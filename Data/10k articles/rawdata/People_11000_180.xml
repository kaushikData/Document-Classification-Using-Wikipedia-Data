He was the NASA Deputy Director for international affairs during the [[Space Race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Tovarich"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duff|first=Brian|date=December 1994 – January 1995|title=Tovarich! |journal=Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Frutkin first started working for NASA when he was hired as deputy director for the U.S. National Committee during the [[International Geophysical Year]], July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958. This title later changed to assistant administrator for international affairs in 1963.&lt;ref name="astronautix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/frutkin.htm|title=Arnold W Frutkin: American Scientist|publisher=www.astronautix.com|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frutkin was employed by NASA as deputy director of the international programs office during the [[space race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. After retiring, Frutkin commented although he had always disliked the space race, he had nonetheless felt disappointed by the success of [[Sputnik 1]].&lt;ref name="Tovarich" /&gt; In 1970, Frutkin and [[Thomas O. Paine|Thomas Paine]] held discussions with the Soviets that would later become the base for the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project|ASTP]].&lt;ref name="history.nasa" /&gt;

Frutkin wrote a letter{{When|date=February 2011}} asking the French space program to reaffirm their pledge not to launch commercial communications satellites under the [[Intelsat]] project's agreement that no other communications satellites besides Intelsat would be launched for commercial purposes.  France had requested that NASA launch a French satellite which they identified as a research instrument. NASA gave the project the go ahead, but later, some French officials started to claim that the satellite would be used for commercial purposes and the launch of the satellite was cancelled.  Lebeau, an employee of the French space program, claimed that Frutkin had refused to launch the French satellite, a comment that resulted in Frutkin barring him from his office. Frutkin took a copy of the letter he wrote with him when he went to meetings in Europe, so as he could produce it when he was queried as to why he supposedly refused the French project.&lt;ref name="jsc" /&gt;

Frutkin believed that the USA had never lost the [[Korean War]] as the aim of the USA had been to prevent North Korea from taking over South Korea, in which they had been successful. This opinion went against what many of his colleagues at the time, including Thomas Paine, believed. Nonetheless, in 1973, Frutkin was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal]] by Thomas Paine, and Frutkin commented that Paine had always been "wonderful" to him.&lt;ref name="jsc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/NASA_HQ/Administrators/FrutkinAW/FrutkinAW_3-8-02.pdf|title=Oral history Transcript - Arnold W. Frutkin|publisher=www.jsc.nasa.gov|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Frutkin was appointed as the associate administrator for external relations for NASA.  He held this post until his retirement in 1979.&lt;ref name="astronautix" /&gt;

== Biography ==

Singer-songwriter, guitarist and percussionist, Aurelio Martinez aka AURELIO (born 1969), is one of Central America’s most gifted performers. Born in Honduras, the artist is known for his powerful and evocative voice. He is a major tradition-bearer of the Garifuna culture and music and he is considered nowadays as the Cultural Ambassador of the Garifuna nation.

The Garinagu, commonly known as the Garifuna are people of Amerindian and West African descents who live along the coasts of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The original home of the Garifuna is St. Vincent (one of the windward islands in the West Indies) from which they were deported in 1796 by the British government and landed on Roatan island, situated in the Bay Islands of Honduras.

Aurelio grew up in a small Caribbean village called Plaplaya, surrounded by a family of talented musicians. His father was a well-known local troubadour who improvised Paranda songs containing Garifuna roots rhythms and Latin sounds. Following the influence of his uncles and grandfather, he became a brilliant drummer in his early childhood. From his vocally gifted mother, he learned to sing and picked up many songs she crafted. Actually, Aurelio began performing at Garifuna ceremonies when just a boy, even at the most sacred events where children were usually not even allowed. At the age of 14, the young man became a respected musician with a firm grounding in Garifuna rhythms, rituals and songs.

While attending secondary school at the provincial capital of La Ceiba, Aurelio dove into diverse and innovative musical projects that took him outside the traditional sphere of performance. By this time, he played professionally with popular Latin ensembles and refined his musical skills.

In the late 80’s, he created his first group called Lita Ariran, who was one of the first Garifuna traditional music and dance group to appear on the international scene and most specifically in Japan. His first album was produced by his friend Akira Tomita with the Japanese company JVC World Sounds (Grupo Garifuna de Honduras, LITA ARIRAN (JVC Records, 1995). Later, Aurelio received the award for the Best singer of Garifuna music and his group Lita Ariran was rewarded for the Best cultural group of the year at the Garifuna World Music Awards, in New York (1998). The less we could say is that Lita Ariran‘s first and unique album remains most certainly a legendary treasure of the Garifuna music nowadays.

In 1997, Aurelio meets his Belizean friend and fellow musician Andy Palacio. The two artists struck up a decades-long friendship thanks in part to their shared hopes for the future of Garifuna music and culture. Through Palacio, Aurelio met Ivan Duran, the tireless producer behind Belize’s Stonetree Records. The same year, the young artist participated in a paranda project, including the King of Paranda Paul Nabor “Nabi”, Junie Aranda, Jursino Cayetano, Andy Palacio, among others. Critics around the world acknowledge PARANDA: AFRICA IN CENTRAL AMERICA (Stonetree Records, 1999) as being one of the best albums to come out of this part of the world. It is in fact a very rich collection of three generations of paranderos with a depth and range that grows with each listen. From the haunting, bluesy exuberance of Paul Nabor's "Naguya Nei" to the fresh sounds of Aurelio’s "Africa", this album takes the listener through the tapestry of feeling and soulful striving that lies at the heart of the Garifuna culture.

In 2004, Aurelio releases his first solo album called GARIFUNA SOUL produced by his friend and long time collaborator Ivan Duran (Stonetree Records, 2004), backed by some of Belize’s and Honduras’ best studio musicians who improvised adeptly on Garifuna percussion, saxophone, electric and bass guitars. Undoubtedly, the artist takes the music into the future without compromising whatsoever the cultural foundations of his inspiration. Aurelio's rich resonant voice and soulful acoustic songs caught the attention of the global music press and saw him as a tradition-bearer with an innate musicality and subtle innovative streak. Indeed, AfroPop Worldwide names him “Newcomer of the year”.

Two years later (2006), Aurelio, a new born gifted musician takes on another role as a politician in the Honduran National Congress, becoming this way the first Garifunacongressman of his region in the country’s history. For this occasion, the politician’s main goal was to represent and support the Garifuna people through concrete manifestations that would protect their integrity as a whole. Precisely, the idea was to lead innovative actions to improve the daily life of this population as well as to feed and preserve their cultural treasures.

In the mean time, the Spanish public television (RTVE) produces: Honduras y Belice: la Aventura Garifuna, an original documentary that features simultaneously, the encounter between old paranda’s singers and the Garifuna’s way of life of yesterday and today’s generations. Aurelio is the star of this journey: a very popular young musician who later becomes known as one of the best paranderos. Thanks to its richness, this documentary is definitely an interesting audiovisual reference to introduce oneself into the surrounding world of the artist.

In 2007, Aurelio was invited to participate in the album WATINA (Stonetree Records, Cumbancha, 2007) featuring Andy Palacio and The Garifuna Collective who received the prestigious WOMEX Award, a respected acknowledgment from the world music industry. Additionally, the album Watina was declared the Greatest World Music Album of All Times by Amazon.com in 2010.

Andy Palacio passed away unexpectedly at the young age of 48, leaving the Garifuna community stunned and bereft. ”Aurelio was still a congressman, but he left the congress session to go to Belize for the funeral,” Duran recalls. “He hadn’t been playing guitar for months because of his intense political commitments. But after Andy’s passing, he gave a few concerts and he knew he needed to start recording right away.”

Together with Ivan Duran, several veteran Garifuna musicians, and the occasional local ensemble dropping into the studio, Aurelio began laying down the tracks for this recording in a cabana on the beach. Laru Beya was not only a way of honoring Andy Palacio as a person; it was a means for continuing his mission of uplifting and expanding what it meant to be a Garifuna artist.

By the year 2008, Aurelio was selected worldwide musician by the Afropop legend Youssou N’Dour, within the Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative. Most definitely, this was a major event allowing Aurelio and the Garifuna music to open up for the first time to African famous musicians. With no doubt, this opportunity of sharing was another main step in the artist’s developing career. Aside of exchanging valuable points of view about the former it gave him new ideas about musical technical features as well as an exciting possibility to share the stage with Youssou N’ Dour in places such as Senegal, New York (Nokia Theater) and Vienna (Vienna Jazz Festival). At the end of this journey, Aurelio’s dream of traveling one day to the African continent finally became true.

Three years later, as part of a result of Youssou N’Dour’s collaboration, Aurelio releases his second album LARU BEYA (Stonetree Records, Real World Records, SUBPOP, 2011), a compilation of soulful songs linking back to the African roots. N’Dour adds his stirring vocals to two of its songs, while elsewhere there is backing from those great veterans of the Afro-Cuban scene, Orchestra Baobab, and from Senegalese rapper Sen Kumpé. Laru Beya wins sixth place in the Top 20 World Music Albums of 2011 in the WorldMusic.co.uk Award. “Aurelio is a highly talented musician, conscious composer and passionate performer with an excellent band behind him, as well as being the prime advocate for a unique culture. If anyone is going to put the Garifuna culture onto the map, it is Aurelio Martinez”, wrote the WorldMusic.co.uk website.

After his debut in the African scene, Aurelio makes a return to his musical roots with his third album LANDINI, (Stonetree Records, Real World Records, 2014). This last composition draws a traditional scenario of the Garifuna community way of life. Most specifically, the album shows a gentle picture of the paranda musical environment in Plaplaya, the artist’s dear hometown. Traditionally, after a long day of fishing, villagers return into their boats to the river landing and gather for a convivial paranda session. This symbolic image leads us to the album’s present name: “landini”, from the English word: “landing”.

According To Aurelio, "I consider this album to be the sound of my Garifuna people. On the previous album [Laru Beya] we experimented and collaborated with other artists to reconnect what was lost between Africa and America. This album is purely Garifuna, and the entire spirit of the music reflects the Garifuna experience. My mother is the sole inspiration for this album. She sees herself reflected in me, to a large degree, the only one of the family who could fulfill her dream of singing professionally. She's the best example I have in my life of what a human being should be, my main consultant and confidante."

Lándini was named to multiple 2014 year-end critics lists, including: #3 on The Sunday Times Ten Best World Music Albums of 2014, #3 on fRoots Critic's Poll New Albums of 2014, #2 World Music Central Best World Music Albums 2014, Songlines 10 Best Albums of the Year 2014, Curious Animal's Best Albums of 2014, #1 Songlines 50 Greatest World Music Albums of the Last Years.

The Garifuna community of New York honored Aurelio in March 2015 with a special musical tribute and concert to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his career.

In January 17, Aurelio launched his new album DARANDI, a collection of Aurelio’s favorite songs from his career recorded to capture the sound of his incendiary live performances accompanied by some of the Garifuna world’s brightest musical talents.

The album has been receiving great reviews by the press: “The Garifuna have a history of escaping slavery … That experience informs the indomitable spirit and characteristic joie de vivre of their music, expressed via the paranda, a unique up-tempo rhythm and melodies that are as listenable as they are danceable to. ***** ” (Morning Star). “This is his best album to date … Recording with his band 'as live' in the studio, he brings new energy and emotion to favorites that range from the charming and slinky 'Laru Beya' to the lament 'Yange,' or a fresh version of 'Dondo,' a paranda classic driven on by tremolo electric guitar lines from Guayo Cedeño. **** ” (The Guardian).  fRoots named Aurelio as “the finest living exponent of the music of the Garifuna people” and London Evening Standard called him “one of the great artists of Latin America."

“We’re not going to let this culture die. I know I must continue my ancestors’ legacy and find new ways to express it. Few people know about it, but I adore it, and it’s something I must share with the world.” Aurelio.

[[File:Carmit Bachar 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Bachar performing at the Jingle Bell Bash 9 at the Tacoma Dome|150px]]
Bachar joined [[the Pussycat Dolls]] in 1995 while they were a [[burlesque]] show. In 2002, she brought her friend [[Gwen Stefani]] to perform at the Pussycat Dolls show. Stefani brought along [[Interscope]]'s [[Ron Fair]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]]. Later, the Dolls got signed at Interscope Records.

Carmit was a member of the Pussycat Dolls longer than any other performer being that she started in 1995 with the Burlesque show and left in 2008 after seven years with the recording group. She was also the first doll to be signed into the recording group in 2001. Most of the then members, including lead singer [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and back-up singer [[Melody Thornton]], were cast by co-founder [[Robin Antin]] in 2002 and 2003, when the group was being transformed into pop recording artists.

In 2006 and 2007, she toured with the Dolls in support of their multi-million selling album ''[[PCD (album)|PCD]]''.

In February 2008, reports surfaced that she was leaving the Pussycat Dolls to pursue solo projects. On March 8, 2008, Bachar officially announced her departure from the Pussycat Dolls on the group's official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcdmusic.com/0FCFEFFFF000011130008000CB051/Content/ContentDetail.aspx|title= Dear Fans|accessdate=2008-03-08|date=2008-03-08|publisher=Pussycat Dolls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Logan''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] played by [[Gregory Itzin]] in the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. During the show's fourth season, Logan is the [[Vice President of the United States]] who is sworn into office as [[President of the United States]] when former President [[Minor characters in 24#24: Season 4|John Keeler]] is critically injured in a [[terrorist attack]]. Subsequently, Logan's administration fell into corruption. The show's fifth season sees him engage in a massive conspiracy to solidify United States oil interests. Logan appears in the fifth and eighth seasons as the primary antagonist.

For the role, Itzin received two [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] in 2006 and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series]] in 2010.

==Characterization==
Charles Logan has a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[History]] from [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox.com/24/profiles/season5/cl.htm |title=FOX Broadcasting Company: 24 |publisher=FOX 24 |accessdate=2008-07-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419032711/http://www.fox.com/24/profiles/season5/cl.htm |archivedate=2008-04-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his vice-presidency, he served as the [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of Western Energy Coal &amp; Reserve; he also served in the California State Legislature, as [[Lieutenant Governor of California]] and as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]].

Logan possesses several characteristics that diminish his capacity to serve as president. In contrast to Palmer, Logan is seemingly incapable of making hard decisions independently, relying on the recommendations of his advisors. If none are available, Logan tries to withdraw himself from the situation entirely. Additionally, his resolve is weak, as he rarely stands behind the decisions he makes. Furthermore, he boasts of his achievements after a crisis is over, even if his claims do not reflect the reality of the situation.

After [[24 (season 5)|Day 5]] revealed that Logan was behind the backfiring conspiracy, show executive producer Evan Katz said that the President was more of a man hiding a secret and was just being a little smarter about how he projects himself. Star [[Kiefer Sutherland]] also noted that people like Logan who are underestimated can become very dangerous because it gives them a sort of cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Gary |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-04-09-24-prez_x.htm |title='24' prez pivots from weasel to evil |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2006-04-09 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the commentary for the show's fifth season DVD, Itzin mentions how he, with the help of [[Jean Smart]], who played his wife Martha, developed an extensive backstory for Logan to help focus his performance. Among other things, he decided that Logan was the son of a distinguished military and political leader. Logan's father physically abused him as a child, which Logan references twice in the finale; first when he tells Jack that he's a lot tougher than he appears to be, then again when he warns Martha that she doesn't know what pain is.

The backstory also included the Logans' son, who died in his twenties several years ago (which might have been the cause of Martha's mental breakdown). Throughout the day, Logan carried a small chain in his pocket which had been a gift from his son, though most shots that show the chain (such as when his pockets are emptied when Jack interrogates him) were cut for time. Itzin also commented that [[David Palmer (24 character)|David Palmer]] was also a friend to Logan's son and visited him extensively.

Logan's reappearance in the sixth season show a man who is deeply sorry about his actions in the previous season. Logan has all but stated he is now a [[Born again Christianity|born again]] [[Christian]] and is searching for redemption. A scene of Logan in private confirms this, showing him grasping a [[Bible]] and quoting a passage for comfort. While he showed no ulterior motives, both President [[Wayne Palmer]] and Logan's ex-wife [[Martha Logan|Martha]] understandably showed doubt as to whether Logan has truly changed.

Itzin has acknowledged a physical resemblance between himself and President [[Richard Nixon]]: "I have the hairline, and my posture’s mediocre."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/arts/television/27itzk.html President Logan Puts a Spin on the Plots of ‘24’]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
{{plot|date=October 2008}}

===24: Season 4===
Logan is first contacted by President [[List of minor characters in 24#24: Season 4|Keeler]] when it is discovered that [[Minor characters in 24#Mitch Anderson|Mitch Anderson]] commandeered a [[stealth fighter]] with the intent to shoot down [[Air Force One]]. Efforts to neutralize the stealth fighter fail, and Air Force One is shot down. As a result, the incapacitated Keeler was deemed unable to serve as president, and Logan was appointed president as a result of the [[25th Amendment]].

After being sworn in, Logan is informed by one of his senior advisors, [[Mike Novick]], that Marwan and his terrorist organization have managed to recover several codes to the nation's nuclear arsenal. While Marwan's people manage to steal a nuclear warhead and successfully launch it on board a missile, [[Counter Terrorist Unit|CTU]] [[Los Angeles]] desperately attempts to track him.

Unfortunately, Logan proves unprepared for both the office and the crisis. When CTU arrests an American civilian named Joe Prado due to his employment under Marwan, Logan is hesitant to face the political risk of detaining Prado without charge. Logan is slow to act, even though CTU and Novick point out that Prado is their only means of finding Marwan in time.

Unwilling to let Logan waste precious time, CTU agent Jack Bauer convinces his superiors to release Prado; afterwards he tortures Prado into revealing one of Marwan's hideouts. Logan, furious that Bauer has acted without his approval, dispatches the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] to arrest him. However, the Secret Service disrupts Bauer's operation to capture Marwan, allowing him to escape.

Logan begins to doubt his ability to govern during the crisis. In response, Novick recruits [[David Palmer (24 character)|David Palmer]] as an advisor, due to the crises he has faced as president. Though Logan initially welcomes Palmer's counsel, he becomes increasingly isolated as Palmer and Novick assume a more active role in leading the search for Marwan.

Eventually, CTU locates Marwan. Although he kills himself to avoid capture, CTU manages to use Marwan's equipment to track the missile and shoot it down before it reaches its target. Despite his lack of leadership during the crisis, Logan quickly accepts credit for his presumed handling of the situation. His only concession to Palmer is a private statement that he had "played a role".

In the midst of the hunt for Marwan, Palmer authorizes a covert CTU operation led by Bauer to extract Lee Jong, an associate of Marwan's, from the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. During the incident, the Chinese Consul is killed by friendly fire. Chinese officials eventually link the operation to Bauer and demand his extradition.

[[Walt Cummings]], Logan's aide, suggests arranging Bauer's murder to prevent his knowledge from being exploited by the Chinese. Though Logan vocally rejects this proposal, Novick later overhears a phone conversation in which Cummings orders a Secret Service agent to kill Bauer before he is turned over to Chinese authorities.

Palmer informs Logan of Cumming's actions, but the president disbelieves the story and refuses to take action. Palmer warns Bauer of the threat on his life, causing Bauer and his CTU colleagues to fake his death. While Bauer goes into hiding, Logan remains unaware of the truth, believing that the situation has been resolved.

===24: Season 5===
Logan prepares to meet [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Yuri Suvarov]] to sign an anti-terrorism defense [[treaty]], seeing the event as the highlight of his presidency. He is startled by the news of David Palmer's assassination, which takes place the morning the treaty is to be signed. [[First Lady]] [[Martha Logan]] insists that Palmer had previously contacted her, warning of a possible terrorist attack. Logan, while seemingly sympathetic, is skeptical given her history of [[mental illness]]. Meanwhile, Eastern European [[separatist]]s take hostages at an airport in opposition to the treaty. Logan orders CTU to organize a rescue, allowing the treaty to be signed as planned.

[[Walt Cummings]] comes to Logan and admits his complicity in Palmer's murder and the airport incident, and further confesses his involvement in an imminent terrorist attack involving the dispersal of [[nerve gas]]. Cummings claims that the attack will justify a stronger U.S. presence in [[Asia]], and promote a greater acquisition of [[oil]] from the region. He also says that the American agent monitoring the attack has gone dark and is now beyond Cummings' reach. Logan is apparently appalled by Cummings' actions.

Meanwhile, Bauer, who has emerged from hiding to investigate Palmer's assassination, discovers that Cummings knows more about the plot than what he let on to Logan. After convincing [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent [[Aaron Pierce (24 character)|Aaron Pierce]] to let him speak with Logan, Bauer confronts Cummings and forces him to confess. Logan promptly orders Cummings arrested. Unfortunately, when government forces move in on the location of the nerve gas, they find it missing and the American agent dead. The terrorists had apparently discovered Cummings' plan.

Shortly after reinstating Bauer at CTU, Logan learns that Cummings has committed suicide. Meanwhile, the terrorists plan to release the nerve gas in a [[Los Angeles]] shopping mall. CTU head [[Lynn McGill]] urges Logan to allow the terrorists to succeed&amp;mdash;potentially killing up to nine-hundred Americans&amp;mdash;in the hopes of catching them and safeguarding the remaining canisters. Despite [[Audrey Raines]]' insistence that such a decision would be immoral, Logan agrees to McGill's plan. However, due to Bauer's last-minute intervention, the attack only kills eleven people.

Immediately thereafter, separatist leader [[Vladimir Bierko]] gives an [[ultimatum]] to Logan, demanding President Suvarov's motorcade route or else face the release of the remaining nerve gas. Ultimately, Logan caves to their demands. Unbeknownst to Logan, Martha joins Suvarov's motorcade in a successful attempt to have the route changed. After CTU thwarts the planned attack, Logan's vice president, [[Hal Gardner]], suggests that he declare [[martial law]] until the end of the crisis. Logan does so, much to the dismay of Martha and Novick.

It is revealed that Logan has collaborated with former CTU agent [[Christopher Henderson]] in orchestrating the day's attacks. When CTU finally defeats the terrorists, Logan turns his full attention to eliminating all evidence of his crimes, ordering Henderson to stop Bauer and [[Wayne Palmer]] from retrieving an audio tape incriminating him in David Palmer's assassination. Logan has Bauer framed for the murder and issues an executive warrant for his arrest. When questioned, Logan claims to have evidence which he will disclose after Bauer is in custody.

Once Jack retrieves the tape, he heads to [[Van Nuys Airport]] to hand it off to [[Secretary of Defense]] [[James Heller]], with the intent to bring down Logan. Once Heller is in possession of the recording, he attempts to cut a deal with Logan, requesting he step down quietly, and in return the recording will never see the light of day. Logan prepares to sign his resignation with Gardner being his witness before Henderson reveals he has retrieved the recording from Heller's men and Jack. Logan then asks Heller to tender his resignation.

Later, Logan is told by one of his co-conspirators, [[Graem Bauer|Graem]], that Martha must be silenced. Logan confesses to Martha his culpability in Palmer's death and implores her to remain quiet for the good of the country. Logan tries one final time to control the situation, when Bauer [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacks]] a [[Boeing 727|727]] plane being co-piloted by the man who has the recording. Graem fakes a [[distress signal]] from the plane, giving Logan the [[pretext]] to shoot it down. When the plane makes an [[emergency landing]], Novick talks Logan out of shooting it down. Jack escapes with the tape.

Logan and Graem agree that the president must commit suicide, reasoning that his trial would do irreparable damage to the country. After apologizing to Martha, Logan prepares to shoot himself. Before he can, Logan receives a call from [[Miles Papazian]], telling him that he will prevent the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] from hearing the tape. Once he learns that Papazian has erased the tape, he cancels Bauer's arrest warrant. Logan meets with Aaron Pierce, whom he had taken prisoner before he could meet with Martha several hours earlier. Pierce refuses any deal with Logan, and Logan orders Adams to kill Pierce, although Pierce subsequently escaped with help from Martha and Mike Novick.

At 5:59:03&amp;nbsp;a.m., Martha stalls the president by sleeping with him, allowing Bauer to sneak aboard [[Marine One]]. Once he is aboard, the president is kidnapped and interrogated by Bauer. Jack is unable to extract a confession from Logan, and is arrested by authorities. However, unbeknownst to Logan, Jack secretly placed a [[microtransmitter]] which later records him confessing his deeds to Martha. Logan is consequently arrested by [[United States Marshal|U.S. Marshal]]s during his eulogy of David Palmer, and is led away while Martha and Novick look on.

[[Karen Hayes]] speculates that Logan may be granted [[clemency]] for his actions in exchange for his immediate resignation in order to protect the country from the embarrassment of a trial. Hal Gardner was then expected to be sworn in as the new president. It was revealed during Day 6 that Logan resigned from office after pleading guilty to [[obstruction of justice|obstructing justice]], and was placed under [[house arrest]]. His role in Palmer's assassination and the events of Day 5 were not publicized.

===24: Season 6===

When Jack Bauer is left a phone number by his father, [[Phillip Bauer|Phillip]], his call is answered by Logan, who has been placed under [[house arrest]] since Day 5. Logan agrees to help Bauer find [[Dmitri Gredenko]], a Russian national who has supplied Islamic terrorists with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-made [[nuclear weapon]]s. Logan reveals that one of Gredenko's supporters, Anatoly Markov, was involved in the conspiracy during Day 5, and that Logan intends to use this knowledge as leverage in order to gain information on Gredenko. He insists that he is looking for [[Salvation#Redemption|redemption]], but Bauer and President Wayne Palmer remain deeply distrustful. Palmer reluctantly grants Logan a temporary release in order to confront Markov.

[[Image:Charlesloganday6.jpg|thumb|right|215px|Logan convinces [[Jack Bauer]] to let him talk to Anatoly Markov alone.]]

Logan enters a Russian [[consulate]] to confront Markov, threatening to implicate him in the Day 5 conspiracy unless he gives up Gredenko. Markov claims not to know anything. Logan leaves the consulate convinced that Markov is lying, prompting Jack to sneak into the consulate alone to extract information from Markov.

When Jack is in their custody, Logan requests he speak to Martha, who is now institutionalized. During the visit, Martha is disgusted by Logan's presence. Just when it is agreed that Martha would make the call, in a sudden fit of rage she stabs him in the shoulder with a kitchen knife, severing an artery. Logan is rushed to the hospital, but begins to flatline en route, with his last words, "Martha" before losing consciousness. He is not heard from for the rest of the season.

===24: Season 8===
Charles Logan makes his first appearance in the season when he offers to help [[Allison Taylor|President Taylor]] with the Russian government, who are attempting to back out of a peace treaty following the assassination of President Omar Hassan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBqf9DzST_c |title=24 8x15/16 Season 8 Episode 15/16 Preview HD |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-05 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians' explanation is they do not believe the new President of the IRK, Hassan's wife Dalia, will be able to hold up the peace agreement; therefore they wish to drop out and have no part in it. Also during this episode it is learned that Logan was granted a presidential pardon from President Daniels.

Later, Jack Bauer learns of Logan's involvement in the government cover-up of Russian involvement in the death of President Hassan when he checks the recent calls of the assassin of [[Renee Walker]]. In the following hours, Logan attempts to prevent information about Russian involvement in Hassan's death being released, in order to protect himself and to prevent it undermining the treaty. As in his final hours as President, Logan is willing to go to any lengths to protect himself, including sanctioning murder, torture and press censorship. Logan persuades Taylor to have CTU mole [[Minor government agents in 24#24: Season 8|Dana Walsh]] quietly tortured for the location of the evidence by men hired by him rather than grant her a pardon, and arrest journalist Meredith Reed to prevent her publishing the evidence given to her by Bauer. He also has Taylor place his aide Jason Pillar in charge of the hunt to find Jack Bauer, allowing Pillar to pass on information to Russian agents who will then kill Bauer. Numerous attempts to kill Bauer prove unsuccessful, however, increasing the pressure on Logan.

In the meantime Logan's private escort is attacked by Bauer, who kidnaps him and takes him underground. Bauer threatens to kill Logan unless he gives up the names of those behind the day's events: Logan names Novakovich, the Russian foreign minister. Unbeknown to Logan, Bauer also places a microtransmitter on him; Bauer listens in as Logan incriminates himself further in a conversation with Russian President [[Yuri Suvarov]]. Bauer leaves him there unconscious, only fifteen minutes before Novakovich is found dead. Logan is in a hospital bed when the episode ends. Bauer later finds Logan again, intending to use him to lure Suvarov into a trap so Bauer can assassinate him, although he then abandons the plan.

When Bauer is eventually captured, Logan makes arrangements for him to be murdered, taking President Taylor's silence as tacit approval. However, at the last moment she refuses to sign the peace treaty and rescinds the order for Bauer's death. Realizing that his plans to kill Jack Bauer and return to political power have failed, Logan murders his right-hand man Jason Pillar and then shoots himself in the head. However, he survives. EMTs responding to the scene believe that he will suffer permanent brain damage.

==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2008}}

Gregory Itzin was commended for his portrayal of a weak President, with some critics commenting that the character was partly inspired by [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7c100080%7c1%7c,00.html |title=Itzin Is '24's' Petrified POTUS |publisher=Tv.zap2it.com |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josefa "Chipita" Rodriguez''' (December 30, 1799 &amp;ndash; November 13, 1863) was [[convicted]] of [[murder]] and [[hanged]] in [[San Patricio County, Texas]], at the age of 63. A century later, on June 13, 1985, the [[Texas Legislature]] passed a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] noting that Rodriguez did not receive a fair [[trial]]. She has been the subject of two [[opera]]s, numerous books, newspaper articles, and magazine accounts.&lt;ref name="tshaonline1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fro50 |title=Handbook of Texas Online - Rodriguez, Josefa #93 |publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and execution==
Rodriguez was reportedly born December 30, 1799, in Mexico. She was a [[Mexican-American]] woman from the South Texas town of [[San Patricio, Texas|San Patricio]] who furnished travelers with meals and a [[Camp bed|cot]] on the porch of her [[lean-to]] on the [[Nueces River]]. She was accused of robbing and murdering a trader named John Savage with an [[axe]]. However, the $600 of gold stolen from him was found down river, where Savage's body was discovered in a [[burlap]] bag. She and Juan Silvera (who was possibly her [[illegitimate]] son) were [[indicted]] on [[circumstantial evidence]] and tried before 14th District Court [[judge]] Benjamin F. Neal at San Patricio. Although Rodriguez maintained her innocence, she refused to [[testify]] in her defense and remained silent throughout the trial, perhaps, some have [[speculated]], to protect her guilty son. Although the [[jury]] recommended [[mercy]], Neal ordered her executed. She was hanged on Friday, November 13, 1863.  She was 63 at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="tshaonline1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caller2.com/newsarch/news10471.html |title=Chipita's execution haunts local memory |work=Corpus Christi Caller-Times |date= |accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last words were quoted as being, "No soy culpable" (I am not guilty).
At least one witness to the hanging claimed to have heard a moan from the [[coffin]], which was placed in an [[unmarked grave]]. Her [[ghost]] is said to haunt San Patricio, especially when a woman is to be executed. Rodriguez is depicted as a [[Ghost|spectre]] with a [[noose]] around her neck, riding through the mesquite trees or wailing from the riverbottoms.&lt;ref name="tshaonline1"/&gt;

==Cultural references==
Chipita Rodriguez has become a folk legend, and since the 1930s, there have been numerous alleged sightings of her ghost along the [[Nueces River]] where she was hanged.

Rodriguez has been the subject of numerous books and newspaper articles. Rachel Bluntzer Hebert’s epic-length poem "Shadows on the [[Nueces]]" and Teresa Palomo Acosta's  poem "Chipita" both portray Rodriguez as a [[heroine]]. In 1993, the [[University of Texas]] music department performed the opera ''Chipita Rodriguez'', composed by [[Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi]] professor Lawrence Weiner. In 2010 a screenplay was written by Del Mar College and Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi student screenwriter Cary Cadena.

'''Daniel Fergus McGrain''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 1 May 1950) is a Scottish former professional [[association football|footballer]], who played for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]] as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]]. McGrain is regarded as one of Scotland's greatest players; sports writer [[Hugh McIlvanney]] commented, "Anybody who saw him at his best had the unmistakable impression of watching a great player, probably one who had no superior anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name="stv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sport.stv.tv/athletics/163883-danny-mcgrain/?report=comment-16901 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207010308/http://sport.stv.tv/athletics/163883-danny-mcgrain/?report=comment-16901 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=7 February 2015 |title=Danny McGrain |publisher=STV Sport |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrain began his career at Celtic and was one of the "[[Quality Street Gang (Celtic F.C.)|Quality Street Gang]]", a group of young players that emerged in the late 1960s. He progressed to the first team and went on to play 659 competitive games for Celtic between 1970 and 1987, winning seven [[List of Scottish football champions|League Championships]], five [[Scottish Cup]]s and two [[Scottish League Cup]]s. He spent his final season of his career with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton]], where he helped win them promotion to the [[Scottish Premier Division|Premier Division]]. McGrain played in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] World Cups for Scotland. His 62 caps earned him a place in the [[Scotland national football team roll of honour]] and he was inducted to the [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]] in 2004.

After retiring from playing, McGrain had a spell as manager of [[Arbroath F.C.|Arbroath]] in the early 1990s, and is now currently part of the coaching staff at Celtic.

At first, McGrain was regarded as a [[midfielder]] but was utilised in a variety of roles in the [[Reserve team|reserve side]] before becoming established as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-(football)|right-back]].&lt;ref name="gd1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Tom|last2=Woods|first2=Pat|title=The Glory &amp; The Dream|year=1987|publisher=Grafton Books|isbn=0-586-20005-3|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bhoy/&gt; He had a spell at [[Scottish Junior Football Association|Junior]] club [[Maryhill F.C.|Maryhill]] to gain experience playing with adults, and also made a fruitless attempt at a college course in engineering prior to becoming a full-time professional.&lt;ref name=bhoy/&gt;

Having been chosen to accompany the main squad to the [[1970 European Cup Final]] along with Dalglish,&lt;ref name=strong/&gt;&lt;ref name=bhoy/&gt; McGrain made his first-team debut for Celtic as a substitute in a [[Scottish League Cup]] tie against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] on 26 August 1970.&lt;ref name="s7071"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/player_games.php?playerid=2692&amp;page=17 |title=Celtic Player Danny McGrain, Games Played 1970-71|publisher=Fitbastats.com |date= |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/game.php?gameid=10468 |title=Dundee United 2 - 2 Celtic, League Cup (26/08/1970) |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on and made his league debut three days later in the opening fixture against [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]] at [[Celtic Park]].&lt;ref name="gd1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="s7071" /&gt; McGrain was used sparingly by manager [[Jock Stein]] in his first couple of seasons in the first team, but the young full-back played well in these games.&lt;ref name="gd1" /&gt;

Having made only 10 league appearances, McGrain suffered the first serious set-back of his career on 25 March 1972. He sustained a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]] during a match at [[Brockville Park|Brockville]] against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] after a clash of heads with forward [[Doug Somner]].&lt;ref name="gd1" /&gt; McGrain, however, made a full recovery and began the following season, 1972–73, as Celtic's first-choice right-back &lt;ref name="gn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollin|first=Jack|title=Soccer - Records, Facts &amp; Champions (2nd edition)|year=1988|publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd|isbn=0-85112-360-0|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; in place of [[Jim Craig (Scottish footballer)|Jim Craig]] who had left the club at the end of the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/player.php?playerid=2676 |title=Celtic Player Jim Craig Details |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGrain now became a first-team regular and made 30 league appearances that season.&lt;ref name="celt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/player.php?playerid=2692 |title=Celtic Player Danny McGrain Details |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also rose through the ranks at international level, making two appearances for the [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland Under 23]] side in the spring of 1973 before finally making his debut at full international level for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in May 1973 against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Racecourse Ground|Wrexham]].&lt;ref name="gn" /&gt; McGrain picked up his first winner's medal at the end of the season when Celtic clinched their eighth successive league championship title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Tom|last2=Woods|first2=Pat|title=The Glory &amp; The Dream|year=1987|publisher=Grafton Books|isbn=0-586-20005-3|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1970s, McGrain was considered by many to be one of the best full-backs in the world.&lt;ref name="gd1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Your Most Exciting Player 1976-77|url=http://celticunderground.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/mcgrain-12.jpg|magazine=[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]|date=May 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played as what is known today as an attacking full-back and contributed significantly in both attacking moves as well as in defence.&lt;ref name="stv" /&gt;  His abilities included a burst of speed, skill and control on the ball, vision and anticipation and, when required, a strong but fair sliding [[Tackle (football move)#Association football|tackle]].&lt;ref name="gd2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Tom|last2=Woods|first2=Pat|title=The Glory &amp; The Dream|year=1987|publisher=Grafton Books|isbn=0-586-20005-3|page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won a further league championship title and a [[Scottish Cup]] in 1974 and played in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for Scotland that same year.&lt;ref name="gn" /&gt;  However, McGrain was diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] immediately after the World Cup, but with the benefit of medication and a controlled diet and lifestyle, continued to play without adverse effect.&lt;ref name="diab"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hugh |last=Keevins |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/celtic-legend-danny-mcgrain-beat-1090383 |title=Celtic legend Danny McGrain: I beat diabetes and so will Scotland kid Scott Allan |newspaper=Daily Record |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a troublesome foot injury that medical staff struggled to identify or treat adequately saw McGrain miss most of the season with Celtic.  He also missed the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] for Scotland.&lt;ref name="gd3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Tom|last2=Woods|first2=Pat|title=The Glory &amp; The Dream|year=1987|publisher=Grafton Books|isbn=0-586-20005-3|pages=425–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Celtic finished the season trophy-less and failed to qualify for [[Uefa#Competitions|European competition]] for the first time since the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Tom|last2=Woods|first2=Pat|title=The Glory &amp; The Dream|year=1987|publisher=Grafton Books|isbn=0-586-20005-3|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunter|first=William|title=Celtic boys out of their class|page=15|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ofw9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P0kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5186%2C171284|accessdate=27 August 2013|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=1 May 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGrain eventually recovered from his mystery foot injury&lt;ref name="gd3" /&gt; and after a tentative re-introduction into the Celtic team, now managed by [[Billy McNeill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Jim|title=McGrain to face Burnley?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QAI-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cUkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1664%2C2322821|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=The Glasgow Herald|date=11 September 1978|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keevings|first=Hugh|title=Danny's great comeback|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zu1AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aacMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3928%2C3742960|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=Evening Times|date=16 November 1978|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davidson|first=Alan|title=Happy Celts: Conn, McGrain on way back|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ix4-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VEoMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5982%2C1021416|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=Evening Times|date=5 March 1979|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; played in the club's last 18 league fixtures of the season in the spring of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/player_games.php?playerid=2692&amp;page=9 |title=Celtic Player Danny McGrain, Games Played |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return from injury, a change in his style of play was apparent. There was a noticeable reduction of pace, which in turn was compensated for by a greater reliance on anticipation of play and distribution of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Tom|last2=Woods|first2=Pat|title=The Glory &amp; The Dream|year=1987|publisher=Grafton Books|isbn=0-586-20005-3|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGrain went on to pick up his fourth league championship medal at the end of that season as Celtic clinched the title with a dramatic 4–2 win over [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in their final game of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/8-ttNXWncnZdJW7Fk10qSA474945/GW922H1314 |title=10-man Celtic win the league |newspaper=The Glasgow Herald |date=22 May 1979 |first=Ian |last=Paul |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrain continued to be a mainstay of the Celtic side during the early to mid 1980s; captaining them to a further three league championships, two Scottish Cups and one Scottish League Cup,&lt;ref name="gn" /&gt; despite also suffering a broken leg in 1981.&lt;ref name=strong/&gt; He made his 600th competitive appearance for Celtic in a 2–0 win over [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] in October 1985.

==International career==
His international career began at [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland Under 23]] level on 13 February 1973 with a game against [[England national under-21 football team|England]] at [[Rugby Park|Kilmarnock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotlandu23/player_games.php?playerid=187 |title=Scotland U23 Player Danny McGrain, Games Played |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGrain played alongside [[Alan Rough]] and [[Asa Hartford]] in a 1–2 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotlandu23/game.php?gameid=31 |title=Scotland U23 1 - 2 England, Friendly (13/02/1973) |publisher=Fitbastats.com  |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won a second cap at Under 23 level a month later away to [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales]], winning 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotlandu23/game.php?gameid=31 |title=Wales 1 - 2 Scotland U23, Friendly (14/03/1973) |publisher=Fitbastats.com  |accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrain made his [[Scotland national football team|full international]] debut for Scotland on 12 May 1973 in a [[British Home Championship]] tie against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Racecourse Ground|Wrexham]], winning 2–0.&lt;ref name="gn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotland/game.php?gameid=363 |title=Wales 0 - 2 Scotland, British Championship (12/05/1973) |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won a further two caps over the following week in Home Championship ties against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[England national football team|England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotland/player_games.php?playerid=842&amp;page=9 |title=Scotland Player Daniel Fergus McGrain, Games Played |publisher=Fitbastats.com |date= |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game against England saw McGrain fielded in an unfamiliar role at left-back to accommodate another highly rated right-back, [[Sandy Jardine]] of Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotland/game.php?gameid=365 |title=England 1 - 0 Scotland, British Championship (19/05/1973) |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGrain would go on to play at left-back for many of his Scotland appearances in the 1970s in order to accommodate the Rangers player, still able to play to the abilities he displayed in his normal role.&lt;ref name="gd2" /&gt;

McGrain played in eight consecutive internationals for Scotland&lt;ref name="gn" /&gt; and was selected by [[Willie Ormond]] for the 22 man squad travelling to [[West Germany]] for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]].&lt;ref name="planetworldcup1974"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jan Alsos |url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1974/squad_sco74.html |title=1974 - Squads - Scotland |publisher=Planet World Cup |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGrain played in all three World Cup group matches ([[DR Congo national football team|Zaire]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]), but despite being undefeated Scotland returned home having failed to qualify for the next phase.&lt;ref name="planetworldcup1974"/&gt;  This early-exit from the tournament proved fortunate for McGrain, who had been suffering from extreme thirst all through the tournament and had lost 2&amp;nbsp;stone (12&amp;nbsp;kg) in weight. On his return to Glasgow, McGrain was diagnosed as being [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetic]]. Had there been any further delay in identification and treatment of his condition, the consequences could have proved fatal.&lt;ref name="diab74"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+Players+are+still+gutted+by+our+KO+in+1974+World+Cup...-a0131005746 |title=Football: Players are still gutted by our KO in 1974 World Cup finals.

McGrain continued to play regularly for Scotland, now being fielded in his more familiar position at right-back, but missed Scotland's ill-fated [[Football World Cup 1978|1978 World Cup]] campaign in Argentina through injury.&lt;ref name="gn" /&gt;

On his recovery from injury in 1979, McGrain regained his place in the Scotland team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ian|title=Stein puts the young ones in driving seat|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PfM9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7UgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3728%2C3662540|work=The Glasgow Herald|accessdate=9 February 2015|date=18 December 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He made 16 consecutive international appearances in the run up to the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] in Spain.  Now [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the side, McGrain was named in [[Jock Stein]]'s 22 man squad travelling to Spain.  He played in Scotland's opening game against [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] but was dropped for the next match against Brazil. McGrain came on as a substitute for [[Gordon Strachan]] in Scotland's third game, against the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="gn" /&gt; This transpired to be his final game for Scotland.&lt;ref name="gn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fitbastats.com/scotland/game.php?gameid=452 |title=Scotland 2 - 2 Soviet Union, World Cup (22/06/1982) |publisher=Fitbastats.com |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==

After retiring from playing, McGrain had a brief spell coaching at [[Clydebank F.C.|Clydebank]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/mcgrain-drafted-in-to-help-out-bankies-1.615528 |title=McGrain drafted in to help out Bankies |work=Herald Scotland |date=19 August 1989|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1992 McGrain was appointed manager of Scottish Second Division side [[Arbroath F.C.|Arbroath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/mcgrain-takes-over-at-arbroath-1.785397 |title=McGrain takes over at Arbroath |work=Herald Scotland |date=11 November 1992 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arb1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/sport/football/former-arbroath-fc-boss-danny-mcgrain-backs-lichties-for-the-title-1.41740 |title=Former Arbroath FC boss Danny McGrain backs Lichties for the title |publisher=The Courier |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That season, McGrain led Arbroath to the quarter-finals of the [[Scottish Cup]], losing 0–3 at home to eventual winners Rangers.&lt;ref name="arb2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arbroathfc.co.uk/history/history_1.htm |title=potted history |publisher=Arbroath FC |accessdate=1 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305023055/http://www.arbroathfc.co.uk/history/history_1.htm |archivedate=5 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following season Arbroath played McGrain's former club Celtic in a Scottish League Cup tie and lost 1–9, a record defeat for the club.&lt;ref name="arb2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian |last=Paul |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/paradise-at-the-seaside-as-celtic-hit-the-goal-trail-1.744911 |title=Paradise at the seaside as Celtic hit the goal trail |work=Herald Scotland |date=26 August 1993 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGrain resigned in January 1994 due to illness.&lt;ref name="arb2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/early-inspections-1.723888 |title=Early inspections |work=Herald Scotland |date=18 January 1994 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 14 months at [[Gayfield Park]], McGrain became popular with their fans and was followed by a group of supporters known as 'Danny McGrain's Bearded Army'. These supporters attended games wearing tribute T-shirts and stick-on beards, affectionately mimicking McGrain's own trademark beard.&lt;ref name="arb1" /&gt;

In August 1997 McGrain joined the backroom staff at Celtic, working under [[Wim Jansen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/paul-goes-to-school-1.385239 |title=Paul goes to school |work=Herald Scotland |date=11 August 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a spell coaching the under-21 side,&lt;ref name="diab74" /&gt; he was made first team coach after being promoted by [[Neil Lennon]] in October 2012 from the [[Celtic F.C. Under-20s and Academy|Development Squad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11787/8175219/Celtic-have-appointed-Danny-McGrain-as-new-first-team-coach |title=Celtic have appointed Danny McGrain as new first-team coach |publisher=Sky Sports |date=18 October 2012 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
McGrain is married to Laraine, and the couple have three daughters.&lt;ref name=strong/&gt; His younger brother [[Tommy McGrain|Tommy]] was also a footballer who trained with Celtic as a teenager, but he did not break through to the first team and subsequently played for [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]].&lt;ref name=drain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partickthistleahistory.wikifoundry.com/page/1978+Tommy+McGrain+Freed|title=McGrain drain... [scan]|work=[[Evening Times]]|via=Partick Thistle History Archive|date=10 June 1978|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonsarchive.com/player.php?id=531|title=Tom McGrain - Player Profile|website=Dumbarton Football Club Historical Archive|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrain supported [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (Celtic's [[Glasgow]] rivals) as a boy. He wrote two autobiographies, one when his career was at its peak and another shortly after he retired. In both, McGrain (a [[Protestant]]) told how he had been spotted by someone doing some scouting for Rangers when he was still a boy but the scout did not recommend him to Rangers, wrongly assuming from his name – Daniel Fergus McGrain – that he was a Catholic and that [[Rangers F.C. signing policy|Rangers would not sign him]] because of this.&lt;ref name="autogenerated428"/&gt; However, McGrain has since stated, "I don't know if that story's true. Over the years that followed nobody from Rangers ever told me they wanted to sign me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hugh |last=Keevins |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/danny-mcgrain-neil-lennon-wins-1842862 |title=Danny McGrain: If Neil Lennon wins 10-in-a-row I hope he gets the knighthood that Jock Stein should have got |work=Daily Record |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strong/&gt;

In the summer of 1974, McGrain was diagnosed as suffering from [[diabetes]]. He had just returned home from playing for Scotland in the World Cup in West Germany, where he had displayed an excessive thirst and lost 2&amp;nbsp;stones (12&amp;nbsp;kg) in weight. Despite his condition, McGrain was able to continue playing top-level football. In March 2002 McGrain was found by [[Strathclyde Police|Police]] in the south side of Glasgow, slumped unconscious in the driver's seat of his car. He had entered a [[Hypoglycemia|hypoglycaemic]] state, where the brain is drained of sugar and causes the body to shut down to conserve what little there is left. The officers revived McGrain and fed him a sugary sweet. Had McGrain not been found in time he would have suffered brain damage and possibly died. However, he made a full recovery and commented "There was no harm done in the end." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DANNY+McGRAIN+IS+FOUND+SLUMPED+AT+WHEEL+OF+HIS+CAR%3B+Scotland+and...-a084124426 |title=Danny McGrain is found slumped at wheel of his car; Scotland and Celtic hero missing for 3 hours after falling unconscious |work=Sunday Mail |date=24 March 2002 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Celtic F.C. supporters|Celtic supporters]] voted for what they considered to be the greatest Celtic XI of all time.  McGrain was voted into the team, which was; [[Ronnie Simpson|Simpson]], McGrain, [[Tommy Gemmell|Gemmell]], [[Bobby Murdoch|Murdoch]], [[Billy McNeill|McNeill]], [[Bertie Auld|Auld]], [[Jimmy Johnstone|Johnstone]], [[Paul McStay|P McStay]], [[Kenny Dalglish|Dalglish]], [[Henrik Larsson|Larsson]] and [[Bobby Lennox|Lennox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/2245965.stm |title=Jinky best-ever Celtic player |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 September 2002 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an inaugural inductee to the [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]] in 2004,&lt;ref name=sfhof&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=1706 |title=Hall of Fame Dinner 2004 |publisher=[[Scottish Football Museum]] |accessdate=21 July 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315052031/http://www.scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=1706 |archivedate=15 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Glasgow rock band Big Wednesday immortalised Danny in music in their single "Sliding in like McGrain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+latest+from+the+Scots+music+scene.-a061062522 |title=The latest from the Scots music scene |work=The Mirror |date=6 August 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danny appeared on television with the group as part of the promotional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BITE+BACK%3B+EURO+JUNGLE.-a061254427 |title=Bite Back; Euro jungle |work=Sunday Mail |accessdate=1 September 2013 |date=10 March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[George W. Bush]]''', (1946-) was the oldest child in a family of six children was born in the city of [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], grew up in the [[Texas|Texan]] cities of [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] and [[Houston]]. He studied at [[Yale University]] and the [[Harvard Business School]] before serving in the Texas [[Air National Guard]]. Bush would later be part owner and managing partner of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] [[baseball]] franchise, become [[governor of Texas]] and eventually become the 43rd [[President of the United States]]. His father died on November 30, 2018 due to a yet unknown cause.

==Upbringing and education==

W. Bush]])]]

[[Image:GeorgeWBush1947.png|200px|thumb|left|George W. Bush as a baby with parents.]]George Walker Bush, the oldest son of [[George H. W. Bush|George Herbert Walker Bush]] and [[Barbara Bush]], was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], on July 6, 1946. Some of his [[paternal]] ancestors had emigrated from [[Somerset]] in the [[West Country]] of [[England]] to [[North America]] in the seventeenth century. They were connected with the [[Salem witch trials]]: [[Mary Parker (Salem witch trials)|Mary Parker]], executed for witchcraft,  was an 8th great-grandmother, and Bush descended from, or was otherwise related to, as many as 217 people involved in the trials.

When Bush was just two years old, his father moved the family from New Haven to the town of [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]] in [[West Texas]] to begin a career in the oil industry. According to George W., then age two, the family lived in one of the few duplexes in Odessa with an indoor bathroom, which they "shared with a couple of hookers".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Bush interview with [[Bob Schieffer]] on ''[[Face the Nation]]'' (aired November 9, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently raised in [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] and [[Houston]], Texas, with siblings [[Jeb Bush|Jeb]], [[Neil Bush|Neil]], [[Marvin Bush|Marvin]], and [[Dorothy Bush Koch|Dorothy]]. A younger sister, Robin, died of [[leukemia]] in 1953 at the age of three, when Bush was 7. His parents came to pick him up from school two days after her death; Bush ran up to their car hoping to see Robin with them, and they told him the news. Bush understood that his sister had died, but his younger brother Jeb did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/bush072699.htm|title=Tragedy Created Bush Mother-Son Bond|date=July 26, 1999|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family spent the summers and most holidays at the [[Bush Compound]] in Maine.

Bush attended Sam Houston Elementary School and San Jacinto Junior High School in [[Midland, Texas]]. He later moved to [[The Kinkaid School]] in [[Piney Point Village, Texas]] for two years.  Afterward, like his father, Bush attended [[Phillips Academy]] (September 1961–June 1964&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bushchildhoodhome.org/bush_history.html History and research]." ''George W.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after his service in the Texas [[Air National Guard]] he entered [[Harvard Business School]] in 1973. He graduated with a [[Masters of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree in 1975, the first U.S. president with an MBA.

===Rugby===
Bush was a keen [[rugby union]] player, during high school and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=CainGrowden&gt;Cain, Nick &amp; Growden, Greg "Chapter 21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby" in ''Rugby Union for Dummies'' (2nd Edition), p297 (pub: John Wiley and Sons, [[Chester]], England) {{ISBN|978-0-470-03537-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruggers&gt;[http://wesclark.com/rrr/famous.html Clarke, Wes ''Famous Ruggers''], retrieved 24th August, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He played at the position of [[Fullback (rugby union)#15.

==Service in the Air National Guard==
{{see also|George W. Bush military service controversy}}
After graduating from Yale University, Bush joined the Texas [[Air National Guard]] on May 27, 1968, during the [[Vietnam War]], with a commitment to serve until May 26, 1974. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on the November 1970 recommendation of Texas Air National Guard commander Lt. Col. [[Jerry B. Killian]]. He served as an [[F-102]] pilot until 1972.  Bush was discharged from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to [[Individual Ready Reserve|inactive duty]] in the [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]]. He was [[Honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974, at the end of his six-year service obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Brit Hume |author2=Mara Liasson |author3=Jeff Birnbaum |author4=Charles Krauthammer |title=The All-Star Panel Discusses John Kerry's Shifting Positions on Iraq War Spending|work=Fox News Network (transcript)|date=July 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol use and DUI arrest==

Bush had described his days before his [[religious conversion]] in his 40s as his nomadic period and irresponsible youth.  Although Bush states that he was not an [[alcoholic]], he has acknowledged that he was "drinking too much".&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;[[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof, Nicholas]], ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E0DE153DF93AA15754C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink How Bush Came to Tame His Inner Scamp]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 1976, Bush was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] of alcohol near his family's summer home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]. He admitted his guilt, was fined [[United States dollar|US$]]150, and had his driving license in the state briefly suspended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/bushdui1.html The Smoking Gun: Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]], Bush said that he gave up drinking after waking up with a [[hangover]] after his 40th birthday celebration: "I quit drinking in 1986 and haven't had a drop since then." He ascribed the change in part to a 1985 meeting with Reverend [[Billy Graham]], after which he began serious [[Bible]] [[Bible study (Christian)|study]], as well as to gentle but persistent pressure from his wife, [[Laura Bush|Laura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/bushtext072599.htm |title= In His Own Words: 'I Made Mistakes' | work=The Washington Post | date=July 30, 1999 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/bush072599.htm |title= Bush's Life-Changing Year | work=The Washington Post | date=July 30, 1999 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/02/bush.dui/ | work=CNN | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | title=Bush acknowledges 1976 DUI charge | date=November 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Hugh Simpson''' [[Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath|CB]] (born 10 December 1922)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U34934 Simpson, Edward Hugh], ''Who's Who 2014'', A &amp; C Black, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is a retired [[United Kingdom|British]] [[civil servant]] and former [[statistician]] best known for describing [[Simpson's paradox]] along with [[Udny Yule]].

Edward Hugh Simpson was introduced to the thinking of [[mathematical statistics]] as a [[cryptanalyst]] at [[Bletchley Park]] (1942–45).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/magazine/868559/Edward-Simpson-Bayes-at-Bletchley-Park.html | title=Edward  Hugh Simpson: Bayes at Bletchley Park | first=Edward | last=Simpson | date=June 2010 | volume=7 | number=2 | doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2010.00424.x | work=[[Significance (magazine)|Significance]] | accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the paper ''The Interpretation of Interaction in Contingency Tables'' while a postgraduate student at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1946 with [[Maurice Bartlett]] as his tutor; and published it in the ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' in 1951 at Bartlett's request because Bartlett wanted to refer to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paradox]] is used in mathematical statistics teaching to illustrate the care statisticians need to take when interpreting data.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} It figured in a 2009 episode of the [[United States|US]] television crime-solving series ''[[Numb3rs]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Simpson entered the [[British civil service|civil service]] administrative class in the UK [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]] in 1947 and subsequently worked also in the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], the [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] Education Liaison Unit, as [[Private Secretary]] to [[Lord Hailsham]] as Lord President of the Council and [[Lord Privy Seal]], and in the Civil Service Department.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He was a [[Commonwealth Fund Fellow|Commonwealth Fund (Harkness) Fellow]] in the USA (1956–57). At one point a useful observation of his on the aggregate behaviour of teachers' pay was labelled "Simpson's Drift".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He retired from the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)#History|Department of Education and Science]] as a Deputy Secretary and [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1982 and now lives in [[Oxfordshire]].

In 2017, Simpson contributed two chapters on the cryptanalytic process [[Banburismus]], developed by [[Alan Turing]] at Bletchley Park during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Edward, Chapter 13, ''Introducing Banburismus'' and Chapter 38, ''Banburismus revisited: depths and Bayes''.

'''Ernest William Sigley''' (born 2 September 1938, in [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]], Australia) is a [[Gold Logie]] winning Australian television host, radio presenter and singer. Sigley is often styled as a "little [[Aussie battler]]" with a [[Larrikinism|larrikin]] sense of humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://televisionau.com/2008/09/ernie-sigley-preparing-to-sign-off.html Ernie Sigley preparing to sign-off | 3AW 17 September 2008. Retrieved 7 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
After completing his education at Williamstown High School, Sigley's career began in 1952 as a turntable operator on Danny Webb's breakfast program at radio station [[3DB (Melbourne)]]. Television started in Australia in 1956, and Sigley made his TV debut as host of ''[[Teenage Mailbag]]'' on [[HSV-7]] in 1957. Shortly after this, he decided to try his luck in London, gaining some work experience at the [[BBC]]. But a bigger break was to come with a three-year stint at [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], where he performed under the name 'Ernie Williams'.&lt;ref name="ES" /&gt;

Sigley is remembered by some for his 1964 association with the [[Adelaide]] leg of [[The Beatles]] tour of Australia. In one press conference, Sigley's questioning of The Beatles about their rock influences, and being able to discuss them (e.g. [[Buddy Holly]]), brought about an enthusiastic response from [[John Lennon]], which contrasted strongly from all the questions asked by other interviewers during the conference.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==3AW radio career==
Sigley was host of the afternoon program on Melbourne's [[3AW]] from 1996 until his retirement on Friday 7 November 2008.&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/11/18/1226770456516.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 The retiring type?

Sigley ended his radio career in January 2009 after a 57-year association with the industry, when it is believed he stormed out of a heated meeting with [[3AW]] management.

==Television career==
In the 1960s and early 1970s, Sigley hosted the prime time Adelaide variety show, [[Adelaide Tonight]] on [[NWS-9]] and he was the original host of the Australian version of the popular game show, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Australian game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', from 1981 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com.au/#q=ernie+sigley+argument&amp;cr=countryAU&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=ctr:countryAU&amp;ei=gd-DUcaFD-GoiAeXwoD4AQ&amp;start=40&amp;sa=N&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;fp=42ed0f4dae2a3762&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=604 Ernie Sigley a wheel once more | The Age 25 June 1981.

After a break from television, Sigley returned in 1989 with [[Denise Drysdale]], hosting [[GTV-9]]'s morning program ''In Melbourne Today''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3aw.com.au/ernie-sigley-career-and-achievements/20081107-5jp5.html?page=single Ernie Sigley: Career and achievements | 3AW 7 November 2008.

From 1974&amp;ndash;1976, Sigley was the host of the national [[Nine Network]] variety show, ''The Ernie Sigley Show'', featuring notable Australian media personalities such as [[Denise Drysdale]], [[Noni Hazlehurst]], [[Pete Smith (announcer)|Pete Smith]] and [[Joy Westmore]]. The program was abruptly axed after an off-air outburst by Sigley, directed at station owner [[Kerry Packer]] and producer [[Peter Faiman]], when the network cut short his first show for 1976, to accommodate a network sports awards telecast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://televisionau.com/2008/09/ernie-sigley-preparing-to-sign-off.html Ernie Sigley preparing to sign-off | Television.au 17 September 2008.

He dismissed Sigley in person, effective immediately, and replaced him with Lane.&lt;ref name="ES" /&gt;

After his dismissal in 1976, Sigley moved to [[ATV-10|ATV-0]] and hosted the early evening variety show ''Ernie'' and then in 1979, ''[[The Penthouse Club|Saturday Night Live]]'' on [[HSV-7]] co-hosting with [[Mary Hardy (comedian)|Mary Hardy]].

Sigley was involved in an infamous stoush with fellow TV star Don Lane at a [[Logies]] Ceremony in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="ES" /&gt; Lane claims that Sigley allegedly made insulting remarks about Lane's partner, Lane then allegedly punched at Sigley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1116231/The-legacy-of-Lanky-Yank-Don-Lane The legacy of 'Lanky Yank' Don Lane (19th paragraph) | SBS World News 22 October 2009. Retrieved 4 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singing career==
Sigley began singing in the 1950s, and was a regular on the local Town Hall circuit. In 1957, his first record, ''Love Is A Golden Ring'', was released by W &amp; G Records. This record was described by Sigley as being the last 78rpm release in Australia.

In 1974, Sigley, with Denise Drysdale, recorded the popular duet, ''Hey Paula'', released by [[Festival Records]], Australia and produced at [[Armstrong Studios]], Melbourne. This song went on to be a No. 1 best-selling hit for them in Australia.&lt;ref name="ES" /&gt;

Sigley regularly performed around Australia on the club circuit, often with his television partner, Denise Drysdale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/full-circle/story-fn6bmg0w-1226144470692 Full circle | The Daily Telegraph 24 September 2011.

[[Image:Galton Watson survival Poisson.png|320px|thumb|Galton&amp;ndash;Watson survival probabilities for different exponential rates of population growth, if the number of children of each parent node can be assumed to follow a [[Poisson distribution]].  For ''&amp;lambda;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;1, eventual extinction will occur with probability&amp;nbsp;1.  But the probability of survival of a new type may be quite low even if ''&amp;lambda;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 and the population as a whole is experiencing quite strong [[exponential growth|exponential increase]].]]

The '''Galton–Watson process''' is a [[branching process|branching]] [[stochastic process]] arising from [[Francis Galton]]'s statistical investigation of the extinction of [[family name]]s. The process models family names as [[patrilineal]] (passed from father to son), while offspring are randomly either male or female, and names become extinct if the family name line dies out (holders of the family name die without male descendants).  This is an accurate description of [[Y chromosome]] transmission in genetics, and the model is thus useful for understanding [[human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]s, and is also of use in understanding other processes (as described below); but its application to actual extinction of family names is fraught. In practice, family names change for many other reasons, and dying out of name line is only one factor, as discussed in [[#Examples|examples]], below; the Galton–Watson process is thus of limited applicability in understanding actual family name distributions.

There was concern amongst the [[Victorian era|Victorian]]s that [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] surnames were becoming extinct.  Galton originally posed the question regarding the probability of such an event in an 1873 issue of ''[[The Educational Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Galton]], Problem 4001, ''[[Educational Times]]'' [http://ioearc.da.ulcc.ac.uk/9344/1/Educational%20Times%20Vol%2025%20Iss%20143.PDF '''25'''(143)] p.300 (March 1, 1873)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Reverend [[Henry William Watson]] replied with a solution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry William Watson|H.W. Watson]], Problem 4001, ''[[Educational Times]]'' [http://ioearc.da.ulcc.ac.uk/9309/1/Educational%20Times%20Vol%2026%20Iss%20148.PDF '''26'''(148)] p.115 (August 1, 1873)&lt;br&gt;
(A first offering submitted by G.S. Carr, ''[[Educational Times]]'' [http://ioearc.da.ulcc.ac.uk/9305/1/Educational%20Times%20Vol%2026%20Iss%20144.PDF '''26'''(144)] p.17 (April 1, 1873), according to Galton was "totally erroneous")&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, they then wrote an 1874 paper entitled "On the probability of the extinction of families" in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland (now the [[Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute]]).&lt;ref&gt;Galton, F., &amp; Watson, H. W. (1875). On the probability of the extinction of families. ''[[Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute]]'', '''4''', [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027596207;view=1up;seq=166 138–144].&lt;/ref&gt;  Galton and Watson appear to have derived their process independently of the earlier work by [[Irénée-Jules Bienaymé|I. J. Bienaymé]]; see Heyde and Seneta 1977.  For a detailed history see Kendall (1966 and 1975).

== Concepts ==

Assume, for the sake of the model, that surnames are passed on to all male children by their father.  Suppose the number of a man's sons to be a [[random variable]] [[probability distribution|distributed]] on the set&amp;nbsp;{&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;}.  Further suppose the numbers of different men's sons to be [[statistical independence|independent]] random variables, all having the same distribution.

Then the simplest substantial mathematical conclusion is that if the average number of a man's sons is 1 or less, then their surname will [[almost surely]] die out, and if it is more than&amp;nbsp;1, then there is more than zero probability that it will survive for any given number of generations.

Modern applications include the survival probabilities for a new [[mutant]] gene, or the initiation of a [[nuclear chain reaction]], or the dynamics of [[epidemic|disease outbreak]]s in their first generations of spread, or the chances of [[extinction]] of small [[population]] of [[organism]]s; as well as explaining (perhaps closest to Galton's original interest) why only a handful of males in the deep past of humanity now have ''any'' surviving male-line descendants, reflected in a rather small number of distinctive [[human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups]].

A corollary of high extinction probabilities is that if a lineage ''has'' survived, it is likely to have experienced, purely by chance, an unusually high growth rate in its early generations at least when compared to the rest of the population.

== Mathematical definition ==

A Galton–Watson process is a stochastic process {''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} which evolves according to the recurrence formula ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and

:&lt;math&gt;X_{n+1} = \sum_{j=1}^{X_n} \xi_j^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\{\xi_j^{(n)} : n,j \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|independent and identically-distributed]] natural number-valued random variables.

In the analogy with family names, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as the number of descendants (along the male line) in the ''n''th generation, and &lt;math&gt;\xi_j^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as the number of (male) children of the ''j''th of these descendants. The recurrence relation states that the number of descendants in the ''n''+1st generation is the sum, over all ''n''th generation descendants, of the number of children of that descendant.

The extinction probability (i.e. the probability of final extinction) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \Pr(X_n = 0).\, &lt;/math&gt;

This is clearly equal to zero if each member of the population has exactly one descendant.  Excluding this  case (usually called the trivial case) there exists
a simple necessary and sufficient condition, which is given in the next section.

==Extinction criterion for Galton–Watson process==
In the non-trivial case the probability of final extinction is equal to one if ''E''{''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 and strictly less than one if ''E''{''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

The process can be treated analytically using the method of [[probability generating function]]s.

If the number of children ''ξ &lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' at each node follows a [[Poisson distribution]] with parameter λ, a particularly simple recurrence can be found for the total extinction probability&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a process starting with a single individual at time ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = e^{\lambda (x_n - 1)},\, &lt;/math&gt;

giving the above curves.

== Bisexual Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process ==

In the classical Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process described above, only men are considered, effectively modeling reproduction as asexual.  A model more closely following actual sexual reproduction is the so-called "bisexual Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process", where only couples reproduce.  (''Bisexual'' in this context refers to the number of sexes involved, not [[sexual orientation]].)  In this process, each child is supposed as male or female, independently of each other, with a specified probability, and a so-called "mating function" determines how many couples will form in a given generation.  As before, reproduction of different couples are considered to be independent of each other.  Now the analogue of the trivial case corresponds to the case of each male and female reproducing in exactly one couple, having one male and one female descendant, and that the mating function takes the value of the minimum of the number of males and females (which are then the same from the next generation onwards).

Since the total reproduction within a generation depends now strongly on the mating function, there exists in general no simple necessary and sufficient condition for final extinction as it is the case in the classical Galton&amp;ndash;Watson process.  However, excluding the non-trivial case, the concept of the [[averaged reproduction mean]] (Bruss (1984)) allows for a general sufficient condition for final extinction, treated in the next section.

===Extinction criterion===

If in the non-trivial case the [[averaged reproduction mean]] per couple stays bounded over all generations and will not exceed 1 for a sufficiently large population size, then the probability of final extinction is always&amp;nbsp;1.

==Examples==
Citing historical examples of Galton–Watson process is complicated due to the history of family names often deviating significantly from the theoretical model. Notably, new names can be created, existing names can be changed over a person's lifetime, and people historically have often assumed names of unrelated persons, particularly nobility. Thus, a small number of family names at present is not [[ipso facto|in itself]] evidence for names having become extinct over time, or that they did so due to dying out of family name lines – that requires that there were more names in the past ''and'' that they die out due to the line dying out, rather than the name changing for other reasons, such as vassals assuming the name of their lord.

[[Chinese surname#Surnames at present|Chinese names]] are a well-studied example of surname extinction: there are currently only about 3,100 surnames in use in China, compared with close to 12,000 recorded in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= O rare John Smith |journal= [[The Economist]] |edition= US |page=32 |date= June 3, 1995 |quote= Only 3,100 surnames are now in use in China [...] compared with nearly 12,000 in the past. An 'evolutionary dwindling' of surnames is common to all societies. [...] [B]ut in China, [Du] says, where surnames have been in use far longer than in most other places, the paucity has become acute. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="du"&gt;{{citation |title=Chinese Surnames and the Genetic Differences between North and South China |last1=Du |first1=Ruofu |first2=Yuan |last2=Yida |first3=Juliana |last3=Hwang |first4=Joanna L. |last4=Mountain |first5=L.

Names have changed or become extinct for various reasons such as people taking the names of their rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor's name, among others.&lt;ref name="du" /&gt; While family name lines dying out may be a factor in the surname extinction, it is by no means the only or even a significant factor. Indeed, the most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as [[Han Chinese|Han]] and adopting Han names.&lt;ref name="du" /&gt; Further, while new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing.&lt;ref name="du" /&gt;

By contrast, some nations have adopted family names only recently. This means both that they have not experienced surname extinction for an extended period, and that the names were adopted when the nation had a relatively large population, rather than the smaller populations of ancient times.&lt;ref name="du" /&gt; Further, these names have often been chosen creatively and are very diverse. Examples include:
* [[Japanese names]], which in general use date only to the [[Meiji restoration]] in the late 19th century (when the population was over 30,000,000), have over 100,000 family names, surnames are very varied, and the government restricts married couples to using the same surname.
* Many [[Dutch name]]s have included a family name only since the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the early 19th century, and there are over 68,000 Dutch family names.
* [[Thai name]]s have included a family name only since 1920, and only a single family can use a given family name; hence there are a great number of Thai names. Furthermore, Thai people change their family names with some frequency, complicating the analysis.

On the other hand, some examples of high concentration of family names is not primarily due to the Galton–Watson process:
* [[Vietnamese name]]s have about 100 family names, and 60% of the population sharing three family names. The name [[Nguyễn]] alone is estimated to be used by almost 40% of the Vietnamese population, and 90% share 15 names. However, as the history of the [[Nguyễn]] name makes clear, this is in no small part due to names being forced on people or adopted for reasons unrelated to genetic relation.

On 17 April 2014, it was announced that Alagiah was being treated for [[colorectal cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27068861|title=George Alagiah diagnosed with bowel cancer|date=17 April 2014|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement from the BBC said: "He is grateful for all the good wishes he has received thus far and is optimistic for a positive outcome." On 28 June, Alagiah announced on [[Twitter]] that he was making "encouraging progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BBCAlagiah/status/482877610389565440|title=Latest from medics - I'm making encouraging progress|publisher=George Alagiah|date=28 June 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in late October 2015, he announced on Twitter that the treatment was officially over and he subsequently returned to the BBC on 10 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/29/bbc-newsreader-george-alagiah-announces-cancer-treatment-is-over|title=BBC newsreader George Alagiah announces cancer treatment is over|last=Quinn|first=Ben|date=29 October 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34764659|title=BBC newsreader George Alagiah 'clear of cancer' and back to work|work=BBC News|date=&lt;!-- Monday --&gt;9 November 2015|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2018 it emerged that the cancer had returned and he would undergo further treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sporn|first=Natasha|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/bbc-newsreader-george-alagiah-to-undergo-more-treatment-as-cancer-returns-a3739986.html|title=BBC newsreader George Alagiah to undergo more treatment as cancer returns|work=London Evening Standard|date=15 January 2018|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/15/bbc-newsreader-george-alagiah-reveals-his-cancer-has-returned|title=BBC newsreader George Alagiah reveals his cancer has returned|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=15 January 2018|work=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2018, in an interview with ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', Alagiah noted that his cancer was terminal and could have been caught earlier if the screening programme in England, which is automatically offered from the age of 60, was the same as that in Scotland, where it is automatically offered from the age of 50.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/25/scottish-health-system-quicker-to-spot-cancer-says-george-alagiah|title=Scottish health system quicker to spot cancer, says George Alagiah|date=25 March 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=13 May 2018|agency=[[Press Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghede Nibo''' is a [[loa]] who is leader of the spirits of the dead in [[Haitian Vodou]]. Formerly human, Ghede Nibo was a handsome young man who was killed violently. After death, he was adopted as a loa by [[Baron Samedi]] and [[Maman Brigitte]]. He is envisioned as an effeminate, nasal [[dandy]].  Nibo wears a black riding coat or [[cross-dressing|drag]].  When he inhabits humans they are inspired to lascivious [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] of all kinds.&lt;ref name="Cassell"&gt;Randy Conner, David Hatfield Sparks &amp; Mariya Sparks (eds), Cassell's ''Encyclopedia of Queer Myth, Symbol &amp; Spirit'', London and New York: Cassell, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function and depiction==
Brav Ghede Nibo is a [[rada loa|rada]] spirit,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carole Boyce Davies]] (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mb6SDKfWftYC&amp;pg=PA963&amp;lpg=PA963&amp;dq=is+Ghede+Nibo+rada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gY8qUULrmZ&amp;sig=q29Ir8R5HTu9FbMbTX9c6QeZ9Is&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UtxzT9SzG6euiQeOgYnkDw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=is%20Ghede%20Nibo%20rada&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora''], ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 963.&lt;/ref&gt; considered a great healer. He is seen carrying a bottle of [[white rum]] infused with [[medicinal herb]]s. Often he also carries a staff and smokes a [[cigar]].  Nibo is the special patron of those who die young, and as such is often conflated with the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] saint [[Gerard Majella]], who is depicted with a skull. He is a [[psychopomp]], an intermediary between the living and the dead. He gives voice to the dead spirits that have not been reclaimed from "below the waters". He is the guardian of the graves of those who died prematurely, particularly those whose final resting place is unknown. His ''chevals'' ("horses", possessed devotees) can give voice to the dead spirits whose bodies have not been found or that have not been reclaimed from "below the waters".

==Service==
Purple is considered his sacred color, and usual offerings include black goats, black [[rooster]]s, [[calabash]], cigars, coconut, fried plantains, pistachios, smoked herrings, sweet sesame balls, and white rum spiced with African [[bird pepper]].&lt;ref name="Cassell"/&gt;

Until recently, Haitian farmers would perform a praise song to Ghede Nibo each November.  It involved phallic thrusts and other erotic gestures and was named "Massissi", a Haitian term for a [[Men who have sex with men|"homoerotically inclined male"]].&lt;ref name="Cassell"/&gt;

==References in Western popular culture==
The [[List of Disney villains|Disney villain]] character [[Dr. Facilier]] in the animated fim ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' is loosely modelled on Ghede Nibo.

* The 1991 [[Jun Urbano]] political comedy [[Juan Tamad at Mister Shooli sa Mongolian Barbecue]] also prominently featured the motiff of "guns, goons, and gold," portraying the belief that mainstream politicians at the time the film was released could not get reelected without violence or vote-buying.

'''Günter Hermann Ewen''' (1962 &amp;ndash; May 18, 1999) was a German mass murderer who killed four people and wounded at least nine others in [[Dillingen, Saarland|Dillingen]], [[Germany]] on May 16, 1999, before escaping to [[Sierck-les-Bains]], [[France]], where he killed another person, and wounded two more. Hunted by German and French police, he eventually committed suicide in a hotel in [[Strassen, Luxembourg]] on May 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/345529.stm Manhunt for border killer], ''[[BBC]]'' (May 17, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/347118.stm Cross-border murder suspect found dead], ''[[BBC]]'' (May 18, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/briton-among-the-dead-as-disco-gunman-kills-five-1094204.html Briton among the dead as disco gunman kills five], ''[[The Independent]]'' (May 17, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101282113-la-chasse-a-l-assassin-fait-trembler-la-moselle-tueur-de-cinq-personnes-ce-week-end-il-court-toujours La chasse à l'assassin fait trembler la Moselle], ''[[Libération]]'' (May 18, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ewen was born in Dillingen in 1962, being the youngest and only boy among five siblings, and suffered from [[asthma]] from childhood. He showed little interest at school, had to repeat two grades and left [[Hauptschule]] after grade seven,&lt;ref name=SZ1805Ganove&gt;Der verdächtige Ewen wurde vom kleinen Ganoven zum Schwerverbrecher, ''[[Saarbrücker Zeitung]]'' (May 18, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon he started an apprenticeship as a paver, which he quit after two years due to his ailment. Up to the age of 30 he lived with his parents and mostly worked odd jobs to earn money.

According to conflicting reports Ewen began to consume alcohol excessively either at the age of twelve&lt;ref&gt;Vom Voyeur zum Serien-Mörder, ''[[Saarbrücker Zeitung]]'' (May 22, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; or eighteen, animated by one of his sisters' boyfriends, whom he admired for his rather wasteful lifestyle. As a youth he was arrested for theft, fraud,&lt;ref name=SZ1805Ganove/&gt; and battery, and starting in 1982 he was caught numerous times while driving under the influence of alcohol, which resulted in a three-month prison term when he was 26. Since 1990 he was arrested for acts of voyeurism and exhibitionism, and in February 1991 he was fined after masturbating in front of women at a tennis club. Six months later Ewen, in drunk condition, twice broke into a home for mentally disabled women and sexually molested them in their beds. One hour after the second such incident he raped a woman in her home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/verbrechen-tag-der-abrechnung_aid_176962.html Tag der Abrechnung], ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'' (21/1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1993 Ewen was convicted for rape and sexual assault in three cases, and sentenced to a prison term of five years and six months. A psychologist found him to be a [[narcissist]], who, in his infantile egocentrism, ruthlessly tried to satisfy his own needs, especially when under the influence of alcohol. In prison he was in therapy concerning his sex offences and was eventually released in October 1996, after serving two third of his sentence.

Out of prison Ewen started his own business, but in August 1998 he was accused by his friend Robert Fisne of six counts of burglary, whereupon he was again arrested. He remained in [[Remand (detention)|remand]] until January 1999, when he was acquitted, since no incriminating evidence could be found and the testimony of Fisne, the only witness in the case, was vague and contradictory. Even though he left prison cleared of these accusations, the arrest turned out to be devastating to Ewen's personal life, as during this time his business went bankrupt, he lost his home, his girlfriend left him and he had accumulated [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]&amp;nbsp;60,000 in debt, while the DM&amp;nbsp;3,000 granted as compensation for his wrongful imprisonment were barely enough to pay his attorney.

Ewen eventually found shelter at the home of his sister and brother-in-law in [[Beckingen]] where he lived up to the day of the shooting and helped renovating the building.&lt;ref name=SZ1805Jagd&gt;Fieberhafte Jagd nach dem Dillinger Mörder, ''[[Saarbrücker Zeitung]]'' (May 18, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Der beschte Bua', ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' (May 27, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Medellin Cartel}}
'''Hacienda Nápoles''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Naples Estate") was the luxurious estate built and owned by [[Colombia]]n drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]] in [[Puerto Triunfo]], [[Antioquia Department]], Colombia, approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Medellin|Medellín]] and {{convert|249|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Bogotá]]. The estate covers about {{convert|20|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Following Escobar's death in 1993, many of the original buildings on the property were demolished or reconditioned for other uses.

==History==
[[Image:Pórtico Hacienda Nápoles.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Main entrance]]
[[Image:Hacienda Napoles.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Hacienda Nápoles private [[bullring]]]]
The estate included a Spanish colonial house, a sculpture park, and a complete [[zoo]] that included many kinds of animals from different continents such as [[antelope]], [[elephant]]s, exotic birds, [[giraffe]]s, [[Hippopotamus|hippopotamuses]], [[ostrich]]es, and [[pony|ponies]]. The ranch also boasted a large collection of old and luxury cars and bikes, a private airport, a [[bullring]], and even a [[Go-kart|kart]]-racing track. [[Gate guardian|Mounted atop]] the hacienda's entrance gate is a replica of the [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]] [[Piper_PA-18_Super_Cub|PA-18 Super Cub]] airplane ([[Aircraft registration|tail number]] HK-617-P) which transported Escobar's first shipment of cocaine to the United States.&lt;ref name="mashable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/01/24/pablo-escobar-hacienda/|date=August 29, 1989|title=Hacienda Nápoles: What do you buy the drug lord who has everything? A zoo|author=Arbuckle, Alex Q. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Escobar was shot and killed by Colombian police in 1993, his family entered a legal struggle with the [[Government of Colombia|Colombian government]] over the property. The government prevailed, and the neglected property is now managed by the Municipality of [[Puerto Triunfo]]. The cost of maintenance for the zoo and the animals was too expensive for the government, so it was decided that most of the animals would be donated to Colombian and international zoos.

Other original features include [[dinosaur]] statues&lt;ref name="mashable"/&gt; built with bones{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} in a section of the estate, along with prehistoric animal statues (such as the [[Woolly mammoth|mammoth]]) that children can climb and play on,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} as well as decommissioned military vehicles and a giant hand sculpture.&lt;ref name="mashable"/&gt;

==Recent years==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=September 2009}}
In September 2006, there was a rumor about building an anti-crime museum about Pablo Escobar, a jail, and a [[theme park]]. The jail is currently under construction, and the dinosaur park has been restored.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
 
By November 2006, ownership of the property had passed to the Colombian government and was valued at 5 billion [[Colombian peso]]s (approximately [[USD|$]]2.23 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.gov.co/sne/2004/agosto/12/22122004.htm |title=LA HACIENDA NAPOLES AHORA ES PROPIEDAD DEL ESTADO COLOMBIANO |language=Spanish |date=September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040820064259/http://www.presidencia.gov.co/sne/2004/agosto/12/22122004.htm |website=Presidencia.gov.co|archivedate=August 20, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hacienda's zoo still{{when|date=January 2016}} hosts [[bison]], a rare [[goat]], one ostrich, and [[zebra]]s. Escobar's hippopotamuses have escaped and become [[feral]], living in at least four lakes in the area and spreading into neighbouring rivers. Contact between the hippos and local fishermen have led to calls for the hippo population to be culled. By 2011, there were at least 30 animals roaming wild in the countryside; the large number of hippos makes it difficult to find zoos into which they can be resettled.&lt;ref name="Kremer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27905743|title=Pablo Escobar’s hippos: A growing problem|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=June 26, 2014|author=Kremer, William |work=BBC News Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also reportedly 40 hippopotamuses living on the grounds of the hacienda itself;&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/pablo-escobars-old-house-is-now-a-jurassic-park-themed-zoo|title=Drug Traffickers Build the Best Theme Parks|date=April 7, 2014|author=Kevin EG Perry}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of June 2014, the park's mascot, a live female hippo named Vanessa (who responds to her name), remains at the site.&lt;ref name="Kremer"/&gt;

In 2014, a "Jurassic Park"-style African theme park was operating on the grounds, which have been rented by a private company. "Parque Temático Hacienda Nápoles" comes complete with a water park, a guided safari attraction, aquariums, and a replica of the caves in Colombia's [[Cueva de los Guácharos|Cueva de los Guácharos National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversion acuatica|url=http://www.haciendanapoles.com/parque-acuatico-acuasaurios|website=Parque Tematico Hacienda Napoles|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, a day ticket to the park cost 32,000 pesos (around $15).&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt; The Escobar museum, his burned private car collection, and the abandoned "ruins" of his house are still publicly accessible, but are reported to have collapsed in February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elcolombiano.com/antioquia/la-mansion-de-pablo-escobar-en-la-hacienda-napoles-se-desplomo-CX1220664&lt;/ref&gt;

Escobar kept four hippos in a private menagerie at Hacienda Nápoles. They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar's death, and hence left on the untended estate. By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby [[Magdalena River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-hippos20dec20,0,5373140.story |title=A hippo critical situation |accessdate=27 March 2008 |first=Chris |last=Kraul |date=20 December 2006 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WsgZRAjS?url=http://www.latimes.com/la-fg-hippos20dec20-story.html |archivedate=8 March 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Geographic Channel]] produced a documentary about them titled ''Cocaine Hippos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://natgeotv.com/asia/cocaine-hippos/about|title= The Invaders: Cocaine Hippos|publisher= [[National Geographic Channel]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130626213741/http://natgeotv.com/asia/cocaine-hippos/about|archivedate= 26 June 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report published in a Yale student magazine noted that local environmentalists are campaigning to protect the animals, although there is no clear plan for what will happen to them.&lt;ref name="Zoo Gone Wild"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nagvekar|first1=Rahul|title=Zoo Gone Wild: After Escobar, Colombia Faces His Hippos|url=http://thepolitic.org/zoo-gone-wild-after-escobar-colombia-faces-his-hippos/|website=The Politic|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, National Geographic published another article on the hippos which found disagreement among environmentalists on whether they were having a positive or negative impact, but that conservationists and locals - particularly those in the tourism industry - were mostly in support of their continued presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilcox|first=Christie|title=Could Pablo Escobar's Escaped Hippos Help the Environment?|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/09/colombia-cocaine-hippos-rewilding-experiment-news/|website=National Geographic|date=26 September 2018|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4019">'''Haji Gokool Meah''' (1847–1939) was a [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian]] industrialist and philanthropist. He was born into a [[Kashmiri Muslims|Kashmiri Muslim]] family in [[Kashmir]] which then was part of the [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir]] at that time. He was originally named '''Modhoo'''. His father died shortly before his birth and his mother remarried.

As a small child, his family left [[Kashmir]] and ended up in [[Calcutta]] where in 1852 they signed up as [[indentured servant|indentured labourers]] bound for the [[sugarcane]] fields of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. On January 25, 1853 they arrived in Trinidad aboard the ''Benares''. They were indentured at the Concord Estate in [[Pointe-à-Pierre]]. After three months, his mother died of [[malaria]] and his stepfather took little interest in him. He was informally adopted by a [[Hindu]] couple who gave him the name Gokool.

Once he was old enough, Gokool secured his own indentureship contract with the Concord Estate. He renewed his contract once it expired, and then went out on his own. He purchased a [[donkey]] cart and made a living hauling sugarcane to the factory at [[Usine Sainte Madeline]], then the second largest [[sugar refinery]] in the world. After a few years of this trade, he sold his cart and established a shop in [[Danglade Village]] on the road to [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]] (now part of the [[Petrotrin]] [[oil refinery]] at Pointe-à-Pierre). Gokool was a true entrepreneur who started off in the cane-cart business and then was a shopkeeper. By 1892, Gokool was able to purchase Diamond, Greenhill and River Estates, comprising almost the whole Diego Martin valley, which he developed as cocoa plantations.

He married Rojan and had 17 children, 11 of whom survived. From shopkeeping he moved on to [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] cultivation, establishing one of the early cocoa [[plantation]]s in the [[Diego Martin]] valley. From cocoa he moved on the [[real estate]], by 1918, Gokool took advantage of recession prices in the wake of World War I and brought several properties in Port-of-Spain. This turned out to be a masterstroke in the long-run, becoming one of the major landlords in [[Port of Spain]]. In 1933, he also established himself as a [[film|cinema]] magnate, establishing the Metro cinema in collaboration with [[MGM]]. Gokool opened the cinema at the corner of St Vincent and Park Streets, called Green Corner, and called it the Metro Cinema. The ornate faux classical-style building, with its plush red-carpeted walls, could seat over 1,000 people in balcony and pit, and cost over $80,000 to construct. By comparison, in those days you could buy the whole of Aranguez for $22,000. The cinema was as big a hit as its films. He later split with [[MGM]] and renamed his cinema the Globe Cinema, eventually operating a string of five cinemas in Port of Spain and San Fernando. He also opened other Globe cinemas in Princes Town and Chaguanas. Gokool died in 1940, aged 92, leaving behind the cinemas he founded.

In 1922 he performed the [[Haj]] (Muslim pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]) with his son Noor. In 1927, he built a masjid in St James which stands to this day. In his will, he established the Haji Gokool Meah Trust, a trust to continue the charitable works which had earned him the title ''Meah'' (benefactor).

'''James McGregor Stewart''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN||CBE|QC}} (June 30, 1889 – February 11, 1955) was a corporate lawyer in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Using crutches as a result of polio at age two, Stewart served as head of a Halifax law firm that became the largest law firm in Atlantic Canada and today bears his name, Stewart McKelvey. He also served as the President of the [[Canadian Bar Association]] in 1941-42.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/cba/info/main/PrintHtml.aspx?DocId=13167 Canadian Bar Association:  Past CBA Presidents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210183240/http://www.cba.org/CBA/Info/main/PrintHtml.aspx?DocId=13167 |date=2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, [[Canadian Lawyer]] magazine named him one of Canada's ten greatest lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blakes.com/pdf/Ten_Greatest_Canadian_Lawyers.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318054801/http://www.blakes.com/pdf/Ten_Greatest_Canadian_Lawyers.pdf# |archive-date=2012-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Stewart was a graduate of [[Pictou Academy]] in 1906 &lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man: A Biography of James McGregor Stewart'', The Osgoode Society: University of Toronto Press, 2000, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and a gold medalist at [[Dalhousie University]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Dalhousie Law School in 1914 at the top of his class where he was also President of the Students' Council.&lt;ref name="BarryCahill"&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shortlisted for the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] but was not successful. The faculty senate at Dalhousie voted in 1910 not to appoint Stewart because he had had polio as a boy and walked with crutches. The motion proposed by Dean Richard Chapman Weldon read: ''"Serious physical defects should be considered as rendering a candidate ineligible for the Rhodes Scholarship."'' &lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

Stewart concluded his articles at a firm then known as Harris, Henry, Rogers &amp; Harris and made partner within a year.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught Real Property part-time at Dalhousie Law School &lt;ref name="BarryCahill" /&gt; and became head of his firm in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian Bar Association==

He served as the first Nova Scotian to be President of the [[Canadian Bar Association]] (CBA), elected as its thirteenth president in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart cancelled the 1942 meeting of the CBA at the government's request to avoid interference with the movement of wartime troops and supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', pp. 66-68.&lt;/ref&gt; He was honoured posthumously at a 1955 meeting of the CBA in Ottawa, along with [[Sir Lyman Duff]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businessman and corporate director==
He was a businessman, serving as a director of the board of many firms including [[Royal Bank of Canada]], [[Sun Life]], and [[Montreal Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a President of Acadia Sugar Refining for many years &lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a lawyer to financier, [[Izaak Walton Killam]] and the [[Royal Securities Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; where he played a role in the consolidation of the Nova Scotia fishing industry &lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart also played a role in the deal that established the seventeen million dollar Mersey paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He also acted as a mentor to [[Frank Manning Covert]] who became a lawyer in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ed., ''Frank Manning Covert: Fifty Years in the Practice of Law''. Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

He appeared several times before the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC). In 1939, he participated in a radio debate on the CBC with Dean Frederick Cronkite of the University of Saskatchewan College of Law on the merits of appeals to the JCPC. Stewart argued in favour of continuing such appeals, praising the quality of the lords of appeal in ordinary who sat on the JCPC.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coal Controller==

He served as Coal Controller during World War II for the [[Wartime Prices and Trade Board]] (WPTB) as a dollar-a-year man but was eventually asked to resign by [[C.D. Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', pp. 140-41.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he was awarded the [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], Civil Division for his distinguished wartime service.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Cahill, ''The Thousandth Man'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dalhousie University==

He also was extremely active in the governance of [[Dalhousie University]]. He joined the Board of Governors in 1929 and was elected as chair of its Board of Governors in 1937.

'''John Fletcher''' (1579–1625) was a [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] playwright. Following [[William Shakespeare]] as house playwright for the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], he was among the most prolific and influential dramatists of his day; during his lifetime and in the early [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], his fame rivalled Shakespeare's. Though his reputation has been far eclipsed since, Fletcher remains an important transitional figure between the Elizabethan popular tradition and the popular drama of the [[Restoration literature|Restoration]].

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Fletcher was born in December 1579 (baptised 20 December) in [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], Sussex, and died of the plague in August 1625 (buried 29 August in [[Southwark Cathedral|St. Saviour's]], [[Southwark]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/john-fletcher|title=John Fletcher Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Richard Fletcher (bishop)|Richard Fletcher]] was an ambitious and successful cleric who was in turn [[Dean of Peterborough]], [[Bishop of Bristol]], [[Bishop of Worcester]] and [[Bishop of London]] (shortly before his death), as well as chaplain to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Fletcher|title=John Fletcher {{!}} English dramatist|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dean of Peterborough, Richard Fletcher, at the execution of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] at [[Fotheringhay|Fotheringay]]. "knelt down on the scaffold steps and started to pray out loud and at length, in a prolonged and rhetorical style as though determined to force his way into the pages of history". He cried out at her death, "So perish all the Queen's enemies!"

Richard Fletcher died shortly after falling out of favour with the Queen, over a marriage she had advised against. He appears to have been partly rehabilitated before his death in 1596 but he died substantially in debt. The upbringing of John Fletcher and his seven siblings was entrusted to his paternal uncle [[Giles Fletcher, the Elder|Giles Fletcher]], a poet and minor official. His uncle's connexions ceased to be a benefit and may even have become a liability after the rebellion of [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Robert Devereux]] the Earl of Essex, who had been his patron. Fletcher appears to have entered [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] University in 1591, at the age of eleven.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=FLTR591J|name=Fletcher, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain that he took a degree but evidence suggests that he was preparing for a career in the church. Little is known about his time at college but he evidently followed the path previously trodden by the [[University wit]]s before him, from Cambridge to the burgeoning commercial theatre of London.

=== Collaborations with Beaumont ===
In 1606, he began to appear as a playwright for the [[Children of the Chapel|Children of the Queen's Revels]], then performing at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]]. [[Commendatory verse]]s by [[Richard Brome]] in the Beaumont and Fletcher 1647 [[book size|folio]] place Fletcher in the company of [[Ben Jonson]]; a comment of Jonson's to [[Drummond of Hawthornden|Drummond]] corroborates this claim, although it is not known when this friendship began. At the beginning of his career, his most important association was with [[Francis Beaumont]]. The two wrote together for close on a decade, first for the children and then for the King's Men. According to an anecdote transmitted or invented by [[John Aubrey]], they also lived together (in [[Bankside]]), sharing clothes and having "one wench in the house between them". This domestic arrangement, if it existed, was ended by Beaumont's marriage in 1613 and their dramatic partnership ended after Beaumont fell ill, probably of a stroke, the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_UbAwAAQBAJ|title=Famous English Renaissance Dramatists-Five-John Fletcher|last=Academy|first=Students'|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-257-15766-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Successor to Shakespeare ===
By this time, Fletcher had moved into a closer association with the King's Men. He collaborated with Shakespeare on ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'' and the [[Lost work|lost]] ''[[Cardenio]]'', which is probably (according to some modern scholars) the basis for [[Lewis Theobald]]'s play ''[[Double Falsehood]]''. A play he wrote singly around this time, ''[[The Woman's Prize]] or the Tamer Tamed'', is a sequel to ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.{{sfn|Squier|1986|p=120}} In 1616, after Shakespeare's death, Fletcher appears to have entered into an exclusive arrangement with the King's Men similar to Shakespeare's. Fletcher wrote only for that company between the death of Shakespeare and his death nine years later. He never lost his habit of collaboration, working with [[Nathan Field]] and later with [[Philip Massinger]], who succeeded him as house playwright for the King's Men. His popularity continued throughout his life; during the winter of 1621, three of his plays were performed at court. He died in 1625, apparently of the plague. He seems to have been buried in what is now [[Southwark Cathedral]], although the precise location is not known; there is a reference by [[Aston Cockayne]] to a common grave for Fletcher and Massinger (also buried in Southwark). What is more certain is that two simple adjacent stones in the floor of the Choir of Southwark Cathedral, one marked '[[Edmund Shakespeare|Edmond Shakespeare]] 1607' the other 'John Fletcher 1625' refer to Shakespeare's younger brother and the playwright. His mastery is most notable in two dramatic types, [[tragicomedy]] and [[comedy of manners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1093/acref/9780192806871.001.0001|title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-280687-1|last1=Birch|first1=Dinah|last2=Drabble|first2=Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stage history ==
[[File:John Fletcher from NPG.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of John Fletcher, circa 1620. [[National Portrait Gallery, London]].]]
Fletcher's early career was marked by one significant failure, of ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', his adaptation of [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]]'s ''[[Il Pastor Fido]]'', which was performed by the [[Children of the Chapel|Blackfriars Children]] in 1608.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9fSAgAAQBAJ|title=Moving Shakespeare Indoors: Performance and Repertoire in the Jacobean Playhouse|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|last2=Karim-Cooper|first2=Farah|date=2014-03-06|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04063-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to the printed edition of his play, Fletcher explained the failure as due to his audience's faulty expectations. They expected a pastoral tragicomedy to feature dances, comedy and murder, with the shepherds presented in conventional stereotypes—as Fletcher put it, wearing "gray cloaks, with curtailed dogs in strings".  Fletcher's preface in defence of his play is best known for its pithy definition of tragicomedy: "A tragicomedy is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants [i.e., lacks] deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy; yet brings some near it, which is enough to make it no comedy".  A comedy, he went on to say, must be "a representation of familiar people" and the preface is critical of drama that features characters whose action violates nature.

Fletcher appears to have been developing a new style faster than audiences could comprehend. By 1609, however, he had found his voice. With Beaumont, he wrote ''Philaster'', which became a hit for the King's Men and began a profitable connexion between Fletcher and that company. ''Philaster'' appears also to have initiated a vogue for tragicomedy; Fletcher's influence has been credited with inspiring some features of [[Shakespeare's late romances]] (Kirsch, 288–90) and his influence on the tragicomic work of other playwrights is even more marked. By the middle of the 1610s, Fletcher's plays had achieved a popularity that rivalled Shakespeare's and cemented the pre-eminence of the King's Men in Jacobean London. After Beaumont's retirement and early death in 1616, Fletcher continued working, singly and in collaboration, until his death in 1625. By that time, he had produced or had been credited with, close to fifty plays. This body of work remained a big part of the King's Men's repertory until the closing of the theatres in 1642.

During the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], many of the playwright's best-known scenes were kept alive as [[droll]]s, the brief performances devised to satisfy the taste for plays while the theatres were suppressed. At the re-opening of the theatres in 1660, the plays in the Fletcher canon, in original form or revised, were by far the most common fare on the English stage. The most frequently revived plays suggest the developing taste for comedies of manners. Among the tragedies, ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'' and especially, ''[[Rollo Duke of Normandy]]'' held the stage. Four tragicomedies (''A King and No King'', ''[[The Humorous Lieutenant]]'', ''Philaster'' and ''[[The Island Princess]]'') were popular, perhaps in part for their similarity to and foreshadowing of heroic drama. Four comedies (''Rule a Wife And Have a Wife'', ''The Chances'', ''[[Beggars' Bush]]'' and especially ''The Scornful Lady'') were also popular. Fletcher's plays, relative to those of Shakespeare and to new productions, declined. By around 1710, Shakespeare's plays were more frequently performed and the rest of the century saw a steady erosion in performance of Fletcher's plays. By 1784, [[Thomas Davies (bookseller)|Thomas Davies]] asserted that only ''Rule a Wife'' and ''The Chances'' were still on stage. A generation later, [[Alexander Dyce]] mentioned only ''The Chances''. Since then Fletcher has increasingly become a subject only for occasional revivals and for specialists. Fletcher and his collaborators have been the subject of important bibliographic and critical studies but the plays have been revived only infrequently.

== Plays ==
Because Fletcher collaborated regularly and widely, attempts to separate Fletcher's work from this collaborative fabric have experienced difficulties in attribution. Fletcher collaborated most often with Beaumont and Massinger but also with [[Nathan Field]], Shakespeare and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/john-fletcher|title=John Fletcher : The Poetry Foundation|website=www.poetryfoundation.org|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his early collaborations with Beaumont were later revised by Massinger, adding another layer of complexity to the collaborative texture of the works. According to scholars such as Hoy, Fletcher used distinctive mannerisms that Hoy argued identify his presence. According to Hoy's figures, he frequently uses ''ye'' instead of ''you'' at rates sometimes approaching 50 per cent. He employs '''em'' for ''them'', along with a set of other preferences in contractions. He adds a sixth stressed syllable to a standard pentameter verse line—most often ''sir'' but also ''too'' or ''still'' or ''next''. Various other habits and preferences may reveal his hand. The detection of this pattern, a Fletcherian textual profile, has persuaded some researchers that they have penetrated the Fletcher canon with what they consider success—and has in turn encouraged the use of similar techniques in the study of literature. [See: [[stylometry]].]  Scholars such as Jeffrey Masten and Gordon McMullan, have pointed out limitations of logic and method in Hoy's and others' attempts to distinguish playwrights on the basis of style and linguistic preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Masten, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2873346 "Beaumont and/or Fletcher: Collaboration and the Interpretation of Renaissance Drama."] ''English Literary History'' 59 (1992): 337-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliography has attempted to establish the writers of each play. Attempts to determine the exact "shares" of each writer (for instance by [[Cyrus Hoy]]) in particular plays continues, based on patterns of textual and linguistic preferences, style and idiosyncrasies of spelling.

The list that follows gives a tentative verdict on the writing of the plays in Fletcher's canon, with likeliest composition dates, dates of first publication and dates of licensing by the [[Master of the Revels]], where available.&lt;ref&gt;Denzell S. Smith, "Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher," in Logan and Smith, ''The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists,'' pp. 52–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[The Faithful Friends]],'' tragicomedy (registered 29 June 1660; MS.)

''The Nice Valour'' may be a play by Fletcher revised by [[Thomas Middleton]]; ''The Fair Maid of the Inn'' is perhaps a play by Massinger, [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] and [[John Webster]], either with or without Fletcher's involvement. ''The Laws of Candy'' has been variously attributed to Fletcher and to John Ford. ''The Night-Walker'' was a Fletcher original, with additions by Shirley for a 1639 production. Some of the attributions given above are disputed by scholars, as noted in connexion with ''Four Plays in One''. ''Rollo Duke of Normandy'', an especially difficult case and source of much disagreement among scholars, may have been written around 1617 and later revised by Massinger.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|first Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of 1647 collected 35 plays, most not published before. The second folio of 1679 added 18 more, for a total of 53. The first folio included ''[[The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn]]'' (1613) and the second ''The Knight of the Burning Pestle'' (1607) are widely considered to be solo works, although the latter was in early editions attributed to both writers. ''Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt'', existed in manuscript and was not published till 1883. In 1640 James Shirley's ''[[The Coronation (play)|The Coronation]]'' was misattributed to Fletcher upon its initial publication and was included in the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of 1679.

'''Lady Florence Caroline Dixie''' (née '''Douglas'''; 25 May 1855{{spaced ndash}}7 November 1905), was a Scottish traveller, [[war correspondent]], writer and [[feminism|feminist]].  Her account of travelling ''Across Patagonia'', her children's books ''The Young Castaways'' and ''Aniwee, or, The Warrior Queen'', and her feminist utopia ''Gloriana, or the Revolution of 1900'' all deal with feminist themes related to girls, women, and their positions in society.

==Early life==
Born in [[Cummertrees]], [[Dumfries]], Scotland on 25 May 1855, Lady Florence Douglas was the daughter of [[Caroline Douglas|Caroline Margaret Clayton]] (1821–1904), daughter of [[Sir William Clayton, 5th Baronet|General Sir William Clayton, 5th Baronet]] (1786–1866), Member of Parliament for [[Great Marlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Marlow]]&lt;ref name="ww"&gt;''DIXIE, Lady Florence, poet, novelist, writer; explorer and a keen champion of Woman's Rights'' in ''Who Was Who'' online at [http://www.xreferplus.com/entry.jsp?xrefid=7345683 7345683]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at xreferplus.com (subscription required), accessed 11 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry|Archibald Douglas]] (18 April 1818 – 6 August 1858) 8th Marquess of Queensberry.

She had a twin brother, Lord James Edward Sholto Douglas (d. 1891), an older sister, Lady Gertrude Douglas (1842–1893), and three older brothers: [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|John, Viscount Drumlanrig]] (1844–1900), later 9th Marquess of Queensberry, [[Lord Francis Douglas]] (1847–1865), and Reverend [[Lord Archibald Edward Douglas]] (1850–1938).&lt;ref name=Cokayne&gt;G.E.

Florence has been described as a tomboy&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Catherine Barnes|title=Victorian women travel writers in Africa|date=1982|publisher=Twayne|location=Boston|isbn=9780805768350|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tried to match her brothers in physical activities, whether swimming, riding, or hunting.&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt;{{rp|65}} She rode astride,&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walsh|first1=William Shepard|title=A Handy Book of Curious Information: Comprising Strange Happenings in the Life of Men and Animals, Odd Statistics, Extraordinary Phenomena, and Out of ...

Her childhood was marked by a number of dramatic and even tragic events.  On 6 August 1858, when she was 3, Lady Florence's father died in what was reported as a shooting accident,&lt;ref name="Queensberry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archibald William Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry|url=http://thepeerage.com/p2031.htm#i20305|website=The Peerage|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was widely believed to have been suicide.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crawford|first1=Bryan|title=Letters my grandfather wrote me : family origins.|date=2011|publisher=Authorhouse|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1456788520|pages=273|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7DOSZpbMM0C&amp;pg=PA273|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ewan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewan|first1=Elizabeth|title=The biographical dictionary of Scottish women : from the earliest times to 2004|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0748617135|page=96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs6qBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862 his widow Caroline acted upon a long-formed conviction  and converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. She took her youngest children, Archibald (12), Florence and James (7) to France, where she could educate them as she wished. This led the children's guardians to threaten Lady Queensberry with the loss of her children under English law. The three were too young to choose a guardian under Scottish law. They remained in France for two years. Falconer Atlee, British Consul at Nantes, offered them a place of safety when their first location was discovered, and Emperor [[Napoleon III]] eventually extended her his protection, ensuring that she could retain custody of the children. Archibald converted and took holy orders, becoming a Roman Catholic priest. Caroline's older daughter, Gertrude, also became Catholic. When her Protestant fiancé would not agree to raise their children in the Catholic faith, Gertrude's engagement was broken off. She entered a convent in Hammersmith and completed her novitiate to become a Sister of the Black Veil in 1867, but later left the order.&lt;ref name="Stratmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stratmann|first1=Linda|title=The Marquess of Queensberry : Wilde's nemesis|date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0300173802|pages=69–77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk3dDZeY9cYC&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Darling"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Douglas|first1=Gertrude|title=Lady Gertrude Douglas on Convent Life|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/75462201|accessdate=15 August 2016|work=The Darling Downs Gazette and General Advertiser (Toowoomba, Qld.)|page=4|date=2 July 1870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, it was agreed that Caroline would retain custody of the children, and they returned to England. Lady Florence was originally educated at home by a [[governess]], but is described as "defiant, rebellious and restless".&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt;{{rp|76}} After returning from France at age 9, the twins were separated. James was sent to a Catholic boarding school, and Florence to a [[convent school]], which she hated. She apparently found some consolation in writing poetry: her [[juvenalia|childhood verses]] were published much later as ''The songs of a child, and other poems'', under the pseudonym 'Darling'.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;Middleton, Dorothy, "Dixie [née Douglas], Florence Caroline, Lady Dixie (1855–1905)" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leadenhall"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixie|first1=Florence|title=The songs of a child, and other poems, by "Darling"|date=1901|publisher=Leadenhall Press|location=London|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011665398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another tragedy struck the family just days before Florence's eldest brother, John Douglas, was to assume his majority as 9th Marquess of Queensberry.  As guests gathered for a lavish celebration, word came that on 14 Jul 1865, 18-year-old Lord Francis Douglas had fallen to his death with three others, after achieving the [[first ascent of the Matterhorn|first successful ascent]] of the [[Matterhorn]].&lt;ref name="Nelsson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelsson|first1=Richard|title=The first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jul/14/matterhorn-first-ascent-whymper-1865|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Fergus|title=Cliffhanger at the top of the world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/nov/04/historybooks.books|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=The Guardian|date=3 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queensberry travelled post-haste to [[Zermatt]] with the intention of bringing home his brother's body, but nothing had been found of Lord Francis but some tattered shreds of his clothing. Queensberry, alone, without a guide, and starting by moonlight, attacked the Matterhorn himself and made it as far as "the Hut".  It was largely a matter of chance that two guides found and rescued him before he died of cold.&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt;{{rp|78–88}} He wrote apologetically to Florence, "I thought and thought where he was, and called him, and wondered if I should ever see him again.  I was half mad with misery, [Florence], and I could not help it."&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt;{{rp|84}}  "Exceedingly amiable and talented"&lt;ref name="Fleming"/&gt; Francis' loss was deeply felt by his family.&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt;{{rp|118–120}} In 1876, Florence would accompany Queensbury on his return to Zermatt, and he would show her the slopes where Francis had died.&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt;{{rp|118–120}}  Beyond the family, the tragedy was a long-running sensation, reported by newspapers all over the world, often in tones both sensational and denunciatory.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mark|first1=Jenkins|title=How the Matterhorn Created Modern Mountaineering 150 Years Ago|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/07/150714-matterhorn-switzerland-mountaineering-climbing-adventure-world/|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=National Geographic|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==
[[File:Bosworth Hall 1791.png|thumb|[[Bosworth Hall (Market Bosworth)|Bosworth Hall]] in Leicestershire]]
On 3 April 1875, at the age of nineteen, Douglas married [[Dixie baronets|Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie, 11th Baronet]] (1851–1924),&lt;ref name="Debrett"&gt;{{cite book|title=Debrett's Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Companionage|date=1878|publisher=Dean &amp; Son|location=London|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RQ82AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA140|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peerage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie, 11th Bt.|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p53401.htm#i534004|website=The Peerage|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JT"&gt;Theakstone, John, [http://victorianresearch.org/travelbibnotes2003.pdf ''Annotated Bibliography of Selected Works by Women Travellers, 1837–1910''] (dated Summer 2003) online at victorianresearch.org (accessed 8 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; known as "Sir A.B.C.D." or "Beau".&lt;ref name="Weddington"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosworth Hall|url=http://www.weddingtoncastle.co.uk/bosworth-hall.html|website=Weddington Castle|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beau, who had succeeded his father as the 11th baronet on 8 January 1872, had an income of £10,000 per year,&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt; a seat at [[Bosworth Hall (Market Bosworth)|Bosworth Hall]], near [[Market Bosworth|Market Bosworth, Leicestershire]], and a London townhouse in the fashionable residential district of [[Mayfair]].&lt;ref name="Burke"/&gt; He served as [[High Sheriff of Leicestershire]] for 1876.&lt;ref name="Bisset"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bisset|first1=Thom Adam|title=The Upper Ten Thousand, For 1876: A Biographical Handbook Of All The Titled And Official Classes Of The Kingdom, With Their Addresses|date=1876|publisher=Kelly and Company,|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfhsAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Florence was only five feet tall, while Beau stood 6&amp;prime; 2&amp;Prime;, Florence became the dominant partner in the marriage, reportedly ruling her husband "with a rod of iron".&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt;

The young couple had two sons, George Douglas (born 18 January 1876), who later became the [[Sir Douglas Dixie, 12th Baronet|12th baronet]], and Albert Edward Wolstan (born 26 September 1878, died 1940), whose godfather was the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;[http://staleyandco.com/Genealogy/Secondary/Burke.pdf Profile], staleyandco.com; accessed 11 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both husband and wife shared a love of adventure and the outdoor life, and are generally considered to have had a happy marriage, certainly the happiest of the Douglas siblings.&lt;ref name="Stratmann"/&gt;  Nonetheless, Beau's habits of drinking and of gambling for high stakes had catastrophic consequences for the family. The couple were reportedly referred to by contemporaries as "Sir Always and Lady Sometimes Tipsy".&lt;ref name="Cordery"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordery|first1=Stacy A.|title=Juliette Gordon Low : the remarkable founder of the Girl Scouts|date=2013|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0143122890|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A9hFVU9-bE4C&amp;pg=PP120|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 Beau's ancestral home and estate at Bosworth were sold to pay his debts.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Writing==
In 1877, Lady Florence published her first novel, ''Abel Avenged: a Dramatic Tragedy''.&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;  A number of Dixie's books, particularly her children's books ''The Young Castaways, or, The Child Hunters of Patagonia'' and ''Aniwee, or, The Warrior Queen'', and her adult novels ''Gloriana, or the Revolution of 1900'' and ''Isola, or the Disinherited: A Revolt for Woman and all the Disinherited'' develop feminist themes related to girls, women, and their positions in society.  Her final novel, a semi-autobiographical work entitled ''The Story of Ijain, or the Evolution of a Mind'' appeared in 1903.&lt;ref name="McKenzie"/&gt;{{rp|36–38}}

Although she published fiction for both adults and children, Dixie is best remembered for her travel books, ''Across Patagonia'' (1880) and ''In the Land of Misfortune'' (1882), both of which are still reprinted. In these books Dixie presents herself as the protagonist of the story. By doing so she defies the male tradition of quoting other travel writers who have visited and written on the area, and creates a unique feminine style of travel writing in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Szurmuk"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Argentina|last=Szurmuk|first=Monica|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=2001|isbn=0813018897|location=Gainesville, FL|pages=67–77|url=http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/AA/00/01/17/20/00001/Szurmuk_9780616101367.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She set out accompanied by her brothers, Lord Queensberry and Lord James Douglas, her husband Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie, and [[Julius Beerbohm]].&lt;ref name="McKenzie"/&gt;{{rp|38–39}} Beerbohm, a family friend, was hired as the group's guide because of his previous experience in Patagonia.&lt;ref name="Patagonia"/&gt; Dixie debated going elsewhere, but chose Patagonia because few European men, and no European women, had ever set foot there.&lt;ref name="Patagonia"/&gt; (Although reasonably accurate in terms of travelers' accounts, this claim ignores Britain's active economic involvement in the region.)&lt;ref name="McKenzie"/&gt;{{rp|40}}

Once in Patagonia, Dixie paints a picture of the landscape using techniques reminiscent of the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]] of [[William Wordsworth]] and others, using [[emotion]] and physical sensation to connect to the natural world.&lt;ref name="McKenzie"/&gt;{{rp|42–44}} While she describes the land as "uninviting and feared territory",&lt;ref name="Penaloza"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penaloza|first1=Fernanda|title=A Sublime Journey to the Barren Plains: Lady  Florence Dixie’s  Across Patagonia  (1880)|journal=Limina|date=2004|volume=10|pages=86|url=http://www.archive.limina.arts.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/186581/10-penaloza.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixie's actions demonstrate that survival in a wild land requires both strength and agency.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Monica|title=Women and the Politics of Travel, 1870–1914|date=2006|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, New Jersey|isbn=9781611473261|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOigGLqvALgC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Florence Dixie Across Patagonia 64f Indian Camp.jpg|thumb|Lady Florence Dixie entering an Indian encampment]]
During her travels in Patagonia, Dixie is "active, hardy, and resilient", rejecting Victorian gender constructs that depicted women as weak and in need of protection.&lt;ref name="McKenzie"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKenzie|first1=Precious|title=The right sort of woman : victorian travel writers and the fitness of an empire|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|isbn=978-1-4438-3637-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0AsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}}  Furthermore, in writing ''Across Patagonia'' (1880), Dixie never mentions her husband by name or title (simply referring to him as "my husband"), and presents herself as the expedition hero rather than the men being the heroes of the story.&lt;ref name="Penaloza"/&gt; She recounts times where she outsmarts or outlasts the men or remains their equal.&lt;ref name="Patagonia"/&gt;

While social issues such as European women's suffrage can be seen in her narrative, she says little about the natives of Patagonia. She has been criticized by Monica Szurmuk for not addressing the military campaigns of General [[Julio Argentino Roca]] against indigenous people of the time.&lt;ref name="Penaloza"/&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name="Szurmuk"/&gt;{{rp|77}}  However, Szurmuk also notes that Dixie's writing has a transgressive quality that acknowledges mutuality:&lt;ref name="Szurmuk"/&gt;{{rp|72–73}}

{{quote|"A remarkable characteristic of Dixie’s writing and one that sets her apart from others is that whenever she writes herself as viewer, she herself is also looked at, viewed, defined. Her first encounter with a “real Patagonian Indian” is marked by mutual gazes and by Indians and Europeans being all on horse-back, and thus at the same physical level."&lt;ref name="Szurmuk"/&gt;{{rp|72}} }}

Lady Dixie shared her observations of Patagonia with [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name="Darwin"/&gt; She took issue with Darwin's description of the [[Tuco-tuco]] in his ''Journal of Researches'' (1839). While Darwin had suggested that the Tuco-tuco were nocturnal creatures that lived almost entirely underground, Lady Dixie had seen the Tuco-tuco out during the daytime.&lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12781 Darwin Correspondence Database], accessed Fri 8 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She sent Darwin a copy of ''Across Patagonia''; Darwin's copy of this book is part of the Library of Charles Darwin located in the Rare Books Room of [[Cambridge University Library]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rutherford, H.

When she returned from Patagonia, Dixie brought home with her a [[jaguar]], which she called Affums and kept as a pet. Affums killed several deer in [[Windsor Great Park]] and had to be sent to a zoo.&lt;ref name="Hardman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardman|first1=Philippa|title=Lady Florence Dixie: a woman who had it all?|url=http://learning.darwinproject.ac.uk/gender/2012/03/08/lady-florence-dixie-a-woman-who-had-it-all/|website=Darwin and Gender: The Blog|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hotel at [[Puerto Natales]] in the Chilean part of Patagonia is named the ''Hotel Lady Florence Dixie'' in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel Lady Florence Dixie|url=http://www.hotelflorencedixie.cl/|website=Hotel Lady Florence Dixie|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her experiences in Patagonia inspire much of her later work, both her writing for children, and her work with the women's suffrage movement. Her two children's books, ''The Young Castaways'' and its sequel ''Aniwee'', are set in Patagonia and depict strong female characters.

{{quote|"The really amazing thing in the book is the prowess, skill, and prudence of the two girls, Topsie and Aniwee, the child of an Indian chief. ... the figures of Topsie, whose expertness as a stalker might put a veteran Highlander to shame, and of Aniwee, who teaches her tribe that a woman may be just as good a hunter and warrior as a man, and so revolutionises the whole social fabric of Indian life,—these are novelties indeed."&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaw|first1=John F.|title=The Young Castaways.

===''In the Land of Misfortune''===
[[File:Lady Florence Dixie.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Lady Florence in the 1880s]]
In 1881, Dixie was appointed as a [[war correspondent|field correspondent]] of the ''[[Morning Post]]'' of London to cover the [[First Boer War]] (1880–1881)&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; and the aftermath of the [[Anglo-Zulu War]]. She and her husband traveled to South Africa together. In [[Cape Town]], she stayed with the Governor of the [[Cape Colony]]. She visited [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]], and on her return interviewed the Zulu king [[Cetshwayo]], being held in detention by the British.&lt;ref name=JT/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mangasarian"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mangasarian|first1=Mangasar Mugurditch|title=Lady Florence Douglas Dixie|journal=Liberal Review: An Organ of the Independent Thinkers of America|date=1905|volume=2|issue=1|pages=336–342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qlzOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA336|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her reports, followed by her ''A Defence of Zululand and Its King from the Blue Book'' (1882) and ''In the Land of Misfortune'' (1882), were instrumental in Cetshwayo's brief restoration to his throne in 1883.&lt;ref name=JT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Dixie-La.html Lady Florence Caroline Douglas Dixie] in the ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' (sixth edition) online (accessed 8 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In Dixie's ''In the Land of Misfortune'', there is a struggle between her individualism and her identification with the power of the [[British Empire]], but for all of her sympathy with the Zulu cause and with Cetshwayo, she remained at heart an imperialist.&lt;ref name=Anderson119/&gt;

===A Feminist Utopia===
[[File:Florence Dixie.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece to "Gloriana", published by Henry &amp; Co., 1890]]

Dixie held strong views on the [[Feminism|emancipation]] of women, proposing that the sexes should be equal in marriage and divorce, that [[the Crown]] should be inherited by the monarch's [[male primogeniture|oldest child, regardless of sex]], and even that men and women should wear [[rational dress|the same clothes]].&lt;ref name=npg/&gt; She was a member of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]], and her obituary in the ''[[Englishwoman's Review]]'' emphasized her support for the cause of [[women's suffrage]] (i.e. the right to vote): "Lady Florence... threw herself eagerly into the Women's Movement, and spoke on public platforms."&lt;ref name=Anderson119/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixie|first1=Florence|title=Woman's position, and the objects of the Women's Franchise League [microform]; lecture ... delivered in the Christian Institute, Glasgow on 21st April 1891|date=21 April 1891|publisher=Leng|location=Dundee|url=https://archive.org/details/womanspositionob00dixi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1890, Dixie published a [[utopia]]n novel, ''Gloriana, or the Revolution of 1900'', which has been described as a [[feminist science fiction|feminist fantasy]].&lt;ref name=heilmann/&gt; It also interweaves elements of romance and [[detective fiction]].&lt;ref name="Wu"/&gt;{{rp|57}}  In it, women win the [[suffrage|right to vote]], as the result of the protagonist, Gloriana, posing as a man, Hector D'Estrange, and being elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The character of D'Estrange is reflective of Oscar Wilde,&lt;ref name=heilmann&gt;Heilmann, Ann, ''Wilde's New Women: the New Woman on Wilde'' in Uwe Böker, [[Dick Corballis|Richard Corballis]], Julie A.

The book ends in the year 1999, with a description of a prosperous and peaceful Britain whose government has deeply benefited from the engagement of women. In the preface to the novel, Dixie proposes not only women's suffrage, but that the two sexes should be [[co-education|educated together]] and that all professions and positions should be open to both. In the novel, she goes farther and says:&lt;ref name=gates&gt;Gates, Barbara T. (ed.), ''In Nature's Name: An Anthology of Women's Writing and Illustration, 1780–1930'' ([[University of Chicago Press]], 2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=QlUW4BQk2wcC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=gloriana&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Rlx-3u-PYy&amp;sig=j7OZWDh6XNij98kKcepmocrHS44&amp;hl=en#PPA62,M1 pages 61–66] online at books.google.co.uk (accessed 9 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women and sports==
===Women's football===
Dixie played a key role is establishing the game of [[women's association football]], organizing [[exhibition match]]es for charity, and in 1895 she became President of the [[British Ladies' Football Club]], stipulating that "the girls should enter into the spirit of the game with heart and soul." She arranged for a women's football team from London to tour Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Richard William Cox, Dave Russell, Wray Vamplew, ''Encyclopedia of British Football'' (London, Routledge, 2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=63AL641DvuUC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=%22Dixie%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=p5gf5dYAlW&amp;sig=5tH6CsLRjhY-3q1YnStwfYIsBCQ&amp;hl=en page 325] online at books.google.co.uk (accessed 9 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=James F.|title=The lady footballers : struggling to play in Victorian Britain|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415426091|pages=27–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1r7aAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood sports===
During her early life and travels, Dixie was an enthusiastic sportswoman, an intrepid rider and shot. As the following reminiscence shows, part of the appeal of hunting in [[Leicestershire]] was the opportunity to compete on an equal footing with active male peers:

{{quote|'The merry blast of the huntsman's horn resounds, the view-halloa rings out cheerily on the bright crisp air of a fine hunting morning; the fox is "gone away," you have got a good start, and your friend has too. "Come on," he shouts, "let us see this run together!" Side by side you fly the first fence, take your horse in hand, and settle down to ride over the broad grass country. How distinctly you remember that run, how easily you recall each fence you flew together, each timber-rail you topped, and that untempting bottom you both got so luckily and safely over, and above all, the old farm-yard, where the gallant fox yielded up his life.' Lady Florence Dixie, 1880&lt;ref name="Patagonia"/&gt; }}

Dixie's skills on horseback were sufficient to be mentioned in sporting magazines. The following account gives a vivid idea of the risks involved in a [[fox hunt]]:&lt;ref name="Baily"&gt;{{cite news|title=Our Van|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjhHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA238|accessdate=4 October 2016|work=Baily's Magazine of Sports &amp; Pastimes|page=238|volume=31|date=1878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"From scent to view they kill him in the open in one hour and five minutes, after a good twelve miles’ run.  There were several very bad falls, and a great deal of grief, horses standing still in all directions.  Lady Florence Dixie, who had been going admirably, had a nasty fall into the Widmerpool road, her horse quite blown. Every one was delighted to see her ladyship out again soon after.  There were few who rode the run as hounds ran, and who saw the fox killed, but we believe Mr. Coupland, Captain Middleton, Lord Douglas, and Tom Firr accomplished it, much to their credit, as in the present state of the country it could not be an easy task."&lt;ref name="Baily"/&gt; }}

In Patagonia, survival of the party as a whole depended on the equal participation of all those within it.  Dixie shared the responsibility and the dangers of necessary tasks such as hunting for food for the party.&lt;ref name="Patagonia"/&gt;

[[File:Florence Dixie Across Patagona 112f The Last Double.jpg|thumb|Hunting ostriches in Patagonia]]

{{quote|"Unconscious of anything but the exciting chase before me, I am suddenly disagreeably reminded that there ''is'' such a thing as caution, and necessity to look where you are going to, for, putting his foot in an unusually deep tuca-tuca hole, my little horse comes with a crash upon his head, and turns completely over on his back, burying me beneath him in a hopeless muddle."

However, she was also "haunted by a sad remorse" for the death of a beautiful golden deer of the Cordilleras, which was exceedingly tame and trusting.&lt;ref name=Patagonia/&gt; During the 1890s, Dixie's views on [[field sports]] changed dramatically, and in her book ''The Horrors of Sport'' (1891) she condemned [[blood sports]] as cruel.&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Florence Dixie The Graphic March 24 1883.jpg|thumb|''The Graphic'', 24 March 1883, page 305]]
Dixie was an enthusiastic writer of letters to newspapers on liberal and progressive issues, including support for Scottish and [[Irish Home Rule]].&lt;ref name=npg&gt;{{cite web|title=Lady Florence Caroline Dixie|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp67199/lady-florence-caroline-dixie-neacutee-douglas|website=National Portrait Gallery|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Her article ''The Case of Ireland'' was published in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'' on 27 May 1882.&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;

Nevertheless, she was critical of the [[Irish Land League]] and the [[Fenian]]s, who reportedly made an unsuccessful attempt to attack her in March 1883.

===Alleged assassination attempt===
Reports were published of an attempt to assassinate Lady Florence Dixie at her residence, the Fishery, situated near the [[River Thames|Thames]], and about two and a half miles from [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. Lady Florence Dixie gave the following account to the newspapers:

{{quote|"I was out walking near the Fishery last evening, about 4:30, when two very tall women came up and asked me the time. I replied that I had not got my watch with me, and, turning, left them. Opening a small gate which led into the private grounds of Capt Brocklehurst, of the Blues, I made toward a stile, and was just going to get over, when I heard the gate open behind, and the two women followed me in. Somehow or other I felt all was not right, so I stopped and leaned against the rails, and then, as they came on, went to meet them. One on the right came forward and seized me by the neck, when by the strength of the clutch I felt it was no woman's power that pulled me down to the ground. In another second I saw the other would-be woman over me, and remember seeing the steel of the knife come right down upon me, driven by this person's hand. It struck through my clothes and against the [[whalebone]] of my stays, which turned the point, merely grazing the skin. The knife was quickly withdrawn and plunged at me again. I seized it with both hands and shouted as loud as I could, when the person who first pulled me down pushed a large handful of earth into my mouth and nearly choked me. Just as the knife was wrenched from my hands, a very big and powerful St. Bernard dog I had with me broke through the wood, and the last thing I remember was seeing the person with the knife pulled backward by him. Then I heard a confused sound of rumbling of wheels, and I remember no more. When I came to myself I was quite alone. From what I saw of the knife I believe it to be a dagger, and the persons were undoubtedly men. They were dressed in long clothes, and were unnaturally tall for women; the one who stabbed me had on a thick veil, reaching below the mouth; the other was unveiled, but his face I did not notice much. This is all the information I can give. My head is very confused and painful, and I expect they must have stunned me. This is a wretched scrawl, but my hands are very much cut, and it pains me so much to write."&lt;ref name="Perth"/&gt;}}

    SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT:    The accounts in this case rest mainly on the statements of Lady Florence Dixie. The investigations of the police into this matter have not resulted in discovering any further circumstances in confirmation of it."&lt;ref name="Hansard"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1883/mar/29/law-and-police-reported-attack-on-lady LAW AND POLICE—REPORTED ATTACK ON LADY FLORENCE DIXIE]
Hansard, HC Deb 29 March 1883 vol 277 cc993-4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Alleged kidnapping===
In her obituary, printed 8 November 1905, ''The New York Times'' suggested that Dixie had claimed to be kidnapped by Irish agitators.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lady Florence Dixie Dead. Author, Champion of Woman's Rights, and War Correspondent|work=New York Times|issue=9|date=8 November 1905|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/20311508/| quote="Lady Florence Dixie was a member of the Queensberry family and inherited the eccentricities as well as the cleverness possessed by so many members of it. Some years ago she startled London by declaring that she had been kidnapped she believed by Irish agitators, and had been held for some days in captivity. Her story was never disproved, but neither was it proved, and there were many people who said that the whole affair was imaginary."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Lady Florence Dixie died of [[diphtheria]] on 7 November 1905.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;{{rp|250}} ''The New York Times'' reported that the "Author, Champion of Woman's Rights, and War Correspondent" had died on 7 November at her home in Glen Stuart, Dumfriesshire.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

==Likenesses==

A monochrome [[lithography|lithograph]] of Dixie by Andrew Maclure was published in 1877.  She is seated on horseback and holding a [[riding crop]].  A copy is in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]].&lt;ref name=npg/&gt;

[[File:+Lady Florence Dixie Vanity Fair.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Lady Florence Dixie by [[Théobald Chartran]], from ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'', 5 January 1884]]

A more significant lithograph, by [[Théobald Chartran]], [[chromolithograph|printed in colour]], appeared in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1884 and is one of the long series of [[Vanity Fair caricatures|caricatures published in the magazine]] between 1868 and 1914. These were all coloured illustrations featuring notable people of the day, and each was accompanied by a short (usually adulatory) biography. Of more than two thousand people so honoured, only eighteen were women. Featured in the magazine on 5 January 1884, she joined this small band, which included [[Isabella II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] (1869), [[Sarah Bernhardt]] (1879), [[Alexandra of Denmark|the Princess of Wales]] (1882) and [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts]] (1883). [[Victoria, Princess Royal]], and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elizabeth, Empress of Austria]], followed later in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanity-fair-prints-company.com/pages/Ladies1.html Vanity Fair Ladies], vanity-fair-prints-company.com; accessed 30 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leslie Calvin''' "'''Les'''" '''Brown''' (born February 17, 1945) is an American motivational speaker, author, radio DJ, former television host, and former politician. As a politician, he is a former member of the [[Ohio House of Representatives]]. As a motivational speaker, he uses the catch phrase "it's possible!" and teaches people to follow their dreams as he learned to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesbrown.com/lesbrown.com/english/meet_lesbrown.html |title=Meet Les Brown - Motivational Speaker, Speech Coach &amp; Best Selling Author |work=Les Brown Enterprises |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the host of ''[[The Les Brown Show]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Brown was born with his twin brother, Wesley, in an abandoned building in Liberty City, a low-income section of [[Miami]], Florida. He was subsequently given up for adoption and adopted by Mamie Brown, a 38-year-old single woman who worked as a cafeteria attendant and domestic assistant. He was declared "educable [[mentally retarded]]" while in grade school. Despite the self-esteem and confidence loss issues this created, he learned how to reach his full potential with the encouragement of his mother and assistance from a helpful teacher in high school, a key point in many motivational speeches he gives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/museum/george-washington-williams-room/african-american-legislators/leslie-c-brown |title=George Washington Williams Room - Legislators |work=The Ohio Statehouse |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional life===
According to many of Brown's speeches, he first decided to get into public radio and kept returning to the same radio station time and time again looking for a break. It wasn't until the on-air failures of the afternoon DJ that he took his break in radio into his own hands and was hired full-time as on-air talent. Upon his termination from the radio station, he ran for election in the Ohio House of Representatives and won. After leaving the Ohio state legislature, he decided to get into television and eventually ended up on PBS. He also formed Les Brown Enterprises in order to support his newest career as a motivational speaker and was on KFWB in California on a daily syndicated radio program from 2011 to 2012. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he also won many local and national awards for excellence and he has an Emmy to his name. Brown was a member of the [[Peabody Award]]s [[The George Foster Peabody Awards Board of Jurors|Board of Jurors]] from 1982 to 1988.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody-awards-board-members&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he began hosting a new talk show, ''[[The Les Brown Show]]'', which began airing on September 6, 1993. After nearly four months, it went on hiatus on December 3, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14630470.html |title=Less Les? (The Les Brown Show) |work=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=6 December 1993}},&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 17, 1994, [[King World Productions]] replaced this with ''[[Rolonda]]'', a show hosted by [[Rolonda Watts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14677374.html |first=Mike |last=Freeman |title=King World Productions replaces 'The Les Brown Show' with 'Rolonda Watts' |work=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=3 January 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Les collaborated with [[John C. Maxwell]] and [[The John Maxwell Team]] for a candid look into the lives of professional speakers called "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUzpNmKJV5o&amp;list=PLlWx1lni_ne3vz0AQEzMDwnexMOLGluNQ "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"], Youtube.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Brown married [[Gladys Knight]] in 1995; they divorced in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=les+brown+gladys+knight+married#v=onepage&amp;q=les%20brown%20gladys%20knight%20married&amp;f=false|title=Jet|last=Company|first=Johnson Publishing|date=1995-10-09|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/archive/pain-and-glory-vol-48-no-23/|title=Pain and Glory - Vol. 48 No. 23|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has ten children: Calvin, Patrick, John Andrew, Ona, Ayanna, Tayloria, Thad, Sumaya, Serena and John-Leslie. He also has 15 grandchildren and two great grandchildren.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Les_Brown.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
Council of Peers Award of Excellence, National Speakers Association, 1989; regional Emmy Award (Chicago), 1991, for the program You Deserve with Les Brown; selected as one of America’s top five speakers, Toastmasters International, 1992.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16140">The [[The Glass House (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[The Glass House (2012 TV series)|The Glass House]]'' featured 14 contestants also known as The Players. When the original fourteen players were revealed, a woman named Melissa was included. Days after the announcement, however, she was removed from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] website, and had been replaced with Holly. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] has yet to confirm why Melissa did not participate on the show. The original fourteen players entered the house on June 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawg |url=http://www.abctheglasshouse.com/abc-the-glass-house-joy-glass-is-a-playboy-model-sexy-smart-daring/ |title=Joy Glass is a PLAYBOY Model "Sexy, Smart, Daring" |publisher=ABC The Glass House |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alex Stein==
Alex Stein is a 25-year-old [[bail bondsman]] from [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/the-glass-house/bios/alex |title=Alex Bio - The Glass House - ABC.com |publisher=Beta.abc.go.com |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2012-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804120730/http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/the-glass-house/bios/alex |archivedate=2012-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex often referred to himself as "Primetime 99" both inside and outside of the house, with the 99 standing for his jersey number when he played football in high school. In the first week, Alex asked the viewers whether he should be the villain of the house or not, with the fans giving him the answer "yes". Following numerous personal attacks towards the other contestants, Alex was voted into limbo, receiving a total of ten votes against him.

'''Margaret Skinnider''' (28 May 1892 – 10 October 1971) was a [[revolutionary]] and [[feminist]] born in [[Coatbridge]], Scotland. She fought during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in [[Dublin]] as a sniper, among other roles, and was the only female wounded in the action. She was mentioned three times for bravery in the dispatches sent to the Dublin GPO.&lt;ref name="labour.ie"&gt;http://www.labour.ie/download/pdf/seven_women_of_the_labour_movement1916.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sadhbh Walsche in ''[[The New York Times]]'' refers to her as "the schoolteacher turned sniper."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/opinion/the-sisterhood-of-the-easter-rising.html The Sisterhood of the Easter Rising] ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Skinnider was born in 1893 to [[Irish people|Irish]] parents in the [[Lanarkshire]] town of Coatbridge. She trained as a mathematics teacher and joined [[Cumann na mBan]] in [[Glasgow]], she was also involved in the women's suffrage movement.&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/print/13866 |title=News |publisher=An Phoblacht |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically she had learned to shoot in a rifle club &lt;ref name="Eight Women of the Easter Rising"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/16/opinion/eight-women-of-irelands-1916-easter-rising.html Eight Women of the Easter Rising] The New York Times, March 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; which had originally been set up so that women could help in defence of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/IRELAND/2002-07/1026693497 |title=RootsWeb: IRELAND-L [IRELAND&amp;#93; Women of Ireland Series: Margaret Skinnider |publisher=Archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=2002-07-14 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her trips to Ireland Skinnider came under the influence of [[Constance Markievicz]] and became active in smuggling detonators and bomb-making equipment into Dublin (in her hat) in preparation for the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. She along with [[Madeleine ffrench-Mullen]] spent time in the hills around Dublin testing dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.stu.ca/~hcbxz/truth/feas2.htm]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Skinnider was shown "the poorest part of Dublin" by Constance Markievicz, she wrote; "I do not believe there is a worse place in the world." The street was "a hollow full of sewage and refuse", and the building "as full of holes as if it had been under shellfire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://republican-news.org/archive/1998/April16/16lily.html |title=An Phoblacht/Republican News |publisher=Republican-news.org |date=1916-04-24 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217094429/http://republican-news.org/archive/1998/April16/16lily.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating variously as a scout, message runner (often dressed as a boy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04182005-153415/unrestricted/FINALFORMATTEDTHESIS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020522/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04182005-153415/unrestricted/FINALFORMATTEDTHESIS.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and sniper Skinnider
took part in action against the [[British Army]] at the Garrison at the College of Surgeons and St. Stephen's Green under
the Command of General [[Michael Mallin]] and [[Constance Markievicz]]. Skinnider was reportedly an excellent markswoman. She was seriously wounded when she was shot three times attempting to burn down houses on Harcourt Street to try to cut off the retreat of British soldiers who had planted a machine gun post on the roof of the [[Newman University Church|University Church]].&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"/&gt;

[[Nora Connolly O'Brien]] describes Skinnider's leading role in this action;

{{quote|When they were going out to attack the nest of snipers she was in charge of the squad. [[William Partridge (Irish revolutionary)|William Partridge]], a very famous man in the working class movement, was there and he and other members of the squad accepted that she was in charge|&lt;ref name="anphoblacht.com"/&gt;}}

In her autobiography "Doing my bit for Ireland" (New York – Century, 1917) Skinnider herself vividly describes her role as a sniper at St. Stephen's Green in the [[Easter Rising]]:

{{quote|It was dark there, full of smoke and the din of firing, but it was good to be in action. I could look across the tops of the trees and see the British soldiers on the roof of the Shelbourne. I could also hear their shot hailing against the roof and wall of our fortress, for in truth this building was just that. More than once I saw the man I aimed at fall.|&lt;ref&gt;Doing My Bit for Ireland" – Margaret Skinnider(New York – Century)1917&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In terms of her role as a woman taking part in military action Skinnider comments:

{{quote|Commandant Mallin [...] finally agreed, though not at all willingly, for he did not want to let a woman run this sort of risk. My answer to this argument was that we had the same right to risk our lives as the men; that in the constitution of the Irish Republic, women were on an equality with men. For the first time in history, indeed, a constitution had been written that incorporated the principle of equal suffrage.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinnfein.ie/news/detail/13144] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914002602/http://www.sinnfein.ie/news/detail/13144 |date=14 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/pettigolass/skinnider.html |title=Famous Irish Women ~ Margaret Skinnider |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2005-02-25 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225084216/http://www.geocities.com/pettigolass/skinnider.html |archivedate=25 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The current president of [[Sinn Féin]], [[Gerry Adams]], quoted Skinnider's stirring words in his 2006 address to the [[Sinn Féin]] Ard Feis.

Initially imprisoned and seriously injured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/75121 |title=Political Theatre. - Indymedia Ireland |publisher=Indymedia.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinnider spent several weeks in hospital&lt;ref name="labour.ie"/&gt; before she contrived to escape whilst awaiting medical treatment and obtained a travel permit from [[Dublin Castle]] to enable her to return to her native [[Scotland]].

== Post-1916 activities ==
Skinnider returned to [[Dublin]] later that year before fleeing to the [[United States]] in fear of internment. Whilst in America, she collected funds for the republican cause and lectured with other women who had fought in the Easter Rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3.1.9 Nationalism 1916-17 |url=http://www.scoilnet.ie/womeninhistory/content/unit3/nationalism_1916_17.html |publisher=Scoilnet.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191315/http://www.scoilnet.ie/womeninhistory/content/unit3/nationalism_1916_17.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinnider also wrote and published her autobiography in New York – "Doing my Bit for Ireland".  Skinnider later returned to Ireland and took up a teaching post in Dublin in 1917. During the War of Independence she was arrested and imprisoned. In the civil war she became Paymaster General of the [[Irish Republican Army]] until she was arrested in 1923 and held at North Dublin Union. There she became Director of Training for the prisoners.&lt;ref name="labour.ie"/&gt; (James Connolly's daughter Nora took over her role)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searcs-web.com/obrien.html |title=SEARC'S WEB GUIDE - Nora Connolly O'Brien (1893-1981) |publisher=Searcs-web.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==

After her release from prison, she worked as a teacher at Kings Inn Street Sisters of Charity Primary School in Dublin until her retirement in 1961. She was a member of the [[Irish National Teachers' Organisation]] (INTO) throughout her teaching career. She became its President in 1956. During her tenure she represented Ireland at the World Conference of the Organisation of the Teaching Professions in [[Manila]], Philippines. She fought in particular for the rights of women – this agitation resulted in the introduction of common incremental salary sales for women and single men in 1949. She sat on the Committee that advised on the 50th anniversary commemorations of the 1916 rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/erskinechilders/status/631785984540213248|title=Erskine Childers on Twitter|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived her last years in Glenageary, County Dublin. She died on 10 October 1971 and was buried next to Countess Markievicz in the Republican plot in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], Dublin.&lt;ref name="Eight Women of the Easter Rising"/&gt;

'''Miloš Obrenović''' ({{IPA-sh|mîloʃ obrěːnoʋit͡ɕ|pron}}; {{lang-sr-cyr|Милош Обреновић}}; 18 March 1780 – 26 September 1860) born Miloš Teodorović (Милош Теодоровић) was [[Prince of Serbia]] from 1815 to 1839, and again from 1858 to 1860. He participated in the [[First Serbian Uprising]], led [[Serbs]] in the [[Second Serbian Uprising]], and founded the [[House of Obrenović]]. Under his rule, [[Serbia]] became an autonomous [[principality]] within the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Prince]] Miloš ruled autocratically, permanently refusing to share power. During his rule, he was the richest man in [[Serbia]] and one of the richest in the [[Balkans]].

==Early life==
'''Miloš Teodorović''' ({{IPA-sh|teodǒːroʋit͡ɕ|}}) was the son of Teodor "Teša" Mihailović (died 1802) from [[Gornja Dobrinja|Dobrinja]], and Višnja (died 18 June 1817).&lt;ref name=Tablica&gt;{{cite web|title=Родословне таблице: Број 16. и 17. Обреновићи|author=А. Ивић|url=https://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0:Tablice16.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second marriage of his mother Višnja, from which also sprung Jovan (1787–1850) and [[Jevrem Obrenović|Jevrem]] (1790–1856).&lt;ref name=Tablica/&gt; From Višnja's first marriage, with Obren Martinović (died 1780) from [[Brusnica, Gornji Milanovac|Brusnica]], Miloš had half-brothers Jakov (died 1811) and [[Milan Obrenović (revolutionary)|Milan]] (died 1810), and half-sister Stana.&lt;ref name=Tablica/&gt; After the death of Obren, Višnja moved from Brusnica and married Teodor in Dobrinja.&lt;ref name=Tablica/&gt; After the death of his brother Milan, a famed revolutionary with great reputation among the people, Miloš adopted the surname Obrenović. In official documents, his name was sometimes written '''Miloš Teodorović Obrenović'''.&lt;ref name="Serbia1877"&gt;{{cite book|author=Serbia|title=Зборник закона и уредаба|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u14tAQAAMAAJ|year=1877|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Serbian Uprising==
{{main article|First Serbian Uprising}}
Miloš fought in the [[First Serbian Uprising]] until its very end in 1813. His half-brother Milan also took part in the Uprising, rising to become the ''vojvoda'' (commander, duke) of the [[Rudnik (mountain)|Rudnik]] district, until his death in 1810. After Milan's death, Miloš adopted the surname of his half-brother, Obrenović. This name was the [[patronymic]] which his half-brother derived from Obren, the first name of his own father (Miloš's step-father). After the rebellion collapsed, Miloš was among the few of its leaders that remained in Serbia to face the returning [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].

==Second Serbian Uprising==
In April 1815, Prince Miloš organized and led the [[Second Serbian Uprising]]. After defeating the Turks, and Napoleon's defeat in Russia, the Turks agreed to the terms of the agreement from 1815. After the killing of [[Karađorđe Petrović]], in 1817, Obrenović became the leader of the Serbs. As a result of the agreement, Serbia gained some autonomy, but remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sovereignty. Miloš Obrenović was left in power as its absolute ruler.

[[File:Paja Jovanovic-Takovski ustanak.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Takovo, proclamation of Uprising.]]

Between the end of 1828 and the autumn of 1830, Prince Miloš created a so-called "legislative commission" to translate the [[Code Napoléon]] into Serbian and codify the laws and customs of the country. After discussing the commission, Miloš invited two distinguished legal specialists to come from Hungary to prepare a more suitable criminal and civil code of laws for Serbia. They were Vasilije Lazarević, ''Bürgermeister'' (mayor) of [[Zemun]], and Jovan Hadžić, lawyer, poet, and member of the municipal senate of [[Novi Sad]].

In January 1831, Prince Miloš informed a great national assembly that he had obtained an imperial [[edict]] from the Sultan ending all direct obligations of Serbian peasants to their former Turkish lords, guaranteeing Ottoman recognition of Serbian autonomy in most matters of internal administration, and offering Serbia the prospect of territorial aggrandizement, as well as the express right to institute schools, courts, and a governmental administration of her own. The [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]]'s decrees of 1830 and 1833 expanded the same rights to a larger territory, and made [[Serbia]] a sovereign principality, with Miloš Obrenović as hereditary prince. A [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Metropolitanate of Serbia]] was established in Belgrade as an autonomous unit of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. [[Russian Empire|Russia]]'s status as the guarantor of [[Serbia]]'s autonomy was also recognized.

==Reign==

The supporters of the rule of law often rebelled against Miloš's government. Following one such rebellion, he agreed to adopt a [[constitution]], the ''Sretenje'' or Candlemas constitution, in 1835. The move was opposed by neighboring [[Habsburg monarchy|Austria]], the ruling Ottoman Empire and Russia. It is believed that the three great empires saw the constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government. [[Metternich]]'s Austria particularly ridiculed the fact that Serbia had its own flag and [[foreign ministry]]. Miloš abolished the constitution at the demand of Russia and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]], and it was replaced by the "Turkish" [[Turkish constitution (Serbia)|Constitution of 1838]].

Miloš abdicated in 1839 in favor of his sons—Milan, who died a few weeks later, and [[Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of Serbia|Mihailo]], who then became prince. Mihailo was deposed in 1842, and the family was out of power until 1858, when it returned with Miloš restored as prince for the last two years of his life.

==Legacy==
[[File:A bust of Miloš the Great in Kragujevac.jpg|thumb|right|A bust of Miloš Obrenović in Kragujevac]]
Miloš Obrenović was given the epithet ''the Great''. He was proclaimed ''Father of the Fatherland'' by the National Assembly.&lt;ref name="Nešić1920"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milutin D.

==Marriage and children==
In 1805, Miloš married [[Ljubica Vukomanović]] (September 1785 – [[Vienna]], 26 May 1843). The couple had eight children whose names are known. It is speculated that Ljubica had other pregnancies that resulted in [[miscarriage]]s, [[stillbirth]]s, or children who died shortly after birth, with some sources giving a number as high as 17 pregnancies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11626">'''Mireille Miller-Young''' is a feminist and an [[associate professor]] of [[women's studies|feminist studies]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. Her research explores race, gender, and sexuality in visual culture and sex industries in the United States.
Miller-Young holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Historiography of the United States|American History]] from [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{cite web | title = Mireille Miller-Young | url = http://www.femst.ucsb.edu/people/mireille-miller-young | accessdate = 2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She describes herself as an "academic pornographer", a term originally adopted by [[Sander Gilman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Taste for Brown Sugar | page = viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller-Young is currently working on a documentary film on black women in the porn industry.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt;

== ''A Taste for Brown Sugar'' ==

Miller-Young's 2004 PhD dissertation examines the history of black women in pornography with [[ethnography|ethnographic]] methods.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=LaShawn|date=2016|title=Review of A Taste for Brown Sugar: Black Women in Pornography, by Mireille Miller-Young|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10999949.2016.1162606?journalCode=usou20|journal=Souls: A Critical Journal of Black Politics, Culture, and Society|volume=18|issue=1|pages=174–176|doi=10.1080/10999949.2016.1162606|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''A Taste for Brown Sugar: The History of Black Women in American Pornography'', the dissertation was hailed as "pioneering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Decena | first = Carlos Ulises | title = Tacit Subjects: Belonging and Same-Sex Desire among Dominican Immigrant Men | publisher = Duke University Press | date = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-8223-4945-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and was published as a book in 2014.
Reviewers have described the book as "masterful"&lt;ref name="harris"/&gt;
and lauded its "rigorous scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stallings|first=L.

It has been described as "a remarkable text that applies critical race studies, feminist studies, sexuality studies, and film studies to Black women in pornography" and as a "must read" that is "deftly building" on the work of feminist scholars such as [[Angela Davis]], [[Saidiya Hartman]], and [[Celine Parrenas Shimizu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamstein|first=Joanna|date=2017|title=A Taste for Brown Sugar: Black Women in Pornography|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2017.1386028|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/00918369.2017.1386028|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It won [[National Women's Studies Association]] and [[American Studies Association]] book awards in 2015.

== Criminal case ==

Miller-Young became known to a wider audience in 2014 when she accosted a pair of teenage anti-abortion activists on campus, stealing and later destroying one of their signs. In her interview with police, Miller-Young said she felt "triggered" by the sign and had a "moral right" to remove the material from sight.&lt;ref =name="indy"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.com/news/2014/mar/21/ucsb-professor-charged-theft-and-battery-after-con/ | accessdate = 2018-05-03 | last = Hayden | first = Taylor | title = UCSB Professor Charged with Theft and Battery | date = March 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Miller-Young was charged with grand theft, battery, and vandalism. She pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] and was sentenced to 108 hours of community service and three years of probation. She was also ordered to pay restitution and attend anger management classes.&lt;ref name="nexus"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dailynexus.com/2014-08-27/court-rules-on-miller-young-case/ | accessdate = 2018-05-03 | last = Lewis | first = Loree | date = August 27, 2014 | website = The Daily Nexus | title = Court Rules on Miller-Young Case }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fix"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/18854/ | accessdate = 2018-05-03 | last = Kabbany | first = Jennifer | title = Feminist Professor Who Attacked Prolife Teen Avoids Jail Time | date = August 18, 2014 | website = The College Fix }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frisky"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefrisky.com/2014-03-24/professor-mireille-miller-young-charged-with-theft-battery-vandalism-after-stealing-anti-abortion-protestors-sign/ | accessdate = 2018-05-03 | last = Wakeman | first = Jessica | title = Professor Mireille Miller-Young Charged With Theft, Battery, Vandalism After Stealing Anti-Abortion Protestors Sign | date = March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case attracted widespread attention and precipitated think pieces from all over the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://criticallegalthinking.com/2014/04/01/improper-attachments-anti-abortion-posters-belong/ | last = Cooper | first = Davina | title = Improper attachments, or who do anti-abortion posters belong to? | date = April 1, 2004 | accessdate = 2018-05-08 | website = Critical Legal Thinking }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  web | url = http://thefeministwire.com/2014/03/mireille-miller-young-standing-with/ | last = Gilmore | first = Stefanie | title = Why I Am In Solidarity with Mireille Miller-Young | date = March 20, 2014 | accessdate = 2018-05-08 | website = Feminist Wire }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://reason.com/archives/2014/05/30/when-the-left-turned-against-f | last = Welch | first = Matt | website = [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] | title = When the Left Turned Against Free Speech | date = June 2014 | accessdate = 2018-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UCSB Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Michael Young, published a letter on the incident that was interpreted as a rebuke to both sides involved in the altercation.&lt;ref name="nexus"/&gt;
More than 30 professors from universities across the nation signed a letter of support for Miller-Young, describing her as a "gentle, brilliant mentor" who was a "victim of the cultural legacy of slavery"; she "fell victim to the graphic nature of the anti-abortion display [because] she [was] pregnant".&lt;ref name="fix"/&gt;
A column in the [[Los Angeles Times]] called Miller-Young a "sucker" who had walked into an obvious trap.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-ra-the-liberal-professor-antiabortion-trap-20140331-story.html | accessdate = 2018-05-03 | last = Abcarian | first = Robin | title = The liberal professor who stepped right into an anti-abortion trap | date = March 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nancy Hopkins Tier''' (May 16, 1909 – January 15, 1997) was an aviator. She was the president of the International Women's Air and Space Museum and a member of United Flying Octogenarians.

==Birth==
She was born as '''Nancy Hopkins''' on May 16, 1909 in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Her father was Alfred Francis Hopkins I (1879–1955) who was born in [[Wayne, Pennsylvania]] and worked as an antique salesman. Alfred was said to be related to the Hopkins family that started [[Johns Hopkins University]]; Alfred's father was from Maryland, and his mother from Maine. Nancy's mother was Anne DeWolf Gibson (1877–1963). Nancy had a brother, Alfred Francis Hopkins II (1914–1988), an illustrator, and two sisters, Frances and Betty. She was a niece of Lady [[Nancy Astor]] and her uncle, [[Charles Dana Gibson]] (1867–1944), was the creator of the [[Gibson Girl]].

==First flight==
In November 1927 she had her first flight from [[Hoover Field]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], and in 1929 she received limited commercial license #5889 at Roosevelt Field in New York. In 1930 she listed her occupation as "aviation air pilot". That same year her father was working as an "antique salesman" and her mother was not listed as living in the household.

==1930 National Air Tour==
In 1930 she entered the [[Women's Dixie Derby]],  2,000 mile air race from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, District of Columbia]]  to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She flew her Viking Kitty Hawk B4 biplane, NC30V. That same year she was one of four women in the 5,000-mile [[Ford National Reliability Air Tour]], and the only woman pilot.

==Marriage==
She married Irving Vanderroest Tier (1902–1978) on February 24, 1931 in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nancy Hopkins wed to Irving V. Tier.

==Recover from spin==
On a ride during the winter of 1931 her plane was in a flat spin and would have crashed. She climbed out of the cockpit preparing to parachute but her weight on the wing tilted the aircraft enough to take her out of the spin. She climbed back into the cockpit and regained control at 200 feet. This got her a job at Viking as a spokeswoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Woman pilot stops crash.

==Later years==
She joined the Connecticut [[Civil Air Patrol]] in 1942 and rose to the rank of Colonel.

==Death==
She died in [[Sharon, Connecticut]] on January 15, 1997.

[[Lieutenant General]] '''Nhial Deng Nhial''' is a [[South Sudan]]ese politician and a member of the ruling [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement|Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM)]]. He was appointed the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 26 August 2011 after having served as the caretaker [[Minister of Defense]] since 10 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sosanews.com/2011/07/13/the-newly-appointed-ministers-or-caretakers/  The Newly Appointed Ministers, 10 July 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that he served as the pre-independence South Sudanese Minister of SPLA and Veteran Affairs, from 22 December 2008 until 9 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/Nhial-Deng-Nhial-appointed,29650  Nhial Deng Nhial Appointed Minister for SPLA Affairs In December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Nhial Deng is a [[Dinka]] from the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] region of [[Southern Sudan]]. He is the son of the famous late leader [[William Deng Nhial]] who was assassinated in 1968 before the Addis Ababa Agreement was signed between [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] in [[Ethiopia]], in 1972. William Deng Nhial was as thoughtful as [[John Garang]] was. His son Nhial Deng Nhial did not join the movement as a member of an average Southern Sudanese family, he came from a home of a politician and was familiar with the grief of losing his father when he was young. He is a man of honor and he has committed his life to the liberation of South Sudan as a member of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement]] and of the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]. Nhial joined the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement|SPLA]] right after its inception in 1983. He was closely associated with the drafting and negotiation of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] between the [[Republic of Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]], which was signed in [[Naivasha]], [[Kenya]], in January 2005.

=== Education ===
Nhial Deng Nhial completed his early education at [[Comboni College]] in [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]]. He then entered the [[University of Khartoum]] to  study law. He graduated in the early 1980s with the degree of [[Bachelor of Laws]] ([[LLB]]), and earned a [[Doctor of Laws is a doctoral degree in law]]([[Juris Doctor|JD]]) degree from the [[University of Dundee]] in the [[UK]] in 2008. He is fluent in both [[English language|English]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. There are South Sudanese media reports, yet unconfirmed, that following the conclusion of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement|Naivasha Agreement]], Nhial Deng Nhial was slated to become the Sudanese Foreign Minister in the ''Government of National Unity''. However following the death of [[John Garang|Dr. John Garang]] in a plane crash in July 2005, Mr. Nhial refused entreaties to serve in Khartoum and opted to work in the nascent Government of [[Southern Sudan]] (GOSS).

== Role in the government of Southern Sudan ==
Nhial Deng Nhial was appointed [[Foreign minister|Minister of Regional Affairs]] in the [[Southern Sudanese]] cabinet in 2005 by [[Salva Kiir|President Salva Kiir]]. He however abruptly resigned from the cabinet less that six month later. There has been speculation as to what led to that resignation, with no clear reason being fronted.

In 2004, rumors soared across Southern Sudan that [[John Garang]] was planning to dismiss Salva Kiir as his deputy and replace him with Nhial Deng Nhial. However, at a meeting of SPLA top brass held in [[Rumbek]], in December 2004, one month before the signing of the CPA, Dr. Garang made it clear that those speculations were just that; only speculations, without any basis for truth.

In December 2008, Nhial Deng Nhial was appointed ''Minister of SPLA and Veterans Affairs'' by the then President of Southern Sudan, [[Salva Kiir]], replacing [[Dominic Dim Deng|General Dominic Dim Deng]] who died in a plane crash on 2 May 2008. He returned to the South Sudanese cabinet with the military rank of [[Lieutenant General]] in the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement|SPLA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/Nhial-Deng-Nhial-appointed,29650 Nhial Deng Nhial Rejoins Southern Sudan's Cabinet]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[independence]] of South Sudan on 9 July 2011, Nhial Deng Nhial was appointed Caretaker  Minister of Defense of the [[Republic of South Sudan]]. On 26 August 2011, President Salva Kiir Mayardit unveiled his long-awaited cabinet with Mr. Nhial Deng Nhial appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Republic of South Sudan.

He is a member of the SPLM's highest organ, the Political Bureau, and served as the leader of the SPLM delegation in Naivasha peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/ministries/splaaffairs.html Nhial Deng Nhial Is A High Ranking Party Official In the SPLM] {{webarchive|url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20110628170806/http://www.goss-online.org/magnoliaPublic/en/ministries/splaaffairs.html |date=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==
Seven-year-old Phillip Spaulding’s world would change forever in 1977 when his mother befriended Jackie Marler; only he wouldn't know it yet. The son of wealthy [[Alan Spaulding]] and Elizabeth Granville, Phillip had his every wish catered to and was exceptionally close to his mother. While his parents were going through a nasty divorce in 1978, Phillip was having chest pains and started receiving treatment from Dr. Justin Marler, Jackie's ex-husband. Phillip bonded with Justin and after his parents divorced, he encouraged his mother to marry Justin in 1979. At about the same time, Alan married Jackie. Phillip was content to have Justin and Jackie as stepparents and became close to both. However, in 1980, Justin and Jackie would divorce their prospective spouses and find love again with each other. In 1981, Elizabeth would unexpectedly leave Springfield for Switzerland and left Phillip in the care of the Marlers. Though confused as to why his mother left and why he was living with his "Aunt Jackie" and "Uncle Justin" instead of his father, Alan, Phillip accepted the situation and soon left Springfield to attend Lincoln Prep School. Late that year, while Phillip was on Christmas break from Lincoln Prep, he finally apologized to Mike Bauer about his treatment of Mike during the time Mike and Elizabeth were lovers.

Thrown out of Lincoln Prep School at 17 ([[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|SORAS]]), Phillip returned to Springfield in 1982 to attend Springfield High. He and Freddie [later calling himself Rick] Bauer became best friends when Phillip covered for Freddie after Freddie, who was driving with Phillip in his car, was pulled over for speeding and didn't have his driver's license. By this time, Jackie had died in a plane crash and Justin was seeing an Italian woman named Helena Manzini, a relationship Phillip disapproved of because he felt it was too soon after Jackie's death. Meanwhile, Phillip was hanging out with a rough crowd. When Phillip and Freddie were nearly involved in an accident, they realized perhaps the crowd they were hanging out with really weren't their friends and they stopped associating with them. Not long afterwards, Phillip met his first love, Melinda "Mindy" Sue Lewis, who in 1983, out of insecurity, staged a rather dramatic accident while riding her horse and was consequently hospitalized. During his visits to Mindy in the hospital, he developed a strong attraction to her roommate, [[Beth Raines]].

Both Phillip and Rick were attracted to Beth, but Phillip backed off and continued to endure Mindy's spoiled behavior in deference to Rick's attraction to Beth. At the senior prom Rick and Beth went together, as did Mindy and Phillip but it was Phillip and Beth who were named King and Queen. Finally on the night of Mindy's 18th birthday party at the Country Club, Phillip and Beth finally confessed their true feelings for each other in the stables. However, Beth's stepfather Bradley found them and shocked Phillip by telling him the truth about his parentage: Alan and Elizabeth weren't his real parents; the Marlers were. Apparently, Alan felt his wife was too fragile to handle the fact their baby was stillborn and he bought the child Jackie was giving up. After Phillip learned the truth, he was not only furious at Justin and Alan, but also at Mindy and Rick, who both knew the truth before he did and didn't tell him. Angry and hurt, Phillip told Rick he was in love with Beth. Though he had initially rejected both his fathers, Phillip, upon learning Justin was flying out of town, tracked him down at the airport and not only forgave him for keeping his parentage a secret, but also gave his blessing for Justin and Helena to marry.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"&gt;[http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gls-phillip-spaulding-timeline-0 GL's Phillip Spaulding Timeline | Soap Opera Digest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was at this point Beth was raped by Bradley. Ashamed of what happened, she told no one and rejected Phillip. Phillip turned to Mindy for comfort and she seduced him without using birth control. Alan was also relieved to see Phillip and Beth growing apart since as far as he was concerned Beth was from a lower class and didn't deserve his son. Beth soon moved into the boarding house to try to get away from Bradley, but he got a court order and forced her to return home. When Beth returned home, Phillip was waiting, and they jumped out of a window and ran away to New York.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"/&gt; After they had been running for a while they found themselves near Central Park and nearly out of money, Beth was working on some artistic sketches when both came upon a sidewalk Santa Claus (who preferred to be called Nick) who asked if they needed help. Though Phillip rudely tried to decline, Beth told the man they were nearly broke and had nowhere to stay and perhaps could not afford a hotel. Nick being the Good Samaritan he was, took pity on the young teenage couple and urged them to follow him through Central Park. Nick had led them to a place where he had led many people who were lost and homeless or poor or down on their luck. Nick turned them over to the others staying there and asked them to watch over Beth and Phillip. Eventually with Nick (Santa’s) help, Beth told Phillip about the rape. Phillip promised to protect her and they pledged to never let anything come between them again. Meanwhile, Mindy and Rick had raced to New York to find the pair and the four friends took odd jobs in order to survive and they enjoyed the sights and sounds of New York. Eventually, in January 1984, Bradley tracked them down and in order to evade him they dressed up as clowns and engaged in a mime act in the park. Bradley saw through their disguise and got in a violent struggle with Phillip in Central Park that ended when Bradley almost fell off a cliff. Beth and Phillip saved him though and warned him to back off. With Bradley apparently no longer a threat, Phillip and Beth returned to Springfield.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"/&gt;

Back in Springfield, Alan hired Bradley with the intent of transferring him out of town in order to separate Phillip and Beth. Meanwhile, Phillip’s Aunt Alex discovered Alan's schemes and revealed it to Phillip. Alex had become extremely protective of Phillip and Beth and when she found out about the rape, she made sure Bradley was arrested. At this time, Beth began to tutor Lujack, the leader of a street gang named the Galahads. Beth hoped this would help Lujack separate himself from his gang. But Darcy, Lujack's jealous girlfriend, had other ideas. Phillip was jealous but he and Beth still planned to marry. At the same time, Mindy was pregnant and told everyone Rick was the father. Then the day of Beth's wedding, Mindy's father, Billy, went to the church where Beth and Phillip were about to be married and confronted Mindy. He wanted to know if it was true the father of her baby was really Phillip. Beth overheard everything and at the altar she slapped Phillip and called off the wedding. Phillip wanted to be part of the baby's life. Mindy agreed but only if Phillip married her. Phillip married Mindy and they spent their honeymoon at Cross Creek. However the pair divorced after Mindy miscarried.

Once again, Phillip focused his attention on Beth, who by now was in love with Lujack. Feeling very rejected and angry, Phillip then discovered Lujack and Floyd Parker were turning the Galahads old garage into a night club. Phillip hired a crooked tradesman named Andy Ferris to sabotage the construction of the club but Andy went too far, and when the building blew up Beth was injured and blinded. Phillip felt very guilty but he could not bring himself to admit his wrongdoing so he enrolled Beth in a school for the blind. However, India von Halkein learned of the nightclub incident and threatened to tell Beth, thereby blackmailing her way into becoming his second wife. Phillip complied with India's demand but refused to consummate the union. However, when India started to notice Phillip and Beth renewing their friendship, she told Beth how Phillip had caused her blindness. Beth angrily rejected Phillip, but didn't tell Lujack the reason because she did not want to cause any more bad blood between them. At Lujack and Beth's engagement party in February 1985, Phillip, having grown to appreciate India's tenacity and wanting to gain control of Spaulding, announced India was pregnant (untrue, Phillip lied). Meanwhile, Lujack brought Andy to the party to play the blackmail tape and expose Phillip as the one who caused the accident. A scuffle over the tape occurred and Andy was shot and killed, and the tape was stolen. A lengthy murder mystery ensued with Lujack being erroneously convicted. By this time Phillip and India had consummated their marriage and India had faked a pregnancy test to make Phillip believe she was actually pregnant with his child. With the demands of the trial out of the way and Alex more determined than ever to run her out of town, India was more desperate than ever to cement her bond with Phillip. Conveniently an old family friend, Dr. Lyon, came visiting, and India employed the services of his never-fail love potion (sort of a gypsy version of Viagra). India began to mega-dose Phillip with the potion in hopes of making their previous baby announcement come true. But before India's desires came true, Phillip became ill from the potion and India was exposed for drugging Phillip. Eventually Beth convinced Phillip to come clean about his deal with Andy and they became friends again. Ironically the police didn't believe Phillip's story but by now plenty of people shared the suspicion India had murdered Andy. In the end, the real culprit turned out to be Floyd, who was holding India in a cabin where he forced her to sign a false confession. Luckily, Lujack and Beth eventually tracked them down and Floyd went to jail. Feeling a great deal of compassion for India, Phillip discovered they really did have a lot in common and agreed to remain married.

Still jealous of Phillip's relationship with Beth and mistakenly believing that Phillip was ready to end their marriage, India began an affair with Simon Hall and when Phillip caught them kissing in early 1986, he quickly divorced India. After Phillip wrote a novel based on his and Beth's love, he and Beth found their way back to one another since Lujack was by now deceased. The couple's lives would be forever changed when Beth began working at a local museum for a Professor Blackburn, who had gotten his hands on the cornerstone of the Von Halkein estate in Andorra. India knew it contained gold and tried to steal it back from him. But the Professor protected the cornerstone until his death. He knocked India unconscious, shot Phillip, and held Beth hostage on a boat in Stony Lake. Some time later Blackburn's dead body turned up, Beth's shoe and some fabric from her dress were found but she was nowhere to be found. Phillip was devastated and vowed to find her, but Alan fabricated some evidence to make it look like Beth was really dead.

In 1987, Phillip had a relationship with his assistant Chelsea Reardon and they investigated the black art scene.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"/&gt; During their investigation, Chelsea learned Alan was also involved in the black art market but only told her sister, Maureen about this since she feared bad blood between father and son. Though Alan secretly burnt down Phillip's house to stop the investigation, Phillip finally learned about it. When Chelsea and Jackson Freemont discovered Warren Andrews killed the head of the black art market, Paul Valère, Warren kidnapped them and Alan, but luckily Phillip saved them and Warren was arrested. Though Phillip was shot by Warren's hit man and left in critical condition, he survived with Rick's help. Chelsea then quit as Phillip's assistant and began to work for Alan at Spaulding while she and Phillip remained as lovers. There was just one problem. Phillip was still obsessed with the love of his life, the late Beth, and that made Chelsea frustrated. At this time, Jackson, noticing Chelsea's singing talent, became her business manager and began to vie with Phillip for her affections. When Chelsea realized they were fighting an old rivalry for Beth rather than a rivalry for her, she lost interest in both men. Phillip wrote her a letter telling her his true feelings for her, but Jackson intercepted it. When Chelsea found out about the letter, she and Phillip got back together and when Phillip forgave Chelsea for her affair with a married man in New York years ago they became engaged However, at this time Phillip was obsessed with wresting power away from Alan and sought the help of Alexandra and the Lewis's to help him. Finally, in 1988, when Chelsea (who wanted Phillip to reconcile with his father) found out about Phillip's plans to wrest control of Spaulding from Alan, she tried to warn Alan, and Phillip locked her up in the Towers. Disgusted, Chelsea bitterly broke up with Phillip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoltv.com/2009/09/14/guiding-light-top-10-moments-in-series-history/ 'Guiding Light': Top 10 Moments in Series History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after, Phillip had an affair with Rick's girlfriend, Meredith Reade after the couple had broken up. Distraught, Phillip agreed not to tell Rick about it and was genuinely relieved when the couple patched things up and got married. Later Meredith found herself pregnant and although Rick knew he wasn't the father, agreed to raise the child as his own without knowing whom the father was. Along came Blake Lindsey, Phillip’s PR-agent at Spaulding. Phillip fell in love with her but didn't know Blake was actually paid by Alan to spy on him. After Alex revealed Blake's schemes and her true identity as the daughter of presumed dead Roger Thorpe, Phillip bitterly left Blake but, later, he forgave her and the couple reconciled. Then tragedy struck in April 1989, when during the delivery of Meredith’s baby, Rick was forced to choose between Meredith’s life and that of the unborn child. Rick chose Meredith. Later, Rick learned from a letter from Alan that Phillip was the father. Though Phillip tried to explain it happened before the couple had married and after they had had temporarily broken up, Rick still felt betrayed and it took him a long time to forgive Phillip. Prior to Phillip and Blake's wedding, a series of accidents started occurring. The trouble came to a climax at their wedding when gunfire rang out and Phillip was shot! It was then that the truth came out: Alan was behind the accidents in order to keep Blake from marrying Phillip and accidentally shot Phillip after having a struggle with a very much alive Roger. While Roger was exposed to everyone, Alan wasn't exposed immediately as the shooter. Roger was first suspected but finally convinced Ross, Phillip and Alan-Michael of Alan's crimes so the three decided to trick Alan into walking again. While Alex was in Europe, Roger appeared into the Spaulding mansion and appeared to shoot Phillip and Alan-Michael. Shocked, Alan stood up from his wheelchair, was exposed of all crimes and went to jail. Immediately after his arrest Alan told Phillip he'd forged Beth's death certificate: there was no proof Beth was dead.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"/&gt;

Though Phillip tried to reassure Blake he was over Beth, he became convinced she was alive. Not long after, a man arrived in town claiming to have kidnapped Beth and demanded a $1 million ransom. Hoping it was true, Phillip paid the money only to learn he'd been lied to by Dana Jones and her lover, Bruce Daly. At this time Bradley was released from prison. Learning the plot, he confronted Dana's lover and was knocked unconscious. Though Phillip suspected Bradley of swindling him first, he later learned the truth. Though Daly was caught, he escaped, and the money (unknowingly pocketed by Roger) was never recovered. Meanwhile, Phillip was becoming obsessed with finding Beth. Unbeknownst to Phillip, Blake discovered an amnesiac and mute Beth was living with Spaulding employee Neil Everest just outside town. Fearing Phillip would leave her for Beth, when Blake learned Phillip had Beth's grave exhumed, she had him committed in the Willow Hills mental institution for his "delusions" about Beth. For Phillip, he seemed to prove Blake right when he reacted violently towards her. Both Gary Swanson and Neil were please with this development: Gary because Blake now had Phillip's power of attorney, and Neil, because the field was clear for him to marry Beth. Of course as with any plans devious, Blake's attempt to take over Phillip's life was about to hit major snags and fall apart and Neil contributed to it.

While Blake had Phillip committed for having defied a court order to exhume Beth Raines's grave, Neil decided to tell Beth about her past and accompanied her to Lillian's house. But, Beth, seeing her childhood home and remembering Bradley refused to go in and then ran away when she saw Bradley. Beth ran away to Clayton where the Willow Hills Sanitarium was and with her aphasia checked herself her into the sanitarium! Eventually, Phillip ended up seeing Beth, as did Lillian and Rick. Later, Blake tried to keep Phillip in Willow Hills, but Rick and Lillian told the court that Phillip was as sane as they were and he was released. But Blake still had his power of attorney. That was until Blake did one more really stupid thing in her plan to retain control. Phillip had the Spaulding mansion phones wired to monitor every call Blake took. Blake took a call from Neil about the upcoming marriage of him and Beth at the courthouse and Blake lied to Phillip saying the phone call was not from Neil! On Christmas Eve, Neil and Beth were about to marry, at the courthouse, with Blake in attendance, when Phillip and Rick on to Blake's plan crashed the ceremony and whisked Beth away! Although Beth tried to explain otherwise, Phillip was convinced Neil had been involved in Beth's kidnapping and fired him from Spaulding Enterprises. Phillip also found out Neil was suspected of causing the death of his wife and stepchildren in Pittsburgh, when the building they were in Neil had helped build collapsed. He also accused Neil of raping Beth! Neil's cause was not helped when WSPR-TV talk show host, Johnny Bauer accused Neil, over the holiday season, of being the mysterious person buying up property along Fifth Street for dubious ends. Determined to prove his innocence, on January 11, 1990, Neil helped Beth relive her kidnapping at the hands of Professor Blackburn. Beth recalled killing Blackburn when he tried to attack her, and she realized her aphasia stemmed from her lack of guilt over his death. At this point, Phillip found Neil and Beth and when the men began fighting, Beth finally spoke, yelling at them to stop.

As the year continued, Neil's true past came to light when he was able to prove the collapse was due not to his design, but to the faulty materials Spaulding had purchased. Grateful to Neil for helping Beth, Phillip voted for him to be rehired. Anxious to have a future with Beth, Phillip ended his calamitous marriage to Blake. She convinced Gary to spy on Phillip and Beth for her, hoping to get evidence of Phillip's unfaithfulness. A devious Gary agreed, and then tried to score points with Phillip by telling him Blake was having an affair. Despite her extracurricular activities with both Gary and Alan-Michael, Blake vehemently refused when Beth asked her to give Phillip an amicable divorce. Phillip asked Beth to marry him anyway. Not wanting to rush into anything, Beth said no, but their feelings ran deep and on Valentine's Day they made love. Meanwhile, one day in March, when Blake and Gary were rummaging through Neil's trailer to find a way to force Beth to stay with Neil, Beth caught them and after having a major verbal fight with Blake over Blake destroying some of her art sketches, Beth collapsed. When Gary and Blake took Beth to Cedars, they were all shocked to learn from Rick that Beth was pregnant! Beth assumed the baby was Neil's and told Phillip, who suggested they pass the child off as his. Unaware the baby really was Phillip's, Beth decided to be honest with Neil, but Blake, who stole Beth's file from the doctor’s office, told Neil before Beth could.! A furious Neil refused to allow Phillip to raise his child. In April, Beth was ecstatic when Dr. Sedgwick showed her a sonogram revealing her child had been conceived in February 1990, and not in December 1989, which meant the child was Phillip's! In the meantime, trying to get back on Alan-Michael's good side, Blake agreed to give Phillip a divorce, no strings attached. However, things were about to get very bad for Phillip. The day he was to meet Neil, Neil knocked him out and left him to die. As Neil was leaving up the stairs, a double-crossing Gary confronted Neil and pushed down a flight of stairs into the garage. Blake showed up to see Gary and Neil fighting, and Gary convinced her  Neil had to be subdued when he showed her the bomb Neil had set.

After tying up Neil, Blake saw Phillip also unconscious and was sure Gary had knocked him out. Blake then tricked Gary and was able to tie him up next to Neil. Blake called Roger who set Gary free. Meanwhile, Neil mumbled “Phillip”, leading Roger to suspect that was who hit him. Roger tried and failed to defuse the bomb and Neil died in the explosion. With the audiotape of Neil murmuring "Phillip" as the one who knocked him out, Phillip's wallet being found in the wreckage of the garage, and threats Phillip had made against Neil's life, this was all enough to get Phillip arrested for Neil's murder. Trying to avoid prosecution and find out who the real murderer was, Phillip faked his own death, stealing a corpse (with Rick's help) in order to do so. Phillip fled to the island of Capria, near Mexico, and was shocked to meet India there. He promised India his Spaulding stock if she would keep quiet about his being alive and went to Springfield to discover what happened to Beth since she didn't follow him out of town. After trying to get Phillip's assets from Alan and Alex, India finally gave up and helped Phillip. When Phillip returned to town, he was shocked to discover that Beth and Rick had married to throw the police off track. After Phillip threatened Gary whom he suspected was Neil's murderer, Gary paid a killer to kill Phillip. The plan failed and finally Det. A.C. Mallet and Roger discovered Gary was Neil's accomplice and murderer. At the same time, Phillip revealed himself alive after the birth of his daughter, Lizzie. Though innocent, Phillip, Beth and Rick were sentenced to perform community service out of town for fraud. After marrying in February 1991, Phillip and Beth moved to Arizona with Lizzie to carry out their community service.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest1"/&gt;

Over the next few years, Phillip avoided any contact with the Spauldings when suddenly in April 1996, Alex called him to ask him to attend Alan-Michael's wedding to Lucy Cooper in Orlando, Florida. Although Phillip told Alex he wouldn't come, he indeed had plans to attend the wedding to Beth's dismay. Phillip arrived early and exposed himself to only Rick and told him he had plans to find the one who had cost him five years of his life. Phillip had found out someone else was involved in the incident which left him accused of Neil’s murder. Gary had asked Phillip to visit him in prison where he gave him note that he had once found in Neil's trailer, which proved Neil had been paid by an "A. Spaulding" to get Phillip's fingerprints on the bomb. Although Rick advised him to drop his investigation, Phillip refused. During the wedding ceremony, Phillip wore a mask and when Alan was about to make a toast, Phillip stopped him and unmasked himself to the shock of all of the guests. Though Amanda, Alan and Alan-Michael weren't happy to see him, Phillip decided to return to Springfield anyway. While conducting his investigation, Phillip then visited Beth in Arizona but she left him for good since he’d refused to drop his vendetta and return home. Meanwhile, Alan-Michael was trying to prevent Phillip's return to Spaulding and, to set him up, he pretended to make up with his brother and tried to send him to a fake business trip to California so that he could spread lies about Phillip to the board. Phillip didn't leave but arrived during a board meeting to see Alan-Michael's actions against him. Not long after, Amanda exposed Alan-Michael as "A. Spaulding" through a letter from Neil to him. After Phillip asked Alan to support him during his fight against Alan-Michael Alan collapsed due to intense pain in his back and was rushed to Cedars. While recovering in his bed, he confessed to the family he was actually "A. Spaulding" and had hired Neil to set Phillip up since he had been disappointed in Phillip.

Furious, Phillip disowned Alan and later made up with Alan-Michael and made plans to move to New York. As for Alan, he was suffering from paralysis, and giving up, refused to attend physical therapy sessions. Although Phillip arranged for him to be transferred to a rehabilitation clinic, he could not be persuaded by Alan to stay in town.. However, Alan still would not admit the seriousness of his injury and refused to heed the doctor's warning he would have to relearn how to use his body. Phillip dropped by the clinic on his way out of town, where Alex tried to convince him of the seriousness of his father's injury. Though Phillip refused to visit Alan, he relented when Alex begged him to stay to see him. The doctor explained to Alan he had a long, arduous journey ahead of him. When Alex and Phillip entered his room, Alan ordered them to leave. Alex left, but Phillip stayed behind and when he saw how resistant Alan was to his physical therapy, Phillip told him how pathetic he was for giving up so easily and he still blamed him for ruining his life. Although Alan-Michael tried to convince Phillip to just leave town and write Alan off for good, Phillip found that he couldn't and remained, staying for a while at the Bauers. Not long after, Phillip was shocked to learn Rick was the father of one of Blake's babies! Although Phillip demanded Ross be told the truth, or else he'd do it, he found he couldn't hurt Ross like that and kept quiet. Meanwhile, Phillip's anger at Alan softened as he sympathized with Alan's physical condition. Knowing Alan was giving up on himself, Phillip and Alan-Michael concocted a plan with Roger and Amanda to make Alan think they were selling Alan’s company Advantage Systems to Roger with the hope Alan would get the urge to fight Roger and thus, get the urge to walk again. Their plan was a success. Meanwhile, after Lizzie had visited Phillip on Christmas, Phillip realized how much he missed Beth. It was too late because Lillian had given him divorce papers from Beth. At this time, Roger and Amanda plotted to take Spaulding over while the family tried to stop them. When Alan-Michael and Lucy left town, Phillip became president again.

That spring, Phillip was surprised to see his former sister-in-law, Harley Cooper at the Country Club masquerading as a woman named Starla. In the process of conducting the sting, Phillip and Harley started having feelings for one another which culminated into a kiss. Later, the pair left for New York to trap Jeffrey. Making it seem like "Starla" was going to get money from Phillip, the pair acted as though she was trying to seduce him, proving it by showing Jeffrey a surveillance tape of Phillip and Starla "making love". However, once the camera was shut off, the fake lovemaking became real as Phillip and Harley gave in to their passion. Later Phillip lied to Jeffrey stating he killed Harley during wild sex and when Jeffrey was ready to turn him to the police and to flee with Jenna, he was arrested for fraud when Harley and Jenna exposed him. Meanwhile, Harley and Phillip agreed to forget about happened that night and remain just friends. Then Harley and Jenna decided to join forces and began a detective agency. Their first assignment was to help Reva to find her long-lost sister. Not long after, Harley received a call from Mallet telling her he wanted a divorce since he was in love with another woman. Hurt and angry, Harley was consoled by Phillip. Meanwhile, Jenna and Harley learned Reva's nemesis, Annie Dutton, may have information on Reva's sister, and so they went to the mental hospital where Annie was staying. But when Security caught them snooping around, Jenna passed Harley off as her sister, Caitlin, and, to Harley's dismay, checked her into the mental institution. "Caitlin" then became Annie's roommate and apparently befriended her. Although Phillip tried to get Harley out of there, Harley was determined to follow through with the plan. Annie discovered who her new "friend" was and with help of the guards, drugged Harley with a psychotic drug. Luckily Phillip came to her rescue and admitted he too was falling in love with her.

Just then, Beth returned to town with Lizzie determined to win Phillip. Anxious to get Phillip back, Beth used Lizzie by getting her hopes up and having her lie that she wanted to stay at home rather than go with Phillip for the night. That same evening, Lizzie held up the mistletoe for the pair to kiss; as Phillip leaned in to kiss Beth's cheek, Beth turned and kissed him passionately on the lips. Later, Beth warned Harley she wanted Phillip back, to which Harley responded that would never happen. While pining for Phillip, Beth became friends with attorney Ben Warren, who was far from reputable. When Phillip warned Beth about how unscrupulous Ben was, she told him to mind his own business. However, Ben soon realized Beth was just using him to make Phillip jealous and offered to help. Later, to make Phillip jealous, Beth faked receiving a phone call from Ben, and made New Year's plans with him. Phillip made it known that he didn't want Ben in his house, but Beth said she will go out somewhere with him anyway. She got herself into more trouble by deciding to stay in Springfield and accept a job. Harley, meanwhile, wasn't happy to see Beth either, especially since she was insecure over Phillip's feelings for Beth. Her fears compounded when Phillip expressed his displeasure at Beth's new friendship with Ben Warren. Although Phillip tried to assure Harley his heart belonged to her, Harley couldn't quite be sure. in 1998, Phillip proved his love for Harley by asking her to move in with him. Elated, Harley accepted the offer but was still disconcerted over the bond Phillip and Beth shared. When Beth thanked Harley for finding a lost Lizzie, she antagonized Harley by telling her to give Phillip some time to be with his family and continued to provoke her by mentioning the phone call she made to Mallet. Angry, Harley attacked Beth but was pulled off by Eleni. To Harley's relief, Phillip wasn't angry but instead understood.

Their relationship took a step back when Beth attempted suicide by throwing herself in front of a car. Guilt-ridden, Phillip offered to stay at the mansion to take care of a rattled Lizzie. After overhearing Lizzie ask Phillip not to make her take care of her mommy alone, Harley got suspicious and starting investigating Beth's past in Arizona. In the process she learned Beth had accidents before. She also discovered Beth had a boyfriend in Arizona named Carl. Harley decided to find him in order to ask him about Beth. Learning she was being investigated, Beth blasted Harley, who remained undeterred. Finally, Beth admitted to Harley about her abusive relationship with Carl but left insulted when Harley continued to interrogate her. Beth then told Phillip about Carl and Harley’s meddling before Harley got to tell him her side of it. When Harley finally got to Phillip, he knew the whole story and yelled at Harley for interfering and jumped to Beth’s defense. Not long after, Carl, upon learning Harley was asking about him, arrived in town threatening Harley to stay out of his business. Although Carl denied hurting Beth, Harley is soon able to trick him into admitting it. Later, she convinced Beth to help her arrest Carl. Using Beth as bait, the plan was for Harley to tape record Carl admitting his abusiveness. Harley, realizing she forgot her gun, left the scene before Carl got there. When she returned, Carl was dead and Beth was the prime suspect. During the investigation, Harley became unnerved at Phillip's attempts to protect Beth, even going as far as him suppressing evidence. Later, when Beth confessed to killing Carl in self-defense, both Harley and Phillip were unconvinced and investigated further. They soon discovered the true killer was Phillip's daughter, Lizzie! Worried about Lizzie, Harley left Phillip so that he could be with his daughter in her time of need. But Phillip wouldn't have it and convinced Harley he could be with her and be a part of his daughter's life at the same time. When Phillip proposed, Harley happily accepted and the couple made plans to marry, however when the wedding plans seemed to get out of hand, the couple decided to elope in New York. However, to their surprise, their elopement wasn't quite the secret they thought it was and they found Buzz and Phillip's Aunt Alex arranged a beautiful wedding for them at City Hall.

Trouble began to brew again with the arrival of Harley's daughter Daisy, now called Susan, who was in search of her real mother now that her adoptive mother had died. In 1999, after telling Harley and Phillip her father had "changed" after her mother's death, Harley allowed Susan to stay the night at her place, to Phillip's disapproval. After calling Susan's father, Jim, Harley suggested they stay in Springfield for the holidays. Pleased to have a mother figure again, Susan was determined to fix Harley up with Jim and kept manipulating them to be alone together. Determined to stay in Springfield, Susan overdosed on medication. The plan worked with a guilt-ridden Harley wishing she could have seen the signs and suggesting that Susan should stay in town. However, Phillip disagreed and tried to encourage Harley to let go and allow Susan and Jim to go on with their lives. As Phillip and Harley continued to debate about Susan's presence in their lives, Harley learned she was pregnant.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest2"&gt;[http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gls-phillip-spaulding-timeline-page-3-0 GL's Phillip Spaulding Timeline Page 3 | Soap Opera Digest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After learning of Harley's pregnancy, a hurt Susan left Springfield to live with Jim but later corresponded with Harley by phone. Later, Susan called Harley asking for help after she shoplifted a dress, telling her she was at a strange bus station outside Springfield. So, Harley has arrived at the bus station outside of Springfield to collect Susan. While there, a creepy man who had been eyeing Susan turned his attention to Harley. The two of them struggled, and Harley managed to kick him in the groin. Meanwhile, Jim arrived and flattened the perpetrator. When Phillip showed up, he and Jim argued about Harley's involvement in Susan's life with Jim complaining Susan was envious of the life Phillip and Harley lead. Phillip offered to solve the problem by moving the two of them to Springfield and gave Jim a job at Spaulding. Harley was forced to mediate between Phillip and Jim who did not get along with Jim even ended up quitting Spaulding to work at Lewis Construction. However, Phillip continued to grate on Jim, and when Jim threatened to leave town, Harley convinced Phillip to give him a reason to stay. So, to please Harley, Phillip bribed Jim to stay (although by now Jim was dating Beth so he was already planning on staying anyway).

That summer, Harley finally gave birth to a son, who was named Alan Cooper Spaulding, with Harley deciding to nickname him "Zach" after the lead in Phillip's novel.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest2"/&gt; Things couldn't have been better when Harley and her new family agreed to join her best friend, Cassie Layne, and her new fiancé, Prince Richard for a Thanksgiving celebration in San Cristobel. After the celebration, Phillip, Beth and Jim were forced to leave early for business reasons, however, their plane crashed into the mountains. All three were o.k., but Jim opted to leave and brave the cold on his own in an attempt to bring help back. Believing that they were going to die, Phillip and Beth prepared a videotape to be made for Lizzie. Emotions high, they started reminiscing about the past and sought comfort in each other’s arms with the video still recording. After being rescued, both decided to keep their lovemaking a secret and go on with their separate lives.

In 2000, the unexpected happened: Beth found herself pregnant with Phillip's child. Convinced Phillip would leave Harley to marry her again, Beth told him about the child. When Phillip refused to marry her, she became afraid Jim would leave her and threatened to have an abortion if Phillip told anyone the child was his. And so worried about Beth's state of mind (as well as his own marriage), Phillip reluctantly agreed to keep the child's true paternity a secret while Beth married Jim, Phillip giving the bride away. Their tryst wasn't a complete secret: the missing video was found by Prince Edmund Winslow who used it to blackmail Phillip when Phillip threatened to fire him from Spaulding. Phillip’s hatred of Edmund wasn’t lost on Harley and when she demanded to know the cause, Rick covered by saying Edmund was blackmailing him. At the same time, the Spauldings were dismayed when Lizzie was diagnosed with leukemia.. With Lizzie's condition worsening, her only chance of surviving was a bone marrow transfusion from the baby Beth was carrying. When Jim refused to have his child delivered prematurely in order to save Lizzie, Phillip blurted out the horrible truth: the child Beth was carrying wasn't Jim's; it was his. In the end, Harley refused to forgive Phillip and asked for a divorce.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest2"/&gt;

At the same time, Jim died heroically in a fire at Christmastime. Almost immediately after, Beth accepted the friendship and support of Edmund. In 2001, against everyone's advice, Beth became his sole champion and encouraged him to secure the crown for himself when he discovered he was the true heir to the throne. Though Phillip tried to show Beth that Edmund couldn't be trusted by telling her Edmund was fixing the island's election, she went to Edmund who immediately used the information to his advantage and went to the press himself, calling the election invalid and declaring himself ruler of San Cristobel. Edmund had Richard arrested and Phillip talked his way past the prison guard and into Richard's cell. When the guard returned, Richard was gone and Phillip was in his place. When Edmund learned what Phillip had done, he had him shackled in the jail. Although Beth was able to save Phillip by convincing Edmund to simply deport him, Phillip told Beth he was seeking sole custody of their children to keep them away from Edmund. Phillip returned weeks later though when Beth asked that the children come for her and Edmund's coronation. Not long after the coronation, he married Beth who became his princess. Mere weeks later, Beth would learn everything people had been saying about Edmund was true when she learned he was holding Cassie captive! Confronted by Beth, a desperate Edmund locked her away but Beth was able to escape from the tower. Luckily, Phillip and Noah saw what Beth was doing and when she fell to the ground, Luckily, Beth was alright and returned to Springfield. After all those months of intrigue, Phillip returned to Springfield in time to see a very pregnant Harley. Instantly assuming she was pregnant with his child, Phillip railed at her that he was the last to know. On the defensive, Harley pointed out he had spent the better part of the winter consumed with Beth in San Cristobel and then informed him he was not the father of her baby. Weeks later, Phillip would be shocked to learn from Edmund just who was the baby's father: Rick.

Furious, Phillip accused Rick of doing this purposely to hurt him (out of revenge for what happened with Meredith Reade) and refused to forgive him. Not long after, Beth ran to Mexico to get a quickie divorce. Edmund caught up with her and again begged her to go back to him. But Beth refused and ran off. While trying to get away from Edmund, Beth was caught in a flash flood and presumed dead. That fall, Phillip was able to get testimony from two witnesses that Edmund had been chasing after Beth when she died, however, the point became moot when Beth suddenly turned up in Springfield alive! Though she claimed to be suffering from memory lapses, Phillip was increasingly suspicious of her strange behavior and personality change. Not long after Beth's return, Phillip learned Harley had Rick's baby, but refused to see the child. However, around Thanksgiving, when the pair was looking for a lost Lizzie and James, Phillip and Rick talked things over and resumed their friendship. Meanwhile, after doing some digging, in early 2002, Phillip learned the woman in town was an imposter named Lorelei Hills. Though Alan wanted her arrested, Phillip was afraid that would traumatize Lizzie and simply asked Lorelei to leave. Though Alan went against Phillip's wishes and had her arrested anyway, when she became ill, Phillip, against his better judgment, allowed her to be cared for at the mansion. The trouble was, she was now insisting she was Beth! Skeptical at first, the more time he spent with her the more he realized this was truly Beth Raines. Beth was the imposter! By the time Phillip realized this, Beth had left Springfield with Edmund! Tracking her down at an old silver mine, Phillip became trapped. Though Beth reasserted herself and raced to the mine to free Phillip, the mine entrance shut while she was inside, trapping them both. Edmund arrived, causing another split between Beth/Lorelei. Edmund accidentally trapped them in the mine a second time, but Beth managed to free Phillip and they found another exit. After getting Beth, who'd taken on the Lorelei personality to deal with her trauma, the help she needed, the pair reunited.

While Beth and Phillip reunited was a good idea in concept, the reality was more difficult. Phillip was cold and distant, confused by Beth's changes in personality while Beth was skittish and irritated by Phillip's pompous and patriarchal attitude in taking his son Zach away from Harley because of her relationship with Gus Aitoro. Frustrated by Beth, Phillip found himself susceptible to the charms of Olivia Spencer, Alan's fiancée. Then suddenly, a scandal rocked the household: Lorelei's diary was published! Though Beth immediately suspected Olivia, the publisher stated Lorelei had done the deed. Lizzie, Phillip, everyone, including Beth herself, blamed Beth. Confused, Beth went to Alan's lake cottage to clear her head, and ran into Bill Lewis. In an attempt to remember the past, she kissed him passionately. Phillip walked in at just that moment and railed out her. Later, Olivia told Phillip that it was Alan who published Lorelei's diary. To get revenge on Alan, the couple placed themselves on the bed, waiting for him to arrive. Once again they got carried away and began making out. Alan walked in, took one look at them, and had a heart attack. Later when Beth learned the circumstances of Alan's heart attack, she and Phillip agreed they had both changed far too much to be together, and gracefully parted ways.

Though now free, Phillip was too guilty over his father's heart attack and vowed to stay away from Olivia, who agreed to marry Alan as well as sign an extreme prenuptial agreement which said she would lose her half of the Beacon Hotel if she cheated before the wedding. But she and Phillip kissed in the elevator moments before the ceremony, and Alex pocketed the security tape. On Thanksgiving Day, Alexandra revealed Olivia had published Lorelei's Diary. Meanwhile, Alex eventually gave Olivia the security tape. Alan found the tape and saw Olivia and Phillip's smooch was right in front of his eyes. Alan threw her out of the house and into the cold, days before Christmas. Later, after finding out Alan faked his earlier heart attack, Phillip and Olivia saw no reason to deny their feelings now, they wildly made love. The couple's happiness didn't last long. Confused about whether to end her marriage, Olivia went out of town in early 2003 to visit her sister and clear her head. While away, she made her choice and sent Phillip a priority letter saying she wanted to be with him and for him to meet her at the Beacon. Alan intercepted the letter and kept it from Phillip. When Olivia arrived at the Beacon, Alan and not Phillip was there to greet her. Hurt and vulnerable, Olivia let herself be seduced by Alan only to have Phillip arrive at the Beacon the next morning and find the two together. Disgusted that she'd fall into Alan's arms so soon, Phillip walked away. When Olivia tried to explain the situation, Phillip revealed he never got the letter. Though the pair figured out Alan intercepted the letter, that didn't matter to Phillip who decided he'd be better off not chasing after his father's wife. However, when Olivia revealed to Phillip she was pregnant and the child might be his, Phillip agreed to stand by her no matter what. Meanwhile, Phillip swore off Spaulding but was pulled back into the company when Alex informed him Alan was acting erratically.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest2"/&gt;

Faced with a mentally disturbed Alan, Phillip agreed to come back to the company. Not long after, an angry but well Alan was termed innocent of Reva's stalking and informed Phillip he was handing control of Spaulding over to his real son—Gus Aitoro! In addition to his troubles with Alan, Alex's schemes to break up Olivia and Phillip seemed to work after Alex paid someone to doctor the paternity test Phillip had secretly done without Olivia's knowledge which showed Alan was the father. However, Olivia had had her own tests done which proved otherwise. Olivia couldn't forgive Phillip's mistrust and asked him to stay away from her. Weeks later, Olivia would fall down the stairs at the Beacon. Although she and the baby were okay, she refused to see Phillip. Later, Phillip was shocked to learn she thought Lizzie was responsible for her fall. Incredulous, Phillip was dismayed to learn Beth and Lillian shared the fear and spirited the girl away to a cabin without his knowledge. In denial for months over Lizzie's emotional state, Phillip was later horrified when Lizzie threatened to kill herself after being confronted by Beth and Lillian. Though Harley was able to defuse the situation and bring Lizzie home, Phillip finally realized his daughter needed help. The situation with Lizzie brought Phillip to the breaking point and he began making plans for his soon-to-be-born daughter and suffering from panic attacks. Though an anxious Phillip tried to convince Olivia to marry him, she saw he was only asking because he wanted to provide a home for the child she was carrying, not because he loved her. Not long after she gave Phillip a non-answer to his marriage proposal, things finally came to a head with Lizzie. The night of Olivia's baby shower, Lizzie sneaked out of the house on the pretense of giving Olivia a gift. When a frightened Olivia refused the gift and asked Lizzie to leave, Lizzie continued to push the gift on Olivia and finally was escorted home by Christopher. That night, Olivia found something in her baby crib—a doll's head. Though Lizzie tried to deny it and pleaded with her family to believe her, she was unable to convince her family of her innocence.

A horrified Olivia decided she had to get as far away from Lizzie as possible and left Springfield. Convinced he was a horrible father because he couldn't help Lizzie, Phillip's mental state would only get worse. Though agreeing to check himself into Cedars in order to have tests done, Phillip discharged himself early after doctors said there was nothing physically wrong with him. However, those close to Phillip could tell there was something seriously wrong. Phillip finally lost his grip on reality, seeing visions of Olivia everywhere. Finally, Phillip began stalking a pregnant woman and broke into her home, thinking she was Olivia. After that incident, Phillip's family decided to arrange an intervention, the same as they had with Lizzie, in order to convince Phillip to get himself help. By now Phillip had grown increasingly paranoid and delusional, but when he realized that his deteriorating condition was scaring Lizzie, Phillip agreed to go to the hospital for tests. After seeing yet another vision of Olivia (though unbeknownst to him, this one was real), Phillip checked himself into Ravenwood Mental Hospital. By now the family knew Olivia was in town, and believing she could help Phillip, they persuaded her to visit him. Phillip's condition had worsened greatly and unsure of his own sanity, he tried to strangle Olivia, thinking she was an hallucination. Unnerved, days later Olivia returned and told Phillip why she'd come back—their baby had died. Instead of the truth snapping Phillip back into reality, it only made him draw deeper into himself, becoming almost catatonic, and to Olivia's horror Phillip started blaming himself.

As time went by, Phillip seemed trapped in his shell, unaware of what was going on around him. Then in January 2004, his condition seemed to improve somewhat. Although he remained silent, he started responding to people. Meanwhile, Olivia hurriedly got a minister to marry her and Phillip at the institution. Olivia's position as Phillip's wife secure, she set out to solidify her power base at Spaulding and more by having Phillip change his will. Meanwhile, she kept a firm hold on Phillip, limiting his visitors, and often answering questions posed to Phillip herself. Finally, weeks later, Phillip received a shock when Olivia showed Phillip their daughter, Emma, who hadn't died after all. Although Phillip agreed to Olivia's demand of telling no one of Emma's existence, in order to protect the child from Lizzie, in private a vengeful Phillip vowed to make Olivia pay and take the child from her. For Olivia, Phillip proved to be a loose cannon and revealed to others Emma was alive. Although Beth and Rick dismissed Phillip's claims as denial, Lizzie was very suspicious and eventually presented Emma to Phillip.. Soon after, Phillip decided he had to take drastic measures to get his life back on track and, on Rick's recommendation, he underwent ECT therapy. Meanwhile, Phillip and Olivia started playing a dangerous game with each other, with Olivia playing the concerned, dutiful wife and with Phillip physically intimidating her. Finally after weeks of therapy, Phillip was released from the hospital and returned home where he and Olivia continued their cat and mouse game. Although Alan suggested Phillip simply get rid of Olivia, Phillip had something devious in mind for his wife. His plan was to frame her for the Antimonious drug scandal that Spaulding was being investigated for. Phillip's plan was foiled with the Feds dropped the investigation before they discovered the evidence. Not long after Phillip got his revenge on Olivia by blackmailing her with the knowledge she had illegally purchased Spaulding stock. With the choice between prison and staying married, Olivia was forced to bow down to Phillip's wishes. cold and calculating, Phillip to set out to embarrass Olivia and keep her under his thumb. In addition, he had Olivia trailed and cut off access to her bank accounts, in the event she'd try to leave. For his final act of revenge, he demanded Olivia resign from Spaulding, giving her a prepared speech on what to say. Finally, on the day of Harley's almost wedding to Gus, Phillip finally gave Olivia what she wanted—a divorce.&lt;ref name="soapoperadigest2"/&gt;

That was the only good thing that would happen that day. For on that day, Harley discovered not only was Alexandra an accomplice in the Antimonious drug deal, but Gus knew. In short order, Harley called the wedding off, Frank (framed for the crime) held a gun on Alan, and Buzz turned Alex in to the police. Seeing a grave injustice to his family, Phillip went after the Coopers, specifically Company. Deciding to rebuild the city of Springfield, Phillip, in a cold and calculating manner worthy of Alan, went through the government and secured permission to go forth with his plans. When Harley and Buzz learned who was behind the takeover of Company, they were furious. However, Phillip remained cold and unapologetic stating it was just business and offered to compensate Buzz fairly. But Buzz refused to give up and decided to fight. Phillip refused to make it easy on the Coopers, visiting Company at every turn and basically rubbing salt in the wound. However, the Coopers weren't the only family Phillip was after. In order to create his own version of Springfield, Phillip needed to acquire more property and made it appear as if he wanted to take over Cross Creek in order to distract them from their other properties. Meanwhile, very soon after, Phillip overheard Bill pleading with one of his employees, to reconsider resigning. Impressed with this middle-aged woman, named Ruth Karloff, Phillip interviewed her and found her to be no-nonsense, efficient and loyal and he hired her as his personal assistant. As the days went by, Phillip was growing more and more callous with each passing day. When he learned Lizzie had drugged her boyfriend, Joey Lupo, he inexplicably took Lizzie's side and blackmailed Joey into leaving town by threatening to foreclose on Mrs. Lupo's house. Days later, Phillip was enraged when his plans for Company were foiled when it was discovered the area was a nesting place for a rare bird. Angry that he'd lost, Phillip vindictively tore down Harley's house. Phillip's malice towards the Coopers wasn't lost on Zach, who distanced himself from Phillip. Although the Coopers denied it, Phillip was certain they were poisoning Zach's mind against him. In the meantime, Lizzie was having her own problems and confessed to Phillip she believed she'd hit Sandy Foster with her car. Desperate to protect his daughter, Phillip urged her to keep quiet while he took care of everything. Meanwhile, Phillip was becoming paranoid that someone at Spaulding was working against him and asked Gus to run a background check on all key employees. In the meantime, Gus was becoming concerned the mole was actually Ruth, Phillip's now trusted assistant. Phillip expressed his doubts.

When Ruth began asking questions about the hit and run, he quickly realized Gus was right and decided Ruth needed to be neutralized to protect Lizzie. To accomplish this, he arranged for a man to run Ruth down! His plan failed however, when Gus ended up saving her life. In the midst of all this, Phillip's diabolical behavior concerned everyone, including those closest to him. In an effort to get through to Phillip, Rick arranged for Phillip to be kidnapped so they could talk. Although Rick tried reasoning, he only succeeded in making Phillip angry. That same day, Phillip learned something startling from Zach—Ruth was Harley in disguise! Still dealing with that revelation, Phillip was shocked to learn Lizzie was at the police station, about to confess to the hit and run! Although he tried to demand she keep quiet, Lizzie openly defied her father and admitted the truth. Believing everyone was against him, Phillip decided to leave Springfield with the only people he cared about—his children. After luring all the children to his private jet, Phillip informed everyone he had the children. Harley attempted to appeal to the human side of him, but to no avail. Not long after, Phillip arranged for Lizzie to be brought to him, however when she refused to go with him, he became enraged and vowed to destroy the people who have cost him his daughter's love. That same night, he asked several people to meet him at Company at 9&amp;nbsp;pm, telling each person if they came, and told no one else of the meeting, their children would be returned to them. At 9&amp;nbsp;pm, various citizens of Springfield converged at Company to find Phillip shot. Although he was rushed to the hospital, it was too late and Phillip was declared dead.

After a short investigation, Harley was arrested, and the spring of 2005, convicted of Phillip's murder. Months after her conviction, Phillip's real shooter was revealed—it was Alan. However, that wasn't the end of the story. Having been revealed to be Phillip's killer, Alan knew he had to leave town and paid a visit to an abandoned warehouse where he met with none other than Phillip. Apparently Alan's concerns about Phillip's state of mind caused him to take drastic action in order to protect his son and his grandchildren: he shot Phillip and faked his death. Unknown to everyone else in Springfield, a completely delusional Phillip was living out his life as CEO of Spaulding in an abandoned warehouse office made to look like his Spaulding office. When Alan was arrested no one believed his story about Philip being alive. Not only that, but the medical staff stopped looking after Phillip because Alan couldn’t pay. Phillip disappeared and later called Rick, stating he needed his help. Despite Rick's reluctance, Phillip pleaded with his friend to keep his situation a secret. Phillip was almost discovered by Mallet the day Harley married Gus but managed to escape. Meanwhile, frantic that a mentally disturbed Phillip was a danger to himself as well as to others, Alan went to desperate lengths to lure him into the open. To draw Phillip out, Alan married none other than Beth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/phillip-spauldi.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708161250/http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/phillip-spauldi.shtml |archivedate=July 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Spring of 2006, Phillip’s Uncle Ross was apparently killed when his plane went down on the way to San Gabriel. After some investigating, Harley learned Alan was telling the truth—Phillip was alive .Rick confirmed it and admitted Ross suspected the truth and set out to find him. Determined not to be found, Phillip asked Rick to have the plane sabotaged so Ross couldn’t take off. Tragically, the plane went up anyway and Ross was killed. In late 2007, the specter of Phillip continued to loom over Springfield. It started at Emma’s seventh birthday party where she received a gift apparently from her father. Panicked, Olivia went to Alan for protection, unaware it was Alan who sent the gift as a way to manipulate Olivia into helping him. When Olivia tried to bow out, Alan upped the ante by hiring someone to break into her room and trash it. Not long after, Alan unexpectedly hired Harley to find Phillip. Though distressed at the thought of him returning, Harley decided it might be best to know his whereabouts and took the case. It didn't take long to learn Beth had received a gift from Phillip for her unborn baby. However, it came from a courier and she had no clue where Phillip was. At one point, Phillip sent Harley a card telling her to stop looking for him; she’ll see him when he is ready. Afterwards, Harley spotted Zach’s new sneakers and the boy was forced to admit they came from Phillip. Told Phillip would be at his ballgame, Harley and her partner Cyrus Foley waited and Cyrus tackled a hooded man they thought was Phillip. It was Remy who claimed to have run into Phillip after losing some gambling money in Clayton. Remy claimed Phillip paid him to deliver this package (which contained Phillip’s old high school sports jersey) to Zach. Remy told the duo he didn’t know where Phillip was, but doubted he was returning to town.

Sometime later, [[Bill Lewis III|Bill Lewis]] became involved with Lizzie, and was falsely accused of being responsible for Lizzie's kidnapping (orchestrated by [[Dinah Marler]] and executed by [[Grady Foley]]). Despite her insistence that she believed Bill was not responsible for her kidnapping, Lizzie's faith in Bill began to wain and she slowly turned into Alan's pawn, distancing herself from Bill. In an effort to make Lizzie see reason, Bill (along with his father, [[Billy Lewis II|Billy]]), set out to find Phillip in an effort to get him to help her. Bill was unsuccessful in his search, but things would work out in a way he never expected.

On February 9, 2009, in an effort to prevent Beth from marrying Alan, [[Henry Cooper Bradshaw|Coop Bradshaw]] was involved in a car accident on his way to the church. Badly injured, Coop was pulled from the wreckage by Phillip. In the following episode, Phillip spoke with Alan alone, at Phillip's mock grave site. He then pulled a gun on Alan, but told him he had no intention of shooting him. He even thanked Alan for straightening him out during his time of mental illness. Later that day, he stopped an enraged Buzz Cooper from physically attacking Alan.

Phillip's return jolted the entire Spaulding family, and they barely had time to adjust when Beth's and Phillip's 19-year-old son, James, returned from boarding school. James was running a Ponzi scheme and even when Phillip helped clear the charges against him, he resented Phillip's return. Beth was torn between the love of her life and the son who had only known the worst of his father. During this time Beth also helped her daughter Lizzie marry Bill Lewis.

Eventually, Phillip learned he was dying. He didn't tell anyone, aside from Lillian, and tried to repair the relationships in his life with the time he had left.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112816770 'Guiding Light' Extinguished After 72 Years On Air : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Beth found out in what were supposed to be Phillip's last days, and she felt devastated as well as betrayed by Phillip and by her mother. Fortunately for Phillip, Alan agreed to a bone marrow transplant, and saved his son's life, but a few days later, Alan quietly died after attending the double wedding of Lillian and Buzz Cooper and Vanessa Chamberlain and Billy Lewis. Beth was forced to break the news to her young daughter Peyton. Shortly before Alan's death, Phillip had proposed to Beth, and she had happily accepted. James and Phillip were now reconciled and Lizzie was trying for a baby. Beth also decided to return to her first love, drawing. A year later, Beth and Phillip were happily married, and were celebrating the upcoming nuptials of their best friends Rick and Mindy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welovesoaps.net/2009/09/guiding-light-finale.html We Love Soaps: The GUIDING LIGHT Finale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:India Goa PratapNaikSJ.jpg|260px|right|thumb|Pratap Naik, S.J., at the TSKK, Goa, India]]
'''Fr. Pratap Naik, S.J.,''' is a [[Jesuit]] [[priest]] from [[Goa]], India.  He is the director of the [[Thomas Stephens Konkkni Kendr]] (TSKK), a research institute working on issues related to the [[Konkani language]], literature, culture and education. The institute is based in Alto Porvorim, on the outskirts of the state capital of [[Panaji]], Goa.

== Founding of the TSKK ==
Naik was one of the proponents for founding the TSKK. The proposal to do so was brought up before the provincial congregation (one of the official bodies of the Jesuits) in 1978. "We wanted to start a school, in the European sense. An institute of higher learning to teach Konkani to Jesuits (primarily and to others too)," according to Naik, who was then a young scholastic trained to take up this work.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

TSKK is named after [[Thomas Stephens (Jesuit)|Thomas Stephens]], the 16th century [[English people|English]] Jesuit [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] [[missionary]] who came to Goa in 1579 and lived in the region till his death. Stevens authored the ''[[Arte da lingoa Canarim]]'', which was written in Portuguese, and was the first printed grammar of what is now called the Konkani language

In 1982 TSKK was registered as a society, and it commenced operation in January 1986 from its former premises at Loyola Hall in [[Miramar, Panaji|Miramar]], Goa. Miramar itself is a centre for training young men wanting to become Jesuit priests.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== On the activities of the TSKK ==
The TSKK focuses on education and research of the Konkani language, literature and culture. Speaking about the professional activities of the TSKK, Pratap Naik has said, "We are not limiting ourselves only to Goa, but wherever Konkani is spoken. Shortly, we are going to study Siddi Konkani, spoken by a community of former slaves who were once located in Goa, and are now based in Yellapur in Konkani [sic]. For this we are collaborating with two Brazilian professors."

A large number of [[expatriate]]s whose [[first language|mother tongue]] was once Konkani are located outside of the Konkani-speaking regions of India. Regarding the creation of opportunities to educate members of such expatriate communities, Naik says: "It's a bit difficult. Distance education is more for information. Learning certain language skills has to be done through intensive contact programs. Short courses could be offered to attain language proficiency."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Training for scholastics ==
Since 1986, Jesuit scholastics training to become priests were sent for a one-month training in Konkani.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In 2003, a Konkani [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] diploma course was proposed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Roman script issue ==
In 2006, Naik was involved a campaign to get official recognition for the [[Roman script]] of Konkani, along with the [[Devanagari]] script, which is the sole officially recognized script for Konkani in Goa.&lt;ref name = "script_hindu"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Special Correspondent | first =  | title = Konkani script row may snowball into a major issue | work = The Hindu | publisher = Narasimhan Ram | date = 12 February 2006 | url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/12/stories/2006021202660300.htm | accessdate = 12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After training as a painter and a sculptor, he became a yoga student of [[Sri Aurobindo]] and lived for many years in [[Puducherry]], where he was a founding member of [[Auroville]].&lt;ref name=Deborah/&gt; In India, he discovered the works of the French Egyptologist and esotericist, [[R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz]], which led him to explore the principles and practices of ancient sacred science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindisfarne.org/detail.html?id=0940262630 ''Homage to Pythagoras''], [[Lindisfarne Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1965-8, Robert met his wife, [[Deborah Lawlor]]. In 1972, they left Auroville for a year so Robert could study [[sacred geometry]] and read Sri Aurobindo. They came back to Auroville in 1973 until 1975.&lt;ref name=Deborah/&gt;

In 1979, Lawlor (then living in [[Tasmania]]) participated in the [[Lindisfarne Fellows Conference]], held at Zen Center's [[Green Gulch Farm]], with [[Keith Critchlow]] from [[London]]. In 1980, Lawlor met together with [[William Irwin Thompson]] and [[Rachel Fletcher]] to teach in the [[Lindisfarne Institute]]'s Summer Program in Sacred Architecture, which provided the context for the design and building of the Lindisfarne Chapel. Critchlow's ''Twelve Criteria for Sacred Architecture'' derives from a lecture given at this time. In 1981, a gathering of about 50 members of the [[Lindisfarne Association]] met in [[Crestone, Colorado]] under the name, ''Homage to [[Pythagoras]]'', which included Lawlor, Thompson, Fletcher, Chritchlow, [[Christopher Bamford]], [[Arthur Zajonc]], [[Anne Macaulay]], [[Kathleen Raine]], [[Robert Bly]], [[Joscelyn Godwin]], [[John Michell]], and [[Ernest McClain]].&lt;ref&gt;''Homage to Pythagoras: Rediscovering Sacred Science'', [[Christopher Bamford]], 1994, {{ISBN|0-940262-63-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mojabi was arrested twice by [[SAVAK]] in 1963, and following his release left Iran to study and later work in France for 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=بخش الحاقی|url=http://www.iran-interlink.org/userfiles/File/mojahedinhistory/3-10.pdf|publisher=Iran Interlink|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Iranian revolution]] he would return to Iran where he would work at his alma mater, [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] (formerly Tehran Polytechnic), as a professor of civil engineering.

== Early life and education ==
Mojabi was born in 1939 into a religious and cultured [[Mojabi|family]] in [[Qazvin]]. His father Seyed Ziaedin was a well-known merchant in the [[Caravanserai of Sa'd al-Saltaneh]]. In 1949, Mojabi's father moved the family to Tehran. The family's residence was in [[Baharestan]] Square which in the 1940s and 1950s was the epicentre of political activities. In those years Shamseddin began his political activity in the Third Force, and later in the neighbourhoods committee of the [[National Resistance Movement of Iran|National Resistance Movement]].

Mojabi studied at the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Funun]], where he gained a diploma in Mathematics. After gaining his diploma, he went to Teacher Training College, and in 1957 and 1958 was employed by the Ministry of Culture as an elementary school teacher. In 1959, Mojabi ranked first nationally in the [[Iranian University Entrance Exam|Concours]] for civil engineering, and won a place at [[Amirkabir University of Technology|Tehran Polytechnic]]. At university, he met Dr. Abbas Sheibani and Morteza Hajizadeh and continued his political activities. In this period the [[Freedom Movement of Iran|Freedom Movement]] of Iranian Students became active, and his interest and familiarity with political issues led to him joining the movement's Political Committee, led by Rahim Ataei.

== Political activism and arrest ==
At Tehran Polytechnic, as Mojabi was the valedictorian certain teaching responsibilities were passed to him, and he would use university facilities to distribute Imam Khomeini's announcements. The Political Committee of the Freedom Movement, whose job was to check the news and political information, had a meeting at on 22 May 1963. The meeting for the first time took place at the house of [[Ahmad Sayyed Javadi]], who at that time was the Prosecutor of Tehran. Individuals including Saeed Mohsen, Mohammad Hanifnejad, and Mohammad Mehdi Jafari were present at the meeting. Jafari had contacts within the nomadic tribes of Southern Iran, and in March and April 1963, he visited southern Iran on various occasions. For SAVAK, who were observing him, this was suspicious. On the night of the meeting Jafari returned from the South, and SAVAK agents followed him. At midnight the house was sieged and all the participants were taken to SAVAK's detention centre in Tehran. 12 people were arrested, and Mojabi was amongst them.

While in prison Mojabi suffered from heart problems but owing to the presence of fellow inmates Dr. Sheibani and Dr. Azar, his friends ensured his health did not deteriorate. At the same time, [[John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated. Using this opportunity, Mojabi and others sent a protest letter to the police chiefs stating, "if we are to be executed, then execute us now, if you have no intentions with us, then free us so we can continue with our education". After some time the prisoners were released by the Tehran Prosecutor on the condition they did not leave the country. Some of the leaders of the Freedom Movement were released, but soon after were under arrest again. After his release he returned to Tehran Polytechnic and completed his studies. Upon graduation, with the intervention of [[Ali Akbar Moinfar]], Mojabi was brought into the Engineering Ministry Program, later renamed the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (Iran)|Ministry of Housing]].

== Life in France ==
[[File:Institut Henri Poincaré - UMS 839.jpg|thumb|vignette|upright=1.30|The Institut Henri Poincaré, where Mojabi studied as a postgraduate.]]
Mojabi initially travelled to London to have heart surgery, and to enrol at a university. There Mojabi managed to find a heart specialist who could carry out the operation, however as the operation in the UK was very costly, Mojabi travelled to Paris.

Mojabi enrolled at the [[Sorbonne]] in the Faculty of Sciences at the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]], and became engrossed in his studies. In France he was able to use his previously unused insurance premiums for pay for his hospital costs. For 9 months, until August 1965 Mojabi remained in hospital. Whilst in hospital he studied and following his release passed two pre-doctorate diplomas in [[Applied Mechanics]] and [[Thermodynamics]]. This allowed Mojabi to enrol in the doctorate program. After 3 years, Mojabi completed a doctorate with a "[[Très honorable avec félicitations]]" distinction in 1967, with a PhD entitled "Buckling of reinforced concrete columns hinged at both ends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flambement des poteaux en béton armé articulés aux deux extrémités|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/flambement-des-poteaux-en-beton-arme-articules-aux-deux-extremites/oclc/60316705|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his studies, the [[International Federation for Structural Concrete|Comité Euro-International du Béton]] (CEB), which his university professors had recommended him for, hired him. There the President of the organisation, Professor Jacques-Ramsay Robinson, noticed his abilities and they began to work together.

In France, Mojabi was one of the leaders of the Union of Islamic Students Association in Europe – and was active in this group alongside [[Hassan Habibi]], [[Sadeq Tabatabaei]], Javad Ezhei, [[Karim Khodapanahi]] and [[Abolhassan Banisadr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=اتحادیه انجمن‌ های اسلامی دانشجویان در اروپا|url=http://mobareze.ir/news/4107.html|publisher=Mobareze|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the formation of the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] Mojabi was familiar with some of the founders and cooperated with the organisation. However, although he had a deep knowledge regarding [[Marxism–Leninism]], soon he noticed changes in the MKO's ideology and through discussions over Islamic thought realised that they had an intellectual diversion. So much so that according to the writings of MKO members in France, Mojabi had "maintained strong religious beliefs", and believed that there must be "moral standards" in politics. For this reason, he distanced himself from that organisation and upon the arrival of Imam Khomeini to Paris he advised him during his stay in [[Neauphle-le-Château]] and supported his opposition movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مجاهدین از پیدایی تا فرجام|url=http://irandidban.com/fa/print-8394|publisher=Iran Didban|accessdate=26 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040025/http://irandidban.com/fa/print-8394|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=شهيدان مجابي: آرزويمان شهادت در راه امام حسين (ع) است|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8810010713|website=farsnews.com|publisher=Fars News|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mojabi, in addition to [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], [[Sadegh Ghotbzadeh]], [[Mozaffar Firouz]], Ahmad Ghazanfarpour were a group of Iranian residents in France who advised Khomeini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=پیشنهاد سازمان اطلاعاتی فرانسه برای ترور امام خمینی|url=http://revolution.pchi.ir/show.php?page=contents&amp;id=6307|publisher=Political Studies and Research Institute|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to Iran ==
With the return of Mojabi to Iran in 1978, a new chapter in his life commenced. In this period he returned to academia, and after 14 years away from his homeland became familiar once again with the political and social issues of Iran.	In late May 1978 with the order of [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] and with the excuse of the [[Iranian Cultural Revolution|Cultural Revolution]] universities in Iran were suspended and Mojabi returned to Paris with his wife and children and did not return until October 1979. After returning to Iran and the reopening of universities, and whilst working at the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC), Mojabi continued teaching in the universities.

Following the revolution, Mojabi attempted to run for candidacy for the Qazvin seat of the [[Iranian legislative election, 1980|1980 Iranian legislative election]], however as an Independent candidate lacked the institutional support of other candidates.

Later, during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], Mojabi would play a vital role in working for the NIOC, and for the [[Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (Iran)|Ministry of Defence]] where under the direction of [[Akbar Torkan]], Mojabi was involved in projects such as the design of underground hospitals and other defence structures or military buildings. This included the design of the [[Al-Faw]] Hospital, which despite 6 months of continuous bombing went undamaged.&lt;ref name="goodbook.blogfa.com" /&gt;

[[File:Dr. Kopácsi Sándor (5).JPG|thumb|225px|Commemorative plaque of Sándor Kopácsi in Budapest District VIII, Corvin Alley No 1 (Corvin Movie Theater)]]
'''Sándor Kopácsi''' (March 5, 1922, [[Miskolc]] – March 2, 2001, Toronto) was a participant in, and chronicler of, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].

==Early career==
He began his professional life as a metalworker, as did his father and grandfather. In 1944, he fought with the resistance movement organized by '''MOKÁN''' (in English, the Anti-Nazi Committee of Hungarian Communists). After the war, many of its members (including Kopácsi) were enlisted to help form the nation's new police force. After a posting to Budapest in 1949, he was appointed Director of Internment Affairs in the Interior Ministry. Despite the impressive title, he was not allowed to do much more than manage paperwork relating to the labor camps. When he attempted to exercise his authority on behalf of the prisoners, he was dismissed and sent to a Party school for re-training. In 1952, he became the Police Chief of Budapest. At that time the Police Department was effectively a branch of '''ÁVH''' (the [[State Protection Authority]]). According to Kopácsi, more policemen were arrested than criminals, so he set about to make the Department more independent. A year later, he was elected to the Hungarian Parliament where he soon became part of the reform movement led by [[Imre Nagy]].

==The Revolution &amp; After==
After the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956, Kopácsi spoke out openly, at a police party meeting, against [[Mátyás Rákosi]]. Influenced by events during the [[Poznań]] workers' uprising, he and several others announced at a meeting of high-ranking army and police officers that they would not fire on the people. On October 31, 1956, Kopácsi was included in the executive committee of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|HSWP]], charged with preparing for the first congress. He won the confidence of the insurgent groups during the revolution, and on November 3, he was elected deputy commander of the national guard, at a meeting of special forces at the Kilián Barracks (9th District). His plan, at talks with Imre Nagy, was for the rebels to be disarmed after the fighting had ceased. On November 5, 1956, he was arrested by [[Ivan Serov]], the head of the [[KGB]]. Placed on trial with Nagy and his associates, Kopácsi was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Supreme Court on June 15, 1958, but freed in the 1963 amnesty. From 1963 to 1965, he worked as a turner in the telephone factory, but then he found a job in [[Solymár]] (Pest County) as a technical officer. In 1969, he obtained permission to complete his university studies, but on receiving his law degree, he failed to find a job to match his qualifications. In 1975, he emigrated with his wife to Canada, where he was employed as a waiter, a worker in a refrigerator factory, and then as a manual laborer in Ontario Hydro, the provincial electrical utility.

==Book==
The original manuscript in Hungarian was over a thousand pages long. With the help of {{ill|Tibor Tardos|hu|Tardos Tibor (író)}}, a Hungarian journalist living in Paris, the manuscript was abridged, edited and translated into French. "''Au Nom de la Classe Ouvrière''" was published by [[Éditions Robert Laffont]] in 1979. Shortly thereafter, it came to the attention of Canadian journalists Daniel &amp; Judy Stoffman, who arranged for an interview with the author that was published in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' . This led to an English translation under his direction.&lt;ref&gt; ''"In the Name of the Working Class"'' , "Translators' Preface" by Daniel &amp; Judy Stoffman&lt;/ref&gt; It remains an important primary source on the revolution.

==Final years==
He retired in 1987. In 1989, he was named [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]] - Holocaust commemoration authority of the state of Israel - for sheltering Jews in his home during World War II.&lt;ref&gt; Obituary. March 4, 2001 in the ''Toronto Star''. Byline: Nicolaas van Rijn; [http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4039994 Sándor Kopácsi] – his activity to save Jews' lives during the [[Holocaust]], at [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Communist government in 1990, he returned to Hungary where his military rank was restored. He went back to Canada in 2000, and died of a heart attack on March 2, 2001.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5609">'''Terentius Varro''' was the name used by men in a branch of the ''[[Terentia (gens)|gens Terentia]]'' in [[ancient Rome]], including:

* '''[[Gaius Terentius Varro]]''' (d. sometime after 200 BC), the surviving commander of the defeated [[Roman army of the mid-Republic|Roman army]] at the [[Battle of Cannae]].

[[File:Terloy.jpg|thumb|The emblem of the Chechen clan - Terloy.]]

The '''Terloy''' (also '''Terlo, Teroy''') (Chechen: '''ТIерлой, ТIерой''') is a [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen]] [[tukkhum]]. Nowadays the majority of the Terloy tribe reside in the western part of Chechnya – So'ljan district, Teh'a-Martan district, H'alha-Martan district, Akhmetovsky district of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and in some villages of republic [[Ingushetia]]. But the origin place of Terloy tribe is in south-west Chechnya Terloy-Mohk, up on the mountains, Galanchoj district. There are no people living there since February 1944. All villages were destroyed by Soviet government and was forbidden to live there because the region was considered as rebellious and dangerous.
Terloy speak in Iton-Khelan dialect of Chechen language.
The name Terloy comes from the geographical place of origin. Ter – from up, loy – indicates to belonging to a group. The population demographics is not known exactly, but it is considered to have around 30,000 people.

«Дийначу нехан буьйда бIаьргаш диина маI-ТIерлой»  - Terloy, who ate uncooked eyes of alive people.  There is a parable, according to which Terloys had eaten eye of a person from a group of people who came to steal cattle of Terloy. Terloy people killed all the men except one. He was that poor man who lost his eye. They left him in the example for others so that he would tell people who did it and for what reason.
In 1994 in the beginning of [[First Chechen War|war with Russia]] there were formed some groups by Terloy to defeat Russian aggression. And there was also one regiment organized by people from Galanchoj district called  Galanchojan Polk  but mostly composed of Terloy because the leader of it was from Terloy.

'''Toma Đurov Milinović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Тома Ђуров Милиновић}}; 1770–1846) or '''Tomo Milinović''' ({{lang|sr|Томо Милиновић}}), nicknamed '''Morinjanin''' ({{lang|sr|Морињанин}}), was a Serbian writer and revolutionary, a ''vojvoda'' under [[Karađorđe Petrović]] during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], he was also Karađorđe's advisor and head of artillery in one of the greatest battles during the uprising, [[Battle of Deligrad]]. While in exile in Trieste and Bessarabia, Tomo wrote, ''Umotvorine'' (Proverbs) and ''Istorija Slavenskog Primorja'' (History of the Slavic Littoral). 

== Origin and early life ==
Tomo Đurov Milinović was born in Morinj in the [[Bay of Kotor]], at the time part of the [[Republic of Venice]] (today [[Kotor]] municipality, [[Montenegro]]).  He learned how to read and write from a deacon in Morinj, and that was all of the schooling he attended throughout his life.  At a young age in order to make a living and help out his family he became a [[sailor]] like most of the men from this region.

For more than ten years he was serving on different merchant ships locally and around Europe. During these voyages he managed to save money and gain trading knowledge so he decided to settle down and become a [[merchant]] in [[Trieste]]. Considering that there was certain amount of merchants from Boka Kotorska living in Trieste as well as other connections he established through his sailing years he found his place quickly in that environment and became quite successful in his business. He even managed to financially help the planning of the First Serbian Uprising through friendship and connections he had with [[Dositej Obradović]] and other Serbian [[Patriotism|patriots]] that either lived there or visited Trieste.

== First Serbian Uprising ==
 [[File:Hajduk Veljko, Stevan Todorović.jpg|thumb|"Death of [[Hajduk-Veljko]]", depicting the Battle of Negotin (1813) and "Toša's Cannon".]]
In 1809, after the third occupation of Trieste by French during [[Napoleonic wars]], most of Tomo's possession had been overtaken. Just around that time The First Serbian Uprising was getting more successful and also more popular between the Serbian people that lived abroad, so Tomo decided to leave Trieste with his wife and son and join the uprising. After arriving to [[Serbia]] he had been accepted by Karađorđe to be his advisor and artillery specialist since he already had some artillery experience while sailing on armed merchant vessels. After the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]] was reached between Russians and Ottomans, few of the Russian gunsmiths assigned to Karađorđe by Russian Military left Serbia. Tomo offered himself to take over the job which Karađorđe gladly accepted. In 1813 Tomo created two cannons of the same size consisting of five pieces each weighing 35 kilograms which made them extremely useful because of the mobility. That same year Tomo was sent to defend [[Deligrad]] as a Head of Artillery, where the Serbian army, consisting of 30,000 troops defeated the Turkish army consisting of 55,000 troops. Under his command [[Artillery]] made a great effort in this battle by good positioning and frequent relocation of the cannons which caught the opposing army unprepared in multiple occasions.

== Exile ==
After the failure of the uprising, Tomo moved back to Trieste where he stayed until 1815. On Karađorđe's recommendation he moved to the [[Russian Empire]], to the town of [[Akkerman]] in [[Bessarabia]]. While in exile Tomo wrote two books, ''Umotvorine'' (published posthumously in 1847) and ''Istorija Slavenskog Primorja''. The former was reprinted in 2004 by a relative, Jeremije Milinović, while the latter was lost and was never published.

== Death ==
Tomo Milinović died in exile in 1846. Without being aware of that fact one of his great friends [[Sima Milutinović Sarajlija|Sima Milutinović]] made efforts and got approval from the Serbian government at the time to bring Tomo back to Serbia, which was Tomo's great wish, but unfortunately it was too late.

'''Václav Klaus''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈvaːtslaf ˈklaus}}; born 19 June 1941) is a [[Czechs|Czech]] economist and politician who served as the second [[President of the Czech Republic]] from 2003 to 2013. He also served as the [[list of Prime Ministers of the Czech Socialist Republic|second and last Prime Minister]] of the [[Czech Socialist Republic|Czech Republic, federal subject]] of the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic]], from July 1992 until the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] in January 1993, and as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|first]] [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] of the newly-independent Czech Republic from 1993 to 1998.

Klaus was the principal co-founder of the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS), a Czech free-market Eurosceptic political party.&lt;ref name="Klaus CV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrad.cz/cms/en/prezident_cr/klaus.shtml |title=Curriculum Vitae of Vaclav Klaus |accessdate=10 July 2008 |date=5 March 2003 |publisher=Office of the President of the Republic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624230526/http://www.hrad.cz/cms/en/prezident_cr/klaus.shtml |archivedate=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.org/publications/notes/notes/TheThreats.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627184428/http://www.fee.org/publications/notes/notes/TheThreats.asp |archivedate=27 June 2008|title=The Threats to Liberty in the 21st century|accessdate=11 February 2008|last=Klaus |first=Václav|date=6 May 2006|publisher=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His presidency was marked by numerous controversies over his strong views on a number of issues, from [[global warming denial]] to [[euroscepticism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jan|last=Richter |title=A decade with President Václav Klaus|url= http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/a-decade-with-president-vaclav-klaus|publisher=[[Radio Prague]]|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a wide-ranging amnesty declared in his last months of office, triggering his indictment by the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Senate]] on charges of [[high treason]]. His political views are often described as "[[Klausism]]".

==Early life==
Klaus was born in [[Prague]] during the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Nazi occupation]], and grew up in the large, then middle-class neighbourhood of [[Vinohrady]]. According to Klaus, he helped build barricades during the [[Prague uprising]] in May 1945, aged 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/klaus-vzpominal-na-prazske-povstani-jako-ctyrlety-jsem-stavel-barikady-1a8-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A100505_165842_ln_domov_hs|title=Klaus vzpomínal na Pražské povstání: Jako čtyřletý jsem stavěl barikády|language=Czech|work=lidovky.cz|date=5 May 2010|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus studied Economics of Foreign Trade at the [[University of Economics, Prague]], graduating in 1963. He also spent some time at universities in Italy (1966) and at [[Cornell University]] in the United States in 1969. He then pursued a postgraduate academic career at the State Institute of Economics of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]], which, according to his autobiography, he was forced to leave in 1970.&lt;ref name="kominek"/&gt;

Soon after that he was employed by the [[Czech National Bank|Czechoslovak State Bank]], where he held various staff positions from 1971 to 1986, as well as working abroad in various Soviet-aligned countries, usually considered a privilege at the time.&lt;ref name="kominek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bne.eu/content/story/vaclav-klaus-wrong-man-all-reasons|title=Vaclav Klaus – a wrong man for all reasons|first=Jiri|last=Kominek|work=Business News Europe|date=21 January 2009|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Klaus joined the Institute for Prognostics of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.

Klaus entered Czechoslovak politics during the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989, during the second week of the political uprising, when he offered his services as an economic advisor to the [[Civic Forum]], whose aim was to unify the anti-government movements in Czechoslovakia and overthrow the Communist regime. Klaus became Czechoslovakia's Minister of Finance in the "government of national unity" on 10 December 1989.

In October 1990, Klaus was [[Civic Forum leadership election, 1990|elected chairman of the Civic Forum]]. Two months later, he led [[Interparliamentary Club of the Democratic Right|supporters of a free-market economy]] into the break-away [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS). Following a period of strong economic growth, Klaus led ODS to victory in [[Czech legislative election, 1992|Czech legislative elections]] on 5–6 June 1992. ODS emerged as by far the largest party, with 76 seats, and Klaus thus became the first democratically elected [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic]].

ODS also performed strongly in the [[Czechoslovak parliamentary election, 1992|Czechoslovak federal election held the same day]], becoming the largest party with 48 seats, double the number of the runners-up, the [[Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]] (HZDS). Klaus was thus poised to become the first prime minister since before [[World War II]] with no past ties to Communism. The first postwar prime minister, Social Democrat [[Zdeněk Fierlinger]], was openly pro-Communist (and would lead his party into a merger with the Communists). The incumbent prime minister, [[Marián Čalfa]], had been a Communist until 1990.

However, ODS would still have needed support from HZDS to form a government. When he began coalition talks with HZDS leader [[Vladimir Meciar]], Klaus told Meciar that unless HZDS was willing to agree to a tighter federation, the only alternative was for the Czechs and Slovaks to form independent nations. As Meciar was unwilling to agree to the former option, on 23 July the two leaders agreed to [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia|dissolve Czechoslovakia]], to take effect on 1 January 1993.

Klaus led ODS to another victory in the [[Czech legislative election, 1996|1996 legislative elections]], and remained Prime Minister in a minority government. However, towards the end of 1997 he was forced to step down as Prime Minister by opponents in his party in connection with accusations of funding irregularities in the ODS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jan|last=Richter |title=Václav Klaus: the experienced and predictable|url= http://www.radio.cz/en/article/100524|publisher=[[Radio Prague]]|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his term as Prime Minister, President Václav Havel heavily criticized Klaus' policy of [[voucher privatization]] of previously state-owned enterprises. The policy was designed to bring about a speedy transition from command economy to free-market economy, but Havel cited the voucher privatization as a cause of the country's subsequent economic problems.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Leader of the opposition (1997–2002)==
At a party congress in late 1997, Klaus was [[Civic Democratic Party leadership election, 1997|re-elected as chairman of ODS]] by 227 votes to 72 votes. The defeated faction subsequently left ODS, and in early 1998 established a new party, the [[Freedom Union (Czech Republic)|Freedom Union]] ({{lang-cs|Unie svobody}}), with President Havel's support.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

ODS finished second in [[Czech legislative election, 1998|early elections in 1998]], behind the [[Czech Social Democratic Party]] (ČSSD). Either party could have formed a majority with the support of other parties, but Freedom Union chairman [[Jan Ruml]], despite his animosity to Klaus, refused to support ČSSD. Instead, Klaus negotiated the "[[Opposition Agreement]]" ({{lang-cs|opoziční smlouva}}) with ČSSD chairman [[Miloš Zeman]], his long-time political adversary. During the following legislative period, ODS allowed Zeman's ČSSD to rule with a [[minority government]], in exchange for a number of parliamentary posts, including the post of the [[Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies]], occupied by Klaus himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1998|title=Constitution Watch: A country-by-country update on constitutional politics in Eastern Europe and the ex-USSR|journal=East European Constitutional Review|volume=7|issue=3|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num3/constitutionwatch/czech.html|accessdate=9 July 2008|publisher=[[New York University School of Law]] and [[Central European University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120060523/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num3/constitutionwatch/czech.html|archive-date=20 November 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Opposition Agreement led to public demonstrations, particularly against an attempt to regulate [[Czech Television]]. This led Zeman to announce that he would not stand again for the post of Prime Minister.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In the [[Czech legislative election, 2002|elections of June 2002]], ODS was again defeated by ČSSD under their new leader [[Vladimír Špidla]], who had previously opposed the Opposition Agreement, and instead formed a coalition with centrist parties. After a long period of deliberation, and even though ODS won [[Czech Senate election, 2002|Senate elections in October 2002]], Klaus did not run for re-election as party chairman at the [[Civic Democratic Party leadership election, 2002|December ODS congress]]. However, he was made honorary chairman of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ods.cz/akce/kongres.php?No=13| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512021623/http://ods.cz/akce/kongres.php?No=13|archivedate=12 May 2008|title=XIII. kongres ODS|publisher=Občanská demokratická strana|language=Czech|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against his declared preference, Klaus was succeeded as party leader by [[Mirek Topolánek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Eva |last=Petržílková|title=Zprávy: Nástupcem Václava Klause v čele ODS se stal nečekaně Mirek Topolánek |url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/zpravy/35558#2|publisher=[[Radio Prague]]|date=15 December 2002|accessdate=9 July 2008 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency (2003–2013)==
[[File:Flag of the President of the Czech Republic.svg|thumb|Standard of the President of the Czech Republic]]
{{details|topic=election procedure and strategies|President of the Czech Republic#Electoral procedure}}

Having lost two general elections in a row, Klaus announced his intention to step down from the leadership and run for President to succeed his political opponent [[Václav Havel]]. The governing coalition was unable to agree on a common candidate to oppose him.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Klaus was elected [[President of the Czech Republic]] on 28 February 2003, in the [[Czech presidential election, 2003|third round of the election]], in which both chambers vote together at a joint session of the Parliament by [[secret ballot]] between the two top candidates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He won with a majority of 142 votes out of 281. It was widely reported that Klaus won due to the support of Communist Members of Parliament, support which his opponent, [[Jan Sokol (philosopher)|Jan Sokol]], had publicly refused to accept. Klaus denied that he owed the Communists any debt for his election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-of-radio-prague-740|title=News|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=16 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924062357/http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-of-radio-prague-740|archive-date=24 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of vetos===
Although Klaus regularly criticized Václav Havel for using his [[Presidential Veto]] powers to block laws and promised restraint, he used his veto more frequently than Havel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/klaus-uz-prekonal-havla-vetoval-vic-zakonu-f26-/domaci.asp?c=A060609_124605_zahranicni_tha|title=Klaus už překonal Havla.

He also vetoed a bill implementing the European Union's [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals]] policy, saying it was a burden for private businesses.

===Euroscepticism===

Klaus' [[euroscepticism]], alongside his scepticism of [[human impact on the environment|the role of humans in climate change]], formed the cornerstones of his policy as President.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He expressed the opinion that [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|accession to the European Union]] would mean a significant reduction of Czech sovereignty, and did not endorse either side in the [[Czech European Union membership referendum, 2003|2003 accession referendum]], in which 77% voted yes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Klaus' eurosceptic activism has consisted of numerous articles and speeches, in which he described alleged gradual loss of sovereignty for member states in favour of the EU. He promoted the publication of a text by the Irish Eurosceptic [[Anthony Coughlan]]. In 2005 Klaus called for the EU to be "scrapped" and replaced by a [[free trade area]] to be called the "Organisation of European States". He also claimed that the EU as an institution undermines freedom, calling the EU "as big a threat to freedom as the Soviet Union was".{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In 2005 he remarked to a group of visiting politicians from the United States that the EU was a "failed and bankrupt entity".{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Václav Klaus and Boris Tadić in Belgrade, 2008.jpg|thumb|Václav Klaus with [[Boris Tadić]] during his state visit to Serbia in 2008.]]

In November 2008, during a stay in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] after a [[state visit]], Klaus held a joint press conference with [[Declan Ganley]], head of [[Libertas (lobby group)|Libertas]], which was at that time campaigning for a "no" vote in [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2008 (Ireland)|a referendum]] on the [[Lisbon Treaty]]. Members of the Irish government called this an "inappropriate intervention", and "unusual and disappointing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1112/breaking27.htm|title=Martin says Klaus comments on Lisbon 'inappropriate'|date=12 November 2008|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Parliament====
{{over-quotation|section|date=June 2017}}
On 5 December 2008, members of the [[Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament]] visited the [[Czech Republic]] prior to the start of the Czech presidency of the European Union. They were invited by Václav Klaus to meet him at Prague Castle. [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], chairman of [[European Green Party|Green]] Group, brought a [[European flag]] and presented it to Klaus.&lt;ref name=shock&gt;{{Cite news|
url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/3757520/Czech-leader-in-shock-after-EU-assault.html|title=Czech leader in shock after EU assault|first=Christopher|last=Booker|date=14 December 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|accessdate=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohn-Bendit also said that he "did not care about Klaus' opinions on the Lisbon Treaty, that Klaus would simply have to sign it". This was criticised by some Czech commentators as "undue interference in Czech affairs".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

At the same meeting, Irish [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Brian Crowley]] told Klaus that the Irish people wanted ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and were "insulted" by Klaus' association with [[Declan Ganley]] and [[Libertas (lobby group)|Libertas]]. Klaus responded that "the biggest insult to the Irish people is not to accept the results of the [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2008 (Ireland)|Irish referendum]]".&lt;ref name=dec5meet&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalplatform.org/wordpress/?p=103|title=Guess Who's Coming To Dinner: Václav Klaus, Cohn-Bendit, Pöttering, Brian Crowley|author=National Platform for EU Research &amp; Information|date=7 December 2008|accessdate=8 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223175216/http://www.nationalplatform.org/wordpress/?p=103|archive-date=23 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley replied, "You will not tell me what the Irish think. As an Irishman, I know it best".&lt;ref name=dec5meet/&gt; British Eurosceptic journalist [[Christopher Booker]] wrote that the meeting "confirms the inability of the Euro-elite to accept that anyone holds views different from their own".&lt;ref name=shock/&gt;

On 19 February 2009, Klaus made a speech to the European Parliament where he criticized what he perceived as the [[Democratic deficit in the European Union|European Union's lack of democracy]], continuing integration and economic policies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The present decision-making system of the European Union is different from a classic parliamentary democracy, tested and proven by history. In a normal parliamentary system, part of the MPs support the government and part support the opposition. In the European Parliament, this arrangement has been missing. Here, only one single alternative is being promoted, and those who dare think about a different option are labelled as enemies of European integration... There is also a great distance (not only in a geographical sense) between citizens and Union representatives, which is much greater than is the case inside the member countries. This distance is often described as the democratic deficit, the loss of democratic accountability, the decision-making of the unelected – but selected – ones, as bureaucratisation of decision-making etc. The proposals to change the current state of affairs – included in the rejected European Constitution or in the not much different Lisbon Treaty – would make this defect even worse. Since there is no European demos – and no European nation – this defect cannot be solved by strengthening the role of the European Parliament, either.&lt;ref name=speech1&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eplive/expert/multimedia/20090126MLT47169/media_20090126MLT47169.pdf|title=Speech of the President of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus in the European Parliament|first=Vaclav|last=Klaus|date=19 February 2009|work=European Parliament|location=Brussels|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=speech2&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.klaus.cz/clanky/310|title=Speech of the President of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus in the European Parliament|first=Vaclav|last=Klaus|date=19 February 2009|website=klaus.cz|location=Brussels|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After this point was made, a number of MEPs walked out of the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae595a3a-feb7-11dd-b19a-000077b07658.html|title=Czech president sparks MEP walk-out|first=Joshua|last=Chaffin|date=19 February 2009|work=Financial Times|location=UK|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?language=en&amp;type=IM-PRESS&amp;reference=20090218IPR49770|title=Czech President Václav Klaus questions ever closer European political integration in speech to the European Parliament|date=19 February 2009|work=European Parliament|location=Brussels|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I fear that the attempts to speed up and deepen integration and to move decisions about the lives of the citizens of the member countries up to the European level can have effects that will endanger all the positive things achieved in Europe in the last half a century... Let us not allow a situation where the citizens of member countries would live their lives with a resigned feeling that the EU project is not their own; that it is developing differently than they would wish, that they are only forced to accept it. We would very easily and very soon slip back to the times that we hoped belonged to history.&lt;ref name=speech1/&gt;&lt;ref name=speech2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Eurozone====
Klaus was a frequent critic of centrally implemented economic policies in the European Union, and of the adoption of the [[Euro]] as the common currency of the [[eurozone]] countries. Around the 10th anniversary of the euro in 2008 he wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' that "in practice, the existence of the euro has shown that forcing an economically disparate Europe into a homogeneous entity through a political decision is political engineering par excellence, far from beneficial for all countries concerned".&lt;ref name=TemYears&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ten Years of Euro: A Reason for Celebration? |url=http://www.klaus.cz/clanky/1415|work=Financial Times |date=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Signing the Lisbon treaty====
Klaus long refused to sign the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], and was the last head of state in the EU to provide a signature. Other European leaders ignored his reluctance, stating that they would not consent to being "held hostage" by the Czech President.&lt;ref name="FT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/371d92e8-b3a1-11de-ae8d-00144feab49a.html|title=Klaus opposition to Lisbon ignored|work=Financial Times|date=8 October 2009|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech Prime Minister [[Jan Fischer (politician)|Jan Fischer]], however, said that Klaus would eventually sign the treaty, saying: "There is no reason for anxiety in Europe. The question is not Yes or No, it is only when".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4f30f2aa-b345-11de-ac13-00144feab49a.html?catid=4&amp;SID=google EU leaders brush off Czech threat to Lisbon]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 7 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008 Klaus said in an interview with the Czech Television that if he was the only person standing in the way of a treaty that all others agreed upon, he would not block it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/eu/zpravy/klaus-lisabonska-smlouva-zmeni-postaveni-cr/346172&amp;id_seznam= Klaus: Lisabonská smlouva změní postavení ČR]'', 25 November 2008, [[České noviny]], news server of ČTK&lt;/ref&gt; Václav Klaus signed the Treaty of Lisbon on 3 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/dokument-prezident-klaus-vysvetluje-proc-podepsal-lisabon-pqc-/domaci.asp?c=A091103_161503_domaci_kot|title=DOKUMENT: Prezident Klaus vysvětluje, proč podepsal Lisabon|language=Czech|date=3 November 2009|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=idnes.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he never signed the addition to the Lisbon Treaty, the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), which was eventually signed by his successor as president, [[Miloš Zeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/na-hrade-uz-visi-vlajka-eu-zeman-podporil-i-euroval-fwr-/domaci.aspx?c=A130403_075730_domaci_kop|title=Zeman na Hradě podepsal euroval, s Barrosem vyvěsil vlajku EU|language=Czech|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=idnes.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Russia===
[[File:Vladimir Putin in the Czech Republic 1-2 March 2006-3.jpg|thumb|Vaclav Klaus and [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]].]]

Klaus has sought cooperation with Russia on issues including energy policy.&lt;ref name="kominek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Czech Power Games"/&gt;

In the 1990s, Klaus promoted renewed oil and gas agreements between the Czech Republic and Russia, and opposed Czech attempts to develop other energy sources,&lt;ref name="Czech Power Games"/&gt; including the construction of a pipeline between the Czech Republic and Germany. According to former Czech secret service directors, he was warned by the secret service of Russian organized crime spreading into the Czech economy. In one scheme, oil was imported to the Czech Republic as heating oil and re-sold as diesel, creating huge profits for Russian businessman [[Semion Mogilevich]], alleged to be a key figure in the Russian mafia.&lt;ref name="kominek"/&gt;

In March 2006, Klaus was described by ''The Economist'' as one of Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]]'s "warmest admirers abroad".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/5578805 Russia and central Europe – Pretty pictures]. 2 March 2006. The Economist.&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus was awarded the 2007 [[Pushkin Medal]] by Putin for the promotion of Russian culture. It was suggested that this was partly due to his use of the Russian language when speaking to Putin and Russian diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Robert Eringer]]|title=Vaclav Klaus Exposed|url=http://recolumns.blogspot.com/2010/10/vaclac-klaus-exposed.html|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=24 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006195045/http://recolumns.blogspot.com/2010/10/vaclac-klaus-exposed.html|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=ČTK|title=Czech president receives Russian Pushkin Medal|url= http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=288494|date=27 December 2007|accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Daniela|last=Lazarová|title=News: President Klaus receives Pushkin Medal|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/news/99058#3|publisher=[[Radio Prague]]|date=27 December 2007|accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus said that in relations with Russia there have been "challenges and successes, tremendous successes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=David |last=Burnett |title=10 Questions For Vaclav Klaus |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1037613,00.html |work=Time  |date=13 March 2005 |accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in a May 2009 interview with ''[[Lidové noviny]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Interview for Lidové Noviny |url= http://www.klaus.cz/klaus2/asp/clanek.asp?id=pMjdKgvT86mB |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus said that Russia was not a threat, but was still a big, strong and ambitious country, of which the Czech authorities should beware more than countries like [[Estonia]] and [[Lithuania]] should.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Andrew |last=Rettman|title=Tensions at EU-Russia Summit|url= http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/may2009/gb20090525_636914.htm|work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|publisher=McGraw-Hill|date=25 May 2009|accessdate=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo===
Klaus criticised [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] during the [[Kosovo War]],&lt;ref name="Czech Power Games"&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Czech_Mate_How_Russia_Is_Rebuilding_Influence_In_The_Former_Soviet_Bloc/2168090.html Czech Power Games: How Russia Is Rebuilding Influence In The Former Soviet Bloc]. RFE/EL. 26 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently a frequent critic of the unilateral [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo declaration of independence]]. During a visit to Slovakia in March 2008, Klaus stated his disagreement with the argument that [[Kosovo]] was an exceptional case, and suggested that the precedent set by the recognition of Kosovo would open a "[[Pandora's box]]" in Europe, leading to disastrous consequences. He compared the situation of Serbia to the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Kosovo threatens to cause split in Czech government|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=48785|publisher=[[B92]]|date=25 March 2008|accessdate=9 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607034144/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=48785|archive-date=7 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Zoltán|last=Dujisin|title=EUROPE: To Recognise Kosovo Or Not|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41593|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|date=14 March 2008|accessdate=9 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515032145/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41593|archive-date=15 May 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Serbia]] recalled its ambassador in protest at the [[Czech Republic–Kosovo relations|Czech government's recognition of Kosovo]], Klaus invited the Serbian ambassador to Prague Castle for a friendly farewell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/37342/%C4%8Cesi+ispratili+ambasadora+Srbije+uz+izvinjenja.html |title=Česi ispratili ambasadora Srbije uz izvinjenj|language=sr|publisher=Pressonline|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a visit to Serbia in January 2011, Klaus stated that as long as he was President the Czech Republic would not appoint an ambassador to Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/230605/Klaus-Dok-sam-ja-predsednik-nece-biti-ambasadora-na-Kosovu|title=Klaus: Dok sam ja predsednik, neće biti ambasadora na Kosovu |publisher=Blic Online|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-election===
{{Main|Czech presidential election, 2008}}
Unlike previous Czech presidential elections, the election of 2008 was conducted using [[recorded vote|on the record]] voting rather than a [[secret ballot]]. This change was demanded by several Czech political parties after the [[Czech presidential election, 2003|previous elections in 2003]], but opposed by Klaus' ODS,&lt;ref name=Sight&gt;{{Cite news|first=Geoff|last=Larcom|title=Prague's politics a sight to see|url= http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/02/pragues_politics_a_sight_to_se.html |work=[[Ann Arbor News]]|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, having strengthened since 2003, had a comfortable majority in [[Senate of the Czech Republic|the Senate]] on its own, and only needed to secure a few votes in the House for the third round.

Klaus' opponent was the former émigré, [[naturalized]] United States citizen and [[University of Michigan]] economics professor [[Jan Švejnar]].&lt;ref name=MI&gt;{{Cite news|first=Karel|last=Janicek|title=U-M prof loses bid for president of Czech Republic |url= http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/02/um_prof_loses_bid_for_presiden.html|agency=Associated Press |date=15 February 2008|accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated by the [[Green Party (Czech Republic)|Green Party]] as a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-EU]] moderate candidate, and also gained the support of the leading opposition [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]], a small number of deputies and senators of [[KDU-ČSL]] and some independent Senators. The first ballot on 8–9 February 2008 resulted in no winner. Švejnar won the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]], but Klaus led in the assembly as a whole and only just failed to achieve the required majority.&lt;ref name=Sight/&gt;

The second ballot on 15 February 2008 included a new candidate [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Jana Bobošíková]], nominated by the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]]. However, without any further support, she withdrew her candidacy before the election,&lt;ref name=MI/&gt; and the second round ended similarly to the previous one, with Klaus remaining on 141 votes. Therefore, in the third round, where only a simple majority of all legislators present from both houses was required, Klaus won by one vote, with Švejnar receiving 111 votes, and the 29 Communists voting for neither.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Klaus re-elected Czech president |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/16/content_7612647.htm |agency=Xinhua News Agency|date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus's first term as President concluded on 7 March 2008, and he took his oath for the second term on the same day so as to avoid an interim without a president and allow Parliament to come to a joint session earlier. He therefore lost the day of overlap, meaning his second term ended on 6 March 2013.

===Resignation as honorary ODS chairman===
Václav Klaus resigned as Honorary Chairman of ODS at the party congress on 6 December 2008.&lt;ref name="BB20081208"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://praguemonitor.com/breakfastbrief/BB20081208.pdf |format=PDF|title=Breakfast Brief |accessdate=9 December 2008 |date=9 December 2008 |publisher=Prague Daily Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day his ally [[Pavel Bém]], the Mayor of Prague, lost a vote for the post of ODS chairman against Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, by 284 votes to 162.&lt;ref name="BB20081208"/&gt;

===Chile pen incident===
[[File:Václav Klaus visiting ESO's Paranal Observatory.jpg|thumb|Václav Klaus visiting [[ESO]]'s [[Paranal Observatory]], [[Chile]].]]
In April 2011, Klaus was seen taking a pen during a state visit to [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/04/14/czech-whos-watching-president-vaclav-klaus-pockets-a-pen-world-catches-him/ |title=Czech Who's Watching: President Vaclav Klaus Pockets a Pen, World Catches Him |last1=Wilson |first1=Jenny |work=Time  |accessdate=14 April 2011 |date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged theft, caught on television cameras, was widely reported around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2011/04/13/2799108/swiped-pen-is-an-international.html |title=Swiped pen is an international event |work=Kansas City Star |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraphtv/8449861/Czech-president-steals-pen.html |title=Czech president steals pen |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Klaus, the incident was exaggerated, as official pens are normally free to be taken by official visitors, including in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-president-says-pen-episode-in-chile-was-unnecessary/765507 |title=Czech President says pen episode in Chile was unnecessary |publisher=CeskeNoviny |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokeswoman for Chilean President [[Sebastián Piñera]] said the Chilean President's guests were free to take the pens from meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/czech-president-steals-pen|title=Czech leader Vaclav Klaus caught stealing pen on Chile trip|last=Quinn|first=Ben|date=2011-04-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/czechrepublic/8449756/Czech-president-Vaclav-Klaus-caught-stealing-pen-during-press-conference.html|title=Czech president Vaclav Klaus caught stealing pen during press conference|date=2011-04-14|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Parliament House incident===
In July 2011, President Klaus visited [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]. The visit was sponsored by the conservative Australian think tank, the [[Centre for Independent Studies]], and so was not afforded the diplomatic protocol of an official visit. While in Canberra Klaus was invited to an interview with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] in their [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] studios. On his arrival Klaus was requested to undergo the standard security clearance procedures required for normal members of the public; ABC staff tried to convince security staff to allow the President to bypass security but they refused, and so Klaus left the building.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-26/czech-president-bounced-by-security/2811236 Czech bounced: president denied entry to Parliament], [[Jeremy Thompson]], [[ABC Online]], 27 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus stated that it was not an issue of his passing through the electronic security system, but rather his treatment by the officials, as nobody had been there to meet him when he and his entourage arrived. After waiting for ten minutes in front of the building, a worker of the [[ABC Television]] invited him in, where he was left "among perhaps as many as hundred school children". After another few minutes he found out that the whole group was waiting for a security clearance. Klaus refused to waste more time waiting in line behind the school children and offered ABC Television to conduct the interview in his hotel. This offer was declined by ABC as they were already set up for the interview in the Parliament House studio.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prague"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/240261-klaus-na-bezpecnostni-ram-jsem-nechtel-cekat-se-stovkou-skolaku.html?ref=zpravy-dne|title=Klaus: Na bezpečnostní rám jsem nechtěl čekat se stovkou školáků|publisher=[[novinky.cz]]|date=27 July 2011|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus' approach was supported by the head of protocol in the Office of the Czech President, Jindřich Forejt, who described the incident as "incredible". Former spokesman for President [[Václav Havel]], [[Ladislav Špaček]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladislavspacek.cz |title=Etiketa a komunikace |publisher=Ladislav Spacek |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that "it is absolutely out of place to check a head of state; it is disrespectful. I am not at all surprised that Klaus turned around and went off. He should not be there trying to argue with some operative that he is not a terrorist".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/news/politics-policy/czech-president-backed-protocol-buffs-not-public-security-clash|title=Czech President backed by protocol buffs, not public on security clash|publisher=[[Czech Position]]|date=27 July 2011|access-date=27 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112175447/http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/news/politics-policy/czech-president-backed-protocol-buffs-not-public-security-clash|archive-date=12 January 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to 2011 Prague gay pride parade ===
Klaus' aide said that "The prepared Prague gay carnival is a pressure action and a political demonstration of a world with deformed values," describing homosexuals as "deviants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tabery |first1=Erik |title=In Prague, a Fight for Gay Rights Goes International |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/09/in-prague-a-fight-for-gay-rights-goes-international/245064/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=27 June 2018 |date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments attracted widespread criticism from Czech politicians across the political spectrum, as well as from thirteen ambassadors. Klaus defended his aide's comments. Criticizing "homosexualism", he said that homosexuality is something to be tolerated but not celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gay pride in Prague|date=14 August 2012|url=https://www.economist.com/eastern-approaches/2012/08/14/gay-pride-in-prague |publisher=The Economist |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Konviser |first1=Bruce I. |title=Czech Leader Is Isolated in Opposing Gay Parade |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/world/europe/16iht-prague16.html |accessdate=27 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Peterson |first1=Abby |last2=Wahlström |first2=Mattias |last3=Wennerhag |first3=Magnus |title=Pride Parades and LGBT Movements: Political Participation in an International Comparative Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNFfDwAAQBAJ |publisher=Routledge |accessdate=27 June 2018 |language=en |date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airsoft gun assault===
On 28 September 2012, Klaus was attacked during a bridge opening ceremony in [[Chrastava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19765533|title=Czech President Vaclav Klaus shot at with replica gun|work=BBC News|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Klaus was walking through a thick crowd, shaking hands and chatting with bystanders, a 26-year-old man, Pavel Vondrouš, approached him and pressed an [[airsoft gun]] against the President's right arm, pulling the trigger seven times before disappearing into the crowd. Klaus was taken to Prague's Střešovice hospital with what was described as "minor bruising" for treatment before being discharged. The attacker, a supporter of the [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/president-klaus-in-shooting-scare|title=President Klaus in shooting scare|work=Radio Prague|date=1 October 2012|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was detained after several minutes, but later released. Before he was taken into custody, he told journalists that he had done it "because politicians were blind and deaf to the people's despair". Vondrouš received a suspended sentence in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/230256-vondrous-dostal-za-strelbu-na-klause-podminku-jsem-mile-prekvapen/|title=Vondrouš dostal za střelbu na Klause podmínku: "Jsem mile překvapen"|language=Czech|work=Česká televize|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of action from the President's bodyguards was heavily criticised, and the head of the President's security resigned after the incident.

===2013 Amnesty and accusations of treason===
On 1 January 2013, using his constitutional powers, Klaus announced an [[amnesty]] to mark the 20th anniversary of the Czech Republic's independence. The amnesty took effect on 2 January and released all prisoners sentenced to one year or less whose sentences had not been served, and all prisoners over 75 years of age sentenced to ten years or less whose sentences had not been served, as well as cancelling all court proceedings which had been ongoing for longer than eight years.&lt;ref name=CTK&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech President declares amnesty on 20 years of Czech Republic|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-president-declares-amnesty-on-20-years-of-czech-republic/883710|work=ČTK|publisher=České Noviny|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 11 January 6,318 prisoners had been released due to the amnesty, with other cases pending the outcome of court appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/vezenskou-sluzbu-zatim-amnestie-stala-890-000-korun/887600|title=Vězeňskou službu zatím amnestie stála 890.000 korun|publisher=Czech Press Agency|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=2013-01-11|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, dozens of high-profile long-running corruption trials ended due to the amnesty, causing the greatest public anger.&lt;ref name="treason"/&gt;

The extent of the amnesty was widely criticized in the Czech Republic, with the opposition demanding a [[vote of no confidence]] against Prime Minister [[Petr Nečas]], who countersigned it.&lt;ref name=BBCamnesty&gt;{{cite news|title=Czech president's mass prison amnesty draws protests|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20905896|accessdate=19 January 2013|publisher=BBC|date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a comparison was drawn with actions taken by Klaus's predecessor, [[Václav Havel]], who ordered three amnesties while Czechoslovak and later Czech president (1989–2003). Havel's first amnesty of January 1990 was the largest post-war amnesty, freeing around 23,000 people, two thirds of the total prison population of 31,000, on the grounds that they had been convicted by a communist court system.&lt;ref name="CTK"/&gt;

The amnesty sparked a public petition to persuade the Senate of the Czech Republic to charge President Klaus with [[high treason]] before the [[Constitutional court]],&lt;ref name="treason"&gt;{{cite news|date=4 March 2013|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21660234|title=Czech President Vaclav Klaus faces treason charge|website=BBC News|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively [[impeach]]ing him.&lt;ref name=NFPK&gt;{{cite web|title=Appeal for Impeachment against President Vaclav Klaus according to Article 65 of the Constitution|url=http://www.klausovavelezrada.cz/en/|work=NFPK|publisher=NFPK|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 24 hours of its launch, it had accumulated 24,500 signatures, and by the beginning of February 2013, the petition had been signed by more than 64,000 people.&lt;ref name=Aktualne.cz&gt;{{cite web|title=Chtěji žalobu na Klause, mohou být v knize rekordů|url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/domaci/politika/clanek.phtml?id=769788|work=Aktualne.cz|publisher=Aktualne.cz|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 2013, the [[Impeachment of Václav Klaus|Senate voted to charge Klaus with high treason]], based on five cases in which he was alleged to have violated the constitution, including the amnesty, his refusal to sign the European stability mechanism and his alleged procrastination in nominating judges to the Constitutional Court. The following day, on 5 March, the Constitutional Court rejected a previous motion by a smaller group of senators to cancel the New Year amnesty, thereby removing the issue of the amnesty from the constitutional suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/ustavni-soud-odmitl-navrh-na-zruseni-cele-novorocni-amnestie-pum-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A130212_154128_ln_domov_hm|title=Ústavní soud odmítl návrh na zrušení celé novoroční amnestie|language=Czech|trans-title=Constitutional Court rejected the motion to cancel the New Year amnesty|work= lidovky.cz|date=12 February 2013|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the sanction for treason committed by the Czech President is the loss of office, and Klaus' term was due to end the following day, the court's verdict was a mere formality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/infos#1|title=Radio Prague, News, March 4, 2013|work=Radio Prague|publisher=Czech Radio 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a guilty verdict would make Klaus ineligible for a third term of office in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-senate-charges-president-vaclav-klaus-with-high-treason/909367 "Czech Senate charges President Vaclav Klaus with high treason"]&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus described the move as an attempt by his political opponents to tarnish his presidency.

==Post-presidency==
After his presidency ended in 2013, Klaus was named a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the [[Cato Institute]].&lt;ref name="Cato"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/people/vaclav-klaus|title=Václav Klaus|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fellowship was terminated in September 2014, due to his views on the [[Ukrainian crisis]], his [[homophobia|hostility to homosexuality]], and support for European far-right parties.&lt;ref name="Cato 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/22/vaclav-klaus-libertarian-hero-has-his-wings-clipped-by-cato-institute.html|title=Vaclav Klaus, Libertarian Hero, Has His Wings Clipped by Cato Institute|publisher=[[Daily Beast]]|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2014, in an interview with Czech radio station [[Radio Impulse]], Klaus said that [[Ukraine]] is an artificially created state and that the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|Russian intervention in the country]] was part of a [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|civil war]].&lt;ref name=Ukraine&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/klaus-o-situaci-na-ukrajine-ddy-/domaci.aspx?c=A140909_150517_domaci_cen# West "dodged" Ukraine and Russia had to respond, says Klaus]. "iDnes". 9 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He continued by describing [[Euromaidan|Maidan]] as an "artificial event created by the West and the United States", in which Russia was forced to intervene.&lt;ref name=Ukraine/&gt; He added that in his opinion, Ukraine lacks the strong ties to keep the country together.&lt;ref name=Ukraine/&gt;

In the [[Czech presidential election, 2018|2018 presidential election]], Klaus endorsed his former political opponent [[Miloš Zeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/461759-klaus-prisel-blahoprat-zemanovi-obava-se-ze-porazeni-vysledek-neprijmou.html|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
===Economic activities===
In 1995, while Prime Minister, Klaus was awarded the title of Professor of Finance by his alma mater, the [[University of Economics, Prague]]. Since then Klaus has occasionally given economics seminars at the university, focused on his free-market views.

His defining feature as an economist since 1990 has been his enthusiasm for [[free market|free market economics]], as exemplified by [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Fund from the June 1990 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/1990/06/01/no-third-way-out |title=No Third Way Out – Reason Magazine |work=Reason |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Klaus, legislation and institutions cannot be created before economic transformation, they have to go hand in hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://ekonomika.idnes.cz/klaus-ceske-banky-delaly-pred-lety-stejne-chyby-jako-ty-americke-pred-krizi-1uz-/ekonomika.asp?c=A091111_130125_ekonomika_vem | title = Klaus: České banky dělaly před lety stejné chyby jako ty americké před krizí |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic | date = 11 November 2009 | language = Czech | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, Václav Klaus has received nearly 50 honorary degrees, including from [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees Honorary Doctoral Degrees at [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501185429/https://www.ufm.edu/cms/es/honorary-doctoral-degrees |date=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published more than 20 books on various social, political, and economic topics. Klaus is a member of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]]. He has published articles in the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ''[[Cato Journal]]''. On 28 May 2008, Klaus gave the keynote address at an annual dinner hosted by the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], a free market advocacy group in Washington, D.C., and received its [[Julian L. Simon]] Memorial Award.

Klaus was elected to become a foreign member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_id=390801 |title=Novi članovi SANU-a |publisher=B92.net |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change scepticism===
[[File:Václav Klaus 0392.jpg|thumb|Václav Klaus 2009]]
Klaus is a vocal critic of the view of scientists that [[global warming]] is anthropogenic. He has described the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] as "a group of politicized scientists with one-sided opinions and one-sided assignments",&lt;ref name=Barillas20070310/&gt; and has claimed that some other top-level politicians do not publicly express their doubts about global warming being anthropogenic because "a whip of political correctness strangles their voices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1261666.php |title=Czech president derogates UN global-warming panel |work=m&amp;c News |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=8 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404031958/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1261666.php |archivedate=4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the [[Cato Institute]] in Washington in March 2007, Klaus expressed the view that "Environmentalism should belong in the social sciences, along with other "isms" such as communism, feminism, and liberalism", and compared environmentalism to a religion, or a "modern counterpart of communism that seeks to change peoples' habits and economic systems".&lt;ref name=Barillas20070310&gt;{{Cite news |first=Martin |last=Barillas |title=Czech president: Environmentalism is a religion |url= http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idCategory=33&amp;idsub=128&amp;id=8342 |work=Spero News |date=10 March 2007 |accessdate=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 2007 article in ''[[The Financial Times]]'', Klaus described environmentalism as "the biggest threat to [[freedom (political)|freedom]], democracy, a [[market economy]] and [[prosperity]]". He said that current political and scientific debates on environment issues were designed to suppress freedom and democracy, and asked readers to oppose the term "[[scientific consensus]]", adding that "it is always achieved only by a loud minority, never by a silent majority".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9deb730a-19ca-11dc-99c5-000b5df10621.html | title = Freedom, not climate, is at risk | first = Vaclav | last = Klaus | date = 13 June 2007 |work=Financial Times  | accessdate =8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online Q&amp;A session following the article he wrote "Environmentalism, not preservation of nature (and of environment), is a leftist ideology... Environmentalism is indeed a vehicle for bringing us socialist government at the global level. Again, my life in communism has made me oversensitive in this respect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ft.com/klaus | title = Global warming: truth or propaganda? |work=Financial Times  | date = 21 June 2007 | accessdate =9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated these statements at a showing of [[Martin Durkin (television director)|Martin Durkin]]'s ''[[The Great Global Warming Swindle]]'' organised by his think tank CEP in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://zpravy.idnes.cz/domaci.asp?c=A070629_084140_domaci_mr | title = Klaus uvedl film o podvodu s globálním oteplováním |work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic | date = 29 June 2007 | language = Czech | accessdate =8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, on [[BBC World]]'s ''[[HARDtalk]]'', Klaus called the interviewer "absolutely arrogant" for saying that a scientific consensus had been reached on climate change that included most of the world. He added that he was "absolutely certain" that in 30 years people would look back and be grateful to him for his stand on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/7091092.stm | title = BBC News Hardtalk: Vaclav Klaus | date = 12 November 2007 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate =9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|September 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], Klaus restated his rejection of global warming, calling for a second IPCC to be established to produce competing reports, and for countries to be left alone to set their priorities and prepare their own plans for the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.un.org/webcast/climatechange/highlevel/2007/pdfs/czechrepublic-eng.pdf |format=PDF|author=Václav Klaus|title=Notes for the speech of the President of the Czech Republic at the UN Climate Change Conference|date=24 September 2007|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Klaus published a book entitled ''Modrá, nikoli zelená planeta'' (literally: "Blue planet – not green"), which has been translated into various languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Václav Klaus |url=http://www.fundacionfaes.org/en/documentos/gotagota/show/00786 |title=FAES – Foundation for social studies and analysis |publisher=Fundacionfaes.org |accessdate=16 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104202706/http://www.fundacionfaes.org/en/documentos/gotagota/show/00786 |archivedate=4 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in English under the title ''Blue Planet in Green Shackles''. The book claims that "the theory of global warming and the hypothesis on its causes, which has spread around massively nowadays, may be a bad theory, it may also be a valueless theory, but in any case it is a very dangerous theory".

At the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|September 2009 UN Climate Change Conference]], Klaus again spoke against the conference, calling the gathering "propagandistic" and "undignified".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE58L6ID20090922 | title=UN climate meeting was propaganda: Czech president | date=22 September 2009 |agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2011 at the National Press Club Address, Klaus described global warming as "a communist [[global warming conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idKceFvO7AM | title=President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic at the National Press Club Address | date=26 July 2011 |agency=ABC  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 2012 Klaus addressed the climate sceptic [[Heartland Institute]]'s Seventh International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC-7).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://heartland.org/ | title=President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic, featured speaker   }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012 he delivered the Magistral Lecture to the World Federation of Scientists in [[Erice]], Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Klaus| first =Václav| title =Manmade Contribution to Global Warming is Not a Planetary Emergency| work =SPPI Reprint Series| publisher =Science and Public Policy Institute| date =22 August 2012| url =http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/reprint/not_planetary_emergency.html| accessdate =10 November 2012| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20121031041609/http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/reprint/not_planetary_emergency.html| archive-date =31 October 2012| dead-url =yes| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is usually depicted as an enemy of the [[X-Men]]. In the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], the character has been portrayed by [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Danny Huston]] and [[Josh Helman]]. In 2009, William Stryker was ranked by [[IGN]]'s as the 70th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/70.html Stryker is number 70] [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Brent Anderson]], he first appeared in the 1982 [[graphic novel]] ''[[X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills]]''. His character was modeled after [[Jerry Falwell]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/5/26/11715632/x-men-best-superheroes&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==

===''God Loves, Man Kills''===
William Stryker is a [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]], with a military history which may have involved the [[Weapon X]] project (the same project that results in [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] being given the [[adamantium]] skeleton). Stryker is characterized by his unequivocal hatred of mutants. So strong is this hatred that Stryker goes so far as to kill his own wife and mutant son [[Jason Stryker]] immediately after his son's birth in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Crazed and outraged, Stryker then makes a [[suicide attempt]]. As time passes, he is convinced that [[Satan]] has a plot to destroy humankind by corrupting prenatal souls, the result of this corruption being mutants. Additionally, Stryker eventually comes to see the birth of his mutant son as a sign from [[God in Christianity|God]], directing him to his true calling: ensuring the [[genocide|eradication]] of all mutants.

Driven by this newfound conviction, Stryker then becomes a popular but controversial preacher and [[televangelist]]. While his followers, including a secret [[paramilitary]] group called the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]], commit [[hate crime]]s against mutants, Stryker arranges to have [[Professor X]]avier kidnapped, brainwashed, and attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, will kill all living mutants. In order to stop this scheme, the [[X-Men]] are forced to join forces with their nemesis [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. When the extent of his bigotry becomes obvious—he attempts to kill [[Kitty Pryde]] in front of a television audience—one of his own security guards shoots and arrests him.

===''God Loves, Man Kills II''===
William Stryker, who made no appearances until this storyline in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', was assumed forgotten. This time, it was revealed that Stryker had been serving a prison sentence as a result of the events of his previous actions. [[Lady Deathstrike]], a character with ties to the X-Men's Wolverine, makes her way onto the airplane where Stryker was being transferred. Once there, she kills his guards and rescues him, then it is revealed that the two are lovers, and he immediately begins a crusade against the X-Men, focusing on Wolverine, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], the X-Treme X-Men team, and Shadowcat, against whom he apparently keeps a grudge.

Stryker sent a group of his followers against several of the X-Men, and kidnapped Kitty Pryde. Along the way, Kitty convinced Stryker that mutants were not an abomination, and he seemed to turn over a new leaf.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Treme X-Men'' #25-30&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Decimation"===
However, he returns as a major player at the start of the 2005 "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" storyline, following the "[[House of M]]" storyline, in which he deemed the sudden massive reduction in number of the mutant population a sign of God, saying "He made the first step and now we have to take the next", basically rallying for genocide on TV. He was featured mostly in ''[[New X-Men]]'' as the main villain, but also appeared in other comics set during this time frame.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' #1-35. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]], one of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute's]] students, he caused a bus to explode, killing about 1/4 of the de-powered students from the academy. Then he planned the assassination of [[Wallflower (comics)|Wallflower]], ordering one of his snipers to shoot her in the head. Next he tried to kill [[Dust (comics)|Dust]], though it was actually [[X-23]]. The deaths of Wallflower and Dust were Stryker's prime objectives, as he had been informed by [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] that both girls would destroy his army. Finally he attacked the institute with his Purifiers, killing [[Quill (comics)|Quill]], leaving [[Onyxx (comics)|Onyxx]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] critically wounded, and hurting [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Emma Frost]], and other students. After Stryker's Purifiers were defeated, he was killed by the enraged boyfriend of Wallflower, [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]],&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #2-27. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; who causes catastrophic damage to Stryker's brain via the rapid growth of a tumor.

[[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] [[Comic book death|resurrected]] Stryker with a [[Technarch]], to join Bastion's new Purifiers. Bastion revealed that as the founder of the Purifiers, Stryker has the second highest number of mutant kills. He is surpassed only by [[Bolivar Trask]], the founder of the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]].&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' (Volume 3) #3 (2008). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastion charges Stryker to locate [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], following their return from the future in the Second Coming event. His Purifiers, in conjunction with [[Cameron Hodge]]'s Right footsoldiers, engage the X-Men and New Mutants. The Purifiers take out Magik with a weaponized ritual, Illyana is abducted by demons through one of her own stepping discs.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #15-20&lt;/ref&gt; They also disrupt Nightcrawler's teleportation with a sonic attack, leading to disorientation. The battle culminates when Wolverine orders [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] to take out Stryker, shifting into the "Death" persona and slices Stryker in half at the waist with his wings.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' #21. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is later revealed that Stryker did not actually murder his son Jason, and had in fact raised the boy in secret, alleviating his apparently debilitating mutation with the help of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] After his father's death, Jason continues his work by joining the Purifiers.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = Mahmud Asrar and Brandon Peterson|inker = Mahmud Asrar and Brandon Peterson|colorist = Israel Silva and Marte Gracia|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Nick Lowe|title = All-New X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #20|date = 18 December 2013|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Brian Michael Bendis|penciller = Brandon Peterson and Brent Anderson|inker = Brandon Peterson and Brent Anderson|colorist = Israel Silva and James Campbell|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Nick Lowe|title = All-New X-Men|volume = 1|issue = #21|date = 15 January 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Behind the Weapon X Project===
During the "Weapons of Mutant Destruction" storyline, William Stryker somehow returned from the dead and has formed the latest incarnation of the [[Weapon X]] Project with the help of some humans that he swayed to his side like Doctor Alba. He sets his sites on eradicating mutantkind by having his scientists work on Adamantium cyborgs.&lt;ref name="Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha'' #1"&gt;''Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; In order to refine these Adamantium cyborgs, William Stryker has the Weapon X Project target [[Old Man Logan]] (an elderly Wolverine from an alternate reality), Sabretooth, Warpath, Domino, and Lady Deathstrike because they have special abilities that the Weapon X are interested in having.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Prime'' Vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt; After the Adamantium cyborgs apprehend Lady Deathstrike and harvest her genetic material for the Weapon X Project to use for their Adamantium Cyborgs, Old Man Logan and Sabretooth evade the Adamantium cyborgs as William Stryker and the rest of the Weapon X Project were able to get their tissue samples.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, William Stryker also has the Adamantium cyborgs target [[Amadeus Cho]]'s [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] form for his blood sample.&lt;ref&gt;''Totally Awesome Hulk'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; When Amadeus Cho's Hulk form and the mutants on Old Man Logan's side raid the Weapon X Project's base and frees Lady Deathstrike and Warpath, William Stryker sets the base to self-destruct where its employees were killed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #4&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown that William Stryker was starting a project that involves the blood from Amadeus Cho's Hulk form that is part of the ingredients for the Mutant/Hulk hybrids.&lt;ref name="Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha'' #1"/&gt; Following some further investigations, Old Man Logan's group and Amadeus Cho's Hulk raided the Weapon X Project's central command. Amadeus Cho's Hulk form did not want Old Man Logan, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' Vol. 3 #6&lt;/ref&gt; As Old Man Logan, Sabretooth, and Lady Deathstrike disputed with Amadeus Cho's Hulk form, William Stryker took the opportunity to get away as they soon join the fight against Bobby Andrews in his mutated H-Beta form. As Hulk fights H-Beta and then the H-Alpha after it killed H-Beta, William Stryker and Doctor Alba escaped in their helicopter upon them losing control of H-Alpha.&lt;ref&gt;''Totally Awesome Hulk'' #22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate timeline seen in the 2005 "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, William Stryker's father was raised by a preacher who cared for him and other children from their town after most were slaughtered by mutants. However, in a horrible stroke of irony his father was later killed by other surviving humans. As such he had to live in hiding, learning to depend on the kindness of both humans and mutants, making this Stryker a far more tolerant person than his 616 universe counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;''Age Of Apocalypse'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; He takes the guise of '''Prophet''' and begins to avenge humanity along with X-Terminated. He breaks into the apartment of Krakken, an engineer who built ovens to incinerate humans, and murders him but not his family. Before killing Krakken, Prophet reveals he previously destroyed one of Krakken's eyes and then finished the job by cutting off his head. William studies the Sentinels and mutants hunt of humans in order to refine his skills in taking them down. He says he's learned their weaknesses and despite their powers, his will and skill is more powerful. With ease, Prophet made his way up an attacking Sentinel, cuts into its head and flips away as the robot is destroyed from the damage. He says his talents were obtained by watching the slaughter of thousands and his victories honor them. As Weapon X leads his final attack on the last surviving City of Men, Prophet allows them to escape by throwing an explosive at Weapon X. He then leads his team out of the city. Once clear the city is destroyed by Weapon X.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Apocalypse'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] iteration of the character is '''William Stryker Sr.''', an [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]], the leader of the anti-mutant conspiracy within the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]], and also linked to the creation of the Ultimate version of the [[Legacy Virus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' #81&lt;/ref&gt; Stryker Sr. can also be seen in flashbacks under the pressure of [[God]] to kill mutants, another trait he passed on to his son William Stryker Jr.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

* Scottish actor [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] portrayed William Stryker in the 2003 film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', while [[Brad Loree]] portrays the character in flashbacks. This version is a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Colonel with a fervent desire to harvest [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] for weapons to take down potential mutant threats, and is a military scientist who has gone into [[defense contractor|defense contracting]] to eradicate mutant threats. His son [[Jason Stryker]] tortured Stryker and his wife by planting telepathic illusions in their minds until Jason's mother committed suicide by drilling into her own brain. Stryker sent Jason to [[Professor X]]avier's school in hopes of having cured, as Stryker regarded his son's mutation as a disease. Previously, Xavier's position that mutation was not a disease to be cured angered Stryker. Stryker then gave his son a [[lobotomy]] to make more docile, and derived a substance from Jason's living body that can be used to control the minds of mutants. After Stryker uses the brainwashed [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] to make an assassination attempt on the [[President of the United States]], the President authorizes Stryker to attack the [[X-Mansion]]. He kidnaps the school's students, and elsewhere kidnaps [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Xavier, whom he has Jason brainwash. Stryker also attempts to use a reproduction of [[Cerebro]] to kill all mutants, though this plan is foiled when the X-Men and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] mutants attack Stryker's compound and rescue their kidnapped loved ones. When confronted by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], he reveals that Wolverine volunteered for the experiment in which Stryker bonded adamantium to his own bones and claws. Magneto also used Stryker's makeshift Cerebro against him and the human race which Stryker was horrified that his weapon was used against him. Stryker is left chained up while Magneto, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] steal his helicopter. He tries to get Wolverine to rejoin him as he can reveal the man's past. After Wolverine chooses to stay with Xavier, Stryker bellows that one day someone else will finish his work. After he leaves, the nearby dam bursts from the resulting battle and the huge wall of rushing water drowns Stryker for good. The X-Men later give the President the files from Stryker's office containing the evidence of Stryker's crimes.
* [[Danny Huston]] portrays a young version of William Stryker in the 2009 prequel film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. The character is a Major and the leader of the [[Weapon X]] project. Stryker recruits [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]] and Logan to join the Weapon X program, though Wolverine eventually leaves the team. Stryker manipulates Logan into returning and undergoing the procedure to have adamantium grafted to his own bones under the false belief that [[Silver Fox (comics)|Kayla Silverfox]] was murdered by Creed. After the successful adamantium bonding process, Logan learns the truth, and Stryker shoots [[adamantium]] bullets in Wolverine's head, causing long-term [[amnesia]]. Although the physical injuries heal, Logan's memories seem to be permanently gone. Stryker attempts to shoot Kayla but the mutant's telepathic abilities force Stryker to "walk until [his] feet bleed - and keep walking", which Stryker does. He is eventually picked up by the military police to bring him in for questioning about his connection with General Munson who tried to shut Weapon X down after learning about his son's mutant status and who Stryker murdered.&lt;ref name=reynolds&gt;{{cite news | author=Marc Graser | author2=Tatiana Siegel | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981136.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Reynolds, will.i.am join 'Wolverine' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Don Creech]] portrays the character's father (credited as Agent Stryker) in the 2011 film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. Set in the 1960s, he appears as a [[CIA]] agent discussing the existence of mutants with Charles Xavier. Like his son, he has anti-mutant beliefs. Xavier reads his mind and mentions that he was thinking of his son to prove he was a mutant. Stryker works out a deal with the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Soviet forces off Cuba's coast]] to join U.S naval forces in attacking the X-Men at the film's climax, which disastrously fails due to Magneto's incredible mutant command over electromagnetism. Though Stryker's intentions are to protect the human race from mutant threats, his own actions effectively serve as part of the catalyst of Magneto's animosity towards humans and lead him to the foundation of both the X-Men and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], which will eventually clash with his son more than once.
* [[Josh Helman]] portrays another younger iteration of William Stryker in the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (while archive footage and audio of Brian Cox is also used).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178093-characters-and-story-details-revealed-for-x-men-days-of-future-past|title=Characters and Story Details Revealed for X-Men: Days of Future Past|author=Perry, Spencer|date=July 15, 2013|accessdate= July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Bolivar Trask]]'s right-hand man, this iteration begins education into mutant affairs.&lt;ref&gt;'Empire Magazine' March 2014 issue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Empire Magazine'' March 2014 issue&lt;/ref&gt; Set in 1973, Major Stryker witnesses Wolverine in action when Wolverine (projected back from the future into his past self), [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], Magneto and Xavier attempt to prevent Mystique's assassination of Trask; the sight of Stryker causes Wolverine to experience intense flashbacks of Stryker's future actions, causing a brief but crucial distraction that allows Magneto to try to kill Mystique to change the future. Stryker is also present when Trask attempts to demonstrate the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] at Washington, before Magneto launches his own attack. 
* Josh Helman reprised his role in the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''. Set in 1983, it is revealed that the events in ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'' only altered the course of his future slightly. After Xavier is used by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] to trigger the launch of the world's nuclear missiles into space, Colonel Stryker comes to the X-Mansion to investigate the events, abducting Mystique, Beast, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Moira MacTaggert]] to investigate the cause of the telepathic broadcast, unaware that his helicopter is infiltrated by Scott Summers, [[Jean Grey]] and Kurt Wagner; Kurt had teleported the three into the helicopter while Jean telepathically convinces the guards not to see the three. At some point in the past decade, Stryker was able to capture Logan and mentally program him after infusing the adamantium to Logan's skeleton. When Jean is able to find and release Logan, Stryker is forced to flee his base as Logan tears through his soldiers before Jean restores a few of Logan's memories. In a deleted scene, Moira has Stryker arrested for kidnapping a federal officer and his wrongdoings on minors. Before being taken away, Stryker warns Moira about mutants being untrustworthy.

===Video games===
* The game-exclusive ultimate villain in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', '''William Kincaid''' (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), is largely based on the ''X-Men'' film series incarnation of William Stryker and similar human X-Men villains [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]].
* William Stryker is referenced several times in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]''. It's revealed that his son Jason Stryker uses his father's [[Master Mold|secret program]] to kill the X-Men. It's also revealed that [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and [[Silver Samurai|Kenuichio Harada]] funded this program with him, and gave the [[apprentice]] Yuriko Oyama to as a "gift".
* William Stryker appears in a major role in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', voiced by [[David Florek]].
* William Stryker appears as a villain in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'', voiced by [[James M. Connor|Jim Conner]].
