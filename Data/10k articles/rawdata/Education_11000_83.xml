The '''Barnard Conference on Sexuality''' is often credited as the moment that signaled the beginning of the [[Feminist Sex Wars]].&lt;ref name="Wilson_1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = Elizabeth | title = The context of "''Between Pleasure and Danger''": The Barnard Conference on Sexuality | journal = [[Feminist Review]] | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 35-41 | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | doi = 10.1057/fr.1983.5 | jstor = 1394680 | date = Spring 1983 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/fr.1983.5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held at [[Barnard College]] (a private women's [[liberal arts]] college in [[New York City]]) on April 24, 1982, and was presented as the annual Scholar and Feminist Conference IX, an integral part of the [[Barnard Center for Research on Women]]. The theme of the Conference was Sexuality. The Conference was set up as a framework for feminist thought to proceed regarding topics that many felt uncomfortable talking about. As Carole Vance, the Academic Coordinator of the Conference wrote in her letter inviting the participants “sexuality is a bread and butter issue, not a frill.”

==History==
The Barnard Sex Conference was held in 1982 by the [[Barnard Center for Research on Women]], then known as the Women’s Center. It was organized by a group of feminists that included [[Ellen Dubois]], [[Ellen Willis]], [[Gayle Rubin]], and was led by Carol Vance. [[Jane Gould]], the director of the Women’s Center then, calls it the “most controversial and perhaps the most important conference”.&lt;ref name="Gould_1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gould | first = Jane | title = Juggling: a memoir of work, family, and feminism | publisher = Feminist Press at the City University of New York | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781558611733 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women who took part understood that this conference was important in light of the growing [[Women Against Pornography]] (WAP) movement led by [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Susan Brownmiller]], and [[Robin Morgan]]. Therefore, the aim was to “move beyond debates about violence and pornography and to focus on sexuality apart from reproduction".&lt;ref name="Gould_1997" /&gt; It is important to notice that the Conference itself was not fully supported by the college itself, as Gould narrates in her autobiography.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Many Barnard faculty members dropped out of the planning committee. Days before the Conference itself, the then President of Barnard College, [[Ellen V. Futter]], began receiving phone calls and letters from WAP and other groups against the premise of the Conference.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The day before the conference was scheduled to begin, Barnard College officials—in response to phone calls from angry members of anti-pornography groups—confiscated 1500 copies of ''Diary of a Conference on Sexuality''.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/409150/pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Diary'', which was intended for distribution to conference participants, was a compilation of steering committee minutes, personal narratives, information about conference events, and work by feminist artists.&lt;ref name="Conference_2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Staff writer | title = Diary of a conference on sexuality | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 49-78 | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | doi = 10.1215/10642684-2010-016 | date = 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1215/10642684-2010-016 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Basiliere_2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Basiliere | first = Jenna | title = Political is personal: scholarly manifestations of the feminist sex wars | journal =Michigan Feminist Studies, special issue: Politics and Performativity | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1-25 | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | date = Fall 2009 | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.ark5583.0022.101 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.indiana.edu/~gender/people/papers/Jenna.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Angry letters and threats of losing funding were also major concerns. Despite all of the contention, the organizers went ahead with the event.

The day of the Conference itself was extremely controversial. The Conference was picketed by the [[Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography feminist]] group. WAP members picketed the conference and gave out handouts, leaflets and protests, wearing T-shirts with the words “For a Feminist Sexuality” on the front and “Against S/M” on the back.&lt;ref name="Gould_1997" /&gt; Accusations about the specific sexual practices of individual women involved in the conference were central to the outcry around the event.&lt;ref name="Basiliere_2009" /&gt; The Conference was very publicized in the news afterwards. Many articles and books have been inspired by this conference, the most famous being Carole Vance's ''Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality.''&lt;ref name="Wilson_1993" /&gt;

Since 1890, the French [[baccalauréat]] exam, required to receive a high school diploma, has traditionally scored students on a scale (Barème) of 0-20,&lt;ref name="penombre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olivier.hammam.free.fr/imports/penombre/lg7/lg07f.htm|title=Pénombre - LG n° 7 - C'est la note qui compte - Notes historiques|first=|last=Pénombre|website=olivier.hammam.free.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="20Min"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/societe/1499475-20141211-notation-eleves-1808-baccalaureat-evalue-boules-couleur|title=Notation des élèves: «En 1808, le baccalauréat était évalué avec des boules de couleur»|website=20minutes.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WESdocs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wenr.wes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/France-Docs1.pdf |title=Data |website=wenr.wes.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do most secondary school and university classes.  Although the traditional scale stops at 20/20, French [[baccalauréat]] results can be higher than 20/20 due to supplementary "options".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courrier-picard.fr/41356/article/2017-07-05/meilleure-note-en-picardie-2092-sur-20 |title=Meilleure note en Picardie : 20,92 sur 20 - Le Courrier Picard |language=fr|publisher=Courrier-picard.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/campus/article/2014/07/08/pour-avoir-plus-de-20-au-bac-mieux-valait-etre-en-s_4453344_4401467.html|title=Pour avoir plus de 20/20 au bac, mieux valait être en S|website=Lemonde.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; French universities traditionally grade in a stricter way than secondary schools, which means that students are unlikely to receive marks as high as they did in secondary school{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

Often, an average grade of 7-8 in [[classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|Preparatory Class for 'Grandes Écoles' (CPGE)]] can be considered as a satisfactory grade if the best grade in the class is only a 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letudiant.fr/etudes/classes-prepa/reussir-sa-prepa-les-reponses-a-vos-questions/en-prepa-dois-je-m-attendre-obligatoirement-a-une-chute-des-notes.html|title=En prépa, dois-je m’attendre obligatoirement à une chute des notes ?|website=Letudiant.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the French government began to explore possible conversion of the 0-20 grading scale to 0-4 or 0-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/education/article/2015/09/17/non-la-notation-de-0-a-20-ne-sera-pas-supprimee-du-moins-pas-tout-de-suite_4761575_1473685.html|title=La notation de 0 à 20 ne sera pas supprimée… du moins pas tout de suite|website=Lemonde.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/campus/article/2014/11/29/vers-une-revolution-de-l-evaluation-des-eleves_4531457_4401467.html|title=Vers une révolution de l’évaluation des élèves ?|website=Lemonde.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, the [[Education in France#Middle school and high school|College]] Gabriel-Séailles, a middle school in southern France, has abolished grading altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/education/article/2014/11/14/un-college-metamorphose-par-l-abandon-des-notes_4523650_1473685.html|title=Un collège métamorphosé par l’abandon des notes|website=Lemonde.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary schools generally use a 10-point grading scale or a letter grade.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The [[ECTS grading scale|European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) scale]] is gaining popularity in the post-secondary education system{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}, since it is the standard for comparing study performance throughout the [[European Union]]. The GPA grading scale is becoming more and more common as well, since it eases the comparison with American students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Some [[Grandes écoles]] use "exotic" systems, like [[Ecole Centrale de Lille]], which uses a three-letter scale system{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}:
* A: Excellent
* S: Satisfactory (''satisfaisant'')
* I: Fail (''insuffisant'')

==History==
In 12th Century Europe, students were evaluated by oral disputation in Latin. In the 14th century, some written examinations occurred, but were rare. By the 16th century the [[Catholic Church]] was struggling against the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], and trying to advance Catholic scholarship as a defense of doctrine, to which end [[Society of Jesus|The Society of Jesus]] was created, and with it Jesuit Colleges.&lt;ref name="maulini"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unige.ch/fapse/SSE/teachers/maulini/note.html|title=Les notes à l'école, idée folle ?|website=Unige.ch|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of which, the [[Collegio Romano]], published the [[Ratio Studiorum]] in 1599, a book of rules for Jesuit education in which official procedures for examinations, competitions, and homework were outlined along with a method for ranking and classifying students.&lt;ref name="maulini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonPenny2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert L. Johnson|author2=James A. Penny|author3=Belita Gordon|title=Assessing Performance: Designing, Scoring, and Validating Performance Tasks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuxdzkjyyKUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=10 October 2008|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60623-744-1|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Ancien Régime]] in France (15th-18th Centuries), oral examination was still the most common method of evaluating students.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/89081/notes-sur-20-ecole|title=A quand remontent les notes sur 20 à l'école?|date=27 June 2014|website=Salte.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1558, a school in Portugal was the first European school to distribute prizes to the best students, and by the end of the century other schools were following suit. By the end of the 18th century, schools in France were beginning to publish bulletins with student evaluations and class rankings and the Jesuite College at Caen would develop a numerical 4 point ranking ("4 niveaux: 1 = bien; 2 = assez bien; 3 = médiocre; 0 = mal").&lt;ref name="maulini" /&gt; Even in the early years of the [[Baccalauréat]] (created in 1808), the oral evaluation committee members expressed their appraisal of candidates with colored balls (Red for "favorable", white for "abstention", black for "unfavorable").&lt;ref name="senat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/r07-370/r07-3702.html|title=A quoi sert le baccalauréat ?|website=Senat.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="20Min" /&gt;  In the [[Second French Empire]], the representation of colored balls was converted into a numerical system of 0-5, and then in 1890&lt;ref name="penombre" /&gt; the numerical system of 0-20 was created along with the modern [[Baccalauréat|French baccalauréat]], which comprises several stages of written examinations&lt;ref name="lelievre"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.mediapart.fr/claude-lelievre/blog/240614/des-evolutions-de-notation-difficiles|title=Des évolutions de notation difficiles|first=Claude|last=Lelièvre|website=Blogs.mediapart.fr|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
In the student rebellions of, 1968, the bulletin of January 6, 1969&lt;ref name="penombre" /&gt; recommended a change from the 0-20 grading scale to a qualitative evaluation such as "very satisfactory", "unsatisfactory", etc., Or adopting a more general (A, B, C, D, E) letter system, or a simplified numerical system (1,2,3,4,5). Before the change could be fully implemented, the recommendation was reversed in a bulletin on  July 9, 1971 which recommended the continuation of the 0-20 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gimonnet|first1=Bertrand|title=Les notes à l'école ou le rapport à la notation des enseignants de l'école élémentaire|date=2007|publisher=L'Harmattan|location=Paris|isbn=978-2296024922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with American grades==
There is no exact formula for converting scores between the French 0-20 scale and American grades,&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consulfrance-miami.org/IMG/doc_Grade_conversion_table_Ambassade.doc |title=Grade conversion table |website=consulfrance-miami.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are several reasons why the systems are not entirely commensurate. For instance, some American institutions use [[Academic grading in the United States#Rank-based grading|Rank Based Grading]] and [[Grading on a curve|grading curves]], that is, shifting the grades of a class so that the highest scores align with the highest grades on the grading scale and the lowest scores align with the lowest grades on the scale or aligning the median achieved score within the class to a fixed point on the grading scale. Likewise some American institutions use [[Weighted GPA|weighted grades]], wherein grades for advanced classes are augmented in the official transcripts to compensate for the difficulty of the classes. French schools use neither,&lt;ref name="fulbright"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fulbright-france.org/sites/default/files/commonapp2016_0.pdf |title=Application |date=2016 |website=fulbright-france.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the result being that in a university, "perfect" 20s are never given,&lt;ref name="umn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facultypages.morris.umn.edu/~buchansb/Grade%20Conversion%20Scales.pdf |title=Grades |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; grades over 14 are extremely rare, and scores over 12 indicate that the student is in the top 10-20% of the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.campusfrance.org/en/page/academic-life-0+|title=Academic Life &gt; USA|website=Usa.campusfrance.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="umn" /&gt; About half of all French Law School students at Paris Sorbonne I maintain an average of 10-12,&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boston.consulfrance.org/IMG/pdf/Equivalences_diplomes_francais_aux_USA.pdf?3131/5c27b22ccaa12d400efbab6bd96fcef124c16151 |title=Info |website=boston.consulfrance.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the median grade at [[Cornell Law School]] is 3.35(B+),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/careers/employers/faq/grading.cfm|title=FAQ|first=Instructional and Web Services, Cornell Information|last=Technologies|website=Lawschool.cornell.edu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Duke University School of Law]] is 3.30 (B+),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/career/pdf/facts.pdf|title=Duke OCS|website=Law.duke.edu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[UC Davis School of Law]] is 3.25-3.35 (B/B+),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.ucdavis.edu/registrar/law-school-regulations.html|title=UC Davis School of Law - Registrar - Law School Regulations 2017-2018|website=law.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Columbia Law School]] it the median GPA is estimated at 3.4(B+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wwws-db.law.columbia.edu/lawnet/checkgrades/GradingGuidelinesFoundation.pdf|title=Data|website=wwws-db.law.columbia.edu|format=PDF}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br&gt; Even though no exact conversion exists between the two systems, there are several scales that approximate a conversion and many American universities require that grades from foreign institutions, such as grades in the French 20 point scale, be converted into the [[Academic grading in the United States#Numerical and Letter grades|American system]] on applications.&lt;ref name="duke"
&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gradschool.duke.edu/admissions/apply/gpa|title=GPA - Duke Graduate School|website=gradschool.duke.edu|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other sources suggest that students should not make their own calculations directly for the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/graduate-school-road-map/2013/06/14/3-concerns-of-international-grad-school-applicants |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025185256/https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/graduate-school-road-map/2013/06/14/3-concerns-of-international-grad-school-applicants |archive-date=2017-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Afterschool Alliance''' is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization in the United States whose mission is "to ensure that all children have access to affordable, quality afterschool programs."  It uses communications and advocacy strategies to increase public and private investments in [[After-school activity|afterschool programs]]. The Alliance serves as both a central resource center for afterschool programs, as well as a public advocate. The nation's leading voice for afterschool, the Afterschool Alliance is the only organization dedicated to raising awareness of the importance of afterschool programs and advocating for more afterschool investments. The Afterschool Alliance works with the Administration, the [[U.S. Congress]], governors, mayors and advocates across the country. The Afterschool Alliance has more than 25,000 afterschool program partners and its publications reach more than 65,000 interested individuals every month.

==History==
The Afterschool Alliance was established in 2000 by the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], the [[U.S. Department of Education]], [[J.C. Penney Company, Inc.]], the [[Open Society Institute]]/The After-School Corporation, the [[Entertainment Industry Foundation]] and the Creative Artists Agency Foundation.

The Afterschool Alliance grew from public awareness efforts undertaken by the Mott Foundation through a public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of Education to expand afterschool programs through the [[21st Century Community Learning Center|21st Century Community Learning Centers]] initiative. The federal government provided grants to local communities for afterschool programs, while the Mott Foundation funded training, evaluation and public awareness activities. The Foundation and the Department's efforts caught the attention of several outside entities with a shared interest in achieving afterschool for all. These groups came together in September 1999 to create the Afterschool Alliance, which was formally incorporated as a nonprofit in 2000.

Today, the Alliance works with a broad range of organizations and supporters, including policymakers and policymaker associations, advocacy groups, afterschool coalitions and providers at every level, business and philanthropic leaders, technical assistance organizations and leaders representing a variety of interests, each with a stake in afterschool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsor Organization: Afterschool Alliance |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=188 |work=Ad Council |accessdate=5 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211181232/http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=188 |archivedate=December 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alliance&gt;{{cite web|title=Afterschool Alliance|url=http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mott.org/~/media/pdfs/Legacy%20Publications/In%20Focus/MIFV2N3%20pdf.ashx{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.carecommute.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lights On Afterschool''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carecommute.net |title=Afterschool transportation |publisher=CareCommute |accessdate=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a nationwide rally to draw attention to the importance of afterschool programs and to highlight their importance to children, families and communities. Each year,  more than one million people attend over 7,500 events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's all happenin' after school in Long Beach |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thehomeroom/2008/10/its-all-happeni.html |work=LA Times |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519142423/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thehomeroom/2008/10/its-all-happeni.html |archivedate=May 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lights On Afterschool'' is covered in every major media market in the country and in thousands of news clips. ''Lights On Afterschool'' events give student participants in afterschool programs a chance to show off the skills that they have learned in their respective programs and to demonstrate the need for further support of such programming.
In 2001, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] became Honorary Chair of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making the Link: Evaluating Policy and Advocacy Grants |url=http://www.resourcelibrary.gcyf.org/sites/gcyf.org/files/resources/2009/gcyf_makingthelink_evaluation.pdf |work=Grantmakers for Children, Youth, and Families |publisher=GCYF |accessdate=30 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101165541/http://www.resourcelibrary.gcyf.org/sites/gcyf.org/files/resources/2009/gcyf_makingthelink_evaluation.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
On February 24, 2014, Representatives [[Dan Kildee]] (D-MI) and [[Rosa DeLauro]] (D-CT) introduced the Afterschool for America's Children Act in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The  legislation would reauthorize and strengthen the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) initiative—the nation’s chief federal funding stream for afterschool programs—by supporting innovative advances taking root in before-school, afterschool and summer learning programs. The bill was companion legislation to S. 326 introduced previously in the [[United States Senate]]. More than 110 national, state and local organizations signed a letter in support of the legislation, including: Afterschool Alliance, [[After-School All-Stars]], SHAPE America - Society of Health and Physical Educators (formally AAHPERD), [[American Camp Association]], [[American Heart Association]], [[Camp Fire (organization)|Camp Fire]], National Association of Elementary School Principals, [[National Education Association]], National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity, National Farm to School Network, [[National Science Teachers Association]], [[Save the Children]], and the [[United States Soccer Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter of Support|url=http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/HouseA4ACLetterOfSupport2014.pdf|publisher=Afterschool Alliance|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kildee reintroduced the legislation in the 114th Congress on February 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.1042 - Afterschool for America's Children Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1042|publisher=Congress.gov|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afterschool Alliance also spoke out in favor of the [[Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2013 (S. 1086; 113th Congress)]]. The bill would [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to provide [[block grant]]s to the states to help low-income parents find child care for their children.&lt;ref name=CoxSenateCCbill&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Ramsey|title=Senate passes child care bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/200746-senate-passes-child-care-bill|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reauthorizing the program, it amends the law to require background checks on grant recipients and annual inspections.&lt;ref name="CoxSenateCCbill"/&gt; The Afterschool Alliance supported the bill, saying "it is important to emphasize the value of quality school-age child care to achieve positive outcomes for children, including improved academic performance, work habits and study skills.&lt;ref name=AAblogKeller&gt;{{cite news|last=Keller|first=Sarah|title=Child Care Development Block Grant Act passes out of Senate HELP Committee|url=http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/afterschoolSnack/Child-Care-Development-Block-Grant-Act-passes-out-of-Senate_09-23-2013.cfm|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=Afterschool Alliance Blog|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational Activism ==
Born into a wealthy family in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], Forsyth felt the need to help under-represented people. Specifically, Forsyth was concerned with the problems of poverty and racism. She began her work helping this cause by creating the Anne C. Stauffer Foundation in 1967, which aimed to "promote the integration of southern preparatory schools".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Anne C.

[[File:August Endell.jpg|thumb|August Endell]]
'''August Endell''' (1871–1925) was a designer, writer, teacher, and German [[Jugendstil]] architect. He is also known as one of the founders of the Jugendstil movement, the German expressionist movement of [[Art Nouveau]]. His first marriage was with [[Baroness Elsa|Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]].

==Life==
August Endell was born on April 12, 1871, in Berlin. In 1892 Endell moved to [[Munich]], where he gave up his dream of being a teacher and instead became a scholar. He studied aesthetics, psychology and philosophy, German literature, and art at the [[University of Munich]]. He had the intention to pursue a doctorate degree in academics, but changed direction when he met [[Hermann Obrist]], who became a close friend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MOMA| url = http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=1727 | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate = 2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose work was characterized by expressive ornamentation of observed submarine flora and fauna. Although influenced and encouraged by Obrist, Endell was primarily concerned with translating his idea of mobile space into architecture and decorations. Endell expressed important ideas on the stylistic intention underlying the work of Jugendstil artists at the time.&lt;ref name="Buddensieg 1983 1–389"&gt;Buddensieg 1983 1–389"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 Endell joined the Initiative of Artistic Münchner Vereinigten Werkstätten für Kunst, and established himself as one of the innovators and leaders of the [[Kunstgewerbeschule|Kunstgewerbler]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, Irene. ''Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1900, Endell met Else Plötz (later the [[Baroness Elsa|Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]]), then an actress and aspiring artist who took private art lessons from him.&lt;ref name="Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 109"&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was married in a civil service on 22 August 1901 in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 109"/&gt; They had an [[open relationship]], and in 1902 Else Endell became romantically involved with a friend of Endell’s, the [[poet]] and [[translator]] Felix Paul Greve (later the [[Canadians|Canadian]] author [[Frederick Philip Grove]]). After the trio travelled together to [[Palermo]], [[Italy]], the Endells’ marriage disintegrated&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 129.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the pair divorced in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Gammel, ''Baroness Elsa'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Although their separation was acrimonious, and Freytag-Loringhoven dedicated several satirical poems to August Endell,&lt;ref&gt;Freytag-Loringhoven, Elsa von. ''Mein Mund ist lüstern / I Got Lusting Palate: Dada Verse''. Trans. and Ed. Irene Gammel. Berlin: Ebersback, 2005, 112–118.&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship was influential for both artists. Endell later married sculptor [[Anna Meyn]] (1882–1967), with whom he had a child. In 1918 Endell was appointed director of the Breslau Academy of Art, in which function he served until he fell ill and died on 13 April 1925 at the age of 54.

==Career==
Endell is noted for many designs. In 1897 he received his first commission, an important one that made him practically famous overnight: to design the façade of the [[Hofatelier Elvira|Atelier Elvira]] Photographic Studio in ([[Munich]]), which belonged to [[Hermann Obrist]].&lt;ref name="Buddensieg 1983 1–389"/&gt; HIs design included an abstract depiction of a dragon coming out of a wave like element. His use of curve lines implied a sense of calmness to the intricate and massive piece. Organic elements  further enforced with the decoration of coral. The building incorporated elements of styles by [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Hector Guimard]]. Unfortunately the Atelier Elvira was burned to the ground during World War II.

[[File:Joseph Sattler-PAN.jpg|left|thumb|Cover by [[Joseph Sattler]] for 1895/96 issue of ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'']]

In 1899, August Endell became co editor of the magazine ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', a literary magazine that was published from 1895 to 1900 in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref name="Buddensieg 1983 1–389"/&gt; The magazine played a key role in the development of the [[Art Nouveau]] movement as a whole, printing illustrations by both well-known and young upcoming artists. . Endell published one of his own essays titled, " Um die Schönheit,” in which Endell comments on how exhibitions of art, stressed from nature is not a set of design ideal for art. Then writing that, “ … we are on the threshold of not only the new style, but also the development of a completely new art. The art of applying forms of nothing insignificant, not representing anything, and not resembling anything… running deep into our souls, so deeply and so strongly as only music can do.&lt;ref name="Mahler"&gt;{{citation|last=Mahler|first=Astrid|title=A World of Forms from Nature: New Impulses for the Aesthetic of the Jugendstil|work=Visual Resources: An International Journal of Documentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;” Endell believed that art and style should be the power of direct impact in form on viewer’s personal feelings.  His opinions of art and style were highly valued by other artists of the time such as, [[Franz Stuck]], [[Lovis Corinth]], and [[Ernst Kirchner]]; being favored highly by futurist artist and expressionists.&lt;ref name="Mahler"/&gt;  In his essays, Endell paved the way for abstract art in Germany. Endell’s personal art theory was based on a psychological aesthetic of perception. He believed formal art should be separate from nature. He felt very strongly about art evoking strong feelings through freely invented forms, just as music does through sounds. Endell also contributed illustrations and decorative designs for wall reliefs, carpets, textiles, coverings, window glass and lamps  to the publication ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]''&lt;ref name="Buddensieg 1983 1–389"/&gt;

Not long after, in 1901, he contributed to the design of the Theater Bunte, in Berlin Germany, which has since been destroyed. Designing all the decorative elements, carpets, fabrics, and even the nails used in the building of the theater. Each area of the theater was painted a different diverse color, thus the name Theatre Bunte, Bunte meaning “colored.&lt;ref name="Mahler"/&gt;”

Endell was also responsible for the design of the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a notable courtyard complex in the centre of Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hackesche Höfe | url = http://www.berlin.de/orte/sehenswuerdigkeiten/hackesche-hoefe/index.en.php | publisher=Land Berlin | accessdate = 2011-05-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429164408/http://www.berlin.de/orte/sehenswuerdigkeiten/hackesche-hoefe/index.en.php| archivedate= April 29, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the design for a sanatorium in Wyk auf Föhr built in 1902. August Endell then went on to design several private homes and villas in the towns of Berlin and [[Potsdam]] in Germany.

All while working as a self-taught architect, Endell was continuously publishing articles, essays, and books on his thought of design. In 1908 he published the book The Beauty in the Big City. Within the book the vision of a modern city is developed through Endell’s artistic [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. He describes the city as taking place at the beginning of the 20th century. He describes the city as a place were work, culture, and art can all be exchanged. A few additional [[architectural]] designs August Endell worked on were; 1912 design of the Racecourse Gallop of Mariendorf, 1912 the Trabrennbahn in Berlin Germany, and in 1914 the temporary location of the exhibition of Deutscher Werkbund.

August Endell was a designer and an architect. From there he moved on to the idea of a new visual art and began creating fine art works that were architecturally structured while still expressing the qualities of other forms of art.
He began creating and building things such as gates, arches, stairway rails, and other decorative wall elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29702">The '''Bilingual Education Act (BEA)''' ({{USStat|81|816}}), also known as '''Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1967''' ({{USPL|90|247}}), approved by the [[90th United States Congress]] on January 2, 1968, and was the first [[United States]] [[Act of Congress|federal legislation]] recognized the needs of [[Limited English proficiency|limited English speaking ability]] (LESA) students. The BEA was introduced in 1967 by Texas senator [[Ralph Yarborough]] and was signed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on January 2, 1968. While some states, such as California and Texas, and numerous local [[school districts]] around the country already had policies and programs designed to meet the special educational needs of [[Primary education in the United States|elementary]] and [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary]] school students not [[language proficiency|fluent]] in the English language, this act signaled that the federal government now also recognized the need for and value of bilingual education programs in [[State school#United States|U.S. public education]]. Passed on the heels of the Civil Rights movement, its purpose was to provide school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=1|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural implications==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
The BEA was a significant piece of education legislation. Its passage signaled "a shift from the notion that students should be afforded equal educational opportunity to the idea that educational policy should work to equalize academic outcomes, even if such equity demanded providing different learning environments."&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010):408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it reflected changes in cultural perspectives towards diversity and immigration. The BEA was an important shift away from the late 1950s anticommunist sentiment where anything foreign was suspect, which had destroyed many earlier local and state attempts at bilingual education.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010): 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it recognized that the federal government was responsible for educating immigrants to the US and opened doors for bilingual education projects on local, state, and federal levels.

Furthermore, this legislation, successfully enacted into law largely thanks to the efforts of Spanish speakers, has become an important part of the "polemic between assimilation and multiculturalism" and the role that language education in our society.&lt;ref&gt;Wiese, Ann-Marie and Eugene E. Garcia. "The Bilingual Education Act: Language Minority Students and Equal Educational Opportunity." Bilingual Research Journal, 22 (1998):3.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the BEA in its original form promoted celebrating linguistic and cultural differences and diversity in the U.S., it in many ways challenged assimilationist theories and the "melting pot" concept of the U.S. And yet, in its final form when passed, it did not mention the important link between language and culture, leaving the language vague.

The act additionally opened up a larger need for teachers who could teach language and other content within a language besides English.  This placed a strain on the teaching pool available in 1968 and even today there is a shortage of teachers for these highly specialized positions.   Culturally, it was argued in this time period that by teaching in a certain language it also taught specific values instead of just a way of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, Armando "Bilingual Education and the Foreign Language Teacher." Paper presented at the National Convention of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (50th, San Antonio, Texas, August 28–30, 1968)., 8 (1968), http://search.proquest.com/docview/64405323&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation and funding==
When Senator Yarborough introduced the bill to the Senate in 1967, he envisioned it as a way of addressing the "'poor performance in school and high dropout rates... and great psychological harm' caused by 'English-only policies, no Spanish-speaking rules, and cultural degradation'" that was evident in many schools at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peadbody Journal of Education, 85: 406, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the passage of the act was a bipartisan effort on behalf of Republicans and Democrats, it underwent significant changes between 1967 and 1968. Many of these changes were in the wording and framing of the act, which ultimately did not recognize the importance of biculturalism or the benefit of bilingualism or even the link between language and culture. Rather, it framed students of LESA as a "problem" that needed to be fixed. In addition, unlike what Yarborough had conceived, it provided no funding for permanent programs regarding students of LESA, as many people feared promoting a sense of entitlement in students and families benefitting from the act.

The BEA provided school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability. The grants that the act provided were given directly to school districts and were to be used to buy resources for educational programs, to train teachers and teachers' aides, to develop and distribute materials and to create meaningful parental involvement projects. Although the act did not require the use of bilingual instruction or the use of a student's native language, its aim was to encourage innovative programs designed to teach students English. The act also gave school districts the opportunity to provide bilingual education programs without violating segregation laws, but at this time, participation was voluntary. Program effectiveness was evaluated at the end of every year and successful programs were eligible to receive federal funding for up to five years.

Because the BEA funding was provided in the form of grants, most of the financial clout lay with local and state education agencies (LEAs and SEAs). However, the federal government limited the reach of these funds in a few significant ways. To begin with, from a simple framing standpoint, the original 1968 BEA did not include any mention of instruction in or maintenance of a student's native language, limiting the potential impact of the act.

From a financial perspective, the BEA was also limited. The only programs eligible for receiving funding were programs for children between the ages of 3 and 8. Because it was meant to redress the dropout issue, the act with this caveat on funding viewed high school students of LESA somewhat of a lost cause. In addition, the act did not fund any permanent programs for educating students of LESA, but only funding exploratory programs. As a result, it did not seek to truly address the burgeoning issue of how to educate students who were not English dominant. Lastly, the funds were at first reserved for communities whose average income was below the poverty line stated in the ESEA ($3,000 in 1968). This limitation on funding had the unfortunate side effect of framing the act as a somewhat of a handout to poor, Latino communities.&lt;ref&gt;Petrzela, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California." Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010): 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to many of these limitations and the vague wording of much of the BEA, funding was limited in the first three years to $85 million. By 1972, "only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a Title VII-funded program."&lt;ref&gt;Petrzala, Natalia M. "Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California. Peabody Journal of Education, 85: 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendments to the Bilingual Education Act==

===1974 amendments===
The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 was not specific and participation by school districts was voluntary. As a result, Civil rights activists argued that the rights of minority-language students were being violated under this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=1|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, three amendments were made to the original act in an attempt to clarify the intent and design of programs designated for the education of LESA students. There were two significant events that impacted these changes: the Lau V. Nichols case and the Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1974.

''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'' was a class-action suit brought against the San Francisco School District and alleged that due to their inability to speak English, there were 1,800 Chinese students who were being denied an equal education. In 1974, the Supreme Court overruled the ruling of the lower courts and determined that the same resources, teachers and curriculum did not imply that the education was equal for students who had a limited command of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing Programs for English Language Learners: Lau v. Nichols|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|publisher=Office for Civil Rights|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year as the Supreme Court's ruling, the Equal Education Opportunity Act was passed. By citing instructional programs as the means through which language barriers were to be broken, it effectively extended the Lau ruling to all students and school districts. Furthermore, school districts were required to have special programs for LESA students regardless of federal or state funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=3|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments in 1974 served to do the following: 
* define "Bilingual Education Program" as one that provided instruction in English and in the native language of the student to allow the student to progress effectively through the educational system
* define the program's goal to prepare LESA students to participate effectively in the regular classroom as quickly as possible while simultaneously maintaining the native language and culture of the student
* create regional support centers of consultants and trainers to provide support to school systems
* stipulate capacity-building efforts by providing funds to school districts' efforts to expand curricula, staff and research for bilingual programs
Funding increased from $7.5 million in 1968 to $68 million and as a result, programs were able to impact 368,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=4|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978 amendments===
In 1978, further amendments were made to extend the act and broaden the definition of eligible students. Specifically, these amendments served to do the following:  
* emphasize the strictly transitional nature of native language instruction
* expand eligibility to students who are [[limited English proficient]] (LEP)
* permit  enrollment of English-speaking students in bilingual programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Federal and State Law Impacting Language Minority Students|url=http://www2.sfasu.edu/enlace/modules/Chronology%20of%20Federal%20Law%20Guiding%20ELL%20Policy%20and%20Practice%20from%20TEA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding increased from $68 million in 1974 to $135 million which was enough to provide funding for 565 school districts and for secondary programs including service centers, graduate school fellowships and training for undergraduate students interested in becoming bilingual educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|volume=6|pages=5|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984 amendments===
In 1984, the Bilingual Education Act was further modified. The amendments enacted during this time served to: 
* increase the flexibility in the implementation of programs for LEP students by providing school districts with more autonomy and independence in deciding how these students should be taught
* allow school districts to apply for funding for different, innovative programs that best met the needs of their students&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Federal and State Law and Policy Impacting Language Minority Students|url=http://www2.sfasu.edu/enlace/modules/Chronology%20of%20Federal%20Law%20Guiding%20ELL%20Policy%20and%20Practice%20from%20TEA.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for these amendments was $139.4 million and there was a heavy emphasis placed on districts using the funding to build enough capacity to eventually be able to support LEP programs without federal government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Manzanares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|pages=6|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 amendments===
The BEA was amended again in 1988. The changes this year served to:
* increase funding to state education agencies
* expand funding for "special alternative" programs
* create fellowship programs for professional training&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Funding for the 1988 amendments was $159 million, with regulations for how the money should be divided. Specifically, at least 60% should be spent developing programs and at least 25% of funds should be spent on training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewner-Kajzajares|first=Gloria|title=Bilingual Education Act: Twenty Years Later|journal=National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education|date=Fall 1988|pages=9|url=http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415073628/http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/files/rcd/BE021037/Fall88_6.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994 reauthorization===
The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) reauthorization in 1994 maintained the same tenets as the original BEA,  introduced new grant categories, set up preference to programs promoting bilingualism, and took into account indigenous languages.  Overall, the premise of this addition was to introduce a more systemic reform.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiese|first=Ann-Marie|title=The Bilingual Education Act:Language minority students and equal educational opportunity|journal=Bilingual Research Journal|date=Winter 1998|pages=22|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/222023139|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Priority given to bilingualism programs: Though the Bilingual Education Act legislation did not prescribe specific instructional practices, it did provide a guide to help language minority students.  The 1994 reauthorization gave preference to grant applications that developed bilingual proficiency, which Local Education Agencies had the right to develop themselves based on the guidelines of the BEA.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*In the FY2000 691 Bilingual Education Instructional Service Grants were given out totaling just over $162 million.  The largest grants in FY2000 were given to the state of California and New York at approximately $58 million and $22.5 million respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osorio-O’Dea|first=Patricia|title=Bilingual Education:  An Overview|journal=CRS Report for Congress|date=June 2001|pages=12|url=http://www.policyalmanac.org/education/archive/bilingual.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1994 California Proposition 187 was introduced in order to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining state provided health care, social services and public education.  This was voted on by the public and became a law in November 1994.  Citizens challenged the constitutionality of this proposition and in March 1998 it was ruled unconstitutional and was taken away.  Though the law did not last, it impacted students who were ELL throughout the mid-to-late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cerda|first=Natalie|title=Bilingual Education Legislative Timeline|year=2006|url=http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm|accessdate=11 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920181947/http://cerdahdz.webs.com/legislationtimeline.htm|archivedate=20 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant court decisions==
*''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' was the first U.S. Supreme Court case that addressed American education of foreign-languages.  This case did away with a Nebraska law that prevented public and private schools from offering instruction in any language but English. '"The protection of the [U.S.] Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue," Supreme Court Justice James C. McReynolds wrote. The decision established the principle that parents have a constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children, including their education.'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Mark|title=BELLs and the Law: Statues and Precedents|journal= Education Week|date=Jan 8, 2009|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'' was a case brought forward, in which Chinese-American students attending a public school in San Francisco alleged that the failure to provide bilingual instruction to all non-English speaking students violated their rights to education due to limited English comprehension.  The case did not create a specific remedy, yet in conjunction with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], ruled in favor of the students, thus expanding the rights of students with limited English proficiency.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Joseph|title=Bilingual Education and the Law: An Overview|journal=Dissemination Center for Bilingual Bicultural Education|year=1976|pages=25|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/63668329|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Serna v. Portales was a case that dictated when a "substantial group" of students with limited English proficiency was present, bilingual education was required.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
*Aspira v. N.Y. Board of Education required testing for students in English and their native language in order to understand if they should receive additional services and bilingual education.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
*Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado stated that students should receive instruction in their native language and English until proficiency in English is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes v. School District No.1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U.S. 189|(1973)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0413_0189_ZS.html| n.d. 9 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*Flores v. Arizona stated that Arizona must do more to fund instruction for ELL students.  The Arizona courts rejected tenets of the NCLB law that changed the services provided to ELL students.  This case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Mark|title=ELLs and the Law: Statues and Precedents|journal= Education Week|date=Jan 8, 2009|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Castaneda v. Pickard in 1981 created a basis for pedagogically addressing Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students.  It required that districts have a plan for addressing LEP students, that schools provide qualified staff to implement that plan, and that the district has developed an effective evaluation protocol for the program.  Though this case did create a more structured plan pedagogically it did not require bilingual education programs to meet these same standards. "It required only that 'appropriate action to overcome language barriers' be taken through well implemented programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kerper Mora Ed.D|first=Jill|title=LEGAL HISTORY OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION: Federal Law|publisher=San Diego State University|date=Jan 26, 2005|url=http://www.moramodules.com/Pages/HistoryBE.htm|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bilingual Education Act and No Child Left Behind==
No Child Left Behind (NCLB), passed in 2002, had a significant impact on bilingual education and the Bilingual Education Act in the United States due to its emphasis on high-stakes testing. As a result of NCLB and its emphasis on testing, the Bilingual Education Act was renamed the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act.

The name change alone of BEA under NCLB is significant in that it signals a shift in the philosophical approach to bilingual education. Essentially, even though the act still leaves with state and local educators the ability to choose from instructional methods, "the statement of purpose and accountability requirements make clear that the primary objective is English acquisition."&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Rachel F. "Bilingual Education Act: Equal Education Opportunities: History, Politics, Theory, and Practice. JRank. JRank. n.d. 9 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Under NCLB, school success and failure is linked to performance on standardized tests. However, this measure subjects English Language Learners (ELLs) "to critical assessments without adequate preparation."&lt;ref&gt;Hilner, Benjamin. "'Bad Policy and Bad Law'": The Shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act in Bilingual Educational POlicy and its Frustration of the Equal Protection Clause." Educational Law Consortium Journal. (2005): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of preparation is due to the fact that NCLB caps funding for bilingual education programs at half of what it had been and does not require that any bilingual education programs undergo periodic evaluation, a measure required by the ''Castenada v. Pickard'' court case. And yet, despite this lack of preparation, ELLs performance on standardized tests can jeopardize a school's access to funding. In essence, "This turns the question of whether or not a school receives a failing label into a question of how many ELLs attend."&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Hilner, Benjamin. "'Bad Policy and Bad Law'": The Shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act in Bilingual Educational Policy and its Frustration of the Equal Protection Clause." Educational Law Consortium Journal. (2005): 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the impact of NCLB on ELLs has significant implications on ELLs and their communities' access to education, NCLB is in conflict with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in that it denies "access to a federally funded program based on their skin color or race."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  The changes in the BEA under NCLB created a grant program that attempted to enhance English language acquisition.  The ruling placed ELL students in a similar classroom environment as their peers for whom English is not a second language.  The law did not require schools to provide bilingual programs and placed them against the rigorous content standards put in place by State Education Agencies. When ELLs were tested with the same state assessments or the National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), it was shown that compared to their fluently English-speaking peers the ELL students displayed larger deficits in both reading and math.  The 2007 NAEP test, showed increased deficits in both math and reading following a surge of the ELL population in the United States.  By 2005 the number of English-learners throughout the US had risen 57% over the prior decade to approximately 5.1 million students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zehr, Mary Ann|title=English-Learners Pose Policy Puzzle |journal=Education Week|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/01/08/17ell.h28.html |date= 8 January 2009 |volume=28 |issue=17 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After NCLB was enacted it was shown that there were sufficient numbers of prospective teachers, yet there were insufficient numbers of these teachers entering certain fields.  Among these specializations were science, math, foreign languages, special education and namely bilingual education.  Several initiatives formed to specifically recruit teachers to these specialization fields and allowed for alternative certification paths.  These teacher shortages continue to exist today and are seen to a greater extent in high-poverty districts.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, Roselia. "TEACHER QUALITY AS A PREDICTOR OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN URBAN SCHOOLS: A NATIONAL FOCUS." Educational Law Consortium Journal.  The Lamar University – Electronic Journal of Student Research (2006): 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The act and NCLB say that the accommodations that it provides should be interpreted in concordance with federal civil rights laws.  "As interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and federal civil rights officials, these provisions rely on terms like “affirmative steps” and “appropriate action” that give school districts the discretion to use a range of instructional approaches. As a result, under both Title VI and the EEOA, courts and federal enforcement agencies must decide on a case-by-case basis whether programs are in fact overcoming linguistic barriers to full participation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Moran, Rachel F.|title=Bilingual Education Act Equal Educational Opportunities Act, Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory, and Practice |url=http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/3644/Bilingual-Education-Act.html |date= 11 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy still remains highly debated at both the state and federal level.

'''Burgundy Farm Country Day School''' is an independent school on a {{convert|25|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus in the Alexandria neighborhood of [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], and {{convert|500|acre|km2}} in [[West Virginia]]. It serves students in grades Junior Kindergarten through Eighth Grade. 

== History == 
The school was founded in 1946 by a group of concerned parents, which included some [[Quakers]] and also included noted CBS broadcast journalist [[Eric Sevareid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Douglas S.|title=Building the Federal Schoolhouse: Localism and the American Education State|date=2014|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0199838486|page=101|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EZFtAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;ots=lg4IZPLmWg&amp;dq=burgundy%20farm%20country%20day%20school%20sevareid&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Lois. In 1950, Burgundy became the first school in the Commonwealth of Virginia to [[racial integration|racially integrate]] and worked actively to attract non-white students.&lt;ref name="wapo_tolerance"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/06/15/a-lesson-in-tolerance/b5b06a1a-b992-4e5b-860b-be2444c76398/| title=A Lesson in Tolerance| publisher=The Washington Post| date=2000-06-15| accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The school's main campus is located on a former dairy farm just outside the [[Washington, DC]]/[[Northern Virginia]] [[Capital Beltway|beltway]].

==Center for Wildlife Studies==
Burgundy's second campus, a {{convert|524|acre|adj=on}} wildlife preserve in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in West Virginia called the '''Burgundy Center for Wildlife Studies''', is commonly referred to as "the Cove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.burgundyfarm.org/about/our-campuses| title=Burgundy Farm Campuses| accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All classes, beginning with first grade, visit the Cove for intensive study in science and natural history biannually.
 
The Cove recently acquired another {{convert|24|acre}}, from landowners surrounding the property. The funding for the purchase of these extra 24 acres came from "The Big Hike", in which a Burgundy teacher, sometimes accompanied by students, hiked from his home in Alexandria to The Cove.

==Summer Camps==
The two campuses both offer a summer camp with open enrollment. The main campus is a summer day camp for 3 years, 8 months to 12 years old. The Burgundy Center campus hosts primarily sleep-away nature-oriented summer camp programs for 8 to 15 year olds and adults.

'''Charles Sanders Peirce''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɜr|s}}&lt;ref&gt;"Peirce", in the case of C. S. Peirce, always rhymes with the English-language word "terse" and so, in most dialects, is pronounced exactly like the English-language word "{{audio|en-us-purse.ogg|purse}}". See {{cite news |url=http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/news/1_3/13_4x.htm#pronunciation |title=Note on the Pronunciation of 'Peirce' |website=Peirce Project Newsletter |volume=1 |issue=3–4 |date=December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; "purse"; 10&amp;nbsp;September 1839 – 19&amp;nbsp;April 1914) was an American [[philosopher]], [[logic]]ian, [[mathematics|mathematician]], and [[science|scientist]] who is sometimes known as "the father of [[pragmatism]]". He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, [[scientific method|scientific methodology]], and [[semiotics]], and for his founding of [[pragmatism]].

An innovator in mathematics, [[statistics]], philosophy, research [[methodology]], and various sciences, Peirce considered himself,  first and foremost, a [[logic]]ian. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]]. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among [[logical positivists]] and proponents of [[philosophy of language]] that dominated 20th&amp;nbsp;century Western philosophy; additionally, he defined the concept of [[abductive reasoning]], as well as rigorously formulated [[mathematical induction]] and [[deductive reasoning]]. As early as 1886 he saw that [[logic gate|logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits]]; the same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.&lt;ref name=P2M&gt;{{cite book |author=Peirce, C.

==Life==
[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce's birthplace building.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Peirce's birthplace. Now part of [[Lesley University]]'s Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences]]
Peirce was born at 3 Phillips Place in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and [[Benjamin Peirce]], himself a professor of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Harvard University]] and perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Very strong argument, should require citation}} At age&amp;nbsp;12, Charles read his older brother's copy of [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Elements of Logic'', then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max, "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v1/v1intro.htm Introduction]", ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 1:xvii, find phrase "One episode".&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to earn the [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] and [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] (1862) from Harvard; in 1863 the [[Lawrence Scientific School]] awarded him a [[B.Sc.]] that was Harvard's first ''summa cum laude'' [[chemistry]] degree;&lt;ref&gt;"Peirce, Charles Sanders" (1898), ''The National Cyclopedia of American Biography'', v. 8, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1uI-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=%22Peirce%2C%20Charles%22 p. 409].&lt;/ref&gt; and otherwise his academic record was undistinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Chauncey Wright]], and [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=363–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his Harvard instructors, [[Charles William Eliot]], formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This opinion proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard 1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life—repeatedly vetoed Harvard's employing Peirce in any capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=19–20, 53, 75, 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous condition then known as "facial neuralgia", which would today be diagnosed as [[trigeminal neuralgia]]. His biographer, Joseph Brent, says that when in the throes of its pain "he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made his life's later years so tragic.

===Early employment===
Between 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]] and its successor, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]],&lt;ref name=Burch&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2010), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Charles Sanders Peirce]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the latter's death in 1880. That employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the [[American Civil War]]; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the [[Boston Brahmin]] Peirces sympathized with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Survey, he worked mainly in [[geodesy]] and [[gravimetry]], refining the use of [[pendulum]]s to determine small local variations in the [[Earth]]'s [[gravity]].&lt;ref name=Burch/&gt;  He was elected a resident fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in January 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Survey sent him to Europe five times,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a [[solar eclipse]]; there, he sought out [[Augustus De Morgan]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], and [[William Kingdon Clifford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an Assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of [[star]]s and the shape of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=SP2&gt;Moore, Edward C., and Robin, Richard S., eds., (1964), ''Studies in the Philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce, Second Series'', Amherst: U. of Massachusetts Press. On Peirce the astronomer, see Lenzen's chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 1877 he was elected a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the [[meter]] as so many [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] of a certain [[frequency]],&lt;ref&gt;Fisch, Max (1983), "Peirce as Scientist, Mathematician, Historian, Logician, and Philosopher", ''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'' (new edition), see p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; the kind of definition employed [[Metre#Standard wavelength of krypton-86 emission|from 1960 to 1983]].

During the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}} Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands during 1883–1909, on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic ''[[Century Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep Peirce Edition Project (UQÀM) – in short] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211228/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep |date=2011-07-06 }}" from [[#PEP|PEP-UQÀM]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, an investigation by the [[William B. Allison|Allison]] Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent [[Julius Hilgard]] and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Nathan, "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v5/v5intro.htm Introduction]", ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 5:xxviii–xxix, find "Allison".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]]'s request.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never again held regular employment.

===Johns Hopkins University===
In 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at [[Johns Hopkins University]], which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy ([[Josiah Royce|Royce]] and [[John Dewey|Dewey]] completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by [[G. Stanley Hall]] and studied by [[Joseph Jastrow]], who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by [[J. J. Sylvester]], who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University]]'' (1883) contained works by himself and [[Allan Marquand]], [[Christine Ladd-Franklin|Christine Ladd]], [[Benjamin Ives Gilman]], and [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]], several of whom were his graduate students.&lt;ref name=grads&gt;Houser, Nathan (1989), "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v4/v4intro.htm Introduction]",  ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 4:xxxviii, find "Eighty-nine".&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held.

Brent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, [[Simon Newcomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=150–54, 195, 279–80, 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as “his difficult personality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Keith Devlin]] believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.&lt;ref name="devlin_2000"/&gt;

Peirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, [[Melusina Fay Peirce|Harriet Melusina Fay]] ("Zina"), left him in 1875,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=98–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with [[Juliette Peirce|Juliette]], whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nationality (she spoke French&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;) remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Nathan, "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v6/v6intro.htm Introduction]", ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 6, first paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=123, 368}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=150–51, 368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success.&lt;ref&gt;In 1885 ({{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=369}}); in 1890 and 1900 (p. 273); in 1891 (pp. 215–16); and in 1892 (pp. 151–52, 222).&lt;/ref&gt; He had no children by either marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===

[[File:Gravestone Charles Sanders Peirce and Juliette Peirce.jpg|thumb|Charles and Juliette Peirce's grave]]

In 1887 Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy {{convert|2000|acre|km2|0}} of rural land near [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], which never yielded an economic return.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=191–92, 217, 270, 318, 321, 337.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peirces named the property "[[Juliette Peirce#Arisbe|Arisbe]]". There they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=369–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles writing prolifically, much of it unpublished to this day (see [[#Works|Works]]). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the [[verso]] side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people, including his brother [[James Mills Peirce]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his neighbors, relatives of [[Gifford Pinchot]], settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' (with whose editor, [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]], he became friendly). He did translations for the [[Smithsonian Institution]], at its director [[Samuel Langley]]'s instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=249–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began but did not complete a number of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed him to the [[Assay Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge [[Francis C. Russell]] of Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced Peirce to editor [[Paul Carus]] and owner [[Edward C. Hegeler]] of the pioneering American philosophy journal ''[[The Monist]]'', which eventually published at least 14 articles by Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many texts in [[James Mark Baldwin]]'s ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Peirce's definitions in the Baldwin|Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]]'' (1901–1905); half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]] under his supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=374–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He applied in 1902 to the newly formed [[Carnegie Institution]] for a grant to write a systematic book of his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis, Newcomb, served on the Institution's executive committee, and its President had been the President of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=279–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend [[William James]], dedicating his ''Will to Believe'' (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=261–64, 290–92, 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|pp=306–07,  315–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used "Santiago" ("St. James" in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See [[Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce]] for discussion and references).

Peirce died destitute in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], twenty years before his widow. Juliette Peirce kept the urn with Peirce’s ashes at Arisbe. In 1934, Pennsylvania Governor [[Gifford Pinchot]] arranged for Juliette’s burial on Milford Cemetery. The urn with Peirce’s ashes was interred with Juliette.&lt;ref&gt;In 2018, plans have been made to erect a memorial monument for Peirce at the site of burrial – see: Justin Weinberg, [http://dailynous.com/2018/03/14/proper-memorial-monument-peirce/ 'A Proper Memorial Monument for Peirce'], website ''[[Daily Nous]]'', March 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery, the American Civil War, and racism===
Peirce grew up in a home where the supremacy of the white Anglo-Saxon male was taken for granted and Negro slavery was considered natural.&lt;ref name=Brent&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brent|first1=Joseph|title=Charles Sanders Peirce, a life|date=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=978-0253211613|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the outbreak of the Civil War his father described himself as a [[Secession in the United States|secessionist]], but after the outbreak of the war, this stopped and he became a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] partisan, providing donations to the Sanitary Commission, the leading Northern war charity. No members of the Peirce family volunteered or enlisted.
Peirce shared his father's views and liked to use the following syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic.&lt;ref name=Menand1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menand|first1=Louis|title=The Metaphysical Club|date=2001|publisher=Flamingo|location=London|isbn=978-0007126903|pages=161–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See: [[Peirce's law#Other proofs of Peirce's law]]''.

==Reception==
[[Bertrand Russell]] (1959) wrote,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1959), ''Wisdom of the West'', p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; "Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century, and certainly the greatest American thinker ever." (Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', published from 1910 to 1913, does not mention Peirce; Peirce's work was not widely known until later.)&lt;ref name=Anellis&gt;Anellis, Irving H. (1995), "Peirce Rustled, Russell Pierced: How Charles Peirce and Bertrand Russell Viewed Each Other's Work in Logic, and an Assessment of Russell's Accuracy and Role in the Historiography of Logic", ''Modern Logic'' 5, 270–328. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/anellis/csp&amp;br.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. N. Whitehead]], while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own "process" thinking. (On Peirce and [[process metaphysics]], see Lowe 1964.&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt;) [[Karl Popper]] viewed Peirce as "one of the greatest philosophers of all times".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl (1972), ''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]&lt;ref&gt;See Royce, Josiah, and Kernan, W. Fergus (1916), "Charles Sanders Peirce", ''The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Method'' v. 13, pp. 701–09. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/royce/cspobit.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; admired him, and [[Cassius Jackson Keyser]] at Columbia and [[C. K. Ogden]] wrote about Peirce with respect, but to no immediate effect.

The first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], the editor of an anthology of Peirce's writings titled ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CLL|Chance, Love, and Logic]]'' (1923) and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings.&lt;ref&gt;Ketner ''et al.'' (1986), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#cb|Comprehensive Bibliography]]'', see p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dewey]] studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins&lt;ref name=grads/&gt; and, from 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' is much influenced by Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;Hookway, Christopher (2008), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/ Pragmatism]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the first six volumes of ''Collected Papers'' (1931–1935), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brent|1998|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and [[T. A. Goudge|Goudge]] (1950), the 1941 Ph.D. thesis by [[Arthur W. Burks]] (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The [[#CSPS|Charles S. Peirce Society]] was founded in 1946. Its ''Transactions'', an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce, pragmatism, and American philosophy, has appeared since 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/pages.php?pID=94&amp;CDpath=4|title=Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society|website=Indiana University Press Journals|language=en|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to [[transactionalism]]).

In 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics [[Carolyn Eisele]] (1902–2000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her 40 years of research on Peirce the mathematician and scientist, culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and [[history of ideas|historian of ideas]] [[Max Fisch]] (1900–1995) emerged as an authority on Peirce; Fisch (1986)&lt;ref name=Fisch&gt;Fisch, Max (1986), ''Peirce, Semeiotic, and Pragmatism'', Kenneth Laine Ketner and Christian J. W. Kloesel, eds., Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana U. Pr.&lt;/ref&gt; includes many of his relevant articles, including a wide-ranging survey (Fisch 1986: 422–48) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983.

Peirce has gained a significant international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and [[pragmatism]] in Brazil ([[#CIEP|CeneP/CIEP]]), Finland ([[#HPRC|HPRC]] and [[#CDPT|{{Not a typo|Commens}}]]), Germany ([[#IRGAI|Wirth's group]], [[#RGSEME|Hoffman's and Otte's group]], and Deuser's and Härle's group&lt;ref&gt;Theological Research Group in C.S. Peirce's Philosophy (Hermann Deuser, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen; Wilfred Härle, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany).&lt;/ref&gt;), France ([[#LIRSCE|L'I.R.S.C.E.]]), Spain ([[#GEP|GEP]]), and Italy ([[#CSPI|CSP]]). His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirceans of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the [[University of Toronto]]'s, thanks in good part to the leadership of [[T. A. Goudge|Thomas Goudge]] and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at [[IUPUI|Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]], home of the [[#PEP|Peirce Edition Project]] (PEP), and the [[Pennsylvania State University]].

==Works==
Peirce's reputation rests largely on a number of academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as ''Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'', the ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', ''[[The Monist]]'', ''[[Popular Science]] Monthly'', the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', ''Memoirs of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', and others. See [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime|Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime]] for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Burks|Burks, Arthur]], Introduction, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 7, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; was ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#PR|Photometric Researches]]'' (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited ''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'' (1883), containing chapters by himself and his [[#GS|graduate students]]. Besides lectures during his years (1879–1884) as Lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Lectures by Peirce|Lectures by Peirce]].

[[Harvard University]] obtained from Peirce's widow soon after his death the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Robin, Richard S. (1967), ''[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/robin/robin.htm Annotated Catalogue of the Papers of Charles S. Peirce]''. Amherst MA: [[University of Massachusetts Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; catalogued this ''[[Nachlass]]'' did it become clear that Peirce had left approximately 1650 unpublished manuscripts, totaling over 100,000&amp;nbsp;pages,&lt;ref&gt;"The manuscript material now (1997) comes to more than a hundred thousand pages. These contain many pages of no philosophical interest, but the number of pages on philosophy certainly number much more than half of that. Also, a significant but unknown number of manuscripts have been lost." — Joseph Ransdell (1997), "Some Leading Ideas of Peirce's Semiotic", [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/ransdell/leading.htm#note2 end note 2], 1997 light revision of 1977 version in ''Semiotica'' 19:157–78.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly still unpublished except [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#mf|on microfilm]].

The first published anthology of Peirce's articles was the one-volume ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CLL|Chance, Love and Logic: Philosophical Essays]]'', edited by [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], 1923, still in print. [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Other collections|Other one-volume anthologies]] were published in 1940, 1957, 1958, 1972, 1994, and 2009, most still in print. The main posthumous editions&lt;ref&gt;See for example "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/collections.html Collections of Peirce's Writings]" at ''Commens'', U. of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; of Peirce's works in their long trek to light, often multi-volume, and some still in print, have included:

1931–1958: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' (CP), 8 volumes, includes many published works, along with a selection of previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence. This long-time standard edition drawn from Peirce's work from the 1860s to 1913 remains the most comprehensive survey of his prolific output from 1893 to 1913. It is organized thematically, but texts (including lecture series) are often split up across volumes, while texts from various stages in Peirce's development are often combined, requiring frequent visits to editors' notes.&lt;ref&gt;See 1987 review by B. Kuklick (of ''Peirce'' by Christopher Hookway), in ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science''v. 38, n. 1, pp. 117–19.

1975–1987: [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CN|''Charles Sanders Peirce: Contributions to'' The Nation]], 4 volumes, includes Peirce's more than 300 reviews and articles published 1869–1908 in ''[[The Nation]]''. Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner and James Edward Cook, online.

1976: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce]]'', 4 volumes in 5, included many previously unpublished Peirce manuscripts on mathematical subjects, along with Peirce's important published mathematical articles. Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.

1977: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SS|Semiotic and Significs: The Correspondence between C. S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby]]'' (2nd edition 2001), included Peirce's entire correspondence (1903–1912) with [[Victoria, Lady Welby]]. Peirce's other published correspondence is largely limited to the 14 letters included in volume 8 of the ''Collected Papers'', and the 20-odd pre-1890 items included so far in the ''Writings''. Edited by Charles S. Hardwick with James Cook, out of print.

1982–now: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce, A Chronological Edition]]'' (W), Volumes 1–6 &amp; 8, of a projected 30. The limited coverage, and defective editing and organization, of the ''Collected Papers'' led Max Fisch and others in the 1970s to found the [http://peirce.iupui.edu/ Peirce Edition Project] (PEP), whose mission is to prepare a more complete critical chronological edition. Only seven volumes have appeared to date, but they cover the period from 1859–1892, when Peirce carried out much of his best-known work. ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 8 was published in November 2010; and work continues on ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 7, 9, and 11. In print and online.

1985: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#HP|Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science: A History of Science]]'', 2 volumes. Auspitz has said,&lt;ref&gt;Auspitz, Josiah Lee (1994), "The Wasp Leaves the Bottle: Charles Sanders Peirce", ''The American Scholar'', v. 63, n. 4, Autumn 1994, 602–18.

Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.

1992: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'' collects in one place Peirce's 1898 series of lectures invited by William James. Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner, with commentary by [[Hilary Putnam]], in print.

1992–1998: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' (EP), 2 volumes, is an important recent sampler of Peirce's philosophical writings. Edited (1) by Nathan Hauser and Christian Kloesel and (2) by ''Peirce Edition Project'' editors, in print.

1997: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#PPM|Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right Thinking]]'' collects Peirce's 1903 Harvard "Lectures on Pragmatism" in a study edition, including drafts, of Peirce's lecture manuscripts, which had been previously published in abridged form; the lectures now also appear in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2. Edited by Patricia Ann Turisi, in print.

2010: ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#PMSW|Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Writings]]'' collects important writings by Peirce on the subject, many not previously in print. Edited by Matthew E. Moore, in print.

;Discoveries

Peirce made a number of striking discoveries in formal logic and foundational mathematics, nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after he died:

In 1860&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1860 MS), "Orders of Infinity", [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/PEP_news_Sept2010.pdf ''News from the Peirce Edition Project'', September 2010] (PDF), p. 6, with the manuscript's text.

Sheffer]] by 33&amp;nbsp;years. (See also [[De Morgan's Laws]].)

In 1881&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1881), "On the Logic of Number", ''American Journal of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQgPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA85 85–95]].

See See Shields, Paul (1997), "Peirce's Axiomatization of Arithmetic", in Houser ''et al.'', eds., ''Studies in the Logic of Charles S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; he set out the [[Peano axioms|axiomatization of natural number arithmetic]], a few years before [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Giuseppe Peano]]. In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as "[[Dedekind-finite]]", and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an [[infinite set]] (Dedekind-infinite), as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that can be put into a [[one-to-one correspondence]] with one of its proper [[subsets]].

In 1886, he saw that Boolean calculations could be carried out via electrical switches,&lt;ref name=P2M/&gt; anticipating [[Claude Shannon]] by more than 50 years. [[File:PeirceAlphaGraphs.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Existential graph]]s: Alpha graphs]]

Based on them are [[John F. Sowa]]'s [[conceptual graph]]s and Sun-Joo Shin's [[diagrammatic reasoning]].

;''The New Elements of Mathematics''

Peirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook, with the working title ''The New Elements of Mathematics'', that presented mathematics from an original standpoint. Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared&lt;ref name=Burks /&gt; in ''The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce'' (1976), edited by mathematician [[Carolyn Eisele]].

;Nature of mathematics

Peirce agreed with [[Auguste Comte]] in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|classified]] mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the [[real numbers]]) and continua. Influenced by his father [[Benjamin Peirce|Benjamin]], Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science ''about'' drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1898), "The Logic of Mathematics in Relation to Education" in ''Educational Review'' v. 15, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/educationalrevie15newyuoft#page/209/mode/1up 209–16] (via ''Internet Archive'').

&lt;/div&gt; Beginning with his first paper on the [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#LOR1870|"Logic of Relatives" (1870)]], Peirce extended the [[theory of relations]] that [[Augustus De Morgan]] had just recently awakened from its Cinderella slumbers. Much of the mathematics of relations now taken for granted was "borrowed" from Peirce, not always with all due credit; on that and on how the young [[Bertrand Russell]], especially his ''Principles of Mathematics'' and ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', did not do Peirce justice, see Anellis (1995).&lt;ref name=Anellis/&gt; In 1918 the logician [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C.&amp;nbsp;I. Lewis]] wrote, "The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer—at least in the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Clarence Irving (1918), ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'', see ch. 1, §7 "Peirce", pp. 79–106, see [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofsymbolic00lewiiala#page/79/mode/1up p. 79] (''Internet Archive''). Note that Lewis's bibliography lists works by Frege, tagged with asterisks as important.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1940, [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of [[relation algebra]].

Relational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of [[E. H. Moore]] and the [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] of [[Garrett Birkhoff]]. In computer science, the [[relational model]] for [[database]]s was developed with Peircean ideas in work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who was a doctoral student&lt;ref&gt;Avery, John (2003) ''Information theory and evolution'', p. 167; also Mitchell, Melanie, "[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/MMScientificAncestry.html My Scientific Ancestry]".&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Arthur W. Burks]], a Peirce scholar. In economics, relational logic was used by [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[John von Neumann]], and [[Paul Samuelson]] to study preferences and utility and by [[Kenneth J. Arrow]] in ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'', following Arrow's association with Tarski at [[City College of New York]].

On Peirce and his contemporaries [[Ernst Schröder]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Hilary Putnam]] (1982)&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;Putnam, Hilary (1982), "Peirce the Logician", ''Historia Mathematica'' 9, 290–301. Reprinted, pp. 252–60 in Putnam (1990), ''Realism with a Human Face'', Harvard. [http://www.jfsowa.com/peirce/putnam.htm Excerpt with article's last five pages].&lt;/ref&gt; documented that Frege's work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]]. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation"&lt;ref name=CSP1885/&gt; (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by [[Peano]] and Schröder, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, [[philosophy of language]], and the [[foundations of mathematics]].

Peirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides [[Ernst Schröder]]:
* Philosophical algebraist [[William Kingdon Clifford]]&lt;ref&gt;Beil, Ralph G. and Ketner, Kenneth (2003), "Peirce, Clifford, and Quantum Theory", ''International Journal of Theoretical Physics'' v. 42, n. 9, pp. 1957–72.&lt;/ref&gt; and logician [[William Ernest Johnson]], both British;
* The Polish school of logic and foundational mathematics, including [[Alfred Tarski]];
* [[Arthur Prior]], who praised and studied Peirce's logical work in a 1964 paper&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt; and in ''Formal Logic'' (saying on page 4 that Peirce "perhaps had a keener eye for essentials than any other logician before or since.").

A philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982);&lt;ref name=Putnam /&gt;the Introduction in Nathan Houser ''et al.'' (1997);&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Roberts, and Van Evra, eds. (1997), ''Studies in the Logic of Charles Sanders Peirce'', Indiana U., Bloomington, IN.&lt;/ref&gt; and Randall Dipert's chapter in Cheryl Misak (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Misak, ed.

===Continua===
Continuity and [[synechism]] are central in Peirce's philosophy: "I did not at first suppose that it was, as I gradually came to find it, the master-Key of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1893–1894, MS 949, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

From a mathematical point of view, he embraced [[infinitesimal]]s and worked long on the mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903 MS), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.176: "But I now define a ''pseudo-continuum'' as that which modern writers on the theory of functions call a ''continuum''. But this is fully represented by [...] the totality of real values, rational and irrational [...]."&lt;/ref&gt; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of ''analysis situs'' ([[topology]]); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds—and within any lapse of time has room for—any [[Aleph number]] (any infinite ''multitude'' as he called it) of instants.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902 MS) and [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Ransdell, Joseph]], ed. (1998), "Analysis of the Methods of Mathematical Demonstration", [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm#m4 Memoir 4], Draft C, MS L75.90–102, see 99–100. (Once there, scroll down).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room. Jérôme Havenel (2008): "It is on 26&amp;nbsp;May 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties."&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Probability and statistics===
Peirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (absolute chance) is real (see [[Tychism]] on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation]] of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) [[statistical model|probability]] when such models are not based on objective [[randomization]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce condemned the use of "certain [[likelihood function|likelihoods]]" (''The Essential Peirce'', 2:108–09) even more strongly than he criticized [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian methods]]. Indeed Peirce used a bit of [[Bayesian inference]] in criticizing parapsychology (''Writings of Charles S. Pierce'', 6:76).&lt;/ref&gt; Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his [[possible world semantics]] introduced the [[propensity probability|"propensity" theory of probability]] before [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Richard W. (1975), "Propensity: Popper or Peirce?", ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]'' ([http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org site]), v. 26, n. 2, pp. 123–32. {{doi|10.1093/bjps/26.2.123}}. [http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/26/2/123.pdf Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Haack|Haack, Susan]] and Kolenda, Konstantin (1977), "Two Fallibilists in Search of the Truth",  ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', Supplementary Volumes, v. 51, pp. 63–104. {{JSTOR|4106816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (sometimes with [[Joseph Jastrow]]) investigated the [[Bayesian probability|probability judgments]] of experimental subjects, "perhaps the very first" elicitation and estimation of [[subjective probability|subjective probabilities]] in [[experimental psychology]] and (what came to be called) [[Bayesian statistics]].&lt;ref name=Stigler78/&gt;

Peirce was one of the [[founders of statistics]]. He formulated modern statistics in "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" (1877–1878) and "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]" (1883). With a [[repeated measures design]], Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow introduced [[Blind experiment|blinded]], [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled randomized experiments]] in 1884&lt;ref&gt;Peirce CS, Jastrow J. [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm On Small Differences in Sensation]. Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences 1885; 3:73–83.&lt;/ref&gt; (Hacking 1990:205)&lt;ref name=Hacking/&gt; (before [[Ronald A. Fisher]]).&lt;ref name=Stigler78/&gt; He invented [[optimal design]] for experiments on gravity, in which he "[[analysis of variance|corrected the means]]". He used [[correlation]] and [[smoothing]]. Peirce extended the work on [[Peirce's criterion|outliers]] by [[Benjamin Peirce]], his father.&lt;ref name=Stigler78/&gt; He introduced terms "[[Confidence interval|confidence]]" and "[[Likelihood function|likelihood]]" (before [[Jerzy Neyman]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisher]]). (See [[Stephen Stigler]]'s historical books and [[Ian Hacking]] 1990&lt;ref name=Hacking/&gt;).

==Philosophy==
{{quote|It is not sufficiently recognized that Peirce's career was that of a scientist, not a philosopher; and that during his lifetime he was known and valued chiefly as a scientist, only secondarily as a logician, and scarcely at all as a philosopher. Even his work in philosophy and logic will not be understood until this fact becomes a standing premise of Peircean studies.|Max Fisch 1964, p. 486.&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt;}}

Peirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], [[statistics]], [[astronomy]],&lt;ref name=SP2/&gt; [[metrology]],&lt;ref name=metr/&gt; [[geodesy]], [[experimental psychology]],&lt;ref name=psych/&gt; [[economics]],&lt;ref name=econom/&gt; [[linguistics]],&lt;ref name=ling/&gt; and the [[history and philosophy of science]]. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.

Peirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system, belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion ([[fallibilism]]) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways—including philosophical [[pragmatism]] (which he founded), [[#Critical common-sensism|critical common-sensism]], and [[scientific method]]&amp;mdash;and, in metaphysics: [[Philosophical realism|Scholastic realism]], e.g. [[John Duns Scotus]], belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, [[objective idealism]], and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love.  In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like [[skepticism]] and [[positivism]], respectively, in others' work.  However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an [[Pragmatism#antiskep|anti-skepticism]] and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity,&lt;ref name=FCE&gt;Peirce (1897) "Fallibilism, Continuity, and Evolution", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.141–75 ([http://www.textlog.de/4248.html Eprint]), placed by the ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', editors directly after "F.R.L." (1899, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.135–40).&lt;/ref&gt; and pragmatism commits one to anti-[[nominalist]] belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453–57).

For Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;Peirce (1903), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.180–202 and (1906) "The Basis of Pragmaticism", ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:372–73, see "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.

===Theory of categories===
{{Main article|Categories (Peirce)}}

On May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled "[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm On a New List of Categories]" to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[G. W. F. Hegel]], categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Burch/&gt; Peirce scholars generally regard the "New List" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's "architectonic", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How To Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.

"On a New List of Categories" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.&lt;ref&gt;See in "Firstness", "Secondness", and "Thirdness" in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1893), "The Categories" MS 403. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/bycsp.htm#NLOC-R Eprint], edited by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph Ransdell]], with information on the re-write, and interleaved with the 1867 "New List" for comparison.&lt;/ref&gt; {{C. S. Peirce categorial table}}

===Aesthetics and ethics===
Peirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://agora.phi.gvsu.edu/kap/CSP_Bibliography/CSP_norm_bib.pdf Charles S. Peirce on Esthetics and Ethics: A Bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030406170524/http://agora.phi.gvsu.edu/kap/CSP_Bibliography/CSP_norm_bib.pdf |date=2003-04-06 }}" (PDF) by Kelly A. Parker in 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902 MS), Carnegie Application, edited by Joseph Ransdell, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm Memoir 2], see table.&lt;/ref&gt; He characterized aesthetics as the study of the good (grasped as the admirable), and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/esthetics.html Esthetics] at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy: logic, or semiotic==
{{Semiotics}}

===Logic as philosophical===
Peirce regarded logic ''per se'' as a division of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref name=FRL&gt;Peirce (1899 MS), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.135–40, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071421/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the art of devising methods of research".&lt;ref name=ars&gt;Peirce (1882), "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', v. 2, n. 19, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 11–12] (via Google), November 1882. Reprinted (''The Essential Peirce'', 1:210–14; ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 4:378–82; ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 7.59–76). The definition of logic quoted by Peirce is by [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]].&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1878), "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–15 (CP 2.645–68, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 3:276–90, ''The Essential Peirce'', 1:142–154). {{quote|...&amp;nbsp;death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. ... logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall ''not'' be limited. ... Logic is rooted in the social principle.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) "mathematics of logic" much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply "logic". He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.

Peirce argued that [[#fs|logic is formal semiotic]], the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs&lt;ref name=QFM&gt;Peirce, (1868), "Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA103 pp. 103–14]. On thought in signs, see p. 112. Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.213–63 (on thought in signs, see 253), ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 2:193–211, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:11–27. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; and sign processes ("semiosis") such as the inquiry process. He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or [[universal rhetoric]], or methodeutic,&lt;ref name=rhetoric/&gt; the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.

====Presuppositions of logic====
In his "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and "in one sense, the sole", rule of reason is that, ''to learn, one needs to desire to learn'' and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think.&lt;ref name="FRL"/&gt; So, the first rule is, ''to wonder''. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:
:...there follows one [[corollary]] which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:
&lt;center&gt;Do not block the way of inquiry.&lt;/center&gt;
Peirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that "the one unpardonable offence" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which "metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted". Peirce in many writings holds that [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|logic precedes metaphysics]] (ontological, religious, and physical).

Peirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of ''fallibilism'', which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real ([[tychism]] and [[synechism]]).&lt;ref name=FCE/&gt;

The First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough ([[#defs|see below]]). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), The Carnegie Institute Application, Memoir 10, MS L75.361–62, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-04.htm#m10 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce'', 2:242–72 (''Peirce Edition Project'', [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_23/v2_23.htm Eprint]), ''The Essential Peirce'', 1:56–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce rejected mere verbal or [[hyperbolic doubt]] and first or ultimate principles, and argued that we have (as he numbered them&lt;ref name=SCFI/&gt;):
# No power of Introspection. All knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from known external facts.
# No power of Intuition (cognition without logical determination by previous cognitions). No cognitive stage is absolutely first in a process. All mental action has the form of inference.
# No power of thinking without signs. A cognition must be interpreted in a subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all.
# No conception of the absolutely incognizable.
(The above sense of the term "intuition" is almost Kant's, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)

Peirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning,&lt;ref name=GVLL/&gt; and the falsity of philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]] ([[#Against Cartesianism|see below]]).

Peirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself&lt;ref name=SCFI /&gt; and later said that to "dismiss make-believes" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905), "What Pragmatism Is", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 2, pp. 161–81, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 see 167]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.411–37, see 416. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/whatis/whatpragis.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Logic as formal semiotic====
Peirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in [[Aristotle]]'s work, in such ''loci'' as: the basic terminology of [[psychology]] in ''[[On the Soul]]''; the founding description of [[sign relation]]s in ''[[On Interpretation]]''; and the differentiation of [[inference]] into three modes that are commonly translated into English as ''[[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'', in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', as well as inference by [[analogy]] (called ''paradeigma'' by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.

Peirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both ''[[semiotic]]'' and ''semeiotic''. Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic [[sign relation]], and defined ''[[semiosis]]'' as "action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce 1907, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.484. Reprinted, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:411 in "Pragmatism" (398–433).&lt;/ref&gt; As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse:

{{quote|To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.|Peirce 1868.&lt;ref name=QFM/&gt;}}
Peirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where 'sign' is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or ''quasi-mind'', that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-mind]" in ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt;—the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).

Inquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:

# Conditions for meaningfulness. Study of significatory elements and combinations, their grammar.
# Validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various separate modes.
# Conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.

Peirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:

{{quote|''On the Definition of Logic''. Logic is ''formal semiotic''. A sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''. This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of [[Weierstrass]]ian severity, and that is perfectly evident. The word "formal" in the definition is also defined.|sign= Peirce, "Carnegie Application", ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, p. 54.}}

====Sign relation====
Peirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign—not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The ''[[sign relation]]'' is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its ''object'', and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its ''interpretant'' (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible ''[[triadic relation]]'', according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.

''Extension × intension = information.'' Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Logic of information|information]]'', including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1867), "Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension" (CP 2.391–426), ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06.htm ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 2:70–86]).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.

''Determination.'' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object—the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object—an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience&lt;ref name=collateral&gt;See pp. 404–09 in "Pragmatism" in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101 here] at peirce-l's Lyris archive. Note: Ransdell's quotes from ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 8.178–79 are also in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:493–94, which gives their date as 1909; and his quote from ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 8.183 is also in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:495–96, which gives its date as 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word "determine" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of "specializes," ''bestimmt'',&lt;ref name=determined&gt;Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:492.&lt;/ref&gt; involving variable amount, like an influence.&lt;ref name=Marty&gt;See "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/76defeng.htm 76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce]", collected by Robert Marty (U. of Perpignan, France).&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, A Letter to Lady Welby (1908), ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'', pp. 80–81: {{quote|I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of "upon a person" is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object determines the sign to determine another sign—the interpretant—to be related to the object ''as the sign is related to the object'', hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.&lt;ref name=Marty/&gt;

====Semiotic elements====
Peirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):
# A ''sign'' (or ''representamen'')&lt;ref&gt;''Representamen'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɛ|p|r|ɪ|z|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|ə|n}} {{respell|REP|ri|zen|TAY|mən}}) was adopted ([[wikt:representamen|not coined]]) by Peirce as his technical term for the ''sign'' as covered in his theory, in case a divergence should come to light between his theoretical version and the popular senses of the word "sign". He eventually stopped using "representamen". See ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:272–73 and ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'' p. 193, quotes in "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html Representamen]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; represents, in the broadest possible sense of "represents". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial—a cloud might be a sign of rain for instance, or ruins the sign of ancient civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language|year=1984|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis|isbn=978-0253203984|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Peirce sometimes put it (he defined ''sign'' at least 76 times&lt;ref name=Marty/&gt;), the sign stands ''for'' the object ''to'' the interpretant. A sign represents its object in some respect, which respect is the sign's ''ground''.&lt;ref name=ground/&gt;
# An ''object'' (or ''semiotic object'') is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as [[Prince Hamlet]].&lt;ref name=fictive&gt;Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:492–502. Fictional object, 498. Object as universe of discourse, 492. See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dynamicalobject.html Dynamical Object]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the [[universe of discourse]] to which the partial or special object belongs.&lt;ref name=fictive/&gt; For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded "as on bedrock".&lt;ref&gt;See "Immediate Object", etc., at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].&lt;/ref&gt;
# An ''[[interpretant]]'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's "predecessor" (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object. An interpretant either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a ''final'' or ''normal'' interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign ''would'' have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.
Some of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref name=collateral/&gt;

====Classes of signs====
Among Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]], via Peirce's three phenomenological [[#Theory of categories|categories]]: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.&lt;ref name=9signs/&gt;

I. ''Qualisign, sinsign, legisign'' (also called'' tone, token, type,'' and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''):&lt;ref name=terms&gt;On the varying terminology, look up in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].&lt;/ref&gt; This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a "First"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a "Second"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a "Third".

II. ''Icon, index, symbol'': This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object—the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.

III. ''Rheme, dicisign, argument'' (also called ''sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,'' also ''seme, pheme, delome,''&lt;ref name=terms/&gt; and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional ''term, proposition, argument''): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}}
Every sign belongs to one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) ''and'' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.

===Modes of inference===
{{Main article|Inquiry}}
Borrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three basic modes of [[inference]]—''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]''—in his "critique of arguments" or "logic proper". Peirce also called abduction "retroduction", "presumption", and, earliest of all, "hypothesis". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical [[Syllogism#Barbara (AAA-1)|syllogism Barbara (AAA)]], for example in "Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis" (1878).&lt;ref&gt;''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 13, pp. 470–82, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=u8sWAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA472 472] or [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 13/August 1878/Illustrations of the Logic of Science VI|the book at Wikisource]]. ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.619–44 [623]&lt;/ref&gt; He does this by rearranging the ''rule'' (Barbara's major premise), the ''case'' (Barbara's minor premise), and the ''result'' (Barbara's conclusion):

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
Deduction.

''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. &lt;br&gt;
''Case:'' These beans are beans from this bag. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Result:'' These beans are white.
{{col-break|gap=1%}}
Induction.

''Case:'' These beans are &amp;#91;randomly selected&amp;#93; from this bag. &lt;br&gt;
''Result:'' These beans are white. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white.
{{col-break|gap=1%}}
Hypothesis (Abduction).

''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. &lt;br&gt;
''Result:'' These beans [oddly] are white. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; ''Case:'' These beans are from this bag.
{{col-end}}

Peirce 1883 in "A Theory of Probable Inference" (''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'') equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before&lt;ref name=SCFI/&gt;). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:&lt;ref&gt;See, under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce'', the following quotes:
* On correction of "A Theory of Probable Inference", see quotes from "Minute Logic", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.102, c. 1902, and from the Carnegie Application (L75), 1902, ''Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science'' v. 2, pp. 1031–32.
* On new logical form for abduction, see quote from Harvard Lectures on Pragmatism, 1903, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.188–89.
See also Santaella, Lucia (1997) "The Development of Peirce's Three Types of Reasoning: Abduction, Deduction, and Induction", 6th Congress of the [[IASS]]. [http://www.pucsp.br/~lbraga/epap_peir1.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The surprising fact, C, is observed;
:But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,
:Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.}}
The logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. "Deduction proves that something ''must'' be; Induction shows that something ''actually is'' operative; Abduction merely suggests that something ''may be''."&lt;ref&gt;"Lectures on Pragmatism", 1903, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.171.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction.&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to J. H. Kehler (dated 1911), ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 3, pp. 203–04, see in "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/retroduction.html Retroduction]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[methodeutic]] or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing.

* Pragmatism (1907 MS in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2)&lt;/div&gt; Peirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, which he called ''[[pragmatism]]'' and, later, ''[[pragmaticism]]'', is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called ''[[pragmatic maxim]]''. Here is one of his more [[Pragmatic maxim#2|emphatic reiterations]] of it:

{{quote|Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have. Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object.}}

As a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, [[William James]], and others in [[the Metaphysical Club]]. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877) and especially "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) as foundational to [[pragmatism]].&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1897), ''The Will to Believe'', see p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (CP 5.11–12), like James (''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

In 1905 Peirce coined the new name [[pragmaticism]] "for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition", saying that "all went happily" with James's and [[F.C.S. Schiller]]'s variant uses of the old name "pragmatism" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in "literary journals, where it gets abused". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author [[Giovanni Papini]]'s declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pragmaticism#Pragmaticism's name]] for discussion and references.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" series of articles. In the second one, "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:
# Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
# Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea "distinct", that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition "nominal" (CP 5.553).
# Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's conceived effects, such as fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduced that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. In clearness's second grade (the "nominal" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.&lt;ref name=Induction&gt;"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead", in Peirce (1878 April), "The Probability of Induction", p. [https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up 718] (via ''Internet Archive'' ) in ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705–18. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.669–93, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 3:290–305, ''The Essential Peirce'', 1:155–69, elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.

Peirce said that a conception's meaning consists in "[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]" implied by "acceptance" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to "vulgar" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.13 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.34 [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce ascribed the success of modern science less to a novel interest in verification than to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph Ransdell]]'s comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/intro/l75intro.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; which he variously called speculative, general, formal or [[universal rhetoric]] or simply methodeutic.&lt;ref name=rhetoric&gt;See [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/rhetoricspec.html rhetoric definitions] at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

====Theory of inquiry====
{{See also|Inquiry}}

=====Critical common-sensism=====
Critical common-sensism,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 4, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA481-IA20 481–99]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.438–63. Also important: ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.497–525.&lt;/ref&gt; treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy]] with a [[fallibilism]] that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.

=====Rival methods of inquiry=====
In "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched '''four methods''' of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:
# The method of '''tenacity''' (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
# The method of '''authority''' – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
# The method of the '''''a priori''''' – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The method of '''science''' – wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the 1898 Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.616–48 in part and ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'', 105–22, reprinted in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:27–41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's "first rule"&lt;ref name=FRL/&gt; is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. [[Scientific method]] excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive—eventually—at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

=====Scientific method=====
Insofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]''; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.

Based on his critique of three [[#Modes of inference|modes of argument]] and different from either [[foundationalism]] or [[coherentism]], Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:

# Active, [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;
# Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;
# Inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience, in both senses: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''.

Thereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''simpliciter'', which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.

A theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.

Peirce extracted the pragmatic [[mental model|model]] or [[theory]] of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.

Abduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective [[modularity (programming)|modularity]] of its principal components.

Peirce's outline of the scientific method in §III–IV of "A Neglected Argument"&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Peirce (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", published in large part, ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, 90–112. Reprinted with an unpublished part, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.452–85, ''Selected Writings'' pp. 358–79, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:434–50, ''Peirce on Signs'' 260–78.&lt;/ref&gt; is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of [[#Modes of inference|critique of arguments]]).

1. '''Abductive''' (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the "facile and natural", as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from "logical simplicity".&lt;ref&gt;See also Nubiola, Jaime (2004), "[http://www.unav.es/users/LumeNaturale.html Il Lume Naturale: Abduction and God]", ''Semiotiche'' I/2, 91–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (c. 1906), "PAP (Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism)" (MS 293), ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, pp. 319–20, first quote under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism "the logic of abduction".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), "Pragmatism – The Logic of Abduction", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.195–205, especially 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Carnegie application, MS L75.279–80: [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Memoir 27], Draft B.&lt;/ref&gt; and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;See MS L75.329–30, from Draft D of [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Memoir 27] of Peirce's application to the Carnegie Institution: {{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), breadth, or incomplexity.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents", ''The Essential Peirce'', 2, see pp. 107–09. On Twenty Questions, see 109: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

2. '''Deductive''' phase. Two stages:
:i. Explication. Not clearly premised, but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.
:ii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found. [[Corollary|Corollarial]] or, if needed, Theorematic.

3. '''Inductive''' phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real "is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead";&lt;ref name=Induction/&gt; in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows "a method which, sufficiently persisted in," will "diminish the error below any predesignate degree." Three stages:
:i. Classification. Not clearly premised, but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas.
:ii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 7.114–20). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of ''S'', ''S'' is found actually accompanied by ''P'' that was predicted for ''S'' (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.
:iii. Sentential Induction. "...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".

=====Against Cartesianism=====
Peirce drew on the methodological implications of the [[#Four incapacities|four incapacities]]—no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable—to attack philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]], of which he said that:&lt;ref name=SCFI /&gt;

1. "It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt" – when, instead, we start with preconceptions, "prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us ''can'' be questioned", though we may find reason to question them later. "Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts."

2. "It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness" – when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left. No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy's multi-generational dream. When "candid and disciplined minds" continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory's author should feel doubts about it.

3. It trusts to "a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses" – when, instead, philosophy should, "like the successful sciences", proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to "the multitude and variety of its arguments" as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but "a cable whose fibers", soever "slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected".

4. It renders many facts "absolutely inexplicable, unless to say that 'God makes them so' is to be regarded as an explanation"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce believed in God. See section [[#Philosophy: metaphysics]].&lt;/ref&gt; – when, instead, philosophy should avoid being "unidealistic",&lt;ref&gt;However, Peirce disagreed with Hegelian [[absolute idealism]]. See for example ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 8.131.&lt;/ref&gt; misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas, and supposing, inevitably, "some absolutely inexplicable, unanalyzable ultimate", which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible.

Peirce [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) [[wikt:psychical|psychical]] or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.

'''Ontology.''' Peirce was a Scholastic Realist, declaring for the reality of generals as early as 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1868), "Nominalism versus Realism", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 1, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA57 57–61]. Reprinted (CP 6.619–24), ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_14/v2_14.htm ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 2:144–53]).&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 "The Logic of Relatives" he wrote: {{quote|I formerly defined the possible as that which in a given state of information (real or feigned) we do not know not to be true. But this definition today seems to me only a twisted phrase which, by means of two negatives, conceals an anacoluthon. We know in advance of experience that certain things are not true, because we see they are impossible.}} Peirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they ''would'' behave under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;On developments in Peirce's realism, see:

'''Psychical or religious metaphysics.''' Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits—and it is a belief in God not as an ''actual'' or ''existent'' being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a ''real'' being.&lt;ref name=Godasreal&gt;Peirce in his 1906 "Answers to Questions concerning my Belief in God", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.495, [http://users.xplornet.com/~gnox/CSPgod.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223094243/http://users.xplornet.com/~gnox/CSPgod.htm |date=2008-02-23 }}, reprinted in part as "The Concept of God" in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'', J. Buchler, ed., 1940, pp. 375–78: {{quote|I will also take the liberty of substituting "reality" for "existence." This is perhaps overscrupulosity; but I myself always use ''exist'' in its strict philosophical sense of "react with the other like things in the environment." Of course, in that sense, it would be fetichism to say that God "exists." The word "reality," on the contrary, is used in ordinary parlance in its correct philosophical sense. [....] I define the ''real'' as that which holds its characters on such a tenure that it makes not the slightest difference what any man or men may have ''thought'' them to be, or ever will have ''thought'' them to be, here using thought to include, imagining, opining, and willing (as long as forcible ''means'' are not used); but the real thing's characters will remain absolutely untouched.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Wikisource:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]" (1908),&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will "stand or fall with the hypothesis"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an "infinitely incomprehensible" being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be ''more'' false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is free&lt;ref&gt;See his [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#MMS|"The Doctrine of Necessity Examined" (1892) and "Reply to the Necessitarians" (1893)]], to both of which editor [[Paul Carus]] responded.&lt;/ref&gt; and (see [[Synechism]]) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.

'''Physical metaphysics.''' Peirce held the view, which he called [[objective idealism]], that "matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1891), "The Architecture of Theories",'' [[The Monist]]'' v. 1, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart01hegeuoft#page/161/mode/1up 161–76], see [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart01hegeuoft#page/170/mode/1up p. 170], via ''Internet Archive''. Reprinted (CP 6.7–34) and (''The Essential Peirce'', 1:285–97, see p. 293).&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce asserted the reality of (1) absolute chance (his [[Tychism|tychist]] view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love ([[Agapism|agapist]] view), echoing his [[#Theory of categories|categories]] Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called "sporting"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called "tychasm", "anancasm", and "agapasm")&lt;ref&gt;See "tychism", "tychasm", "tychasticism", and the rest, at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].&lt;/ref&gt; of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]]; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1893), "Evolutionary Love", ''The Monist'' v. 3, pp. 176–200. Reprinted ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.278–317, ''The Essential Peirce'', 1:352–72. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/evolove/evolove.htm Eprint] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520131053/http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/evolove/evolove.htm |date=May 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially of space, time, and law.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 115 in ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'' (Peirce's 1898 lectures).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science of review==
{{Main article|Classification of the sciences (Peirce)}}
Peirce outlined two fields, "Cenoscopy" and "Science of Review", both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science.  In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus:&lt;ref name=phil/&gt;

# Science of Discovery.
## Mathematics.
## Cenoscopy (philosophy as discussed earlier in this article – categorial, normative, metaphysical), as First Philosophy, concerns positive phenomena in general, does not rely on findings from special sciences, and includes the ''general'' study of inquiry and scientific method.
## Idioscopy, or the Special Sciences (of nature and mind).
# Science of Review, as Ultimate Philosophy, arranges "...the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science". His examples included [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s ''[[Alexander Von Humboldt#The "Cosmos"|Cosmos]]'', [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s ''Philosophie positive'', and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]'s ''Synthetic Philosophy''.
# Practical Science, or the Arts.

Peirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.

[[File:College of Creative Studies, UCSB.jpg|thumb|250px|The front of the College of Creative Studies]]

The '''College of Creative Studies''' is the smallest of the three [[undergraduate]] colleges at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], unique within the University of California system in terms of structure and philosophy.&lt;ref name='dnccslife'&gt;{{Cite news |last=Golay |first=Annie |date=May 18, 2016 |title=Students Talk Life in UCSB’s Smallest College |url=http://dailynexus.com/2016-05-18/students-talk-life-in-ucsbs-smallest-college/ |newspaper=[[Daily Nexus]] |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its small size, student privileges, and grading system are designed to encourage self-motivated students with strong interests in a field to accomplish original work as undergraduates. A former student has called it a “[[graduate school]] for undergraduates”. The college has roughly 350 students in eight [[Academic major|majors]] and approximately 60 professors and lecturers.&lt;ref name='dnccslife'/&gt; There is an additional application process to the standard UCSB admission for prospective CCS students, and CCS accepts applications for admissions throughout the year.

== History ==
In the late 1960s, the [[Chancellor]] of UCSB, Vernon I. Cheadle, was looking for an [[alternative education]] program for undergraduate students which could embody the new thinking of the 60s and also attract attention to his growing university. He contacted a professor in the [[English literature|English]] department, [[Marvin Mudrick]], to come up with ideas for this new program. In 1967 the University of California allowed funding for Mudrick to start up the most promising of those ideas, the College of Creative Studies.

The program started with approximately 50 students in 7 majors: [[Art]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]], [[Music Composition]], [[Literature]] and [[Physics]]. The [[experiment]]al program struck a chord with its students and faculty, and along with the powerful pushing of Mudrick as its [[Provost (education)|provost]], it secured its place at UCSB. The program grew over the years in student and faculty size and in 1975 found its home in a building at UCSB that dates from when the campus was a [[World War II]] [[Marine corps|marine]] base. In 1995 the college added the major of [[Computer Science]]. In 2005, with the retirement of Provost William Ashby, the title of the Provost was changed to [[Dean (education)|Dean]] and the College was placed under the leadership of Dr. [[Bruce Tiffney]].

The Art department includes the only undergraduate [[Artist's books|book arts]] program in the University of California system. Recently, the Physics program has become regarded as one of the best undergraduate Physics programs in the nation; its students attend graduate schools with percentages resembling those of [[Ivy League]]s. CCS students have won the UCSB Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research several times in recent years. Literature students run ''Spectrum'', a literary magazine, and ''Into the Teeth of the Wind'', a poetry review.

== Philosophy ==

The [[philosophy]] of the College of Creative Studies is that certain undergraduate students are capable of rigorously exploring and adding to their chosen field of knowledge. Students skip introductory courses as appropriate and are encouraged to accomplish original work throughout their time at the College: Literature students compile a portfolio of writing, art students put on a minimum of two shows displaying their work, music students perform their own compositions, and science students enter labs by their [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] years to conduct research and write scholarly papers for publication.

The College considers students to be the most important people involved, not the faculty or administration. It has a low student-teacher ratio, and each student is paired with a faculty adviser with whom they meet at least once a [[Quarter (academic)|quarter]].

== Privileges and grading system ==

CCS students have few [[general education requirements]] and may take almost any course in the entire university, including graduate classes, without being required to complete the prerequisites. They can drop classes up to the last day of instruction in the quarter, a privilege intended to encourage students to attempt taking many units and advanced classes without being penalized in the case that they bit off more than they could chew.

In CCS classes, students do not receive letter grades. Instead, the College uses a sliding [[Credit (education)|unit]] scale where if a student completes all the work for a class at a satisfactory level, the student receives a full 4 units for most classes. If the student completes less work, he/she would receive fewer units, and if the student goes beyond expectations, a professor may give student more units. This system aims to promote a non-competitive atmosphere that focuses more on the student learning the material rather than learning how to take a test.

CCS students are afforded many privileges to help in the pursuit of their education. 

*Fewer prerequisites: If a CCS student can show a capability of taking an upper division or graduate class, even without the prerequisites, the college greatly facilitates the process of getting the student in that class.
*Drop class and change grading: CCS students may drop any class up until the last day of instruction. This privilege is given as a backup if a student happens to try taking advanced classes or more classes than the usual student. They may also change their grading between letter grade or pass/no-pass for classes outside CCS.&lt;ref name="ccs.ucsb.edu"&gt;[http://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/handbook/registration/ Registration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516220247/http://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/handbook/registration/ |date=2008-05-16 }}, College of Creative Studies&lt;/ref&gt;
*Priority registration: CCS students are among the first students at UCSB to sign up for classes each quarter. They sign up at the same time as [[honors student]]s and [[Sportsperson|athletes]].
*Higher unit cap: CCS students have a unit cap of 95.5 units per quarter. However, most students take between 15 and 25 units a quarter.&lt;ref name="ccs.ucsb.edu"/&gt;
*Building access: All CCS students receive a key to the CCS building and have 24-hour access to it.
*Computer Lab: CCS students have 24-hour access to their own computer lab where they have free [[Internet]] access, [[Computer printer|printing]] and [[photocopying]].
*[[Library]] checkout: CCS students get quarter-long check-out from the UCSB library and may renew materials up to five times.

== The building ==
[[File:Old Little Theatre, UCSB.jpg|thumb|250px|Old Little Theatre]]
The College of Creative Studies is housed in its own single story building, number 494, located between campus [[dorms]], a dining commons, and the University Center. The building was built during World War II and shares the title as the oldest building at UCSB with the other buildings left from when the campus was a marine base.

The building contains classrooms, art studios, faculty and administrative offices, an art gallery, computer labs, print and wood shops and a small 100 person theater. For most of its life it was painted brown, but in early 2005 the administrative offices were painted yellow, the college proper was painted green and the Old Little Theatre was painted red.

The building acts as a "home base" for its students, who spend time in the building studying and socializing. Students are allowed to personalize the building, so the walls have stickers and art, classrooms contain couches and modified desks and there are a few roaming stuffed animals.

Although many students and staff members are fond of the building, the college has outgrown it and is looking for funds to renovate it and/or build new facilities.

CCS alumni include:

* Art: [[Mary Heebner]], [[Peggy Oki]], [[Halsey Rodman]], [[Macduff Everton]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5239">'''Dimitri Petrides ''' (August 1912 in [[Cyprus]] &amp;ndash; 1985 in [[Blackpool]]) was a [[ballroom dancer]] who was instrumental in pioneering and developing [[Latin dance|Latin American dancing]] in England. He left Cyprus when he was eighteen with his mother after the death of his father, eventually settling in England. He was one of the founding members of the Latin-American Faculty of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]], and wrote the first English textbook on the subject. He was a Fellow and Examiner of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]].

Dimitri was also an adept linguist speaking Greek, English, French and Italian, so much so that, during [[World War II]] he worked as a [[translation|translator]] on a [[prisoner of war]] camp for Italian prisoners of war. Later, after the war, Dimitri was in a jewellery shop buying awards for a competition, when he met [[Nina Hunt]]. She asked him to teach her to dance. They were later married, and had a son, Ian.

== Latin dance in England ==
The rhythms that make Latin American dance popular today were first brought to this country in the early 1930s. It was a Frenchman who introduced this style to the English dance scene. He had come to Britain as a young man, and was known professionally as ''[[Monsieur Pierre]]'', (Pierre Jean Phillipe Zurcher-Margolle, [[Toulon, France]], circa 1890 – London, 1963). Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style when the [[Peanut Vendor]] started the rumba craze in Europe and America in 1931. The rumba and the [[beguine]] were demonstrated in London in 1932 by the French champion couple M. &amp; Mme Chapoul at an event organised by ''The Dancing Times''. Pierre was present and went to the ''Cabine Cubaine'' club in Paris to take a look at the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Frank and Peggy. 1968. ''Come dancing''. Allen, London. p137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In 1947 Pierre, his partner [[Nina Hunt]] and colleague [[Doris Nicols]] founded the Latin American section of the Ballroom Branch of the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]] (ISTD). Meanwhile, Dimitri had met [[Josephine Bradley]], one of the greats of Ballroom dancing. Miss Bradley suggested to [[Gwenethe Walshe]] that she might partner up with Dimitri. Dimitri and Gwenthe were Britain's first Latin American champions winning many of the earliest competitions before going on to build on their success and become popular as demonstrators, lecturers, coaches and judges. It is hard to imagine today that there was no Latin at the [[Blackpool Tower]], the [[International Latin American Dance Champions|International]] had not started, and the Star featured a competition in rumba only. Dimitri and Gwenethe joined the new faculty very early on.

The Latin American section of the ISTD now included Gwenethe Walshe and Dimitri Petrides. This small band of dedicated specialists worked hard to establish an examination system and syllabus for both amateur and professional dancers. [[Sidney Francis]] and [[Walter Laird]] also joined somewhat later.&lt;ref&gt;Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing 2004. ''100 years of dance: a history of the ISTD Examinations Board''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; The syllabus they worked on was eventually agreed upon by 1955 and ever since been the basis of Latin American dancing. The group improved technique and the framework for teaching and assessment dramatically in these years.

Dimitri was important in pioneering and developing Latin American dancing. He worked on the figures, gave demonstrations, and taught students. He wrote one of the first technique books in English for Latin American dancing in 1949 entitled ''The Latin-American dances'' (later edition, 1960, ''The Latin American technique''). Of this book the General Secretary of the ISTD, H. Vivian Davies said:
:"... Dimitri Petrides is today recognised as one of the foremost authorities in this county on Latin and American dancing... the author has justly earned a reputation for authenticity and style." &lt;ref&gt;H. Vivian Davies, Foreword to Petrides, Dimitri 1949. The ''Latin-American'' dances. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also part of a later committee of examiners, which included Sidney Francis, [[Peggy Spencer]], Doris Lavelle, Elizabeth Romain, and Doris Nichols. They prepared the ''Revised Latin American Technique''. This states in its foreword "this is the official Latin-American technique upon which all future Imperial examinations are to be conducted" and is still used by the ISTD in five parts (one for each Latin dance).

Dimitri next turned his attentions to establishing competitive dancing and set up several competitions in England including the prestigious All England Championship with Nina and Sidney Francis. He became a leading examiner and adjudicator, as well as a Fellow of the ISTD. Dimitri continued to work until his death whilst judging at the famous [[Blackpool Dance Festival]].

== The mission of the Museum of Medicine ==
[[Eduardo Estrella Aguirre|Dr. Eduardo Estrella]] founded Ecuador's National Museum of Medicine on 5 March 1982. Estrella's mission was to paint a full picture of the native, natural medicine of [[South America]] and to preserve Ecuadoran heritage. The main elements of the museum include Aboriginal Medical Food&lt;!--[http://www.amazon-indians.org/]what's this here for?--&gt;, nutrition and health, medical archeology, and medicinal plants. There is a full museum with Dential equipment from the late 17th, 18th through the very start 19th century such as Antique Microscopes, Antique Medicine Bottles, medical instrument literature and a complete library of knowledge and language of Andian Medicine Plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://instituciones.msp.gob.ec/museo/ Official web site of the [[Eduardo Estrella Aguirre|Dr. Eduardo Estrella]] Ecuador National Museum of Medicine in Quito, Ecuador ]&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.centroculturalpuce.org/index.php/13-eventos/exposiciones/127-apotecas-archivos-iconos-registro-fotografico-del-museo-nacional-de-medicina-eduardo-estrella-quito-ecuador]

There are also sections dedicated to Colonial medicine in South America, as well as institutionalization of academic medicine, hospitals, and medical education.

Dr. Eduardo Estrella studied medicine at the [[Central University of Ecuador]]. After graduation, Dr Estrella did his [[Postgraduate education]] on [[Radiotherapy]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States]] from 1968 to 1970. He did his specialized studies in psychiatry at the [[University of Navarra]], [[Pamplona]] from 1970 to 1973, [[Spain]]. Aguirre later chaired the medical faculty at the Central University of Ecuador.  Dr Estrella got his doctoral degree from the [[Catholic University]] of [[Quito]] in the 1980s. This was after he had published extensively on Andian medicine and on the history of medicine.

==Archives==
The Dr. Eduardo Estrella National Museum of Medicine library has been established to collect, protect, classify and catalog the medical, administrative and economic documentation of health institutions for Ecuador.  The library is composed of more than 15 documentaries funds, corresponding to approximately 10,000 boxes and hardcover volumes.  The Museum and Library are located in Hall No. 5 Eugenio Espejo Convention Center (lanes Sodiro and Valparaiso). Open Monday to Saturday from 8:30 to 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcomercio.com/cultura/Archivos-especializados-historicos-historia-Quito-Ecuador_0_1095490505.html] The library and reference room at the Dr. Eduardo Estrella National Museum of Medicine in Quito&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2347">'''Edmund Brice''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1648&amp;ndash;1696) was an [[England|English]] translator and schoolmaster.

==Life==
Brice, whose dates of birth and death are unknown, became a member of [[Jesus College, Oxford]] on or before 27 October 1648, [[matriculation|matriculating]] on 12 March 1649 and obtaining his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree on 12 July 1650.  He was then appointed a Fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], retaining his fellowship until about December 1660. It was reported that, during the time when he was a fellow of All Souls, he heard a sermon "preached in great Power" by [[John Pordage]], rector of [[Bradfield, Berkshire]].  Brice and his companion went to discuss matters with Pordage, and joined his [[Behmenism|Behmenist]] group, although it is unclear how long he spent with the group.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/73145| title=Brice, Edmund (fl. 1648&amp;ndash;1696) |last=Hessayon| first =Ariel |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (online edition, subscription access)| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=2004| accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was licensed to instruct boys in the [[diocese of London]] in [[Latin (language)|Latin]] grammar on 24 April 1669, having subscribed to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].  He also translated from the Latin [[Theodore Mundanus]]'s response to [[Edmund Dickinson]] "concerning the Quintessence of the Philosophers" (1686).  In 1696, another translation of his, ''Centrum Naturae Concentratum, or, The Salt of Nature Regenerated'', was published.  This was based on "The center of nature concentrated, or, Ali Puli his tractate of the regenerated salt of nature", ascribed to an "Asian moor" who had converted to Christianity called [[Ali Puli]]. A book by [[Jakob Böhme]] (''Aurora, that is, the Day Spring'' (1656)), inscribed by Brice on the flyleaf, came to be owned by [[Caleb Gilman]], a founder of the [[Philadelphian Society]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10028">'''Education in Libya''' begins with [[primary education]], which is both free and compulsory. Children in [[Libya]] between the ages of 6 and 15 attend primary school and then attend [[secondary school]] for three additional years (15- to 18-year-olds). About 60 percent of students are assigned to a vocational secondary program, while the remaining 40 percent are assigned to a more academic-focused secondary program, based on test scores and interests.&lt;ref name = Hanley/&gt; Under [[Muammar Gadaffi|Gadaffi]], primary and secondary education focused on his treatise on political philosophy, [[the Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|the Green Book]], with older students studying "Jamahiriya studies".

==Brief overview==
About 766,807 students in 2000 attended primary school and had 97,334 teachers; approximately 717,000 students were enrolled in secondary, technical, and [[vocational schools]]; and about 287,172 students were enrolled in [[List of universities in Libya|Libya's universities]].&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Libya.pdf Libya country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (April 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 public expenditures on education amounted to about 2.7 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Although no figures were found for government expenditures on education, Libyan television announced on September 1, 2004, that a new ministry for education had been formed, the General People’s Committee for Higher Education.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In the early 1980s, estimates of total [[literacy]] were between 50 and 60 percent, or about 70 percent for men and 35 percent for women, but the gender gap has since narrowed, especially because of increased female school attendance. For 2001 the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Report estimates that the adult literacy rate climbed to about 80.8 percent, or 91.3 percent for males and 69.3 percent for females. According to 2004 U.S. government estimates, 82 percent of the total adult population (age 15 and older) is literate, or 92 percent of males and 72 percent of females.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] recorded about an 89.9 percent adult literacy rate in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Reports: Libya|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/LBY|website=hdr.undp.org|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[UNICEF]] estimated that as high 99.9 percent literacy rates among youths ages 15 to 24 for both sexes in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At a Glance: Libya (Statistics)|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/laj_statistics.html|website=unicef.org|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The Kingdom of Libya (1951-1969)===

Despite the poor economic situation in the 1950s, the [[Kingdom of Libya]] decreed the creation of its first modern university, the [[University of Libya]] in [[Benghazi]], on December 15, 1955. The "Al-Manar" palace was assigned to be the first campus of the University.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Faraj Dghaim, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The university originally hired faculty from outside of Libya, and relied on the Egyptian government to pay the many staff members' salaries for the first four years.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Faraj Dghaim, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kingdom of Libya founded many new institutions and revived many old ones. These institutions included koranic schools and were largely religious in nature.&lt;ref name=Libedu/&gt;

===Gadaffi Regime (1969-2011)===

Education during [[Muammar Gadaffi]]'s rule in Libya was defined by his treatise on political philosophy, known as [[the Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|the Green Book]] and belief in an eventual [[decentralization]] of various government institutions. The book was a central part of the Libyan curriculum for primary and secondary education under his regime. Students from ages 9 to 18 were required to study Gadaffi's government in classes referred to as "Jamahiriya studies". Jamahiriya covered various aspects of Libya's government, either taken directly from the Green Book or compiled from the Green Book into various companion texts.&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillis|first1=Clare Morgana|title=End of History in the New Libya|journal=Foreign Policy|date=May 2012|issue=193|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; British author [[George Tremlett]] reported that students would study the Green Book for two hours each week in 1993.&lt;ref name="Tremlett1993"&gt;{{cite book | last=Tremlett | first=George | pages=208, 210, 214, 217, 220 | title=Gadaffi: The Desert Mystic | edition=First | location=New York | publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf | year=1993 | isbn=0-88184-934-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects also integrated these political philosophies, such as Geography texts denying current national borders to promote [[pan-arabism|pan-arabist]] beliefs. In order to enforce these views, all curriculum designers were required to be part of the [[lijan thawriya]], local committees dedicated to the interpretation of the Green Book.&lt;ref name = Gillis/&gt;

The Gadaffi regime had seen a large increase in students pursuing post-secondary education, in both universities and in the technical and vocational sector. In 1975 there were only two universities and around 13,418 students enrolled in post-secondary education. By 2004, there were nine universities and 84 technical and vocational schools with over 270,000 post-secondary students.&lt;ref name="Libedu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wes.org/eWENR/04July/Practical.htm |title=Education in Libya |author=Clark, Nick |publisher=World Education News and Reviews, Volume 17, Issue 4 |date=July 2004 |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, Libya's government realized it could not meet the demands for skilled workers and post-secondary educators, and began reforms to help meet these demands. In 1988, then secretary of education [[Maatouq M. Maatouq]] helped establish the Ministry of Technical and Vocational training, which oversaw trade schools and secondary-level vocational programs. That year, Gadaffi also asked Dr. Saleh Ibrahim to create Libya's first [[postgraduate education|postgraduate school]], which by 2004 had trained 80 percent of Libya's post-secondary teaching staff.&lt;ref name="Hanley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanley|first1=Delinda C.|title=Libya Invests in Its People's Education|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=March 2001|volume=20|issue=2|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Gadaffi Era (2011 to present)===

The [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]] in 2011 resulted in a delay to the start of the next year's classes on all levels which drew criticism for the [[National Transitional Council]]. It also drew attention several faults in the education system under Gadaffi. According to the [[Tripoli Post]], students at the [[University of Tripoli]] felt that the Gadaffi regime had provided them with low quality education.&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Umar N.|title=Education in Libya: A Point of Concern|url=http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=5&amp;i=7605|accessdate=18 October 2016|work=The Tripoli Post|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the 2011 civil war, the new education ministry began efforts to rewrite curricula. New curricula and texts began implementation in January 2012. Under the interim regime, efforts have been made to remove Gadiffi's influence from all levels education until it can be addressed appropriately.&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duncan|first1=Don|title=Education in Libya After Gaddafi|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2011-11-11/education-libya-after-gaddafi|accessdate=18 October 2016|work=Public Radio International|agency=Public Radio International|date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acting education minister Suliman El-Sahli stated  the ministry hopes "All historical eras will be presented objectively, without propaganda".&lt;ref name = Gillis/&gt;

Under the Gadaffi regime, vocational education was tailored largely for domestic, public sector jobs. Efforts to shift focus in vocational towards private sector jobs and improved international relations became an important issue for the new government in Libya. In 2013, the Libyan Board for Technical and Vocational Education signed an [[memorandum of understanding]] with UK based [[TVET UK]] in order to facilitate efforts to modernize the institutions established in the 1970s and 1980s and overhaul vocational education in Libya. TVET UK agreed to work with UK based suppliers to set up workshops in Libya to prepare the transition of skilled works into new private sector industries.&lt;ref name="tvet uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helping to build the New Libya {{!}} TVET UK News|url=http://www.tvetuk.org/2013/04/helping-to-build-the-new-libya/|website=www.tvetuk.org|publisher=TVET UK|date= April 26, 2013|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, the General National Congress began a funding initiative to send students to study overseas. The program had chosen 2,004 educators with masters degrees and 5,692 students to complete their education abroad at its inception, with plans to send another 3,616 top students over the coming years and to provide another 31,000 students with english language training. Initially, the fund gave scholarships to students who fought in militias during the civil war, but was later expanded to allow women and handicapped students to receive scholarships as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Custer|first1=Sarah|title=Libya scholarships to send 40,000 abroad|url=http://thepienews.com/news/libya-ld-3-28-billion-proposed-to-send-40000-students-abroad/|accessdate=18 October 2016|work=thepienews.com|date=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in Nigeria''' is overseen by the [[Nigerian Federal Ministry of Education|Ministry of Education]]. [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|Local authorities]] take responsibility for implementing state-controlled policy regarding [[public education]] and [[state schools]]. The education system is divided into [[Kindergarten]], [[Primary education]], [[Secondary education]] and [[Tertiary education]].  Nigeria's central government has been dominated by instability since declaring independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and, as a result, a unified set of education policies has not yet been successfully implemented.  Regional differences in quality, [[curriculum]], and funding characterize the education system in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aminu|first=Jibril|date=1990|title=Education in Nigeria: Overcoming Adversity|jstor=40703846|journal=Journal of Education Finance|volume=15|issue=4|pages=581–586|doi=10.2307/40703846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdullahi|first=Danjuma|last2=Abdullah|first2=John|date=June 2014|title=The Political Will and Quality Basic Education in Nigeria|url=http://jppgnet.com/journals/jppg/Vol_2_No_2_June_2014/5.pdf|journal=Journal of Power, Politics, and Governance|publisher=American Research Institute for Policy Development|volume=2|issue=2|pages=75–100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, [[Nigeria]] possesses the largest population of [[out-of-school learning]] youth in the world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Primary education==
[[File:Nigeria Primary School Enrolment by state in 2013.svg|thumb|Nigeria Primary School Enrolment by state in 2013]]
Primary education begins at around age 3 for the majority of Nigerians. Students spend six years in primary school and graduate with a school-leaving certificate. Subjects taught at the primary level include mathematics, English language, Christian Religious Knowledge, Islamic knowledge studies, agricultural science,home economics and one of the three main indigenous languages and cultures: [[Hausa–Fulani|Hausa-Fulani]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo language|Igbo]]. Private schools also offer computer science, French, and Fine Arts. Primary school students are required to take a Common Entrance Examination to qualify for admission into the Federal and State Government Secondary schools, as well as private ones.

Before 1976, education policy was still largely shaped by the colonial policy of the British Colonial Period. In 1976, the Universal Primary Education program was established.  This program faced many difficulties and was subsequently revised in 1981 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/universal-basic-education-nigeria/|title=Universal Basic Education in Nigeria - Centre for Public Impact|work=Centre for Public Impact|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal Basic Education, ''UBE'', came as a replacement of the Universal Primary Education and intended to enhance the success of the first nine years of schooling  The ''UBE'' involves 6 years of Primary School education and 3 years of Junior Secondary School education, culminating in 9 years of uninterrupted schooling, and transition from one class to another is automatic but determined through continuous assessment. This scheme is monitored by the Universal Basic Education Commission, UBEC, and has made it "free", "compulsory" and a right of every child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UBEC|title=About UBEC. Universal Basic Education Commission|url=http://ubeconline.com/about_ubec.html|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, the ''UBEC'' law section 15 defines UBE as early childhood care and education. The law stipulates a 9-year formal schooling, adult literacy and non-formal education, skill acquisition programs, and the education of special groups such as nomads and migrants, girl child and women, Al-majiri, street children and disabled people (Aderinoye, 2007).

==Secondary education==
Students spend six years in Secondary School, that is 3 years of JSS (Junior Secondary School), and 3 years of SSS (Senior Secondary School). By Senior Secondary School Class 2 (SS2), students are taking the GCE O’Levels exam, which is not mandatory, but some students take it to prepare for the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination. The Senior Secondary School ends on the WASSCE.
Junior Secondary School is free and compulsory. It leads to the [[BECE]], which opens the gate to Senior Secondary School.&lt;ref name="IBE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Nigeria.pdf | title=World data on Education | publisher=UNESCO-IBE | date=2011 | accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSS curriculum is based on 4 core subjects completed by 4 or 5 elective subjects. Core subjects are: English; mathematics; Economics; Civic Education; one or more electives out of biology, chemistry, physics or integrated science; one or more electives out of English literature, history, geography or social studies; agricultural science or a vocational subject which includes: Commerce, food and nutrition, technical drawing or fine arts.&lt;ref name="IBE"/&gt;

After the BECE, students can also join a technical college. The curriculum for these also lasts 3 years and leads to a trade/craftsmanship certificate.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=World+TVET+Database&amp;ct=NGA#par0_2 | title=Vocational education in Nigeria | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | date=2012 | accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Republic of Nigeria is made up of thirty-six States and the Federal Capital Territory. There are about two Federal Government Colleges in each state. These schools are funded and managed directly by the Federal Government through the Ministry of Education. Teachers and staff are Federal Government employees. Teachers at the Federal Government schools are required to possess a bachelor's degree in Education or in a particular subject area, such as, Mathematics, Physics etc. These schools are supposed to be model schools carrying and maintaining the ideals of secondary education for Nigerian students. Admission is based on merit, determined by the National Common Entrance Examination taken by all final year elementary school pupils. Tuition and fees are very low, approximately twenty five thousand naira ($69.08), because funding comes from the Federal Government.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

State-owned secondary schools are funded by each state government and are not comparable to the Federal government colleges. Although education is supposed to be free in the majority of the state-owned institutions, students are required to purchase books, uniforms and pay for miscellaneous things costing them an average of fifty thousand naira ($200) in an academic year. Teachers in State-owned institutions usually have a National Certificate of Education or a bachelor's degree, but this is not always the case as many secondary schools in [[Nigeria]] are filled with unqualified teachers who end up not being able to motivate their students. Often these schools are understaffed due to low state budgets, lack of incentives and irregularities in payment of staff salaries.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt; Some state-owned secondary schools are regarded as elite colleges because of the historically high educational standard and producing alumni who have prominent citizens in the various careers. These included [[King's College, Lagos]] and [[Queen's College, Lagos]]. However, the college ranking of these institutions have since dropped because of the arrival of some private institutions.

Private secondary schools in Nigeria tend to be quite expensive with average annual fees averaging from two hundred and fifty thousand naira to One million naira($1000.00&amp;nbsp;– $4000.00). These schools have smaller classes (approximately twenty to thirty students per class), modern equipment and a better learning environment. Most teachers in these institutions possess at least a bachelor's degree in a specific course area and are sent for workshops or short term programs on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

==Promotional examinations==
With the introduction of the 6-3-3-4 system of education in Nigeria, the recipient of the education would spend six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary school, three years in senior secondary school, and four years in a tertiary institution. The six years spent in primary school and the three years spent in junior secondary school are merged to form the nine in the 9-3-4 system. Altogether, the students must spend a minimum period of six years in Secondary School. During this period, students are expected to spend three years in Junior Secondary School and three years in Senior Secondary School.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

The General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE) was replaced by the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE). The SSCE is conducted at the end of the Secondary School studies in May/June. The GCE is conducted in October/November as a supplement for those students who did not get the required credits from their SSCE results. The standards of the two examinations are basically the same. A body called West African Examination Council (WAEC) conducts both the SSCE and GCE. A maximum of nine and a minimum of seven subjects are registered for the examination by each student with Mathematics and English Language taken as compulsory.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

A maximum of nine grades are assigned to each subject from: A1, B2, B3 (Equivalent to Distinctions Grade); C4, C5, C6 (Equivalent to Credit Grade); D7, E8 (Just Pass Grade); F9 (Fail Grade). Credit grades and above is considered academically adequate for entry into any University in Nigeria. In some study programs, many of the universities may require higher grades to get admission.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

The Federal Government policy on education is adhered to by all secondary schools in Nigeria. Six years of elementary school is followed by six years of secondary school. Junior Secondary school consists of JSS1, JSS2 and JSS3 which are equivalent to the 7th, 8th and 9th Grade while the Senior Secondary school consists of SS I, SS 2, and SS 3 which is equivalent to the 10th, 11th and 12th Grade. The Senior Secondary School Examination (SSCE) is taken at the end of the SS 3. The [[West African Examination Council]] (WAEC) administers both exams. Three to six months after a student has taken the SSCE examination, they are issued an official transcript from their institution. This transcript is valid for one year, after which an Official transcript from the West African Examination Council is issued.

The National Examination Council is another examination body in Nigeria; it administers the Senior Secondary School Examination (SSCE) in June/July. The body also administers the General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE) in December/January. Students often take both WAEC and NECO examinations in SSS 3.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

==International education==
As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iscresearch.com/&lt;/ref&gt; listed Nigeria as having 129 international schools.&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms "ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation."&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"/&gt; This definition is used by publications including [[The Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tertiary education==
[[File:Open University of Nigeria, Lagos Nigeria 01.jpg|thumb|Open University of Nigeria, Lagos]]
The government has majority control of university education. Tertiary education in Nigeria consists of Universities (Public and Private), Polytechnics, Monotechnics, and Colleges of education. The country has a total number of 129 universities registered by NUC among  which federal and state government own 40 and 39 respectively while 50 universities are privately owned. In order to increase the number of universities in Nigeria from 129 to 138 the Federal Government gave 9 new private universities their licences in May 2015. The names of the universities that got licenses in Abuja included, Augustine University, Ilara, Lagos; Chrisland University, Owode, Ogun State; Christopher University, Mowe, Ogun State; Hallmark University, Ijebu-Itele, Ogun State; Kings University, Ode-Omu, Osun State; Micheal and Cecilia Ibru University, Owhrode, Delta State; [[Mountain Top University]], Makogi/Oba Ogun state; Ritman University, Ikot-Epene, Akwa- Ibom State and Summit University, Offa, Kwara State.

First year entry requirements into most universities in Nigeria include: Minimum of SSCE/GCE Ordinary Level Credits at maximum of two sittings; Minimum cut-off marks in Joint Admission and Matriculation Board Entrance Examination (JAMB) of 180 and above out of a maximum of 400 marks are required. Candidates with minimum of Merit Pass in National Certificate of Education (NCE), National Diploma (ND) and other Advanced Level Certificates minimum qualifications with minimum of 5 O/L Credits are given direct entry admission into the appropriate undergraduate degree programs.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

Students with required documents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fatherprada.com/blog/guide/required-documents-for-admission-screening/|title=The Required Documents for Admission Screening {{!}} University Admission|last=|first=|date=2018-01-22|work=University Admission in Nigeria|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically enter [[university]] from age 17-18 onwards and study for an [[academic degree]]. Historically, universities are divided into several tiers:

=== First generation universities ===

Five of these Universities were established between 1948 and 1965, following the recommendation of the Ashby Commission set up by the British Colonial Government to study the necessity of university education for Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Livsey, "Imagining an Imperial Modernity: Universities and the West African Roots of Colonial Development." ''Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History'' 44.6 (2016): 952-975.&lt;/ref&gt; These universities are fully funded by the [[Government of Nigeria|federal government]]. They were established primarily to meet a need for qualified personnel in Nigeria and to set basic standards for university education. These universities have continued to play their roles for the production of qualified personnel and the provision of standards, which have helped to guide the subsequent establishments of other generations of universities in Nigeria. Universities in this tier are
* [[University of Nigeria, Nsukka]] 
* [[University of Lagos]]
* [[Obafemi Awolowo University]]
* [[Ahmadu Bello University|Ahmadu Bello University Zaria]]
* [[University of Ibadan]]&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

=== Second generation universities ===

With the increasing population of qualified students for university education in Nigeria and the growing needs for scientific and technological developments, setting up more universities became imperative. Between 1970 and 1985, 12 additional universities were established in various parts of the country.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

=== Third generation universities ===

The need to establish Universities to address special areas of Technological and Agricultural demand prompted the establishment of 10 additional Universities between 1985 and 1999.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

=== State universities ===

Pressures from qualified students from each state who could not readily get admissions to any of the Federal Universities continued to mount on States Governments. It became imperative and urgent for some State Governments to invest in the establishment of Universities.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

=== Private universities ===

The Federal Government established a law in 1993, allowing private sectors to establish universities following guidelines prescribed by the Government.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

The typical duration of undergraduate programs in Nigerian universities depends largely on the program of study. For example, Social Sciences/Humanity related courses are 4 Years, I.C.T related courses are 4 years, Engineering/Technology related courses are 5 Years, Pharmacy courses are 5 Years, and Law courses are 5 Years, each with two semester sessions per year. Medicine (Vet/Human) degrees take 6 Years and have longer sessions during the year.&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

=== Vocational education ===

Within education in Nigeria, vocational training and informal education dominate as the central forms of sharing regionally specific knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omolewa|first=Michael|date=2007|title=Traditional African Modes of Education: Their Relevance in the Modern World|jstor=27715419|journal=International Review of Education / Internationale Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft / Revue Internationale de l'Education|volume=53|issue=5/6|pages=593–612|doi=10.2307/27715419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration of vocational education in the country is overseen by the National Board for Technical Education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;African Development Fund. "Skills Training and Vocational Education Project." Appraisal Report. Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, as a result of high unemployment rates for school graduates, the Nigerian government placed a new emphasis on making vocational programs available to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chuta|first=E. J.|date=1986|title=Free Education in Nigeria: Socioeconomic Implications and Emerging Issues|jstor=1188364|journal=Comparative Education Review|volume=30|issue=4|pages=523–531|doi=10.2307/1188364}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocational education is now available to students in Nigeria beginning at the secondary level, and the Nigerian government has declared its dedication to improving technical and vocational education through a number of commissions and programs. The most significant plan for improvement was the Master Plan for 2001-2010 for the Development of the National Vocational Education system developed by the [[Federal Ministry of Education (Nigeria)|Federal Ministry of Education]] in 2000.  Current challenges for the enforcement of these systems includes a shortage of teachers, poor statistics on the labour market needs, and outdated curriculum and technology at vocational training centers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  As it stands now, students in Nigeria can pursue either a National Technical Certificate or an Advanced National Technical Certificate.  Administration of these certificates is overseen by the National Business and Technical Examinations Board (NABTEB).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wenr.wes.org/2017/03/education-in-nigeria|title=Education in Nigeria - WENR|date=2017-03-07|work=WENR|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to institutional forms of [[vocational education]], the [[Federal government of Nigeria|Nigerian government]] allows and encourages participation in [[apprenticeship]]s. These apprenticeships are instrumental in instilling the skills involved with a specific trade, but they also instill a commitment to community values including: patience, determination, and respect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Child labour|Child Labour]] laws prevent children younger than 15 from entering the workforce, but children less than 15 years of age may legally procure apprenticeships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  While efforts are being made to improve the quality and availability of vocational education, many policy oriented approaches have been blocked by a small number of politicians.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The failures to properly implement a national approach to worker's education has roots in the political instability of the country.  To this end, many academics have questioned if politicians are attempting to intentionally subjugate the working class through a lack of educational breadth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omole|first=M. A. Lanre|date=1998-09-01|title=The politics of workers’ education in Nigeria|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0260137980170502|journal=International Journal of Lifelong Education|volume=17|issue=5|pages=291–306|doi=10.1080/0260137980170502|issn=0260-1370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Informal education and literacy programs ==
[[File:Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development (7269588282).jpg|thumb|
School age children participating in literacy education
]]
Informal modes of education have formed a foundation for tertiary education in Nigeria for many years and are still at play today.  These programs and structures are difficult to study and assess unanimously as they are decentralized and unique in their missions and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=James R.|date=1972|title=Nonformal Education in Africa: Micro-Solutions to Macro-Problems?|jstor=523921|journal=African Studies Review|volume=15|issue=2|pages=241–254|doi=10.2307/523921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many academics have concluded that an overall lack of funding and centralization has significantly hindered the quality, funding, and implementation of [[literacy]] programs for both school age children and adults.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, many have achieved success at promoting employment and increasing economic mobility for those who have utilized the programs. In addition to vocational [[apprenticeship]]s, the [[Federal government of Nigeria|Nigerian government]] and various [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have introduced communal based strategies for increasing literacy rates among both children and adults. One such example is the Centre of Excellence for Literacy and Literacy Education (CELLE), an NGO committed to accelerating national development through literacy education.  In 1992, CELLE launched the Premier Reading Club (PRC), which is a nationally organized club with defined structure and methods for teaching children and adults to read and share their ideas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Onukaogu|first=Chukwuemeka Eze|date=1999|title=Enhancing Reading Clubs in Nigeria: The CELLE's Experience|jstor=40017046|journal=Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy|volume=43|issue=1|pages=68–77|doi=10.2307/40017046}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have achieved varying levels of success with the primary challenge being that funding is difficult to come by.  Formal and informal literacy education in Nigeria received a significant boost under the colonial rule of Britain, but since independence in 1960, educational funding across the board has been lacking.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Informal education has also aimed at addressed issues other than illiteracy.  Calls to incorporate informal [[HIV/AIDS]] education into the prison education system have been frequent and met with limited and varied response.    This population is in need of this education as inmates are not exposed to the standard methods of TV and print media campaigns addressing the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enuku|first=Usiwoma Evawoma|last2=Enuku|first2=Christie Akpoigho|date=1999|title=Incorporating AIDS Education in Prison Adult Education Programs in Nigeria|jstor=23294867|journal=Journal of Correctional Education|volume=50|issue=3|pages=96–100|doi=10.2307/23294867}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a psychological perspective, much of the informal education of adults is based on western research regarding [[psychology]] and [[social science]]s.  However, increasing academic movements are aiming to contextualize and build upon these western based ideals for the sake of social betterment in Nigeria, as well as developing nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhola|first=Harbans S.|date=2006|title=Review of The Psychology of Adult Learning in Africa|jstor=29737108|journal=International Review of Education / Internationale Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft / Revue Internationale de l'Education|volume=52|issue=5|pages=486–488|doi=10.2307/29737108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the informal education system in Nigeria can be described as nuanced and complicated.  Despite large support for investment in adult literacy and vocational programs, small groups of politicians and funding challenges have stalled the implementation of many literacy and vocational programs.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OMOLEWA|first=MICHAEL|date=2008|title=ADULT LITERACY IN AFRICA: THE PUSH AND PULL FACTORS|jstor=40608042|journal=International Review of Education / Internationale Zeitschrift für Erziehungswissenschaft / Revue Internationale de l'Education|volume=54|issue=5/6|pages=697–711|doi=10.2307/40608042}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study regarding the involvement of the national government in education and literacy programs concluded that the high illiteracy rates in Nigeria were significantly related to the government's lack of commitment towards its standardized education policies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Female education ==
[[File:Female literacy rate in Nigeria by state in 2013.svg|thumb|description=Female literacy rate in Nigeria by state in 2013&lt;br&gt;{{legend|#0e1f85|&gt; 90%}} {{legend|#5ba6f3|80–90%}} {{legend|#115a24|70–80%}} {{legend|#1e983e|60–70%}} {{legend|#24e556|50–60%}} {{legend|#e3e524|35–50%}} {{legend|#e02222|&lt; 35%}}]]

{{main|Women in education in Nigeria}}Education has been recognized as a basic human right since the 1948 adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. A positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in primary school and the gross national product and life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2012/0,,contentMDK:23004468~pagePK:64167689~piPK:64167673~theSitePK:7778063,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this correlation, enrollment in schools represents the largest component of societal investment into human capital.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, T.P. (2002). "Why Governments should Invest More to Educate Girls" World Development, Vol. 30 No.2 Pp 207&amp;nbsp;– 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid socioeconomic development of a nation has been observed to depend on the calibre of women and their education in that country. Women participation in education has been on increase, several motivations are employed by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], local, state, and federal government to encourage more women in education. Women can now been seen in various high-profile careers.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha (2003) "Women's Education: A Global Challenge" Sign:: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 2003, vol. 29, no. 2 Pp 325&amp;nbsp;– 355.&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, there are still many challenges preventing gender equality in the Nigerian education system.  There is a significant bias against female involvement in specific academic disciplines, with studies showing the existence of sex-based stereotyping of students by teachers in secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolarin|first=T. A.|date=Autumn 1987|title=Girls and Science Education in Nigeria|jstor=2295355|journal=The Journal of Negro Education|volume=56|issue=4|pages=580–587|doi=10.2307/2295355}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most dominant barriers are currently [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]], [[teen marriage]], religious beliefs, [[poverty]], and poor school facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Office, Nigeria Country. "Girls' Education Fact Sheet." UNICEF, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the rise of militancy groups such as the [[Boko Haram]] and the Niger Delta militancy have contributed to destabilization of the education system.  Both now and historically, girls have disproportionately experienced the impacts of this destabilization.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{Glossary of education-related terms TOC}}

==D==
* '''[[Deemed university]]''': ‘Deemed-to-be-University’,  Status of autonomy granted to high performing institutes and departments of various universities in India by [[Government of India]].
* '''[[Distance education]]:''' (or '''distance learning''') A field of education that focuses on the pedagogy/andragogy, technology, and instructional systems design that is effectively incorporated in delivering education to students who are not physically "on site" to receive their education. Instead, teachers and students may communicate asynchronously (at times of their own choosing) by exchanging printed or electronic media, or through technology that allows them to communicate in real time (synchronously). Distance education courses that require a physical on-site presence for any reason including the taking of examinations is considered to be a hybrid or blended course or program.
* '''[[Dunce]]:''' A person incapable of [[learning]]. The word is derived from the name of the great schoolman, [[John Duns Scotus]], whose works on [[logic]], [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] were accepted textbooks in the [[universities]] from the 14th century.
* '''[[Dyslexia]]:''' Said to be a [[neurological disorder]] with [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[genetics|genetic]] markers. Dyslexia was originally defined as a difficulty with reading and writing that could not be explained by general intelligence.  One diagnostic approach is to compare their ability in areas such as reading and writing to that which would be predicted by his or her general level of [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], but some would say that it is not certain that intelligence should be a predictor of reading or writing ability; and also that the causes, effects and treatments of reading disabilities may be similar for all levels of intelligence.

==E==

* '''[[Early childhood education]]:''' Covers the [[education]] of a [[child]] from the period from birth to eight years of age.
* '''[[Education]]:''' A [[social science]] that [[List of education topics|encompasses]] [[teaching]] and [[learning]] specific [[knowledge]], [[belief]]s, and [[skill]]s. Licensed and practicing teachers in the field use a variety of methods and materials in order to impart a [[curriculum]].
* '''[[Education policy]]:''' is the collection of rules, both stated and implicit, or the regularities in practice that govern the behavior of persons in schools. Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy.
* '''[[Education reform]]:''' A plan, program, or movement which attempts to bring about a systematic change in [[education]]al theory or practice across a [[community]] or [[society]].
* '''[[Education voucher]]:''' (commonly called a '''school voucher''') A certificate by which parents are given the ability to pay for the [[education]] of their children at a school of their choice, rather than the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] to which they were assigned. These vouchers would be paid for using [[tax revenues]].
* '''[[Educational animation]]:''' [[Animation]] produced for the specific purpose of fostering [[learning]].
* '''[[Educational counseling]]:''' Conducted by [[School Counselor|counselor]]s in [[school]]s and [[university|universities]]. It is intended to help children suffering from education-related [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]s such as [[Beating up|beating]]s and other forms of [[corporal punishment]] used in many countries. A more common application is with children who have been abused or [[bullying|bullied]]. The counselor works with the child to help him or her get over the trauma he or she has suffered.
* '''[[Educational evaluation]]:''' The [[evaluation]] process of characterizing and appraising some aspect of the [[education]] enterprise.
* '''[[Educational film]]:''' A [[film]] or movie whose primary purpose is to educate. Educational films have been used in classrooms as an alternative to other teaching methods.
* '''[[Educational game]]s:''' [[Game]]s, including [[video game]]s of this [[computer and video game genres|genre]], designed to teach people, typically [[child]]ren, about a certain subject or help them learn a skill as they play. Some people call these types of games [[edutainment]] because they combine [[education]] and [[entertainment]].
* '''[[Educational leadership]]''': [[Leadership]] in formal educational settings. It draws upon interdisciplinary literature, generally, but ideally distinguishes itself through its focus on pedagogy, epistemology and human development. In contemporary practice it borrows from political science and business. Debate within the field relates to this tension.
* '''[[Educational organization]]:''' [[Organization]] within the scope of [[education]]. It is a common misconception that this means it is organizing educational system; rather, it deals with the theory of organization as it applies to education of the human [[mind]].
* '''[[Educational perennialism]]:''' '''Perennialists''' believe that one should teach the things that they believe are of everlasting importance to all people everywhere. They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics.
* '''[[Educational programming language]]:''' A [[programming language]] that is designed primarily as a learning instrument and not so much as a tool for writing real-world application programs.
* '''[[Educational psychology]]:''' The study of how humans learn in [[education]]al settings, the effectiveness of educational treatments, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of  [[school]]s as [[organization]]s.  Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s.  Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment among the general population and sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those subject to specific [[disabilities]].
* '''[[Educational research]]:''' [[Research]] conducted to investigate [[behavior]]al patterns in pupils, students, teachers and other participants in schools and other educational institutions. Such research is often conducted by examining work products such as documents and [[standardized test]] results. The methods of educational research are derived chiefly from the [[social science]]s, and in particular from [[psychology]].
* '''[[Educational software]]:''' [[Computer software]] whose primary purpose is [[teaching]] or [[Unsupervised learning|self-learning]].
* '''[[Educational technology]]:''' The use of [[technology]] to improve [[education]]. It is a systematic, iterative process for designing instruction or training used to improve performance. Educational technology is sometimes also known as '''instructional technology''' or '''learning technology'''.
* '''[[E-learning]]:''' An approach to facilitate and enhance learning through, and  based on, both computer and communications technology.  Such devices can include [[personal computer]]s, [[CD-ROM]]s, Digital Television, P.D.A.s and Mobile Phones. Communications technology enables the use of the [[Internet]], [[email]], discussion forums, [[collaborative software]] and team learning systems (see also [[online deliberation]]).
* '''[[Electronic portfolio]]:''' In the context of [[education]] and [[learning]], an '''electronic portfolio''', normally known as an '''ePortfolio''' or a '''digital portfolio''', is a [[Career portfolio|portfolio]] based on electronic media and services. It consists of a personal  digital record containing information such as a collection of artifacts or evidence demonstrating what one knows and can do.
* '''[[Empirical evidence|Empirical knowledge]]:''' (or '''''a posteriori'' knowledge''') [[Propositional knowledge]] obtained by experience or sensorial information. It is contrasted with ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori knowledge]]'', or knowledge that is gained through the apprehension of [[innate idea]]s, "[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]," "pure [[reason]]," or other non-experiential sources. The [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s are usually considered ''[[a posteriori]]'', literally "after the fact," disciplines. [[Mathematics]] and [[logic]] are usually considered ''a priori'', "before the fact," disciplines.
* '''[[Student engagement|Engagement]]:''' The sentiment a student feels or does not feel towards learning or the learning environment.
* '''[[Epistemic theories of truth]]:''' Attempts to analyse the [[wikt:notion|notion]] of [[truth]] in terms of ''[[epistemic]]'' notions such as "[[belief]]", "[[acceptance]]", "[[verificationist|verification]]", "[[Theory of justification|justification]]", "[[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]" and so on. There is a variety of such conceptions, and they may be classified into [[verificationist]] theories and [[Perspectivalism|perspectivalist]] and [[relativist]] theories.
:Verificationism is based on a certain kind of mental activity: "verifying" a [[proposition]]. The distinctive claim of verificationism is that the result of such verifications is, by definition, [[truth]]. That is, truth is reducible to this process of [[Verification and validation|verification]].
:According to [[perspectivalism]] and [[relativism]], a [[proposition]] is only true relative to a particular perspective. Roughly, a proposition is true relative to a perspective [[if and only if]] it is "accepted" or "[[Testimonial|endorsed]]" or "[[legitimated]]" somehow by that perspective.

* '''[[Epistemology]]:''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''[[episteme]]'' (knowledge) and ''[[logos]]'' (word/speech)) The branch of [[philosophy]] that deals with the nature, origin and scope of [[knowledge]]. Historically, it has been one of the most investigated and most debated of all philosophical subjects. Much of this debate has focused on analysing the nature and variety of knowledge and how it relates to similar notions such as [[truth]] and [[belief]]. Much of this discussion concerns the justification of knowledge claims, that is the grounds on which one can claim to know a particular fact.
* '''[[Student exchange program|Exchange student]]:'''  A [[student]] (usually from [[high school]] or [[university]]) who temporarily goes abroad and lives with a host family in a foreign country, and attends [[school]] there. That host family often also sends a child of theirs abroad, usually to the same country as the student they are hosting. In this way, the two students are said to have been "exchanged," essentially temporarily trading countries with each other, although the period of exchange may not necessarily be simultaneous.  The main purpose of exchange programs is to increase [[culture|cultural]] understanding, both for the student and the people in the host country he/she comes into contact with.  Exchanges are often arranged by organizations created for this purpose, called [[student exchange program]]s.  [[Youth For Understanding]] and [[American Field Service]] are two examples of these organizations.
* '''[[Experience]]:''' Comprises [[knowledge]] of or skill in or [[observation]] of some thing or some event gained through involvement in or exposure to that thing or event. The history of the word ''experience'' aligns it closely with the concept of ''[[experiment]]''.
:The concept of experience generally refers to [[know-how]] or [[procedural knowledge]], rather than [[propositional knowledge]]. Philosophers dub knowledge based on experience "[[empirical knowledge]]" or "''a posteriori'' knowledge". A person with considerable experience in a certain field can gain a reputation as an [[expert]].

* '''[[Experiential education]]:''' (or "learning by doing") The process of actively engaging students in an authentic [[experience]] that will have benefits and consequences. Students make discoveries and experiment with knowledge themselves instead of hearing or reading about the experiences of others. Students also reflect on their experiences, thus developing new [[skill]]s, new [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and new [[theories]] or ways of [[thinking]].  Experiential education is related to the [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] learning theory.
* '''[[Experimental analysis of behavior]]:''' The name given to the approach to [[psychology]] founded by [[B. F. Skinner]].  As its name suggests, its foundational principle was the rejection of theoretical analysis, in particular the kinds of [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]] that had grown up in the [[comparative psychology]] of the 1920-1950 period, in favor of a more direct approach. It owed its early success to the effectiveness of Skinner's procedure of [[operant conditioning]], both in the laboratory and in [[behavior therapy]].
* '''[[Expulsion (education)]]:''' Removing a student from a [[school]] or [[university]] for violating rules or [[academic honor code]]s.
* '''[[Extra credit]]''' is an academic concept, particularly used in schools. Students are offered the opportunity to undertake optional work, additional to their compulsory school work, in order to gain additional credit that would boost their grades.&lt;ref name=Lucas2004&gt;{{Citation
 | last1 = Lucas | first1 = Sandra Goss
 | last2 = Bernstein | first2 = Douglas A.
 | year = 2004
 | title = Teaching Psychology
 | pages = 36
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Extracurricular activities]]:''' Activities performed by [[student]]s that fall outside the realm of the normal [[curriculum]] of school or university education. Extracurricular activities exist at all levels of education, from [[high school]] and [[college]] to [[university]] education. Such activities are generally [[Volunteering|voluntary]] as opposed to mandatory, non-paying, tend to be [[social]] or [[philanthropic]] as opposed to scholastic, and involve others of the same age. Students often organize and direct these activities under [[faculty (university)|faculty]] sponsorship.

==F==

* '''[[Forbidden knowledge]]:''' (in contrast to [[secret knowledge]]) Used to describe [[forbidden books]] or other information to which access is restricted or deprecated for political or religious reasons. Forbidden knowledge is commonly not secret, rather a society or various institutions will use repressive mechanisms to either completely prevent the publication of information they find objectionable or dangerous ([[censorship]]), or failing that, to try to reduce the public's trust in such information ([[propaganda]]). Public repression can create paradoxical situation where the proscribed information is generally common knowledge but publicly citing it is disallowed.
* '''[[Functional illiteracy]]:''' Refers to the inability of an individual to use [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[Speech communication|speaking]], [[writing]], and [[computation]]al skills efficiently in everyday life situations. Unlike an [[illiterate]], a functionally illiterate adult could be able to read and write text in his native language (with a variable degree of grammatical correctness, speed, and style), but is unable like the first, even in his own cultural and linguistic environment, to perform such fundamental tasks as filling out an [[application for employment]], following written instructions, reading a newspaper, reading traffic signs, consulting a dictionary, or understanding a bus schedule.
* '''[[Future Problem Solving Program]]:''' (FPSP) An international academic competition. Over 250,000 students internationally participate in the Future Problem Solving program every year.  Participating countries include the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Russia]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].

'''HOSA-Future Health Professionals''', formerly known as Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA), is a national career and technical student organization endorsed by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] and the Health Science Technology Education Division of [[Association for Career and Technical Education|ACTE]]. HOSA is composed of middle school, secondary, and post secondary/collegiate students, along with professional, alumni, and honorary members. It is headquartered in [[Southlake, Texas]], and is the largest student organization which prepares students to enter the healthcare field.

==History==
HOSA was founded in 1976 out of a task force from the American Vocational Association in order to determine whether a new student organization accommodating healthcare students was necessary. 

From November 4–7, 1975, the [[State Department of Education]] and Division of Vocational Education in [[New Jersey]] with 18 representatives from [[Alabama]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]] voted to form the American Health Occupations Education Student Organization. 

On November 10–13, 1976, in a constitutional convention in [[Arlington, Texas]] AHOESO adopted bylaws, which also changed the organization's name to Health Occupations Students of America; elected national leaders; selected colors and a motto; made plans to design an emblem; and set the first National Leadership Conference for the spring of 1978 in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="StudentMembershipHandbookP6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Student Membership Handbook|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the organization dropped the acronym from its name, and began publishing all documents under the brand "HOSA - Future Health Professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Lauver, Lori S., et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8309">'''Harry Sherman Crowe''' (1922–1981) was a history professor, university administrator and labour researcher. In 1958, his firing by [[United College, Winnipeg|United College]] gained national attention. In raising questions about the security of [[academic freedom]] and tenure in [[Canada]], Crowe’s case became a catalyst in solidifying the work of the [[Canadian Association of University Teachers]] (CAUT) in defending [[academic freedom]] and ensuring scholarly rights for academic staff in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, Michiel. ''Academic Freedom in Canada: A History.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

Crowe began his academic studies at United College (now the [[University of Winnipeg]]) in 1938. He enlisted in the army during [[World War II]]; attaining the rank of captain. Upon returning from military duty in Europe, Crowe studied at [[University of Manitoba]] (honours degree), and later pursued graduate studies at [[University of Toronto]] (M.A.) and [[Columbia University]] (Ph.D.).  In 1950, he was hired at United College. In 1951, he was awarded [[tenure]] and was later promoted to [[associate professor]] in 1956.

==Controversy==

The events that led to his controversial dismissal began in 1958 when United College Principal [[Wilfred Lockhart]] obtained, by mysterious means, a letter written by Professor Crowe to his colleague, William Packer. In that letter, Crowe had expressed concern with the religious and academic environment at United College and the worrying prospect of a Conservative victory in the upcoming federal election.{{Year needed|date=April 2017}}  Lockhart raised the letter to the College’s Board of Regents. Professor Crowe was subsequently fired on the grounds that the letter demonstrated his incompatibility with the "avowed purposes" of the College and his lack of respect and loyalty to the administration. Crowe objected to his dismissal by arguing, among other things, that the letter was private in nature and its reading by Principal Lockhart was unauthorized.

Crowe’s termination prompted local and national concern about academic freedom and the status of [[Academic tenure|tenure]] in [[higher education]].  [[Kenneth McNaught]], Stewart Reid, and Richard Stingle announced they would resign in protest.&lt;ref&gt;McNaught, Kenneth. ''Conscience and History: A Memoir.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowe’s dismissal, along with public concern about the affair, prompted the Canadian Association of University Teachers to step in by forming an ad hoc committee of enquiry—the first such committee established by CAUT, which was formed in 1951.  In 1959, the final report of the CAUT investigation was delivered by [[University of Toronto]] law professor [[Bora Laskin]] and [[University of Saskatchewan]] economist Vernon Fowke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Phillips |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/vernon-clifford-fowke/ |title=Vernon Clifford Fowke |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Fowke-Laskin Report" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.crowefoundation.ca/documents/CroweReport.pdf |title=Report of the Investigation by the Committee of the Canadian Association of University Teachers into the Dismissal of Professor H.S. Crowe by United College, Winnipeg, Manitoba |publisher=Crowefoundation.ca |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212554/https://www.crowefoundation.ca/documents/CroweReport.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that Crowe’s dismissal was "an unjust and unwarranted invasion of the security of academic tenure." &lt;ref&gt;"Report on the Crowe Case," Canadian Association of University Teachers, ''CAUT Bulletin'', 7:3 (1959)p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  The report further determined that the Board of Regents mishandled the complaint against Professor Crowe, violating [[natural justice]], [[due process]], and [[academic freedom]].

The release of the Fowke-Laskin report compelled the Board of Regents to reinstate Professor Crowe. However, the Board refused to reinstate his colleagues—McNaught, Reid, and Stingle—who had resigned in support of Harry Crowe. In protest, Crowe and twelve other faculty resigned from their positions at United College. Among them were: Michael Oliver, Fred Harper, Walter Young, Margaret Stobie, Roman R. March, G.E. Panting, Hugh R. Makepeace,&lt;ref&gt;Teacher stood up for colleague http://www.thewhig.com/2009/12/21/teacher-stood-up-for-colleague&lt;/ref&gt; Kay Sigurjonsson,&lt;ref&gt;http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20170331.OBSIGURJONSSON/BDAStory/BDA/deaths&lt;/ref&gt; William Packer, John Warkentin, Michael Jaremko, and Elizabeth F. Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Donald C. and Christopher Holmes, "The CAUT, the Crowe Case, and the Development of the Idea of Academic Freedom in Canada," ''CAUT Bulletin'', 24, 3 (December, 1975), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

One year after the Crowe events, CAUT adopted its first policy statement on academic freedom and established an Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caut.ca/about-us/committees-and-working-groups/academic-freedom-and-tenure-committee |title=Academic Freedom and Tenure Committee of the Canadian Association of University Teachers |publisher=Caut.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continues to monitor and investigate freedom matters for academic staff in Canada.

Following the incident at United College, Crowe worked for several years as a labour researcher for the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway, Transport, and General Workers. He returned to the academy for a teaching post at Atkinson College, [[York University]], where he was a professor (1966–1969) and then college dean (1969–1974 and 1979–1981). Crowe also wrote as a columnist for both the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' and ''[[Chatelaine (magazine)|Chatelaine]]''.&lt;ref name="yorku1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivesfa.library.yorku.ca/fonds/ON00370-f0000297.htm |title=F0297 - Harry S. Crowe fonds |publisher=Archivesfa.library.yorku.ca |date=2003-04-16 |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-author of ''A Source-Book of Canadian History: Selected Documents and Personal Papers.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid, Crowe, &amp; McNaught|title=A Source-Book of Canadian History: Selected Documents and Personal Papers|date=1964|publisher=Longmans Canada|location=Toronto|url=https://www.questia.com/library/91233269/a-source-book-of-canadian-history-selected-documents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Canadian Association of University Teachers established the Harry Crowe Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowefoundation.ca |title=Harry Crowe Foundation |publisher=Crowefoundation.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a charitable organization that undertakes education and research on the role of post-secondary teaching and research in contemporary society.

In England, '''learning and skills''' refers typically to post-compulsory education and training, provided by further education and sixth form colleges, schools with sixth forms, local authority and adult education institutions, private and voluntary sector providers, offender learning, and workplace learning including Apprenticeships and other employer-facing initiatives. 
The learning and skills sector is vital to increasing productivity, economic competitiveness and sustainable employment in the UK

Learning and skills also refers to the actual learning which learners undertake and the skills they acquire.

== Responsibility for learning and skills ==
Funding of provision is subject to frequent change.  The former [[Learning and Skills Council]] (2001-2010) was replaced by the [[Skills Funding Agency]] (still operating April 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Further education and training|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/skills-funding-agency|publisher=Gov.UK|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Young People's Learning Agency]] (now closed and incorporated into the [[Education Funding Agency]] from April 2012).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is wise to consult government department websites - Department for Education, and DBIS, for updated information.

== Providers of learning and skills ==

The learning and skills sector is made up of a number of different training providers, such as colleges and private organisations, and also includes workplace learning and offender learning.
 
=== Further education colleges and adult education institutes ===

Further education colleges can vary considerably in size, and in the subjects and facilities they offer. Many are ‘general’ FE colleges and offer courses in a wide range of subject areas.

Some further education colleges are specialist colleges, and offer subjects such as agriculture and horticulture, drama and dance. Other specialist colleges cater for students with a particular disability or learning difficulty.

=== Private training providers ===
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
Private training providers can include profit-making or voluntary organisations.

=== Schools with sixth forms and sixth form colleges ===

Sixth forms also vary a lot in size, and in the courses and facilities they offer. Sixth form colleges tend to be larger and more informal than school sixth forms and offer both academic style courses (such as A levels) and vocational programmes.

=== Workplace learning ===

Workplace learning falls into a number of categories. It can include training for people looking for work, for people learning how to do a job (for example through [[Apprenticeship]]s or for people learning new skills in their current job (through [[Continuing Professional Development|continuing professional development]] or employer-facing work initiatives such as Train to Gain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Workplace Learning|url=http://skillvoyage.com/blog/workplace-learning/|publisher=Skill Voyage|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace learning can be offered through different mediums - classroom training, e-learning, or blended learning, a mix of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern workplace learning in England|url=http://www.maximillion.co.uk/event-management/modern-workplace-learning-in-england/|publisher=Maximillion|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Offender learning ===

Offender learning is provides learning activities for offenders in prison or those in the community under the supervision of the Probation Service.

== Programmes offered by learning and skills providers ==

Programmes offered by learning and skills providers are very diverse and range from basic skills [[basic skills]] courses to [[Foundation degree|Foundation Degrees]], including both academic and vocational qualifications.

Dr. '''Lilli Nielsen''' (''née'' '''Reker''') (b. December 21, 1926, [[Rønne]], [[Bornholm]];&lt;ref name="lilliworkscv"&gt;[http://www.lilliworks.com/dr_nielsen_cv.htm About Dr. Lilli Nielsen:CV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006092851/http://www.lilliworks.com/dr_nielsen_cv.htm |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; † June 24, 2013, [[Kolding]], Denmark) was a Danish [[psychologist]] in the field of teaching blind children and those with multiple disabilities.  She has written several books on the subject.  
* '''Are You Blind?''' - This book focuses on the adult's interactions when working with children/adults with multiple disabilities.  The needs of individuals with autistic-like tendencies or who exhibit self-injurious or aggressive behaviors are specifically addressed.  The Five Phases of Educational Treatment are presented in detail - a technique used to build trust and encourage skill attainment.  
* '''Early Learning Step By Step''' - Parents, educators, and therapists who work with children and adults with multiple special needs will gain an understanding of how all individuals achieve readiness skills for learning.  Environmental intervention can facilitate skill attainment through Active Learning equipment and techniques, including learning to move, coordinate hand movement, learning to chew/eat, dress/undress, and play constructively.
* '''Educational Approaches''' - This book is a collection of Dr. Nielsen's papers, articles, essays and research ideas. It explains how she expanded the educational approaches for children and infants with vision impairments.
* '''Functional Scheme''' - This functional skill assessment and learning reassessment tool was developed by Dr. Nielsen to meet the needs of children and adults who are functioning at a developmental level under 48 months.  The purpose of the tool is to create the best possible basis for developing an appropriate learning program for the learner.
* '''Space and Self''' - Dr. Nielsen details the meaning of spatial relations as it applies to the development of self-identity.  The development and use of the “Little Room” is provided, with particular emphasis on promoting object conceptualization, self-identification and spatial relations in individuals with multiple special needs.
* '''Spatial Relations in Congenitally Blind Infants''' - This is Dr. Nielsen's dissertation on her scientific study, which resulted in the design of the "Little Room."  The study investigated whether a specially designed environment would facilitate the development of early spatial relations in congenitally blind infants.
* '''The Comprehending Hand''' - The ability to grasp is of fundamental importance for a child with special needs to get into contact with his/her surroundings and to enhance the development of the other senses. The book gives practical hints on how to adapt materials and surroundings to stimulate and encourage fine motor skill development.
* '''The FIELA Curriculum – 730 Learning Environments''' - Developed by Dr. Nielsen, The Flexible Individual Enriched Level Appropriate Curriculum offers 730 examples of developmentally appropriate activities for children and adults with multiple disabilities.  This book is an "appetizer" to the thousands of learning environments and activities a child or adult needs to develop and learn to his potential.  (An optional Manual with Moveable Cards provides an instantly usable programming option.)
She was the second of seven children, four of whom were born blind.  When she was seven she was charged with the responsibility of taking care of her blind younger brother.&lt;ref name="lilliworks"&gt;[http://www.lilliworks.com/about_dr__lilli_nielsen.htm About Dr. Lilli Nielsen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529103857/http://www.lilliworks.com/about_dr__lilli_nielsen.htm |date=2007-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a preschool teacher, then worked in a hospital, became a psychologist, and eventually was hired to teach the blind.&lt;ref name="lilliworks"/&gt;

In 1988 she earned a [[PhD]] in [[psychology]] at the [[University of Århus]].&lt;ref name="lilliworkscv"/&gt;

Lilli Nielsen has worked as special education adviser at Refsnaesskolen, National Institute to Blind and Partially Sighted Children and Youth in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsbvi.edu/resources/2588-an-introduction-to-dr-lilli-nielsens-active-learning An Introduction to Dr. Lilli Nielsen's Active Learning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been awarded the Knight [[Order of the Dannebrog]].&lt;ref name="lilliworks"/&gt;

Dr. Lilli Nielsen died on the June 24, 2013, at the public hospital of Kolding after a short period of illness (pneumonia).

== Philosophy of Active Learning for Individuals with Visual Impairments ==
The Active Learning approach emphasizes that all individuals learn best by active participation.  All activity, especially in the earliest stages of development, actually "wires our brains" and establishes critical foundational concepts and skills necessary for all future learning.

Individuals with multiple disabilities (cerebral palsy, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, autism, hearing impairment, etc.) are at great risk from developing reliance on others to interact with the world around them.  They learn to be a passive rather than active participant, waiting for adults to provide activity rather than seeking it out on their own.  Children and adults with special needs often develop stereotypical or aggressive behaviors in order to communicate with others or cope within the environments in which they are placed.  Active Learning recognizes that every child/adult with special needs is unique.  The programming and intervention for facilitating learning must reflect this individuality.

Active Learning emphasizes creating a developmentally appropriate and enriched environment so that children and adults with multiple special needs become active learners.

Dr. Nielsen's Active Learning approach addresses the breakdowns that can occur at the earliest stages of development due to an individual's inability to access the world because of disabilities including visual impairment, cerebral palsy, cognitive disabilities, hearing impairment, autism and other disabilities.

=="Little Room"==
One of her most famous ideas is that of the "little room."  This is a box that is laid over a blind or severely disabled child that has toys and other stimuli hanging from it.  The child can then explore and play with the toys. Most will vocalize, even for the first time, due to the superior acoustics of the Little Room.  As Nielsen wrote: "The purpose of the 'Little Room' is to facilitate blind children's achievement of spatial relations and reaching behaviour, but it can also be of considerable help for sighted low functioning children."&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, L. (1992).  Space and Self.  Copenhagen, Denmark: Sikon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=="HOPSA-dress"==

The HOPSA-dress provides vertical orientation, without the need for weightbearing, to children with multiple disabilities.  Items with interesting textures can be placed near the feet for tactile stimulation.  Later, the pulley system can be adjusted so that the child can bear weight gradually, at their own pace.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="95857">These are attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of ''attack'' is used for this list to exclude attacks during warfare, robberies, gang violence, political or police attacks (as related to protests), accidents, single [[suicide]]s, and [[murder-suicide]]s by rejected spouses or suitors, as they are not the type of mass murder event that is the focus of concern. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled. Accounts without reliable sources have been deleted.

An '''educational programming language''' is a [[programming language]] that is designed mostly as an instrument for [[learning]], and less as a tool for writing programs to perform work.

==Learning paths==
Many educational programming languages position themselves inside a learning path, that is, a sequence of languages each designed to build on the others moving a student from easy to understand and entertaining environments to full professional environments. Some of the better known are presented below.

===Assembly language===
Originally, [[machine code]] was the first and only way to program computers. [[Assembly language]] was the next type of language used, and thus is one of the oldest families of computer languages in use today. Many dialects and implementations are available, usually some for each computer processor architecture. It is very basic and termed a [[low level programming language]]. It is one of the more difficult languages to work with being [[Type system|untyped]] and rigid, but this is how computers work at low level. Several simplified dialects exist for education.

Low level languages must be written for a specific [[Central processing unit|processor]] [[Computer architecture|architecture]] and cannot be written or taught in isolation without referencing the processor for which it was written. Unlike higher level languages, using an educational assembly language needs a representation of a processor, whether virtualized or physical. Assembly is the most helpful language to use for learning about fundamental computer processor operation.

* ''[[Little Man Computer]]'' (LMC) is an instructional model of a simple [[von Neumann architecture]] computer with all basic features of modern computers. It can be programmed in machine code (usually decimal) or assembly. It is based on the concept of having a little man locked in a small room. At one end of the room are 100 mailboxes as memory; each can hold a three digit instruction or data. At the other end of the room are two mailboxes labeled INBOX and OUTBOX which receive and emit data. In the middle of the room is a work area with a simple two function (add and subtract) calculator called the Accumulator and a resettable counter called the Program Counter. The counter is similar to what a doorperson uses to count how many people have entered a facility; it can count up 1, or can be reset to 0. As specified by the [[von Neumann architecture]], memory holds both instructions and data. The user loads data into the mailboxes and then signals the little man to begin executing.
* ''[[Next Byte Codes]]'' (NBC) is a simple language with assembly language syntax that is used to program [[Lego Mindstorms NXT]] programmable bricks. The command line compiler emits NXT compatible machine code, and supports Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
* ''Little Computer 3'' ([[LC-3]]), is an assembly language with a simplified instruction set, but can be used to write moderately complex assembly programs and is a theoretically viable target for C compilers. It is simpler than x86 assembly but has many features similar to those in more complex languages. These features make it useful for teaching basic programming and computer architecture to beginning college computer science and computer engineering students, which is its most common use.
* ''[[DLX]]'' is a [[reduced instruction set computer]] (RISC) processor architecture by the main designers of the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and the [[Berkeley RISC]] designs, two benchmark examples of RISC design. DLX is essentially a cleaned up, simplified MIPS, with a simple 32-bit load/store architecture. It is widely used in [[college]]-level computer architecture courses.
* ''[[MIX]]'' and ''[[MMIX]]'' are hypothetical computers used in [[Donald Knuth]]'s monograph, ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' (''TAOCP''). Paraphrasing Knuth: ''The MIX systems are computers intended to illustrate machine-level aspects of programming, so its machine language is simple, elegant, easy to learn. It also includes all the complexities needed for high performance in practice, so in principle it can be built and perhaps be competitive with some of the fast general-purpose computers.'' MIX is hybrid programmable in [[binary numeral system|binary]] and [[decimal]] numbers; most programs written for it will work using either form. Software implementations for MIX and MMIX have been developed by Knuth and made freely available. Several versions of both emulators exist. MIX is a 1960s-style computer. It is superseded by MMIX, a newer modern computer architecture, a [[64-bit]] [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[instruction set]] architecture (ISA). For MMIX, Knuth collaborated with the architects of the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] ISAs.

===BASIC===
''[[BASIC]]'' (which stands for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was invented in 1964 to provide computer access to non-science students. It became popular on minicomputers during the 1960s, and became a standard computing language for [[microcomputer]]s during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The goals of BASIC were focused on the needs of learning to program easily: be easy for beginners to use, be interactive, provide clear and friendly error messages, respond quickly, do not require an understanding of computer hardware or operating systems. What made BASIC particularly useful for education was the small size of programs. Useful programs to illustrate a concept could be written in a dozen lines. At the same time BASIC did not require mathematical or computer science sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; BASIC continues to this day to be frequently self-taught with excellent tutorials and implementations. See [[List of BASIC dialects by platform]] for a complete list. BASIC offers a learning path from learning oriented BASICs such as [[Microsoft Small Basic]], [[BASIC-256]] and [[SiMPLE]], to more full featured BASICs like [[Visual Basic .NET]] and [[Gambas]].

* ''[[Visual Basic .NET]]'' with a freely available [http://www.microsoft.com/Express/VB/ Visual Basic Express Edition] including an [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/beginner/bb308754.aspx K-12 learning center] and [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/beginner/default.aspx Beginner adult learning center]
* ''[[Microsoft Small Basic]]'' is a restricted version of Visual Basic designed as a first language, "aimed at bringing 'fun' back to programming". The language is explicitly quite small with only 15 intuitive keywords. By including object specific libraries for things of general interest to children, children can create entertaining, interactive programs, on the net or on the desktop. For example, with 6 lines of code, it is possible to demonstrate a random network image viewer using [[Flickr]] as the source.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft corporation 2009 [http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/0/6/90616372-C4BF-4628-BC82-BD709635220D/Introducing%20Small%20Basic.pdf Getting Started Guide for Small Basic], p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The system utilizes the [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] IDE to provide [[IntelliSense|autocompletion]] and [[Tooltip|context sensitive help]].
* ''[[Visual Basic for Applications]]'' (VBA) is a version of Visual Basic built into most Microsoft Office applications and is used to build macros to automate processes within most applications of [[Microsoft Office]] (e.g. creating a User-Defined Function in Excel or creating a complex sequence of commands in response to a user event in a data entry form in Access).  VBA can also work across applications like automatically creating a report in Word from a database in Access. VBA is not used to make [[standalone program]]s but works only within a host application. VBA is on every machine that has any part of MS Office installed, so it is arguably the most ubiquitously available version of BASIC.
* ''[[Gambas]]'' which is a freely available easy to use BASIC for Linux with a [[wikibooks:Gambas|wikibook on Gambas]] available.
* ''[[Basic-256]]'' an easy to use version of BASIC designed to teach anybody the basics of computer programming. It uses traditional BASIC control structures ([[gosub]], [[for loop]]s, [[goto]]) for ease of understanding program flow-control. It has a built-in graphics mode that allows children to draw pictures on screen after minutes.  It includes tutorials that introduce programming concepts through fun exercises.
* ''[[SiMPLE]]'' is a programming development system that was created to provide easy programming abilities for everybody, especially non-professionals. It is somewhat like AppleSoft [[BASIC]]. It is compiled and lets users make their own libraries of often-used functions. "Simple" is a generic term for three slightly different versions of the language: Micro-SiMPLE to use only 4 keywords, Pro-SiMPLE, and Ultra-SiMPLE to use 23 keywords.
* ''[[Hot Soup Processor]]'' is a BASIC-derived language used in Japanese schools.
* ''[[TI-BASIC]]'' is a simple BASIC-like language implemented in Texas Instruments graphing calculators, often serving as a students' first look at programming.
* ''[[SmallBASIC]]'' fast and easy to learn BASIC language interpreter ideal for everyday calculations, scripts and prototypes. It includes trigonometric, matrix, and algebra functions, a built in IDE, a powerful string library, system, sound, and graphic commands, and a structured programming syntax.

===C===
* ''[[Ch (computer programming)|Ch]]'' is a C/C++ interpreter designed to help non-CS students to learn math, computing and programming in C and C++. It extends C with numerical, 2D/3D graphical plotting and scripting features.

===Java-based===
[[Sun Microsystems]]'s recommended path is Greenfoot to BlueJ to Netbeans-BlueJ to Netbeans-Java.&lt;ref name="SunLP"&gt;{{cite web

* ''[[Greenfoot]]'' is an interactive Java development environment developed primarily for educational use. It allows easy development of two-dimensional graphical applications, such as simulations and interactive games. It is mainly aimed at programming education (object-oriented programming with Java) at high school and early university level.&lt;ref name=SunLP/&gt;
* ''[[NetLogo]]'' is a development environment for building and exploring scientific models, specifically agent-based models. It is in widespread use both in science research [http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/references.shtml (Science papers using NetLogo)] and in educational contexts, including elementary, secondary schools, universities and museums.
* ''[[BlueJ]]'' is an integrated Java environment specifically designed for introductory teaching, first year college student. It eliminates some of Java's complex syntax, the difficulties of I/O and represents the object/class relationships visually. The BlueJ environment was developed as part of a university research project about teaching object-orientation to beginners (the [[Blue (programming language)|Blue system]]). The aim of BlueJ is to provide an easy-to-use teaching environment for the Java language that facilitates the teaching of Java to first year students. Special emphasis has been placed on visualization and [[interaction techniques]] to create a highly interactive environment that encourages experimentation and exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* ''[[NetBeans]]-[[Java (programming language)|Java]]'' This is a professional level platform. NetBeans refers to both a [[Computing platform|platform]] for developing applications for the network, and an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) developed using the NetBeans Platform. The platform is a reusable [[software framework]] to simplify developing other desktop applications. It offers services common to desktop applications, letting developers focus on the logic specific to their application. The IDE is [[Open-source software|open source]], written in Java using the NetBeans Platform. The IDE supports developing all Java application types ([[Java Platform, Standard Edition|Java SE]], [[Web application|web]], [[Enterprise JavaBean|EJB]] and [[MIDlet|mobile]] applications) out of the box. Among other features are an [[Apache Ant|Ant]]-based project system, [[revision control]] and [[code refactoring]].

===Lisp-based===
[[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] is the second oldest family of programming languages in use today, and as such has [[:Category:Lisp programming language family|many]] of [[Dialect (computing)|dialects]] and implementations at a wide range of difficulties. Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, based on [[lambda calculus]], which makes it particularly well suited for teaching theories of computing. As one of the earliest languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in [[computer science]], including [[tree (data structure)|tree data structure]]s, [[Garbage collection (computer science)|automatic storage management]], [[Type system|dynamic typing]], [[object-oriented programming]], and the [[self-hosting]] [[compiler]] all of which are useful for learning computer science.

The name ''LISP'' derives from "LISt Processing language". [[Linked list]]s are one of the languages' major [[data structure]]s, and Lisp [[source code]] is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or even new [[domain-specific language]]s embedded in Lisp. So Lisps are useful for learning language design, and creating custom languages.

A reasonable learning path would be Logo followed by any educational variant such as Scheme or newLISP, followed by a professional variant such as Common LISP.

* ''[[Logo (programming language)|Logo]]'' is a language that was specifically designed to introduce children to programming.  The first part of learning Logo deals with "turtle graphics" (derived from [[turtle (robot)|turtle robots]]) used as early as 1969 with proto-Logo.  In modern implementations, an abstract drawing device, called the ''turtle'', is used to make programming for children very attractive by concentrating on doing [[turtle graphics]]. [[Seymour Papert]], one of the creators of Logo, was a major thinker in [[constructionism (learning theory)|constructionism]], a variety of [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist learning theory]].  Papert argued that activities like writing would naturally be learned by much younger children providing that they adopted a computing culture.&lt;ref name="RedC"&gt;{{Cite conference

Since Logo is actually a streamlined version of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] with more advanced students it can be used to introduce the basic concepts of computer science and even artificial intelligence. [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ Brian Harvey] wrote a series ''Computer Science Logo Style''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/v1-toc2.html Volume 1: Symbolic Computing] [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/v2-toc2.html Volume 2: Advanced Techniques] [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/v3-toc2.html Volume 3: Beyond Programming]&lt;/ref&gt; for self study of computer science based on Logo. Logo is widely available on virtually every platform, in both free and commercial versions.

* ''[[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]'' was originally designed in 1975 to serve a tutorial purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy Lewis Steele, Jr.. "Scheme: An Interpreter for Extended Lambda Calculus". MIT AI Lab. AI Lab Memo AIM-349. December 1975. [http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/ai-lab-pubs/AIM-349.pdf], from [[Lambda Papers]]&lt;/ref&gt; LISPs of the day used non-recursive control structures to implement [[lambda calculus]], primarily since LISPs were still being implemented for efficiency reasons in hardware. [[Guy L. Steele Jr.]] and [[Gerald Jay Sussman]] constructed Scheme as a fast interpreted language atop an underlying LISP with cheap procedure calls.&lt;ref&gt;"Debunking the 'Expensive Procedure Call' Myth, or Procedure Call Implementations Considered Harmful, or LAMBDA, the Ultimate GOTO". ACM Conference Proceedings. 1977. http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/ai-lab-pubs/AIM-349.pdf, from the [[Lambda Papers]]&lt;!-- is link correct? It's a paper with a different title, written in 1975 not 1977 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pedagogically this allowed for teaching programming in terms of [[domain-specific language]]s and [[meta-circular evaluator]]s. The publication of [[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]] in 1984 incorporated this educational philosophy into a canonical textbook, which changed the predominance of Pascal as the university programming language. {{cquote|The publication of Abelson and Sussman's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (sicp) (Abelson et al., 1985) revolutionized the landscape of the introductory computing curriculum in the 1980s. Most importantly, the book liberated the introductory course from the tyranny of syntax. Instead of arranging a course around the syntax of a currently fashionable language, sicp focused the first course on the study of important ideas in computing: functional abstraction, data abstraction, streams, data-directed programming, implementation of message-passing objects, interpreters, compilers, and [[register machine]]s.
Over a short period, many universities in the US and around the world switched their first course to sicp and Scheme. The book became a major bestseller for MIT Press. Along with sicp, the Scheme language became widely used. It was no longer the subject of a few individual courses at Indiana University, MIT, and Yale, but the language of choice in introductory courses all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

: Since then the Scheme community has introduced several pedagogic programming environments for more modern approaches. Of particular note is the [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] outreach effort with its [[DrRacket]] environment, freely available text [[How to Design Programs]] and [[ProgramByDesign]] educator training.&lt;ref&gt;More information on the PLT group results is at [http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/ Northeastern PLT: Publications].&lt;/ref&gt; The first unit of the [[Bootstrap curriculum|Bootstrap Curriculum]] uses the Racket language.

*''[[newLISP]]'' aims to provide a fast, powerful, cross-platform, full-featured scripting version of the Lisp language which uses only a modest amount of system resources such as disk space and memory. It is particularly suited for learners because of its simple, consistent, streamlined, Lisp environment that minimizes the learning curve and maximizes programmer productivity and pleasure.

Each provides graphical environments which may be used to teach not only programming concepts to kids but also physics and mathematics simulations, story-telling exercises, etc., through the use of [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructive learning]]. Smalltalk and Squeak are fully featured application development languages that have been around and well respected for decades; Scratch is a children's learning tool.

* ''[[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]]'' is a visual language based on and implemented in Squeak. It has the goal of teaching programming concepts to children and letting them create games, videos, and music. In Scratch, all the interactive objects, graphics, and sounds can be easily imported to a new program and combined in new ways. That way, beginners can get quick results and be motivated to try further. The Scratch community has developed and uploaded over 3,000,000 projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scratch.mit.edu/ |title=Scratch: imagine, program, share |author1=Mitchel Resnick |author2=John Maloney |author3=Natalie Rusk |author4=Evelyn Eastmond |author5=Amon Millner |author6=Jay Silver |author7=Eric Rosenbaum |author8=Karen Brennan |author9=Amos Blanton |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at [[MIT Media Lab]].

The Kodu language is designed specifically for game development and provides specialized primitives derived from gaming scenarios. Programs are expressed in physical terms, using concepts like vision, hearing, and time to control character behavior. While not as general-purpose as classical programming languages, Kodu can express advanced game design concepts in a simple, direct, and intuitive manner. The Kodu tool is available in three forms: PC as a free download in public beta and academic forms, and as a low-cost Xbox 360 Live download.
* ''[[Logo (programming language)|Logo]]'' is an educational language for children, designed in 1967 by [[Daniel G. Bobrow]], [[Wally Feurzeig]], [[Seymour Papert]] and [[Cynthia Solomon]]. Today the language is remembered mainly for its use of "[[turtle graphics]]", in which commands for movement and drawing produced [[turtle graphics|line graphics]] either on screen or with a small robot called a "[[Turtle (robot)|turtle]]". The language was originally conceived to teach concepts of programming related to [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and only later to enable what Papert called ''"[[kinesthetic|body-syntonic]] reasoning"'' where students could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle.
* ''[[Lego Mindstorms]]'' is a line of Lego sets combining programmable bricks with electric motors, sensors, Lego bricks, and Lego Technic pieces (such as gears, axles, and beams). Mindstorms originated from the programmable sensor blocks used in the line of educational toys. The first retail version of Lego Mindstorms was released in 1998 and marketed commercially as the Robotics Invention System (RIS). The current version was released in 2006 as Lego Mindstorms NXT. A wide [[Lego Mindstorms NXT#Programming|range of programming languages is used]] for the mindstorms from Logo to BASIC to derivatives of Java, Smalltalk and C. The Mindstorm approach to programming now have dedicated physical sites called [[Computer Clubhouse]]s.
*''[[Mama (software)|Mama]]'' is an educational [[object-oriented programming|object oriented]] language designed to help young students start programming by providing all the language elements in the student mother tongue. Mama language is available in several languages, with both LTR and RTL language direction support. A [http://www.eytam.com/mama new variant of Mama] was built atop [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s ''[[Alice (software)|Alice]]'' development environment, supporting scripting of the 3D stage objects.

Snap! adds the ability to create new blocks and has [[first-class functions]] that enables the use of [[anonymous functions]]. It is actively maintained by [[UC Berkeley]]. The [https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap--Build-Your-Own-Blocks source] is entirely hosted on [[GitHub]].
* ''[[Stagecast Creator]]'' is a visual programming system based on [[programming by demonstration]]. Users demonstrate to the system what to do by moving icons on the screen, and it generates rules for the objects (characters). Users can create two-dimensional simulations that model a concept, multi-level games, interactive stories, etc.
* ''[[Stencyl]]'' is a visual programming and game development IDE that has been used for education and commerce. The concept it uses of ''code blocks'' is based on [[MIT]]'s [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] visual language (listed above). It also permits the use of ''normal'' typed code (separate or intermingled) through its own API and the [[Haxe]] language.
* ''[[ToonTalk]]'' is a language and environment that looks like a video game. Computational abstractions are mapped to concrete analogs such robots, houses, trucks, birds, nests, and boxes. It supports big integers and exact rational numbers. It is based upon [[Concurrent constraint logic programming|concurrent constraint programming]].

It includes a step-by-step introductory programming course that teaches the basics of the language in a straightforward manner.

==Historical==
* ''[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]'' is the most well-known language that was designed with education in mind. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, it was the primary choice in introductory computer science classes for teaching students programming in both the US and Europe. Its use for real-world applications has since increased, and regarding it as a purely educational language has since become somewhat controversial.{{according to whom|date=May 2014}}

==University==
* ''[[A++]]'' represents a more recent attempt to create a language designed to provide an efficient tool for basic training in programming.
* ''[[Curry (programming language)|Curry]]'' is a teaching language&lt;ref&gt;M. Hanus. Teaching Functional and Logic Programming with a Single Computation Model. In Proc. Ninth International Symposium on Programming Languages, Implementations, Logics, and Programs (PLILP’97), pp. 335–350. Springer LNCS 1292, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; designed to amalgamate the most important declarative programming paradigms, namely functional programming (nested expressions, higher-order functions, lazy evaluation) and [[logic programming]] (logical variables, partial data structures, built-in search). It also integrates the two most import operational principles developed in the area of integrated functional logic languages: "residuation" and "narrowing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~curry/report.html Curry report, Introduction.

* ''[[Flowgorithm (programming language)|Flowgorithm]]'' is a graphical [[authoring tool]] for writing and executing programs via [[flowchart]]s. The approach is designed to emphasize the algorithm rather than the syntax of a given language. The flowchart can be converted to several major languages such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Visual Basic .NET]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://flowgorithm.org/about/index.htm|website=Flowgorithm|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[M2001]]'' is a [[Modular programming|modular]] mathematical language for developing and presenting mathematical algorithms, from modern discrete to classical continuous mathematics. It is built on a semantic framework based in category theory, with a syntax similar to that of Pascal or [[Modula-2]]. It is designed for education only, so efficiency and ease of implementation are far less vital in its development than generality and range of application. It was created to play a strong role in forming a formal algorithmic foundation for first-year college math students.

* ''[[Python (programming language)|Python]]'' is a [[cross-platform]] [[Programming paradigm#Multi-paradigm|multi-paradigm]] [[Command-line interface#Command-line interpreter|interpreted]] [[scripting language]] which is utilized for teaching computer science in various colleges and universities around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools Using Python|url=https://wiki.python.org/moin/SchoolsUsingPython|website=Python.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Python's clear syntax, interpreted interface, and high level data structures make it an ideal instructional language for education, while the large number of extant libraries make it useful for working programs.
* ''[[Oz (programming language)|Oz]]'' is a language designed to teach computer theory. It supports most major paradigms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/people/PVR/paradigmsDIAGRAMeng108.pdf Programming Paradigms] poster&lt;/ref&gt; in one language so that students can learn paradigms without having to learn multiple [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntaxes]]. Oz contains in a simple and well-factored way, most of the concepts of the major programming paradigms, including logic, functional (both lazy and eager), imperative, object-oriented, constraint, distributed, and concurrent programming. It has a canonical textbook [[Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming]] and a freely available standard implementation, the Mozart Programming System.
* ''[[Wolfram Language]]'' is a multi-paradigm programming language developed by Wolfram Research and is the programming language of mathematical symbolic computation program, [[Mathematica]] and the Wolfram Development Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wolfram.com/development-platform|title=Wolfram Development Platform: Introducing a Programming Revolution|website=www.wolfram.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes symbolic computation, functional programming, and rule-based programming and can employ arbitrary structures and data.

The Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills. To receive federal school funding, states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade levels.

The act did not assert a national achievement standard—each state developed its own standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Child Left Behind|url=http://www.scoe.org/pub/htdocs/nclb.html|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCLB expanded the federal role in public education through further emphasis on annual testing, annual academic progress, report cards, and teacher qualifications, as well as significant changes in funding.&lt;ref name="No Child Left Behind"/&gt;

The bill passed in the Congress with bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/1 |title=To close the achievement gap with accountability, flexibility, and choice, so that no child is left behind.|date=2001-03-22 |publisher=Library of Congress&lt;!--|publisher-url=https://www.congress.gov/--&gt;|accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, criticism from right, left, and center had accumulated so much that a [[bipartisan Congress]] stripped away the national features of No Child Left Behind.

==Provisions of the act==
No Child Left Behind requires all public schools receiving federal funding to administer a statewide [[standardized test]] annually to all students. Schools that receive [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act#Title|Title I]] funding through the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] must make [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP) in test scores (e.g. each year, fifth graders must do better on standardized tests than the previous year's fifth graders).

* Schools that miss AYP for a second consecutive year are publicly labeled as "In Need of Improvement," and must develop a two-year improvement plan for the subject that the school is not teaching well. Students have the option to transfer to a better school within the school district, if any exists.
* Missing AYP in the third year forces the school to offer free tutoring and other supplemental education services to students who are struggling.
* If a school misses its AYP target for a fourth consecutive year, the school is labelled as requiring "corrective action," which might involve wholesale replacement of staff, introduction of a new curriculum, or extending the amount of time students spend in class.
* A fifth year of failure results in planning to restructure the entire school; the plan is implemented if the school unsuccessfully hits its AYP targets for the sixth consecutive year. Common options include closing the school, turning the school into a [[charter school]], hiring a private company to run the school, or asking the state office of education to run the school directly.

States must create AYP objectives consistent with the following requirements of the law:&lt;ref name="American Educational Research Assosiation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linn|first=Robert L.|author2=Eva L. Baker |author3=Damian W Betebenner |title=Accountability Systems: Implications of Requirements of the No Child Left behind Act of 2001|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=31|date= Aug–Sep 2002|issue=6|pages=3–16|jstor=3594432|doi=10.3102/0013189x031006003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# States must develop AYP statewide measurable objectives for improved achievement by all students and for specific groups: economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and students with [[limited English proficiency]].
# The objectives must be set with the goal of having all students at the proficient level or above within 12 years (i.e. by the end of the 2013–14 school year).
# AYP must be primarily based on state assessments, but must also include one additional academic indicator.
# The AYP objectives must be assessed at the school level. Schools that failed to meet their AYP objective for two consecutive years are identified for improvement.
# School AYP results must be reported separately for each group of students identified above so that it can be determined whether each student group met the AYP objective.
# At least 95% of each group must participate in state assessments.
# States may aggregate up to three years of data in making AYP determinations.

The act requires states to provide "[[Highly Qualified Teachers|highly qualified]]" teachers to all students. Each state sets its own standards for what counts as "highly qualified." Similarly, the act requires states to set "one high, challenging standard" for its students. Each state decides for itself what counts as "one high, challenging standard," but the curriculum standards must be applied to all students, rather than having different standards for students in different cities or other parts of the state.

The act also requires schools to let military recruiters have students' contact information and other access to the student, if the school provides that information to universities or employers, unless the students opt out of giving military recruiters access. This portion of the law has drawn lots of criticism and has even led to political resistance. For instance, in 2003 in [[Santa Cruz, California]], student-led efforts forced school districts to create an "opt-in" policy that required students affirm they wanted the military to have their information. This successful student organizing effort was copied in various other cities throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2003/04/23/32recruit.h22.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on teachers, schools, and school districts==

===Increased accountability===
Supporters of the NCLB claim one of the strong positive points of the bill is the increased accountability that is required of schools and teachers. According to the legislation, schools must pass yearly tests that judge student improvement over the fiscal year. These yearly standardized tests are the main means of determining whether schools live up to required standards. If required improvements are not made, the schools face decreased funding and other punishments that contribute to the increased accountability. According to supporters, these goals help teachers and schools realize the significance and importance of the educational system and how it affects the nation. Opponents of this law say that the punishments only hurt the schools and do not contribute to the improvement of student education.

In addition to and in support of the above points, proponents claim that No Child Left Behind:
* Links state academic content standards with student outcomes
* Measures student performance: a student's progress in reading and math must be measured annually in grades 3 through 8 and at least once during high school via [[standardized test]]s
* Provides information for parents by requiring states and school districts to give parents detailed report cards on schools and districts explaining the school's AYP performance; schools must inform parents when their child is taught by a teacher or para-professional who does not meet "highly qualified" requirements
* Establishes the foundation for schools and school districts to significantly enhance parental involvement and improved administration through the use of the assessment data to drive decisions on instruction, curriculum and business practices

The commonwealth of Pennsylvania has proposed tying teacher's salaries to test scores.  If a district's students do poorly, the state cuts the district's budget the following year and the teachers get a pay cut. Critics point out that if a school does poorly, reducing its budget and cutting teacher salaries will likely hamper the school's ability to improve.

===School choice===
* Gives options to students enrolled in schools failing to meet AYP. If a school fails to meet AYP targets two or more years running, the school must offer eligible children the chance to transfer to higher-performing local schools, receive free tutoring, or attend after-school programs.
* Gives school districts the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency, even for subgroups that do not meet State Minimum Achievement standards, through a process called "safe harbor," a precursor to growth-based or [[value-added modeling|value-added assessments]].

===Narrow definition of research===
The act requires schools to rely on [[scientifically based research]] for programs and teaching methods.  The act defines this as "research that involves the application of rigorous, systematic, and objective procedures to obtain reliable and valid knowledge relevant to education activities and programs." Scientifically based research results in "replicable and applicable findings" from research that used appropriate methods to generate persuasive, empirical conclusions.&lt;ref name=Beghetto&gt;Beghetto, R. (2003) [http://www.ericdigests.org/2003-5/based.htm Scientifically Based Research.] ERIC Clearinghouse on Educational Management. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality and distribution of teachers===
Prior to the NCLB act, new teachers were typically required to have a bachelor's degree, be fully certified, and demonstrate subject matter knowledge—generally through tests. It is widely accepted&lt;ref&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; that teacher knowledge has two components: specific subject matter knowledge (CK) such as an understanding of mathematics for a mathematics teacher, and pedagogical knowledge (PCK), which is knowledge of the subject of teaching/learning itself. Both types of knowledge, as well as experience in guided student teaching, help form the qualities needed by effective teachers.

Under NCLB, existing teachers—including those with tenure—were also supposed to meet standards. They could meet the same requirements set for new teachers or could meet a state-determined "...high, objective, uniform state standard of evaluation," aka HOUSSE. Downfall of the quality requirements of the NCLB legislation have received little research attention, in part because state rules require few changes from pre-existing practice. There is also little evidence that the rules have altered trends in observable teacher traits.&lt;ref name="American Economic Assosiation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanushek|first=Eric A.|author2=Steven G. Rivkin |title=The Quality and Distribution of Teachers under the No Child Left Behind Act|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=24|date= Summer 2010|issue=3|pages=133–50|jstor=20799159|doi=10.1257/jep.24.3.133|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.3.133}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, American educators have been struggling to identify those teacher traits that are important contributors to student achievement. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what traits are most important and most education policy experts agree that further research is required.

==Effects on student assessment==
Several analyses of state accountability systems that were in place before NCLB indicate that outcomes accountability led to faster growth in achievement for the states that introduced such systems.&lt;ref&gt;See the analyses of NAEP results in Martin Carnoy and Susanna Loeb, "Does external accountability affect student outcomes? A cross-state analysis," ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'' 24, no. 4 (Winter 2002): 305–31, and [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Margaret E. Raymond, "Does school accountability lead to improved student performance?" ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' 24, no. 2 (Spring 2005): 297–327.&lt;/ref&gt;  The direct analysis of state test scores before and after enactment of NCLB also supports its positive impact.&lt;ref&gt;Center on Education Policy, ''Answering the Question That Matters Most: Has Student Achievement Increased Since No Child Left Behind?''  Washington:  Center on Education Policy, June 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; A primary criticism asserts that NCLB reduces effective instruction and student learning by causing states to lower achievement goals and motivate teachers to "teach to the test."  A primary supportive claim asserts that systematic testing provides data that shed light on which schools don't teach basic skills effectively, so that interventions can be made to improve outcomes for all students while reducing the achievement gap for disadvantaged and disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/nochild/ List of articles regarding NCLB debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improved test scores==
The Department of Education points to the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP) results, released in July 2005, showing improved student achievement in reading and math:&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/importance/nclbworking.html No Child Left Behind Act Is Working] Department of Education. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* More progress was made by nine-year-olds in reading in the last five years than in the previous 28 years combined.
* America's nine-year-olds posted the best scores in reading (since 1971) and math  (since 1973) in the history of the report. America's 13-year-olds earned the highest math scores the test ever recorded.
* Reading and math scores for [[African American|black]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] nine-year-olds reached an all-time high.
* Achievement gaps in reading and math between white and black nine-year-olds and between white and Hispanic nine-year-olds are at an all-time low.
* Forty-three states and the District of Columbia either improved academically or held steady in all categories (fourth- and eighth-grade reading and fourth- and eighth-grade math).

These statistics compare 2005 with 2000 though No Child Left Behind did not even take effect until 2003. Critics point out that the increase in scores between 2000 and 2005 was roughly the same as the increase between 2003 and 2005, which calls into question how any increase can be attributed to No Child Left Behind. They also argue that some of the subgroups are [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picked]]—that in other subgroups scores remained the same or fell.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Perlstein, ''Tested''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the makers of the standardized tests have been blamed for making the tests easier so that it is easier for schools to sufficiently improve.

Education researchers Thomas Dee and Brian Jacob argue that NCLB showed statistically significant positive impact on students' performance on 4th-grade math exams (equal to two-thirds of a year's worth of growth), smaller and statistically insignificant improvements in 8th-grade math exam performance, and no discernible improvement in reading performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=http://educationnext.org/evaluating-nclb/|title=Evaluating No Child Left Behind|first1=Thomas|last1=Dee|first2=Brian|last2=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of standardized testing===
Critics argue that the focus on [[standardized test]]ing (all students in a state take the same test under the same conditions) encourages teachers to teach a narrow subset of skills that the school believes increases [[Test preparation|test performance]], rather than achieve in-depth understanding of the overall curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.reading.org/resources/issues/positions_high_stakes.html High-Stakes Assessments in Reading] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827061209/http://www.reading.org/resources/issues/positions_high_stakes.html |date=2006-08-27 }}. International Reading Association. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a teacher who knows that all questions on a math test are simple addition problems (e.g., What is 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3?) might not invest any class time on the practical applications of addition, to leave more time for the material the test assesses. This is colloquially referred to as "[[teaching to the test]]."  "Teaching to the test" has been observed to raise test scores, though not as much as other teaching techniques.&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite journal

Many teachers who practice "teaching to the test" misinterpret the educational outcomes the tests are designed to measure. On two state tests, [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Michigan]], and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) almost two-thirds of eighth graders missed math word problems that required an application of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] to calculate the distance between two points.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, G. &amp; McTighe, J. (2005). Understanding by design, 2nd Edition. ASCD. {{ISBN|978-1-4166-0035-0}}. pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  The teachers correctly anticipated the content of the tests, but incorrectly assumed each test would present simplistic items rather than higher-order items.

Another problem is that outside influences often affect student performance.  Students who struggle to take tests may perform well using another method of learning such as project-based learning.  Sometimes, factors such as home life can affect test performance.  Basing performance on one test inaccurately measures student success overall.  No Child Left behind has failed to account for all these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-child-has-failed/2015/02/13/8d619026-b2f8-11e4-827f-93f454140e2b_story.html|title=‘No Child’ has failed|last=Eskelsen García|first=Lily|last2=Thornton|first2=Otha|date=February 13, 2015|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Those opposed to the use of testing to determine educational achievement prefer alternatives such as subjective teacher opinions, classwork, and [[Educational assessment|performance-based assessments]].&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.fairtest.org/facts/whatwron.htm What's Wrong With Standardized Testing?] FairTest.org. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under No Child Left Behind, schools were held almost exclusively accountable for absolute levels of student performance.  But that meant that even schools that were making great strides with students were still labeled as "failing" just because the students had not yet made it all the way to a "proficient" level of achievement.  Since 2005, the U.S. Department of Education has approved 15 states to implement growth model pilots.  Each state adopted one of four distinct growth models: Trajectory, Transition Tables, Student Growth Percentiles, and Projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carey|first=Kevin|title=Growth Models and Accountability: A Recipe for Remaking ESEA|journal=Education Sector|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incentives for improvement also may cause states to lower their official standards. Because each state can produce its own standardized tests, a state can make its statewide tests easier to increase scores.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://ed.sc.gov/news/more.cfm?articleID=385 New study confirms vast differences in state goals for academic ‘proficiency’ under NCLB].

==Intended effects on curriculum and standards==

===Improvement over local standards===
Many argue that local government had failed students, necessitating federal intervention to remedy issues like teachers teaching outside their areas of expertise, and complacency in the face of continually failing schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mizell, H|year=2003|url=http://www.middleweb.com/HMnclb.html|title=NCLB: Conspiracy, Compliance, or Creativity?|accessdate=2007-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713071731/http://www.middleweb.com/HMnclb.html|archive-date=2007-07-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some local governments, notably that of New York state, have supported NCLB provisions, because local standards failed to provide adequate oversight over special education, and NCLB would let them use longitudinal data more effectively to monitor [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html#no%20child|title=Federal Legislation and Education in New York State 2005: No Child Left Behind Act|year=2005|publisher=New York State Education Agency|accessdate=2007-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509143713/http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html#no%20child|archivedate=2007-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; States all over the United States have shown improvements in their progress as an apparent result of NCLB. For example, Wisconsin ranks first of all fifty states plus the District of Columbia, with ninety-eight percent of its schools achieving No Child Left Behind standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2008/state.php?state=WI |title=NPR and Newshour 2008 Election Map: More about Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of education===
* Increases the quality of education by requiring schools to improve their performance
* Improves quality of instruction by requiring schools to implement "scientifically based research" practices in the classroom, parent involvement programs, and professional development activities for those students that are not encouraged or expected to attend college.
* Supports early literacy through the Early Reading First initiative.
* Emphasizes reading, language arts, mathematics and science achievement as "core academic subjects."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;United States. Public Law 107-110. 107th Congress, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Student performance in other subjects (besides reading and math) will be measured as a part of overall progress.

===Effect on arts and electives===
NCLB’s main focus is on skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, which are areas related to economic success.  Combined with the budget crises in the [[late-2000s recession]], some schools have cut or eliminated classes and resources for many subject areas that are not part of NCLB's accountability standards.&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, T. (2010). No Child Left Behind and Fine Arts Classes. Arts Education Policy Review, 111(1), 4–7. {{doi|10.1080/10632910903228090}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2007, almost 71% of schools have reduced instruction time in subjects such as history, arts, language, and music to provide more time and resources to mathematics and English.&lt;ref&gt;Grey, A.

In some schools, the classes remain available, but individual students who are not proficient in basic skills are sent to [[remedial education|remedial]] reading or mathematics classes rather than arts, sports, or other optional subjects.

According to Paul Reville, the author of "Stop Narrowing of the Curriculum By Right-Sizing School Time," teachers are learning that students need more time to excel in the "needed" subjects. The students need more time to achieve the basic goals that should come by somewhat relevant to a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reville|first=Paul|title=Stop the Narrowing of the Curriculum By ‘Right-Sizing’ School Time|journal=Education Week 24|date=October 2007|issue=Academic Search Premier. EBSCO.Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physical Education]], on the other hand, is one of the subjects least affected.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Jennings and Diane Stark Rentner, Ten Big Effects of the No Child Left Behind Act on Public Schools,  Phi Delta Kappan, Vol. 88, No. 02, October 2006, pp. 110–13&lt;/ref&gt; Some might find this confusing because like many electives and non-core classes, No Child Left Behind does not address Physical Education directly.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Speregen, "Physical Education in America's Public Schools" UMich.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Two reasons why Physical Education is not adversely affected include the obesity crisis in the United States that the federal government is trying to reverse through programs like First Lady Michelle Obama's ''Let's Move Campaign,'' which among other things, looks to improve the quantity and quality of physical education.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Williams1, Mark B. McClellan and Alice M. Rivlin, "Beyond The Affordable Care Act: Achieving Real Improvements In Americans’ Health" Health Affairs August 2010 29: 81481–88&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there is research, including a 2005 study by Dr. Charles H. Hillmam of The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that concludes that fitness is globally related to academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman et al. 2005; CDE, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The opportunities, challenges, and risks that No Child Left Behind poses for science education in elementary and middle schools—worldwide competition insists on rapidly improving science education. Adding science assessments to the NCLB requirements may ultimately result in science being taught in more elementary schools and by more teachers than ever before. 2/3 of elementary school teachers indicated that they were not familiar with national science standards. Most concern circulates around the result that, consuming too much time for language arts and mathematics may limit children's experience—and curiosity and interest—in sciences.&lt;ref name="The University of Chicago Press"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marx|first=Ronald W.|author2=Christopher J.

===Limitations on local control===
Both U.S. [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[American liberalism|liberal]] critics have argued that NCLB's new standards in federalizing education set a negative precedent for further erosion of [[States' rights|state]] and local control. [[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] further argue that the federal government has no [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] authority in education, which is why participation in NCLB is technically optional. They believe that states need not comply with NCLB so long as they forgo the federal funding that comes with it.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, R.

==Effects on school and students==

===Gifted students===
NCLB pressures schools to guarantee that nearly all students meet the minimum skill levels (set by each state) in reading, writing, and arithmetic—but requires nothing beyond these minima. It provides no incentives to improve student achievement beyond the bare minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs not essential for achieving mandated minimum skills are neglected or canceled by those districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/news/2013/04/08/59542/5-ways-no-child-left-behind-waivers-help-state-education-reform/|title=5 Ways No Child Left Behind Waivers Help State Education Reform  - Center for American Progress|date=2013-04-08|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unrealistic goals===
"There's a fallacy in the law and everybody knows it," said Alabama State Superintendent Joe Morton on Wednesday, August 11, 2010. According to the No Child Left Behind Act, by 2014, every child is supposed to test on grade level in reading and math. "That can't happen," said Morton. "You have too many variables and you have too many scenarios, and everybody knows that would never happen." Alabama State Board Member Mary Jane Caylor said, "I don't think that No Child Left Behind has benefited this state." She argued the goal of 100 percent proficiency is unattainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.al.com/breaking/2010/08/times_watchdog_report_no_child.html Times Watchdog Report: No Child Left Behind on the way out, but not anytime soon].

However, none of these "missing" students from Sharpstown High were reported as dropouts.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meier and Woods|first=D. and G.|year=2004|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-0459-6|page=36|title = Many Children Left Behind: How the No Child Left Behind Act Is Damaging Our Children and Our Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variability in student potential and 100% compliance===
The act is promoted as requiring 100% of students (including disadvantaged and [[special education]] students) within a school to reach the same state standards in reading and mathematics by 2014; detractors charge that a 100% goal is unattainable, and critics of the NCLB requirement for "one high, challenging standard" claim that some students are simply unable to perform at the given level for their age, no matter how effective the teacher is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edaccountability.org/ EdAccountability.org] website.&lt;/ref&gt; While statewide standards reduce the [[educational inequality]] between privileged and underprivileged districts in a state, they still impose a "one size fits all" standard on individual students. Particularly in states with high standards, schools can be punished for not being able to dramatically raise the achievement of students that may have below-average capabilities{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

In fact, the "all" in NCLB means only 95% of students, because states must report the assessment scores of 95% of students when calculating [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP) scores.&lt;ref name="Wrightslaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrightslaw.com/heath/nclb.support.htm |title=Doing Your Homework: Answering Questions about Support for NCLB by Sue Heath – Wrightslaw |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students who have an [[Individualized Education Program|Individual Education Plan]] (IEP) and who are assessed must receive the accommodations specified in the IEP during assessment; if these accommodations do not change the nature of the [[Educational assessment|assessment]], then these students' scores are counted the same as any other student's score.  Common acceptable changes include extended test time, testing in a quieter room, translation of math problems into the student's native language, or allowing a student to type answers instead of writing them by hand.

Simply being classified as having [[special education]] needs does not automatically exempt students from assessment.  Most students with mild disabilities or physical disabilities take the same test as non-disabled students.

In addition to not requiring 5% of students to be assessed at all, regulations let schools use alternate assessments to declare up to 1% of all students proficient for the purposes of the Act.&lt;ref name="titleVDOE :: No Child Left Behind – NCLB, Understanding AYP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/src/vps-accountability.shtml |title=VDOE :: No Child Left Behind – NCLB, Understanding AYP |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080211145310/http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/src/vps-accountability.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  States are given broad discretion in selecting alternate assessments.  For example, a school may accept an [[Advanced Placement]] test for English in lieu of the English test written by the state, and simplified tests for students with significant cognitive disabilities.  The Virginia Alternate Assessment Program (VAAP) and Virginia Grade Level Alternative (VGLA) options, for example, are [[portfolio assessment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/srv/terminology.shtml "Terminology" Virginia Department of Education website]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that support NCLB assessment of disabled or limited English proficient (LEP) students say that [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]] ensures that deficiencies in the education of these disadvantaged students are identified and addressed.  Opponents say that testing students with disabilities violates the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) by making students with disabilities learn the same material as non-disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Liz. [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/education/no_child/impact.html  "No Child Left Behind’s Impact on Specialized Education"]. Online NewsHour.  August 21, 2005. pbs.org/newshour. 20 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children with disabilities===
NCLB includes incentives to reward schools showing progress for students with disabilities and other measures to fix or provide students with alternative options than schools not meeting the needs of the disabled population.&lt;ref&gt;[[No Child Left Behind Act#Provisions of the act]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law is written so that the scores of students with IEPs (Individualized Education Plans) and 504 plans are counted just as other students' scores are counted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Schools have argued against having disabled populations involved in their AYP measurements because they claim that there are too many variables involved.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Aligning the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act===
Stemming from the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (EAHCA) of 1975, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was enacted in its first form in 1997, and then reenacted with new education aspects in 2006 (although still referred to as [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA 2004]]). It kept the EAHCA requirements of free and accessible education for all children.  The 2004 IDEA authorized formula grants to states and discretionary grants for research, technology, and training.  It also required schools to use research-based interventions to assist students with disabilities.

The amount of funding each school would receive from its "Local Education Agency" for each year would be divided by the number of children with disabilities and multiplied by the number of students with disabilities participating in the schoolwide programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cdynamic%2CTopicalBrief%2C11%2C |title=Building The Legacy of IDEA 2004 |publisher=Idea.ed.gov |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act#Alignment with No Child Left Behind]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly since 2004, policymakers have sought to align IDEA with NCLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/tb-nclb-align.pdf|title=Reauthorized Statute Alignment With the No Child Left Behind Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IDEA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious points of alignment include the shared requirements for [[Highly Qualified Teachers]], for establishment of goals for students with special needs,  and for assessment levels for these students. In 2004, George Bush signed provisions that would define for both of these acts what was considered a "highly qualified teacher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cdynamic%2CTopicalBrief%2C3%2C |title=Building The Legacy of IDEA 2004 |publisher=Idea.ed.gov |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive effects for students with disabilities===
The [[National Council on Disability]] (NCD) looks at how NCLB and IDEA are improving outcomes for students with Down syndrome.  The effects they investigate include reducing the number of students who drop out, increasing graduation rates, and effective strategies to transition students to post-secondary education.  Their studies have reported that NCLB and IDEA have changed the attitudes and expectations for students with disabilities. They are pleased that students are finally included in state assessment and accountability systems. NCLB made assessments be taken "seriously," they found, as now assessments and accommodations are under review by administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf|title=No Child Left Behind: Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities|last=American Youth Policy Forum|first=|last2=Educational Policy Institute|publisher=National Council on Disability|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization that found positive correlations between NCLB and IDEA was the National Center on Educational Outcomes.  It published a brochure for parents of students with disabilities about how the two (NCLB &amp; IDEA) work well together because they "provide both individualized instruction and school accountability for students and disabilities."  They specifically highlight the new focus on "shared responsibility of general and special education teachers," forcing schools to have disabled students more on their radar." They do acknowledge, however, that for each student to "participate in the general curriculum [of high standards for all students] and make progress toward proficiency," additional time and effort for coordination are needed.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 10–12, http://www.cehd.umn.edu/nceo/onlinepubs/parents.pdf, "NCLB and IDEA: What parents need to know and do"&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Center on Educational Outcomes reported that now disabled students will receive "...the academic attention and resources they deserved."&lt;ref&gt;p. 20, http://www.cehd.umn.edu/nceo/onlinepubs/parents.pdf, "NCLB and IDEA: What parents need to know and do"&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular research has been done on how the laws impact students who are [[deaf]] or hard of hearing. First, the legislation makes schools responsible for how students with disabilities score—emphasizing "...student outcomes instead of placement."&lt;ref&gt;pp. 480–81, "Policies for Students Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Hidden Benefits and Unintended Consequences of No Child Left Behind," http://aer.sagepub.com/content/44/3/460.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;  It also puts the public’s eye on how outside programs can be utilized to improve outcomes for this underserved population, and has thus prompted more research on the effectiveness of certain in- and out-of-school interventions.  For example, NCLB requirements have made researchers begin to study the effects of read aloud or interpreters on both reading and mathematics assessments, and on having students sign responses that are then recorded by a scribe.

Still, research thus far on the positive effects of NCLB/IDEA is limited.  It has been aimed at young students in an attempt to find strategies to help them learn to read.  Evaluations also have included a limited number of students, which make it very difficult to draw conclusions to a broader group.  Evaluations also focus only on one type of disabilities.

===Negative effects for students with disabilities===
The National Council for Disabilities had reservations about how the regulations of NCLB fit with those of IDEA.  One concern is how schools can effectively intervene and develop strategies when NCLB calls for group accountability rather than individual student attention.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, "No Child Left Behind:Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities" http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Individual nature of IDEA is "inconsistent with the group nature of NCLB."&lt;ref&gt;p. 23, "No Child Left Behind:Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities" http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They worry that NCLB focuses too much on standardized testing and not enough on the work-based experience necessary for obtaining jobs in the future.  Also, NCLB is measured essentially by a single test score, but IDEA calls for various measures of student success.

IDEA's focus on various measures stems from its foundation in Individualized Education Plans for students with disabilities (IEP). An IEP is designed to give students with disabilities individual goals that are often not on their grade level. An IEP is intended for "developing goals and objectives that correspond to the needs of the student, and ultimately choosing a placement in the least restrictive environment possible for the student."&lt;ref&gt;[[Individualized Education Program]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the IEP, students could be able to legally have lowered success criteria for academic success.

A 2006 report by the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy (CEEP) and the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community indicated that most states were not making AYP because of special education subgroups even though progress had been made toward that end.  This was in effect pushing schools to cancel the inclusion model and keep special education students separate. "IDEA calls for individualized curriculum and assessments that determine success based on growth and improvement each year. NCLB, in contrast, measures all students by the same markers, which are based not on individual improvement but by proficiency in math and reading," the study states.&lt;ref&gt;Education Policy Brief, Closing the Achievement Gap Series: Part III, "What is the Impact of NCLB on the Inclusion of Students with Disabilities?"
Cassandra Cole, http://www.ceep.indiana.edu/projects/PDF/PB_V4N11_Fall_2006_NCLB_dis.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425124129/http://www.ceep.indiana.edu/projects/PDF/PB_V4N11_Fall_2006_NCLB_dis.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed with the Indiana University Newsroom, author of the CEEP report Sandi Cole said, "The system needs to make sense. Don't we want to know how much a child is progressing towards the standards?...We need a system that values learning and growth over time, in addition to helping students reach high standards."&lt;ref&gt;Cassandro Cole, Interview w/ Newsroom Indiana University, http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/4379.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Cole found in her survey that NCLB encourages teachers to teach to the test, limiting curriculum choices/options, and to use the special education students as a "scapegoat" for their school not making AYP.  In addition, Indiana administrators who responded to the survey indicated that NCLB testing has led to higher numbers of students with disabilities dropping out of school.

Legal journals have also commented on the incompatibility of IDEA and NCLB; some say the acts may never be reconciled with one another.&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of No Child Left Behind on IDEA’s Guarantee of Free, Appropriate Public Education for Students with Disabilities: A Critical Review of Recent Case Law, http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130163302/http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an IEP is designed specifically for individual student achievement, which gives the rights to parents to ensure that the schools are following the necessary protocols of Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). They worry that not enough emphasis is being placed on the child's IEP with this setup. In Board of Education for Ottawa Township High School District 140 v. Spelling, two Illinois school districts and parents of disabled students challenged the legality of NCLB’s testing requirements in light of IDEA’s mandate to provide students with individualized education.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, The Impact of No Child Left Behind on IDEA’s Guarantee of Free, Appropriate Public Education for Students with Disabilities: A Critical Review of Recent Case Law, http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130163302/http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although students there were aligned with "proficiency" to state standards, students did not meet requirements of their IEP.  Their parents feared that students were not given right to FAPE.  The case questioned which better indicated progress: standardized test measures, or IEP measures?  It concluded that since some students may never test on grade level, all students with disabilities should be given more options and accommodations with standardized testing than they currently receive.

==Effects on racial and ethnic minority students==

===Attention to minority populations===
* Seeks to narrow the class and [[racial achievement gap in the United States]] by creating common expectations for all. NCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although test scores are improving, they are not improving equally for all races, which means that minority students are still behind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* Requires schools and districts to focus their attention on the academic achievement of traditionally under-served groups of children, such as low-income students, students with disabilities, and students of "major racial and ethnic subgroups".&lt;ref name="titleCharting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2004/01/01142004.html#elements |title=Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind |accessdate=2008-04-09 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each state is responsible for defining major racial and ethnic subgroups itself.&lt;ref name="titleCharting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind"/&gt;  Many previous state-created systems of accountability measured only average school performance—so schools could be highly rated even if they had large achievement gaps between affluent and disadvantaged students.

===State refusal to produce non-English assessments===
All students who are learning English would have an automatic three-year window to take assessments in their native language, after which they must normally demonstrate proficiency on an English-language assessment. However, the local education authority may grant an exception to any individual English learner for another two years' testing in his or her native language on a case-by-case basis.

In practice, however, only 10 states choose to test any English language learners in their native language (almost entirely Spanish speakers).&lt;!-- dead ref: http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/03/01/25ell.h25.html --&gt; The vast majority of English language learners are given English language assessments.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, J. (nd) [http://www.nabe.org/Resources/Documents/NCLB%20page/NABE_on_NCLB.pdf No Child Left Behind: Misguided Approach to School Accountability for English Language Learners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408184000/http://www.nabe.org/Resources/Documents/NCLB%20page/NABE_on_NCLB.pdf |date=2013-04-08 }}. National Association for Bilingual Education. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many schools test or assess students with limited English proficiency even when the students are exempt from NCLB-mandated reporting, because the tests may provide useful information to the teacher and school.  In certain schools with large immigrant populations, this exemption comprises a majority of young students.

NCLB testing under-reports learning at non-English-language immersion schools, particularly those that immerse students in Native American languages.  NCLB requires some Native American students to take standardized tests in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/native-american-languages-act-twenty-years-later-has-it-made-difference |title=Native American Languages Act: Twenty Years Later, Has It Made a Difference? |publisher=Cultural Survival |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, the students could be legally tested in their native language, except that the state has not paid to have the test translated.

===Demographic study of AYP failure rates and requirement for failing schools===
One study found that schools in California and Illinois that have not met AYP serve 75–85% minority students while schools meeting AYP have less than 40% minority students.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, A., &amp; Sunderman, G. L. (2006). ''School Accountability under NCLB: Aid or Obstacle for Measuring Racial Equity?'' Cambridge, MA: Civil Rights Project at Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools that do not meet AYP are required to offer their students' parents the opportunity to transfer their students to a non-failing school within the district, but it is not required that the other school accepts the student.&lt;ref name="Knaus, Christopher 2007"&gt;Knaus, Christopher. (2007). [http://www.berkeleyrep.org/school/images/Knaus.pdf ''Still Segregated Still Unequal: Analyzing the Impact of No Child Left Behind on African American Students'']. University of California, Berkeley: National Urban League.&lt;/ref&gt; NCLB controls the portion of federal Title I funding based upon each school meeting annual set standards.  Any participating school that does not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for two years must offer parents the choice to send their child to a non-failing school in the district, and after three years, must provide supplemental services, such as free tutoring or after-school assistance. After five years of not meeting AYP, the school must make dramatic changes to how the school is run, which could entail state-takeover.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education: The Condition of Education 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
As part of their support for NCLB, the administration and Congress backed massive increases in funding for elementary and secondary education.  Total federal education funding increased from $42.2 billion to $55.7 billion from 2001, the fiscal year before the law's passage, to fiscal year 2004.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Proposal [http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget09/summary/edlite-section1.html].&lt;/ref&gt; A new $1 billion Reading First program was created, distributing funds to local schools to improve the teaching of reading, and over $100 million for its companion, Early Reading First.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget05/summary/edlite-section1.html U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other formula programs received large increases as well.  This was consistent with the administration's position of funding formula programs, which distribute money to local schools for their use, and grant programs, where particular schools or groups apply directly to the federal government for funding. In total, federal funding for education increased 59.8% from 2000 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/index.htm |title=Archived:Introduction: No Child Left Behind |publisher=US Department of Education |accessdate=2009-02-23 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The act created a new competitive-grant program called Reading First, funded at $1.02 billion in 2004, to help states and districts set up "scientific, research-based" reading programs for children in grades K–3 (with priority given to high-poverty areas). A smaller early-reading program sought to help states better prepare 3- to 5-year-olds in disadvantaged areas to read. The program's funding was later cut drastically by Congress amid budget talks.&lt;ref name="edweek.org"&gt;{{cite web|title = No Child Left Behind: An Overview|url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|publisher = Education Week|accessdate = 29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding Changes: Through an alteration in the Title I funding formula, the No Child Left Behind Act was expected to better target resources to school districts with high concentrations of poor children. The law also included provisions intended to give states and districts greater flexibility in how they spent a portion of their federal allotments.&lt;ref name="edweek.org"/&gt;

Funding for school technology used in classrooms as part of NCLB is administered by the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT). Funding sources are used for equipment, professional development and training for educators, and updated research.  EETT allocates funds by formula to states. The states, in turn, reallocate 50% of the funds to local districts by Title I formula and 50% competitively. While districts must reserve a minimum of 25% of all EETT funds for professional development, recent studies indicate that most EETT recipients use far more than 25% of their EETT funds to train teachers to use technology and integrate it into their curricula. In fact, EETT recipients committed more than $159 million in EETT funds towards professional development during the 2004–05 school year alone.  Moreover, even though EETT recipients are afforded broad discretion in their use of EETT funds, surveys show that they target EETT dollars towards improving student achievement in reading and mathematics, engaging in data-driven decision making, and launching online assessment programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In addition, the provisions of NCLB permitted increased flexibility for state and local agencies in the use of federal education money.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCLB increases were companions to another massive increase in federal education funding at that time.  The Bush administration and congress passed very large increases in funding for the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) at the same time as the NCLB increases.  IDEA Part B, a state formula-funding program that distributes money to local districts for the education of students with disabilities, was increased from $6.3 billion in 2001 to $10.1 billion in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget07/summary/edlite-section1.html U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; Because a district's and state's performance on NCLB measures depended on improved performance by students with disabilities, particularly, students with learning disabilities, this 60 percent increase in funding was also an important part of the overall approach to NCLB implementation.

===Criticisms of funding levels===
Some critics claim that extra expenses are not fully reimbursed by increased levels of federal NCLB funding. Others note that funding for the law increased massively following passage&lt;ref name="Education 2006"&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/edlite-chart.html#5 U.S. Department of Education, Elementary and Secondary Education Act Budget Table]. 2006. 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and that billions in funds previously allocated to particular uses could be reallocated to new uses.  Even before the law's passage, Secretary of Education Rod Paige noted ensuring that children are educated remained a state responsibility regardless of federal support:
{{quote|Washington is willing to help [with the additional costs of federal requirements], as we've helped before, even before we [proposed NCLB]. But this is a part of the teaching responsibility that each state has. ... Washington has offered some assistance now. In the legislation, we have ... some support to pay for the development of tests. But even if that should be looked at as a gift, it is the state responsibility to do this.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/interviews/paige.html|title= Frontline. Testing Our Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Various early Democratic supporters of NCLB criticize its implementation, claiming it is not adequately funded by either the federal government or the states. [[Ted Kennedy]], the legislation's initial sponsor, once stated: "The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not."&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.amconmag.com/2005_08_01/article.html Leaving No Child Left Behind: States charged with implementing Bush’s national education plan balk at the cost of compliance.] ''The American Conservative.'' Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan B. Neuman]], U.S. Department of Education's former Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, commented about her worries of NCLB in a meeting of the [[International Reading Association]]:
{{quote|In [the most disadvantaged schools] in America, even the most earnest teacher has often given up because they lack every available resource that could possibly make a difference. ... When we say all children can achieve and then not give them the additional resources ... we are creating a fantasy.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html|title=Bush Education Ad: Going Positive, Selectively|publisher=[[FactCheck]]|year=2004|accessdate=2007-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107021306/http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html|archive-date=2008-01-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Organizations have particularly criticized the unwillingness of the federal government to "fully fund" the act. Noting that [[United States House of Representatives#Legislative functions|appropriations bills always originate in the House of Representatives]], it is true that during the Bush Administration, neither the Senate nor the White House has even requested federal funding up to the authorized levels for several of the act’s main provisions. For example, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] requested only $13.3 billion of a possible $22.75 billion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.aft.org/topics/nclb/funding.htm Funding] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019125537/http://www.aft.org/topics/nclb/funding.htm |date=2006-10-19 }}.

Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocacy groups note that President Bush's 2008 budget proposal allotted $61 billion for the Education Department, cutting funding by $1.3 billion from the year before. 44 out of 50 states would have received reductions in federal funding if the budget passed as it was.&lt;ref&gt;Center for American Progress [http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/10/education_map.html The Targets of Bush's Education Cuts].&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, funding for the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT) has continued to drop while the demand for technology in schools has increased (Technology and Learning, 2006). However, these claims focused on reallocated funds, as each of President Bush's proposed budgets increased funding for major NCLB formula programs such as [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act|Title I]], including his final 2009 budget proposal.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;

Members of Congress have viewed these authorized levels as spending caps, not spending promises. Some opponents argue that these funding shortfalls mean that schools faced with the system of escalating penalties for failing to meet testing targets are denied the resources necessary to remedy problems detected by testing. However, federal NCLB formula funding increased by billions during this period&lt;ref name="Education 2006"/&gt; and state and local funding increased by over $100 billion from school year 2001–02 through 2006–07.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_026.asp?referrer=list National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiscal year 2007, $75 billion in costs were shifted from NCLB, adding further stresses on state budgets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/StateFederalCommittees/BudgetsRevenue/MandateMonitorOverview/tabid/15850/Default.aspx:Mandate Monitor Overview]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decrease resulted in schools cutting programs that served to educate children, which subsequently impacted the ability to meet the goals of NCLB. The decrease in funding came at a time when there was an increase in expectations for school performance. To make ends meet, many schools re-allocated funds that had been intended for other purposes (e.g., arts, sports, etc.)  to achieve the national educational goals set by NCLB. Congress acknowledged these funding decreases and retroactively provided the funds to cover shortfalls, but without the guarantee of permanent aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13746166 |title=Funding Stagnant for No Child Left Behind Program |publisher=NPR |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number one area where funding was cut from the national budget was in Title I funding for disadvantaged students and schools.&lt;ref name="cgcs.org"&gt;[http://www.cgcs.org/images/Legislative/Feb06.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120172356/http://www.cgcs.org/images/Legislative/Feb06.pdf|date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

According to the book ''NCLB Meets School Realities'', the act was put into action during a time of fiscal crisis for most states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The funding they received from the federal government in support of NCLB was not enough to cover the added expense necessary to adhere to the new law.

==Proposals for reform==
The Joint Organizational Statement on No Child Left Behind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtest.org/joint%20statement%20civil%20rights%20grps%2010-21-04.html|title= Joint Organizational Statement on No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act|date=2004-10-21|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proposal by more than 135 national civil rights, education, disability advocacy, civic, labor, and religious groups that have signed on to a statement calling for major changes to the federal education law. The National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing (FairTest) initiated and chaired the meetings that produced the statement, originally released in October 2004. The statement's central message is that "the law's emphasis needs to shift from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to holding states and localities accountable for making the systemic changes that improve student achievement." The number of organizations signing the statement has nearly quadrupled since it was launched in late 2004 and continues to grow. The goal is to influence Congress, and the broader public, as the law's scheduled reauthorization approaches.

Education critic [[Alfie Kohn]] argues that the NCLB law is "unredeemable" and should be scrapped. He is quoted saying "[I]ts main effect has been to sentence poor children to an endless regimen of test-preparation drills".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/31/1558/ NCLB: 'Too Destructive to Salvage'], ''USA Today'', May 31, 2007. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, former [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services Secretary]] [[Tommy Thompson]] and [[Georgia Governor]] [[Roy Barnes]], Co-Chairs of the Aspen Commission on No Child Left Behind, announced the release of the Commission's final recommendations for the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspeninstitute.org/site/c.huLWJeMRKpH/b.938015/k.40DA/Commission_on_No_Child_Left_Behind.htm Beyond NCLB: Fulfilling the Promise to Our Nation's Children] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608121158/http://www.aspeninstitute.org/site/c.huLWJeMRKpH/b.938015/k.40DA/Commission_on_No_Child_Left_Behind.htm |date=2007-06-08 }}, February, 2007. Retrieved 6/8/07.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission is an independent, bipartisan effort to improve NCLB and ensure it is a more useful force in closing the achievement gap that separates disadvantaged children and their peers.  After a year of hearings, analysis, and research, the Commission uncovered the successes of NCLB, as well as provisions that must be significantly changed.

The Commission's goals are:
* Have effective teachers for all students, effective principals for all communities
* Accelerate progress and achievement gaps closed through improved accountability
* Move beyond status quo to effective school improvement and student options
* Have fair and accurate assessments of student progress
* Have high standards for every student in every state
* Ensure high schools prepare students for college and the workplace
* Drive progress through reliable, accurate data
* Encourage parental involvement and empowerment

The Forum on Educational Accountability (FEA), a working group of signers of the Joint Organizational Statement on NCLB has offered an alternative proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaccountability.org/|title=Forum on Educational Accountability|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes to shift NCLB from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to supporting state and communities and holding them accountable as they make systemic changes that improve student learning.

While many critics and policymakers believe the NCLB legislation has major flaws, it appears the policy will be in effect for the long-term, though not without major modifications.

President Barack Obama released a blueprint for reform of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]], the successor to No Child Left Behind, in March 2010. Specific revisions include providing funds for states to implement a broader range of assessments to evaluate advanced academic skills, including students’ abilities to conduct research, use technology, engage in scientific investigation, solve problems, and communicate effectively.

In addition, Obama proposes that the NCLB legislation lessen its stringent accountability punishments to states by focusing more on student improvement. Improvement measures would encompass assessing all children appropriately, including English language learners, minorities, and special needs students. The school system would be re-designed to consider measures beyond reading and math tests; and would promote incentives to keep students enrolled in school through graduation, rather than encouraging student drop-out to increase AYP scores.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A. [http://www.education.com/magazine/article/Obama_Child_Left_Behind/ "Obama on No Child Left Behind Act"], "Education.com, Inc." (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama’s objectives also entail lowering the achievement gap between Black and White students and also increasing the federal budget by $3 billion to help schools meet the strict mandates of the bill. There has also been a proposal, put forward by the Obama administration, that states increase their academic standards after a [[dumbing down]] period, focus on re-classifying schools that have been labeled as failing, and develop a new evaluation process for teachers and educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html?scp=1&amp;sq=NCLB&amp;st=cse| title=No Child Left Behind Act | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Dillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government’s gradual investment in public social provisions provides the NCLB Act a forum to deliver on its promise to improve achievement for all of its students. Education critics argue that although the legislation is marked as an improvement to the ESEA in de-segregating the quality of education in schools, it is actually harmful. The legislation has become virtually the only federal social policy meant to address wide-scale social inequities, and its policy features inevitably stigmatize both schools attended by children of the poor and children in general.

Moreover, critics further argue that the current political landscape of this country, which favors market-based solutions to social and economic problems, has eroded trust in public institutions and has undermined political support for an expansive concept of social responsibility, which subsequently results in a disinvestment in the education of the poor and privatization of American schools.

Skeptics posit that NCLB provides distinct political advantages to Democrats, whose focus on accountability offers a way for them to speak of equal opportunity and avoid being classified as the party of big government, special interests, and minority groups—a common accusation from Republicans who want to discredit what they see as the traditional Democratic agenda. Opponents posit that NCLB has inadvertently shifted the debate on education and racial inequality to traditional political alliances. Consequently, major political discord remains between those who oppose federal oversight of state and local practices and those who view NCLB in terms of civil rights and educational equality.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, R. and Kantor, H. (2006). From New Deal to No Deal: No Child Left Behind Act and the Devolution of Responsibility for Equal Opportunity. 76:4. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Educational Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the plan, the Obama Administration responds to critiques that standardized testing fails to capture higher level thinking by outlining new systems of evaluation to capture more in depth assessments on student achievement.&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"&gt;U.S. Department of Education [http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/blueprint.pdf "ESEA Blueprint for Reform"], (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; His plan came on the heels of the announcement of the [[Race to the Top]] initiative, a $4.35 billion reform program financed by the Department of Education through the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohman, J. [http://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0235.htm "Comparing No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top."], "OLR Research Report" (4 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama says that accurate assessments "...can be used to accurately measure student growth; to better measure how states, districts, schools, principals, and teachers are educating students; to help teachers adjust and focus their teaching, and to provide better information to students and their families."&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"/&gt; He has pledged to support state governments in their efforts to improve [[standardized test]] provisions by upgrading the standards they are set to measure. To do this, the federal government gives states grants to help develop and implement assessments based on higher standards so they can more accurately measure school progress.&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"/&gt; This mirrors provisions in the Race to the Top program that require states to measure individual achievement through sophisticated data collection from kindergarten to higher education.

While Obama plans to improve the quality of standardized testing, he does not plan to eliminate the testing requirements and accountability measures produced by standardized tests. Rather, he provides additional resources and flexibility to meet new goals.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Chaddock, G. [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0315/Obama-s-No-Child-Left-Behind-revise-a-little-more-flexibility "Obama’s No Child Left Behind Revise: A Little More Flexibility"], "The Christian Science Monitor". (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Obama’s reform efforts maintain that high-stakes testing is detrimental to school success across the country, because it encourages teachers to "teach to the test" and places undue pressure on teachers and schools if they fail to meet benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Ravitch, D. [http://0-www.eric.ed.gov.novacat.nova.edu/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ919558&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ919558 "Dictating to the Schools: A Look at the Effects of the Bush and Obama Administrations on Schools"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810123430/http://0-www.eric.ed.gov.novacat.nova.edu/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ919558&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ919558 |date=2011-08-10 }}, "Virginia Journal of Education". (November 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-authorization process has become somewhat of a controversy, as lawmakers and politicians continually debate about the changes that must be made to the bill to make it work best for the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtest.org/NCLB-lost-decade-report-home |title=NCLB’s Lost Decade Report |publisher=FairTest |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waivers ==
In 2012, President Obama granted waivers from NCLB requirements to several states. "In exchange for that flexibility, those states 'have agreed to raise standards, improve accountability, and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness,' the White House said in a statement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-09/politics/politics_states-education_1_waivers-flexibility-standards?_s=PM:POLITICS | work=CNN | title=Obama to push 'No Child Left Behind' overhaul | date=March 15, 2010 | access-date=February 13, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214144437/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-09/politics/politics_states-education_1_waivers-flexibility-standards?_s=PM:POLITICS | archive-date=February 14, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight of the 32 NCLB waivers granted to states are conditional, meaning those states have not entirely satisfied the administration's requirements and part of their plans are under review.

The waivers of [[Arizona]], [[Oregon]], and [[Kansas]] are conditional, according to Acting Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Michael Yudin. Arizona has not yet received state board approval for teacher evaluations, and Kansas and Oregon are both still developing teacher and principal evaluation guidelines.

In addition, five states that did not complete the waiver process—and one whose application was rejected—got a one-year freeze on the rising targets for standardized test scores: [[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Iowa]], [[Maine]], and [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=07/19/2012 12:01 am Updated: 08/13/2012 11:04 am |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/19/no-child-left-behind-waiver_n_1684504.html |title=No Child Left Behind Waivers Granted To 33 U.S. States, Some With Strings Attached |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-06-24 |date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replacement ==
On April 30, 2015, a bill was introduced to Congress to replace the No Child Left Behind Act, the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], which was passed by the House on December 2 and the Senate on December 9, before being signed into law by President Obama on December 10, 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1177|title=S.1177 114th Congress (2015–2016): Every Student Succeeds Act|last=Lamar|first=Sen Alexander|date=2015-04-30|website=congress.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill affords states more flexibility in regards to setting their own respective standards for measuring school as well as student performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/2/9836014/every-student-succeeds-act|title=Congress is getting rid of No Child Left Behind.

'''Oxbridge''' is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[University of Oxford|Oxford]]" and "[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]", the two oldest, most prestigious, and highly-ranked universities in the [[United Kingdom]]. The term is used to refer to them collectively, in contrast to other British universities, and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of them, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status or [[elitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Oxbridge|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/135559 | website=oed.com|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |quote=Originally: a fictional university, esp. regarded as a composite of Oxford and Cambridge. Subsequently also (now esp.): the universities of Oxford and Cambridge regarded together, esp. in contrast to other British universities. ''adj'' Of, relating to, characteristic of, or reminiscent of Oxbridge (freq. with implication of superior social or intellectual status |edition = 3rd |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Although both universities were founded more than eight centuries ago, the term ''Oxbridge'' is relatively recent. In [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackeray]]'s novel ''[[Pendennis]]'', published in 1850, the main character attends the fictional [[List of fictional Oxbridge colleges|Boniface College, Oxbridge]]. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', this is the first recorded instance of the word. [[Virginia Woolf]] used it, citing Thackeray, in her 1929 essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]''. By 1957 the term was used in the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=G.D. Worswick |title=The anatomy of Oxbridge |work=[[Times Educational Supplement]] |date=3 May 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=G.D. Worswick |title=Men's Awards at Oxbridge |work=[[Times Educational Supplement]] |date=6 June 1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Universities Quarterly'' by 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=British Universities and Intellectual Life |author=A. H. Halsey |page=144 |work=Universities Quarterly |year=1958 |volume=12 |issue=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c3cuAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Halsey+%22BRITISH+UNIVERSITIES+AND+INTELLECTUAL+LIFE%22&amp;q=Oxbridge |accessdate=2009-03-22 |publisher=Turnstile Press. |authorlink=A. H. Halsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When expanded, the universities are almost always referred to as "Oxford and Cambridge", the order in which they were founded. A notable exception is Japan's Cambridge and Oxford Society, probably arising from the fact that the Cambridge Club was founded there first, and also had more members than its Oxford counterpart when they amalgamated in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camford.org/Whycamford.htm|title=Why The "Cambridge &amp; Oxford Society"?|date=5 April 1995|author=Giro Koike |accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being a collective term, ''Oxbridge'' is often used as shorthand for characteristics the two institutions share:

*Each has a similar [[collegiate university|collegiate structure]], whereby the university is a co-operative of its constituent colleges, which are responsible for [[Tutorial system|supervisions/tutorials]] (the principal undergraduate teaching method) and pastoral care.

==Related terms==
Thackeray's ''[[Pendennis]]'' (1850) also introduced the term ''Camford'' as another combination of the university names&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; "he was a Camford man and very nearly got the English Prize Poem"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; although this term has never achieved the same degree of usage as ''Oxbridge''. Camford was also used as the name of a fictional university city in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story ''[[The Adventure of the Creeping Man]]'' (1923).

Other portmanteaus have been coined that extend the term ''Oxbridge'', though none has achieved widespread recognition. ''Doxbridge'' is one example of this, referring to [[Durham University|Durham]], Oxford and Cambridge.&lt;ref name="doxbridge3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Doxbridge: a chip on our collective shoulders?|url=https://www.palatinate.org.uk/doxbridge-a-chip-on-our-collective-shoulders/|work=Palatinate|date=November 6, 2014|accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doxbridge4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Debate: Rather be at Oxbridge than Doxbridge?|url=http://thetab.com/uk/cambridge/2012/01/16/rather-be-at-oxbridge-than-doxbridge-3428|work=The Tab|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thetab.com/uk/durham/2015/10/16/doxbridge-thing-asked-oxbridge-students-20761|title=Is Doxbridge a thing?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">Founded of necessity due to damage caused largely by the [[American Civil War]], the '''Peabody Education Fund''' was established by [[George Peabody]] in 1867 for the purpose of promoting "intellectual, moral, and industrial education in the most destitute portion of the Southern States."  The gift of foundation consisted of securities to the value of $2,100,000, of which $1,100,000 were in [[Mississippi|Mississippi State]] bonds, afterward repudiated.  In 1869 an additional $1,000,000 was given by Mr. Peabody, with $384,000 of [[Florida]] funds, also repudiated later.  The main purpose of the fund was to aid elementary education by strengthening existing schools.  Because it was restricted from founding new schools, it did not benefit [[freedmen]] in [[Southern United States|the South]], as there were no established schools for blacks.

"The fund introduced a new type of benefaction in that it was left without restriction in the hands of the trustees to administer.  Power to close the trust after thirty years was provided on condition that two-thirds of the fund be distributed to educational institutions in the Southern states."&lt;ref&gt;Orr, 1950, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of the Peabody Education Fund were strict, allowing for the distribution of about $80,000 per year over a period of thirty years.  By the time of the termination of the fund in 1898, about $2,500,000 had been distributed.  In 1875, the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund founded the Peabody [[Normal School]] of the South which promptly became the Peabody Normal College (1875-1911).  It was maintained in connection with the [[University of Nashville]] and supported by annual donations from the Peabody Education Fund.  In 1910 the [[Peabody College|Peabody College for Teachers]] was organized.  Placed adjacent to [[Vanderbilt University]], the college opened its doors on June 14, 1914 for summer school.  In September 1915, four new buildings had been completed at a cost of $750,000. About 1915, the Peabody Education Fund ceased to exist.

The [[Southern Education Foundation]], a not-for-profit foundation, was created in 1937 from the Peabody Education Fund and three funds intended to support education for blacks: the [[John F. Slater Fund]], the [[Negro Rural School Fund]], and the [[Virginia Randolph Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kofi Lomotey|title=Encyclopedia of African American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dURVOtUlPKYC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=%22Encyclopedia+of+African-American+Education%22+Virginia+Randolph+Fund&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zBJGm5L46g&amp;sig=w8w5wbWd4_Ju0qrv4-zEUjKsJEo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zsRKUuKkOOSjiAfmxoDoAQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Encyclopedia%20of%20African-American%20Education%22%20Virginia%20Randolph%20Fund&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 2013|volume=v1|year=2010|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=1412940508|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Blundell Jones''' (4 January 1949 – 19 August 2016) was a British [[architect]] and architectural historian. He trained as an architect at the [[Architectural Association School]], and held academic positions at the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[London South Bank University]]. He was a professor of architecture at the [[University of Sheffield]] from 1994 until his death in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheffield School of Architecture|url=https://twitter.com/SSoA_news/status/766970822116384768|website=Twitter|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a prolific author on architectural history and theory. As well as being a regular contributor to the [[Architectural Review]], he wrote or collaborated on monographs of the work of [[Erik Gunnar Asplund]], [[Hans Scharoun]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Hugo Häring]] and [[Günter Behnisch]]. 

Jones died on 19 August 2016 at the age of 67.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.architectural-review.com/archive/peter-blundell-jones-1949-2016-a-truly-important-architectural-historian/10010070.article?blocktitle=PBJ-Obituary&amp;contentID=17179&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his writing, he also left some buildings, such as The Round House at Stoke Canon, Devon, which he designed for his parents, and the refurbished Padley Mill, Grindleford, Derbyshire. These show their pedigree in the more human side of modernism.

Peter, the second of three children, was born near Exeter, where his father, Geoffrey, was an orthopaedic surgeon, and his mother, Avis (nee Dyer), a GP. He attended an Exeter preparatory school and Blundell’s school, Tiverton.

After he left the AA in 1972, he was commissioned to write the book on Scharoun. He then designed and built The Round House and taught for a year at the North London Polytechnic and the University of Bath, whilst also writing for the Architectural Review and Architectural Journal.

Peter was an assistant lecturer at Cambridge University (1979-83) and from 1988 a principal lecturer and then reader at the South London Polytechnic. In 1992 he was named architectural journalist of the year. In 1994 he was appointed professor at the University of Sheffield School of Architecture.

'''Queen Victoria School''' ('''QVS''') is a school in [[Fiji]]. It was established in 1906 in [[Nasinu]] to provide education to the sons of Fijian Chiefs. It later moved to Nanukuloa in Ra when World War II broke out; then the school was moved to Lodoni where the two schools QVS and RKS operated side by side before eventually moving to its current site at Matavatucou, [[Tailevu Province|Tailevu]]. It then accepted students from Fijian villages based on their results in a secondary entrance examination.

The school is run as an academic college, but there is an adjoining farm which provides food to the school and serves as a training ground. Students are taught basic skills like crop and livestock husbandry, and there is a small dairy unit. These sessions usually last for about three hours and take place on Saturday morning. There is a farm manager and some permanent labourers who live on the compound.

The school is equipped with a library, chemistry and biology laboratories, computer lab and playing fields. This school takes part in cadet training and march for the passout parade. In Fiji, it is well known for high discipline.

Queen Victoria School consists of four houses: VERATA (blue), REWA (yellow), BAU (green) and TOVATA (red).

The school has a chapel in a position high on a hill and overlooking the sea and surrounding hills. The services are mainly [[Methodist]], but other denominations are catered for. There is a school choir that performs at the Sunday morning service. 

[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport; ex-students have played in rugby teams in Fiji and abroad. The school has won the [[Deans Trophy]] 22 times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} QVS is well known for partaking in the Secondary Schools Athletics meet, Secondary School Rugby League and the Deans trophy Rugby Cup.

==Philosophy==
Science Buddies mission is to help students to build their literacy in science and technology so they can become productive and engaged citizens in the 21st century.

The site has personalized learning tools, over 15,000 pages of scientist-developed subject matter (including experiments based on the latest academic research), and an online community of science professionals who volunteer to advise students. 

Science Buddies also provides resources to support parents and teachers as they guide students seeking out and performing science projects. They attempt to provide a bridge between scientists, engineers, educators, and students, giving students access to current scientific research and simultaneously giving scientists a way to reach out to young people interested in their fields.

==About Science Buddies==
Noticing how much fun his teenage daughter had participating in science fairs but dismayed to discover a shortage of quality science fair help online, Ken Hess thought science fair "productivity tools" and mentoring would allow many more students to participate in science fairs and develop inspirational relationships with science role models. Over time, such a program would help students improve their science skills and literacy while inspiring them to consider careers in science and engineering. So, in early 2001, Ken Hess started a charity with a mission of developing online tools and support for students doing science fair projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/tip/2003/oct03/buddies.htm Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center Interaction Point newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with high tech companies, government labs and agencies (like [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] and [[NASA]]), universities, and other science education resources, Science Buddies offers scientist-authored tools, tips, and techniques.

{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
The first '''Shelter Island Conference''' on the [[:Category:Foundational quantum physics|Foundations of Quantum Mechanics]] was held from June 2–4, 1947 at the Ram's Head Inn in [[Shelter Island (town), New York|Shelter Island, New York]]. Shelter Island was the first major opportunity since [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and the [[Manhattan Project]] for the leaders of the American physics community to gather after the war. As [[Julian Schwinger]] would later recall, "It was the first time that people who had all this physics pent up in them for five years could talk to each other without somebody peering over their shoulders and saying, 'Is this cleared?'"

The conference, which cost $850, was followed by the [[Pocono Conference]] of 1948 and the [[Oldstone Conference]] of 1949. They were arranged with the assistance of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS). Later Oppenheimer deemed Shelter Island the most successful scientific meeting he had ever attended; and as [[Richard Feynman]] recalled to [[Jagdish Mehra]] in April 1970: "There have been many conferences in the world since, but I've never felt any to be as important as this.... The Shelter Island Conference was my first conference with the big men.... I had never gone to one like this in peacetime."&lt;ref name=Metra/&gt;

==Organization==
The conference was conceived by Duncan MacInnes, a scientist studying [[electrochemistry]] at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]]. Once the president of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]], MacInnes had already organized a number of small scientific conferences. However, he believed that the later conferences had suffered from a bloated attendance, and over this issue, he resigned from the Academy in January 1945. That fall, he approached the NAS with the idea of a series of 2–3 day conferences limited to 20–25 people. [[Frank Jewett]], the head of the NAS, liked the idea; he envisioned a "meeting at some quiet place where the men could live together intimately", possibly "at an inn somewhere", and suggested that MacInnes focus on a couple of pilot programs. MacInnes' first choice was "The Nature of [[Biopotential]]s", a subject close to his own heart; the second would be "The Postulates of Quantum Mechanics", which later became "Foundations of Quantum Mechanics".

[[Karl K. Darrow]], a theoretical physicist at [[Bell Labs]] and secretary of the [[American Physical Society]], offered his help in organizing the quantum mechanics conference. The two decided to try to emulate the success of the early [[Solvay Conference]]s, and they consulted with [[Léon Brillouin]], who had some experience in that area. In turn, Brillouin suggested consulting [[Wolfgang Pauli]], the recent Nobel medalist at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]].

In January 1946, MacInnes, Darrow, Brillouin, and Pauli met in New York and exchanged letters. Pauli was enthusiastic about the topic, but he was primarily interested in bringing together the international physics community after the ordeal of the war. He suggested a large conference, including many older, foreign physicists, much to MacInnes' chagrin. With Jewett's encouragement, MacInnes asked Pauli for suggestions of "younger men" such as [[John Archibald Wheeler]], explaining that the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] would support only a small conference. Pauli and Wheeler replied that MacInnes' conference might be merged with [[Niels Bohr]]'s conference on Wave Mechanics in [[Denmark]] in 1947; they pointed out that the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] had close ties with the Rockefeller Foundation anyway. Darrow wrote to Wheeler that Bohr's conference was a poor replacement because it would draw few Americans. Finally, Shelter Island was explicitly an American conference. Darrow was chairman of the conference.

==Proceedings==

===Lamb shift===
[[Willis Lamb]] had found when probing hydrogen atoms with microwave beams that one of the two possible quantum states had slightly more energy than predicted by the [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] theory; this became known as the [[Lamb shift]]. Lamb had discovered the shift a few weeks before (with [[Robert Retherford]]), so this was a major talking point at the conference. As it was known that the Dirac theory was incomplete, the small difference was an indication that [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) was progressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gribbin |first= John &amp; Mary |title=Richard Feynman: A Life in Science |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear= |year= 1997 |publisher=Viking Press |location= England |isbn= 0-670-87245-8 |oclc=  |page=105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electron magnetic moment===
Another dramatic discovery was reported at the conference by [[Isidor Rabi]]; a precise measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron, though this was overshadowed by Lamb’s work.

===Mesons===
Marshak presented his two-meson hypothesis about the [[pi-meson]], which were discovered shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Metra&gt;{{cite book |last=Metra |first= Jagdish |title=The Beat of a Different Drum: The life and science of Richard Feynman |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear= |year= 1994 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location= Oxford, England |isbn= 0-19-853948-7 |oclc=  |pages=245–249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===QED===
Richard Feynman gave an informal presentation about his work on [[quantum electrodynamics]]. He gave a more formal, and less successful, presentation on QED at the [[Pocono Conference]] next year.

}}'''Socratic''', or '''Socratic.org''', is an education tech company that offers a mobile app for students. The app uses AI technology to help students with their homework by providing educational resources like videos, definitions, Q&amp;A, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.socratic.org/introducing-the-socratic-app-38210d670028#.mlso9elv4|title=Making learning way easier — Introducing the Socratic app|last=Bhansali|first=Shreyans|date=2016-07-14|newspaper=Building Socratic|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socratic's stated mission is to Make Learning Easier.

Socratic was first launched as a web product in 2013 by Chris Pedregal and Shreyans Bhansali, in [[New York City]], United States. They launched their app under the same name in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/socratic|title=Socratic {{!}} crunchbase|website=www.crunchbase.com|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The Socratic app utilizes AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology to accurately predict which concepts will help a student solve their question. Over months, millions of real student questions were analyzed and classified. Then the app uses that data to guess on future questions and provide specific education content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailynexus.com/2016-08-05/socratic-application-allows-students-to-post-homework-questions-get-answers/|title=Socratic Application Allows Students To Post Homework Questions, Get Answers|newspaper=The Daily Nexus|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emergingedtech.com/2016/08/socratic-digital-tutor-ai-app-guided-by-student-testing/|title=Socratic Used Extensive User Testing to Build Powerful Free "Digital Tutor" App — Emerging Education Technologies|website=www.emergingedtech.com|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app works by letting students take a photo of a homework question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-07-23-how-to-make-learning-easier-than-cheating|title=How to Make Learning Easier than Cheating (EdSurge News)|newspaper=EdSurge|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), the app is able to read their photo and classify it using the technology described above. Students receive various “cards” in the app with different learning resources such as definitions, YouTube videos, Q&amp;A, and original content and illustrations written by the Socratic.org web community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.socratic.org/introducing-the-socratic-app-38210d670028#.tjhjskt8w|title=Making learning way easier — Introducing the Socratic app|last=Bhansali|first=Shreyans|date=2016-07-14|newspaper=Building Socratic|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Socratic added additional math features to the app, including step-by-step equation help and graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswire.com/news/homework-help-app-socratic-launches-math-features-18569485|title=Homework Help App, Socratic, Launches Math Features|website=www.newswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''target drone''' is an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], generally [[Teleoperation|remote controlled]], usually used in the training of [[anti-aircraft]] crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avonds.com/Target%20Drones.htm |title=Avonds Scale Jets - Target Drones |publisher=Avonds.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest drones was the British [[De Havilland Tiger Moth#Training|DH.82 Queen Bee]], a variant of the Tiger Moth trainer aircraft operational from 1935. Its name led to the present term "drone".{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In their simplest form, target drones often resemble radio-controlled model aircraft. More modern drones may use [[countermeasures]], [[radar]], and similar systems to mimic manned aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_02.html |title=Target Drones |publisher=Vector Site |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More advanced drones are made from large, older missiles which have had their warheads removed.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In the United Kingdom, obsolete [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]] jet and propeller-powered aircraft (such as the [[Fairey Firefly]], [[Gloster Meteor]] and de Havilland [[Sea Vixen]] used at [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] [[Llanbedr Airport|Llanbedr]] between the 1950s and 1990s) have also been modified into remote controlled drones, but such modifications are costly.  With a much larger budget, the U.S. military has been more likely to convert retired aircraft or older versions of still serving aircraft (e.g., [[F-4 Phantom II|QF-4 Phantom II]] and [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|QF-16 Fighting Falcon]]) into remotely piloted targets for [[USAF]], [[USN]] and [[USMC]] use as Full Scale Aerial Targets or FSATs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fencecheck.com/content/index.php?title=The_Final_Mission:_The_USAF%92s_QF-4_Target_Drones]{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article29.html|title=F-16 Versions - QF-16|website=www.f-16.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tazti''' is a [[speech recognition]] software package developed and sold by Voice Tech Group, Inc. for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[personal computer]]s. The most recent package is version 3.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=voicetechgroup.com |url=http://www.tazti.com/ |title=Voice Recognition Software &amp;#124; Speech Recognition Software |publisher=Tazti |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 8.1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=voicetechgroup.com |url=http://www.tazti.com/downloads.php |title=Downloads &amp;#124; Tazti &amp;#124; Voice Recognition Software &amp;#124; Speech Recognition Software |publisher=tazti |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 64-bit editions. Earlier versions of Tazti supported [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows XP]]. PC video game play by voice, controlling PC applications and programs by voice and creating speech commands to trigger a browser to open web pages, or trigger the Windows operating system to open files, folders or programs are Tazti's primary features. Earlier versions of Tazti included a lite Dictation feature that is eliminated from the latest version. 

==Features==
Tazti Speech Recognition software has four primary areas of functionality: 
# Play PC games by voice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Events |url=http://thegamefanatics.com/2010/09/04/tazti-brings-voice-recognition-to-pc-games |title=Tazti Brings Voice Recognition to PC Games |publisher=The Game Fanatics |date=2010-09-04 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Control PC based applications and programs by voice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Events |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2055599/control-your-pc-with-these-5-speech-recognition-programs.html |title=Control your PC with these 5 speech recognition programs |publisher=PC World |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Open files, folders and webpages by creating custom speech commands and associating them to file, folder or web URL.
# Run programs that include command line parameters which may include batch flies to mash up Tazti to robots, robotics, web apps, or desktop or other programs not a part of Tazti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sviNw4GUk6E |title=Lego Mindstorm NXT 2 Robot controlled by Tazti speech recognition |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqyH7eiMJIA |title=Lost in Space robot, voice recognition |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robocommunity.com/forum/thread/16820/Possible-voice-recognition-software-for-RS-Media/ |title=Possible voice recognition software for RS Media |publisher=RoboCommunity |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tazti utilizes a minimal user interface. As an example, user spoken speech commands appear in a balloon on the user interface dashboard as they are spoken allowing the user to confirm by sight the speech recognition quality.

==History==
Voice Tech Group, Inc. was founded in 2005 as an Ohio corporation primarily concerned with the research of semantic search and voice search. Voice Tech Group, Inc. released Tazti Speech Recognition 1.0 as their first multi-feature speech recognition product in 2005. Early features include mashing up bookmarks and favorites to speech commands, website navigation by voice including of social media sites such as Facebook and Myspace, and voice control of iTunes. Voice Tech Group, Inc partnered with SR Tech Group LLC to develop speech and voice recognition technologies in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Events |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/23/idUS254006819120130723 |title=Google scoops up speech recognition patents (updated) |publisher=Reuters |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 2.0.2 released in September 2010 added dictation, keyboard shortcuts that also allow custom setups for PC game play, an advanced speech API, and the ability to turn off/on groupings of speech commands. 

Version 2.4 released in November 2011 improved dictation and fixed bugs.

Version 3.0 released in July 2013 eliminated some features including dictation and added features to game play by voice and control of application and programs by voice.

'''UNESCO-CEPES''' (Centre Européen pour l’Enseignement Supérieur – CEPES) was established in 1972 at [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], as a de-centralized office for the '''European Centre for Higher Education'''. The Centre was closed in 2011 due to lack of funding. The centre promoted international cooperation in the sphere of higher education among [[UNESCO]]’s Member States in Central, Eastern and South-East Europe and also served Canada, the United States and Israel. ''Higher Education in Europe'', a scholarly publication focusing on major problems and trends in higher education, was the official journal of UNESCO-CEPES. 
The CEPES headquarters was in the [[Kretzulescu Palace]] in Bucharest.

==History==
On 21 September 1972, as the only intergovernmental Centre for Higher Education in Europe region, North America and Israel, UNESCO European Centre for Higher Education (Centre Européen pour l’Enseignement Supérieur – CEPES) was established in Bucharest.
The early mission of the CEPES was to encourage cooperation, to disseminate information, and to research modern trends in higher education within the Europe Region. In the early 1990s, with the fall of the communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe, the role of UNESCO-CEPES extended its round has been broader.
 
on this endeavour, the UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs Programme constituted "a major breakthrough with regard to the reinforcement of inter-university co-operation at the sub-regional, regional and interregional levels as a means to improve the quality in higher education as well as to strengthen national capabilities for higher level training and research in the developing countries."

In April 1997, the joint Council of Europe/UNESCO Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications Concerning Higher Education in the European Region was adopted, and UNESCO-CEPES assumed a Co-Secretariat function to the Convention.
From the late 1990s, the Centre gradually more co-worked on European Union projects aimed at the reform of higher education in Eastern and Central Europe and reinforced its cooperation with international organisations such as World Bank, OECD, and others.

In September 2003, UNESCO-CEPES was nominated a consultative member of the Follow-up Group of the Bologna Process (BFUG), charged with the accomplishment of Bologna Process goals, and the actualisation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA).

On 25 September 2009, according as a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between UNESCO and the Romanian Government on transitional arrangements for UNESCO-CEPES, The MoU realigns the Centre’s mandate with the new education landscape in Europe and provides that during the 2010-2011 period. CEPES will focus on addressing the needs of higher education of UNESCO’s Member States in Central, Eastern and South-East Europe.

On 31 December 2011, the Centre was closed as funding was not ensured by the Government of Romania or other countries in the region, which is a requirement for all UNESCO Regional Centres.

==Mission==
The UNESCO European Centre for Higher Education/Centre européen pour l'enseignement supérieur (CEPES) promotes co-operation and provides technical support in the field of higher education among UNESCO’s Member States in Central, Eastern and South-East Europe.

Specifically UNESCO-CEPES:

The '''University of Zimbabwe (UZ)''' in [[Harare]], is the oldest and top ranked [[Universities of Zimbabwe|university]] in [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=aboutuz/&gt; It was founded through a special relationship with the [[University of London]] and it opened its doors to its first students in 1952. The university has nine faculties and 1 College ( Faculties of Agriculture, Arts, Commerce, Education, Engineering, Law, Science, Social Studies, Veterinary Sciences and the College of Health Sciences) offering a wide variety of degree programmes and many specialist research centres and institutes. The university is accredited through the [[National Council for Higher Education, Zimbabwe|National Council for Higher Education]], under the [[Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Zimbabwe|Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education]]. English is the language of instruction. Although once a very successful university, UZ has been facing challenges since 2008 and now the University is on a rebounding drive. Major work is being done to uplift the status of the University. Refurbishments are being carried out on the Main campus and many facilities are being upgraded to make the university an International Academic Brand. The university has faced criticism for awarding fraudulent degrees to members of the [[Mugabe]] regime particularly the obscure PhD given to [[Grace Mugabe]].&lt;ref name="fr1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fr2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fr3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fr4" /&gt;

== History ==
===Early years===
[[File:Uzcouncilroom.jpg|thumb|Council room of the University of Zimbabwe. Portraits of former Vice-Chancellors from left to right: [[Robert Craig (theologian)|Robert Craig]], [[Leonard John Lewis|Leonard Lewis]], [[Walter Kamba]] and [[Gordon Chavunduka]].]]

In 1945, Manfred Hodson (after whom a [[University of Zimbabwe#Residences|residence]] is now named) formed the ''Rhodesia University Association'', inspired by the promise of £20,000 by Robert Jeffrey Freeman for establishing such a university.
&lt;ref name=historicalnote/&gt; The following year, the Legislative Assembly of [[Southern Rhodesia]] adopted a motion proposed by Hodson for the establishment of a university college to serve the needs of [[Rhodesia]] and neighbouring territories. The [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia]] established the Rhodesia University Foundation Fund in 1947. The Legislative Assembly accepted an offer of land in [[Mount Pleasant, Harare|Mount Pleasant]] from the City of Salisbury (now [[Harare]]) for the construction of the campus in 1948. Four years later a bill was enacted for the incorporation and constitution of the university. First classes began for some 68 students on a temporary site at 147 Baker Avenue (now Nelson Mandela Avenue).&lt;ref name=aboutuz&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Zimbabwe|first=|authorlink=University of Zimbabwe|title=About UZ|url=http://www.uz.ac.zw/information/uz.html|accessdate=2 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212230253/http://www.uz.ac.zw/information/uz.html|archivedate=12 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent of the initiatives of Hodson and the Legislative Assembly, the Central African Council's commission on higher education, led by [[Alexander Carr-Saunders|Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders]] (after whom another [[University of Zimbabwe#Residences|residence]] is now named) recommended the establishment of a university college to serve Rhodesia and Nyasaland, with its first preference being to integrate with the Southern Rhodesian initiative.&lt;ref name=historicalnote/&gt;

===Establishment===
Construction began on the Mount Pleasant site, funded by grants from the [[British government|British]] and [[Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] Governments, [[Anglo American Corporation]], the [[British South Africa Company]], the Rhodesia Selection Trust, the [[Alfred Beit#The Beit Trust|Beit Trust]], the [[Ford Foundation]] and the Dulverton Trust and in July 1953 [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth, the Queen Mother]] laid the foundation stone. In 1955 the British government formally adopted the institution, establishing the '''University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (UCRN)''' by [[Royal Charter]]. The college was admitted to the privilege of Special Relation with the [[University of London]] the following year and in 1957 all activities were transferred to the Mount Pleasant campus. The following year the college was granted pieces of land upon which the [[University of Zimbabwe Farm|college farm]] and the [[University of Zimbabwe Lake Kariba Research Station|Lake Kariba Research Station]] were constructed.&lt;ref name=historicalnote/&gt; In 1963 the [[University of Zimbabwe#Colleges|Medical School]] opened and was affiliated to the [[University of Birmingham]]. After the dissolution of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], the University College continued as an independent institution of higher education and research, open to all races.&lt;ref name=aboutuz/&gt; In 1970 a phased termination of the associations with the Universities of London and Birmingham began.

===Post independence===
Following [[Zimbabwe]]'s independence after the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], the university was renamed University of Zimbabwe in 1980. In 1981, the first black Principal, [[Walter Kamba]], was appointed&lt;ref name=feminist&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaidzanwa|first=R.B.|authorlink=Rudo Gaidzanwa|title=Alienation, Gender and Institutional Culture at the University of Zimbabwe|journal=Feminist Africa|volume=8|pages=60&amp;ndash;82|publisher=African Gender Institute|location=Cape Town|year=2007|url=http://www.feministafrica.org/uploads/File/Issue_8/07_issue8_article4.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|pdf]]|issn=1726-4596|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Zimbabwe finals postponed|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 September 1981|url=http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&amp;&amp;AppName=2&amp;enter=true&amp;BaseHref=DCG/1981/09/10&amp;EntityId=Ar01902|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1982 the Royal Charter was replaced by an Act of Parliament.&lt;ref name=uzact/&gt; Student numbers rose from 1,000 in 1980 to 2,000 by 1985.&lt;ref name=slow&gt;{{cite news|title=Harare makes slow progress|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=22 September 1995|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=95236&amp;sectioncode=26|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Zimbabwe Act]] was controversially amended in 1990, giving the government more powers and, according to many faculty, students and observers, attacking [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|first=|authorlink=Human Rights Watch|title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1990|publisher=|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1990/WR90/AFRICA.BOU-12.htm|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe students riot for third day|publisher=St Louis Post-Despatch|date=30 October 1990|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB04CE7293B6B45&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over fraudulent degrees===

The university has faced criticism for awarding fraudulent degrees to members of the [[Mugabe]] regime; in 2014, [[Grace Mugabe]] was given a doctorate in sociology, only two months after being registered on the programme, and although a dissertion does not exist in the university archives. Also other senior members of the Mugabe regime were given doctorates, without writing dissertations.&lt;ref name="fr1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201409191481.html|title=Zimbabwe: Grace Mugabe's PhD Scandal Torches Storm|first=Elias|last=Mambo|date=19 September 2014|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fr2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/article/2000135151/zimbabwe-s-first-lady-grace-mugabe-awarded-phd-two-months-after-enrollment|title=Zimbabwe's First Lady Grace Mugabe, awarded PhD, two months after enrollment|first=May|last=Jesaro|website=Standard Digital News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fr3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/zimbabwe-grace-mugabe-awarded-phd-two-months-university-where-president-mugabe-chancellor-1465523|title=Zimbabwe: Grace Mugabe Awarded PhD in Two Months from University where President Mugabe is Chancellor|first=Ludovica|last=Iaccino|date=15 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fr4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theindependent.co.zw/2014/10/24/grace-phd-fraud-interview-sheds-light/|title=Grace PhD fraud: Interview sheds light|date=24 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29451239|title=Call for Zimbabwe's Grace Mugabe to return PhD|date=1 October 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsday.co.zw/2014/09/13/now-dr-grace-dr-mujuru/|title=It’s now Dr Grace and Dr Mujuru!|date=13 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November 2017, the university of Zimbabwe students boycotted writing exams citing that the former first lady Dr Grace Mugabe's controversial PhD should be revoked. They also protested and declared that they would not write examinations until Robert Mugabe resigned. Inevitably, the 93 year old leader and then chancellor of the University resigned the following afternoon on 21 November 2017 as head of state and government. Many claimed that the University of Zimbabwe's students will go down in history as those who gave the Mugabe regime the 'final push'  of his 37 year reigned as Zimbabwe's leader{{Citation needed|reason=Where is the source on this?|date=December 2017}}.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate===
[[File:uz geology fieldschool2002.jpg|thumb|left|Undergraduate [[geology]] [[field work|field school]] in [[Mazowe District]], Bachelor of [[Science]] programme, University of Zimbabwe.]]

The basic format of undergraduate learning at UZ is [[lecture]]s, by [[professor]]s or [[lecturer]]s and [[tutorial]]s by [[lecturer]]s of [[teaching assistant]]s. Many programmes also have [[laboratory]]-based practical work and [[field work|field school]]s. Tests and assignments on course content are graded for a theory [[coursework]] grade. Practical work, where applicable, is graded for a practical coursework grade. Theory, and in some cases practical, [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s are administered.

The degree programmes follow the [[Course (education)|Course Unit]] model, and in many programmes it is possible for students to select some of the courses from a range of options. Honours degrees have a compulsory project course that the students must complete individually, with different projects carried out by each student.&lt;ref name="regs"&gt;University of Zimbabwe Academic Registry. (2005) ''General Academic Regulations for Undergraduate Degrees of the University of Zimbabwe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The undergraduate programmes offered lead to [[Bachelor degree|Bachelor]], [[Bachelor degree#Honours Degrees and academic distinctions|Bachelor (Honours)]] and Intercalated bachelor's degrees. Registered bachelor's degree programmes are in arts, business studies and computer science, tourism and hospitality management, education, adult education, science education, nursing science, science, social work, dental surgery, medicine and surgery and veterinary science. Registered undergraduate Bachelor (Honours) programmes are in agriculture, agricultural engineering, applied environmental science, arts, accountancy, business studies, law, engineering, mining engineering, surveying, medical laboratory sciences, nursing science, pharmacy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, science, economics, politics and administration, psychology, rural and urban planning, and sociology. Registered intercalated programmes are in anatomy, human physiology, veterinary anatomy, veterinary physiology and veterinary biochemistry.&lt;ref name="ugprospectus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uz.ac.zw|title=Undergraduate Prospectus of the University of Zimbabwe|last=University of Zimbabwe|first=|authorlink=University of Zimbabwe|year=2006|accessdate=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postgraduate===
[[File:2004 uz iwrm.jpg|thumb|Postgraduate [[water resources]] students in the Faculty of Engineering, University of Zimbabwe, with their [[professor]]s and [[lecturer]]s.]]

The University of Zimbabwe offers postgraduate honours degrees, two types of master's degree and doctoral degrees. Postgraduate honours programmes, also known as ''special honours'' programmes last are for one-year duration and incorporate coursework, examinations and a compulsory project module. Master's degrees by coursework and project are designated M.A. or M.Sc. and are of one to two years duration. They incorporate coursework and project modules. Master's degrees by research thesis only are designated M.Phil. and require a minimum of two years study. The doctoral programme, D.Phil., is by research thesis only. Students who are carrying out an M.Phil. study, but have not yet submitted their thesis, may apply to their faculty to upgrade their study to the D.Phil. programme.&lt;ref name="pgprospectus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uz.ac.zw|title=Postgraduate Prospectus of the University of Zimbabwe|last=University of Zimbabwe|first=|authorlink=University of Zimbabwe|year=2006|accessdate=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension of programmes===
Due to the heavy staff vacancies that UZ began suffering from in the 2000s, many programmes and specialisations have been suspended.&lt;ref name="hararetrib" /&gt;

=== Rankings ===
Although UZ has not generally featured in major international rankings such as the [[THES - QS World University Rankings|Times Higher Education Supplement QS World University Rankings]] or the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], the World Universities Ranking placed the university number 14 in Africa in 2007, after various South African universities, the [[American University in Cairo]] and the [[University of Dar-es-Salaam]], and number 3,549 out of 9,760 accredited universities in the world.&lt;ref name="ghana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/137640/1/ghanaian-universities-fail-in-world-ranking.html|title=Ghanaian universities fail in world ranking|date=13 June 2007|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=Ghana News}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, UZ had slid to number 17 in Africa and number 4,001 globally.&lt;ref name="rank2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webometrics.info/top100_continent.asp?cont=africa|title=World universities ranking: top Africa|last=|publisher=Ranking web of world universities|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004092257/http://www.webometrics.info/top100_continent.asp?cont=africa|archivedate=4 October 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=7 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, according to [[University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urapcenter.org/2010|title=URAP - University Ranking by Academic Performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Zimbabwe is the best university in Zimbabwe and 1340th university in the world.

==Campuses==
[[File:Uzgreen.jpg|thumb|left|Social gathering on the edge of the College Green, University of Zimbabwe]]

The main campus of the University of Zimbabwe is located in the [[Mount Pleasant, Harare|Mount Pleasant]] suburb in northern [[Harare]]. It forms the main portion of the block of land reserved for educational purposes between Mount Pleasant Drive, Upper East Road, Churchill Avenue and Teviotdale Road. Other facilities within this area include the [[Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council]], the [[Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture (Zimbabwe)|Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture]] Audio-Visual Centre and [[Mount Pleasant School, Harare|Mount Pleasant School]].&lt;ref name=hararemap&gt;{{cite map|publisher=Surveyor General, Zimbabwe|title=Street Map of Harare|cartography=|edition=2002|section=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the academic buildings, the main campus is host to sporting facilities, all but two student residences and much of the staff housing. The College Green, located centrally to the academic buildings, is a popular site for social events. About one third of the campus is a seasonal [[wetland]], unsuitable for construction and thus unused.&lt;ref name=uzmap&gt;{{cite map|publisher=University of Zimbabwe Department of Physical Planning|title=Map of the University of Zimbabwe|cartography=|edition=2000|section=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major satellite campus is the Medical School campus at [[Parirenyatwa Hospital]] in central Harare.&lt;ref name=hararemap/&gt; It houses the College of Health Sciences. Additional university properties within Harare include blocks of [[apartments|flats]] for staff and student housing in [[Avondale, Harare|Avondale]], [[Avenues, Harare|the Avenues]] and Mount Pleasant.

The university also owns a [[University of Zimbabwe Farm|farm]] in Teviotdale, [[Mazowe District]], north of Harare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|publisher=Surveyor General, Zimbabwe|title=1:250,0000 Series: Harare|cartography=|edition=1998|section=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Zimbabwe Lake Kariba Research Station]] in the Nyamhunga suburb of [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|publisher=Surveyor General, Zimbabwe|title=1:250,0000 Series: Kariba|cartography=|edition=1998|section=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Zimbabwe's universities started as colleges and satellite campuses of UZ, including [[Bindura University of Science Education]] and [[Chinhoyi University of Technology]].

== Administration and organisation ==

===Central governance===
{{See also|List of principals of the University of Zimbabwe}}
