Cambodia's health authorities remain alert but confident that the country is prepared for a swine flu pandemic. In terms of ensuring that infected pigs do not spread the disease to Cambodia, the Cambodian Pig Raiser Association said it has told the government it should ban live pig imports. But Khlauk Chuon, the deputy director of Camcontrol at the Ministry of Commerce, said they would only ban live pig imports from a country that has been hit with swine flu.&lt;br /&gt; "We are very worried about this new disease because it can transfer from pig to human, from human to human and from human to pig," Khlauk Chuon added. 6 cases has been confirmed in Cambodia, including one domestic case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009042925585/National-news/Regional-flu-cases-cause-concern.html|title=Regional flu cases cause concern |publisher= phnompenhpost.com |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_396137.html |title=1st domestic case in Cambodia |publisher=Straits Times |date= |accessdate=27 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628220200/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_396137.html |archivedate=28 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all carriers, [[China Eastern Airlines]] was the first choice as it is based in Shanghai, where the original and the only Sino-Mexican flight disembarks, but later the job has fallen onto the [[Guangzhou]] based [[China Southern Airlines]], as China Eastern's aircraft don't fit the facility at [[General Abelardo L. Rodríguez International Airport|Tijuana Airport]]. The replacing China Southern flight would leave [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport|Guangzhou]] at 21:00 on 3 May as a normal flight until it reaches the stop-over at Los Angeles, and then fly empty toward Mexico City to pick up the 120 stranded tourists. The charter flight estimates to be back in Shanghai 11:00 in the morning on 5 May, and all passengers on board will then go through health to see if further action is needed. 1,089 cases were confirmed in China by early May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-05/02/content_11300720.htm|title=China Southern charter picking up 120 Chinese visitors in Mexico on May 5|publisher=XinHua|date=|accessdate=2 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090505132113/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2009-05/02/content_11300720.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}  {{Link language|zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's Ministry of Health has gathered experts to draft the Influenza A(H1N1) vaccine and immunity strategy which would include, 'when, how and against whom' the vaccine should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=421736|title=China To Draft Flu Vaccine And Immunity Strategy|publisher=Bernama|date=29 June 2009|accessdate=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ministry's Contingency Office deputy director, Liang Wannian, said the optimum objective of the flu vaccine was for the protection of high-risk population, especially people with basic illness and pregnant women. The first batch of China's A (H1N1) flu vaccine is expected to be ready by July, and would undergo a two-month clinical test before it is available in the market. China's flu vaccine strategy is to stockpile enough vaccine for one per cent of her population by 1 October, as a preventive measure to encounter any vast outbreak of the flu. Liang said China would take more severe and effective preventive measures at its many gateways and educate the people on the H1N1, also known as swine flu.

In early September 2009, China's [[State Food and Drug Administration]] granted approval to a homegrown [[swine influenza|swine flu]] vaccine, which producer [[Sinovac Biotech]] claims is effective after only one dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/03/content_11990303.htm |publisher=Xinhua |title=China's Sinovac gets world's first production license for A/H1N1 flu vaccine |accessdate=8 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jgeZrXkH?url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/03/content_11990303.htm |archivedate=10 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/china-approves-homegrown-swine-flu-vaccine-20090903-f9cr.html (''The Sydney Morning Herald'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

About 18 people on U.S. military bases in [[Kuwait]] have tested positive for swine flu, a [[U.S. Central Command]] spokeswoman said on 24 May 2009. They are the first cases reported in Kuwait. It remains unclear whether the virus has spread to the civilian population. The names and units of the infected people were not immediately available.  Maj. Kristi Beckman, speaking from Central Command headquarters in [[Tampa]], said everyone who tested positive for the virus was quarantined in military health facilities approved by officials from the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health.

The [[Politics of Laos|Lao government]] agreed to buy 10 thermal imaging machines and install them at the country's major immigration border checkpoints. The machines would help officials identify anyone entering the country with a high temperature and create confidence among Lao people, foreigners living in [[Laos]] and people traveling to Laos. Health officials would be on hand at international border checkpoints to ensure anyone found to be infected could be treated immediately. Each machine could cost about US$25,000. The decision to buy them was made after the government found visitors to Laos included people coming from the United States, Spain and other affected countries.

The Prime Minister [[Bouasone Bouphavanh]] said masks should be made available and health officials would be assigned to work at border checkpoints. The machines would help officials identify anyone entering the country with a high temperature and create confidence among Lao people, foreigners living in Laos and people travelling to Laos. Health officials would be on hand at international border checkpoints to ensure anyone found to be infected could be treated immediately. On 18 June, the first case in Laos was confirmed.

"One Lebanese man who was in Spain and two Canadians who arrived in Lebanon a week ago are suffering from swine flu," Khalifeh told AFP. "We put them in quarantine and the blood samples we have taken every day have proven to be positive. "The Lebanese man and the two visiting Canadians were given the proper medical treatment in time and they are well now."
He told a press conference said the man was part of a group of 22 Lebanese who had been attending a training seminar in Spain at an institute where the disease was later detected. He said health authorities may use thermal scanners at the airport to detect passengers with fever. "The situation is under control," he said.

The Lebanese Health Minister Mohammad Jawad Khalifeh asked citizens to stop the social habit of greeting with kissing, as it is a Lebanese habit to greet each other with three kisses on the cheek. He also requested that affected schoolchildren be kept at home and that travel to countries in which cases have been confirmed be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUKTRE53R3D320090428 |title=Lebanese told not to kiss in anti-swine flu drive &amp;#124; Lifestyle &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2009 |first=Nadim |last=Ladki| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090501145551/http://uk.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUKTRE53R3D320090428| archivedate= 1 May 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beirut also banned the import of pork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodbizdaily.com/articles/28988-swine-flu-fear-prompts-lebanon-to-ban-pork-imports.aspx |title=News: Swine flu Fear Prompts Lebanon to Ban Pork Imports |publisher=Foodbizdaily.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=30 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503110754/http://foodbizdaily.com/articles/28988-swine-flu-fear-prompts-lebanon-to-ban-pork-imports.aspx| archivedate= 3 May 2009 | deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongolian authorities quarantined 103 plane passengers on last 7 May who may have been exposed to swine flu.

The passengers were aboard a flight in which two passengers who had performed in a Mongolian band in Mexico developed a fever. When the plane stopped for a scheduled landing in Moscow, the ill passengers were hospitalized.

Landing later in [[Ulaanbaatar]], the Mongolian Health Ministry announced it had quarantined all passengers as well as the crew of six. The people will remain under medical surveillance for seven days, according to officials of the General Authority for Emergency Management.

The Mongolian Health Ministry has sought to prevent the spread of swine flu in Mongolia by urging people to avoid public places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongolia-web.com/health/2384-mongolia-quarantines-air-passengers-following-swine-flu-alert- Mongolia quarantines air passengers following swine flu alert | Mongolia Web News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most defectors with backgrounds in health care agree that, considering the isolation of North Korean society and its highly inadequate health care system, incidents of swine flu are likely to be either suppressed or merely misdiagnosed.

Following the confirmation of the first case of the disease in Mongolia, heightened concerns arose. the very high cases in China would make the spread of the disease to North Korea only a matter of time. If swine flu would come to North Korea, there is a possibility of rapid spreading of the disease through the jangmadang (market), which has become the primary means of survival for the people.

The plans of the WHO to distribute swine flu vaccines, contributed by developed countries,  to a selected 100 developing countries in November; North Korea is included in the priority list.&lt;ref&gt;Yeol, Kim So (29 October 2009).

The first case was confirmed in a South Korean worker in Gaeseong Industrial Complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2009/11/north-koreas-first-h1n1-case-is-a-south-korean.html?no_prefetch=1 H5N1: North Korea's first H1N1 case is a South Korean&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December, the Ministry of Public Health called on a meeting to discuss how to prevent H1N1 influenza from spreading. Importing of vaccines and isolation of people in their respective homes were considered. The Ministry of Education has also decided to call on all schools nationwide to have a winter break a month earlier in an approach to stop the spread of the disease due to the fact that the majority of fatalities caused by the disease are people younger than 23 years of age.&lt;ref name="goodfriendsusa.blogspot.com"&gt;[http://goodfriendsusa.blogspot.com/2009/12/north-korea-today-no-311no311-1-hot.html North Korea Today No. 311/No.311-1 Hot Topics December 2009].

The '''2011 Taiwan food scandal''' was a [[food safety]] scandal in [[Taiwan]] over the use of the [[plasticizer]] [[DEHP]] to replace [[palm oil]] in food and drinks as a [[clouding agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-06-04/content_2817703.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108175731/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-06-04/content_2817703.html |archive-date=2018-01-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bak"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxic additives tracked to bakeries as scandal escalates|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&amp;ID=201106040019|publisher=The Central News Agency|accessdate=5 June 2011|author=The Central News Agency|date=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical agent has been linked to developmental problems with children as it affects hormones.&lt;ref name="pdo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Plasticizer contamination triggers food security fear across Taiwan Strait |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/7400614.html|publisher=People's Daily Online|accessdate=5 June 2011|author=People's Daily Online|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The food affected includes beverages, fruit juices, bread, sports drinks, tea, and jam.&lt;ref name="inq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/11274/70-food-brands-from-taiwan-recalled-from-market-shelves | title=70 food brands from Taiwan recalled from market shelves | publisher=inquirer.net | date=2 June 2011 | accessdate=5 June 2011 | author=Jocelyn R. Uy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years of investigations, the Taiwanese government levied NT$1.2 million (approx. US$40,000) in fines against 37 companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Plasticizer Settlement: What it Means for Food Safety|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/taiwan-issues/2013/10/22/391741/The-plasticizer.htm|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or slightly more than US$1000 per company.

== History ==
In mid May 2011, Taiwanese authorities reported that two Taiwanese companies&lt;ref name="pdo"/&gt; Yu Shen Chemical Co. and Pin Han Perfumery Co. were using plasticizer DEHP in clouding agents the firms manufactured.&lt;ref name="pdo"/&gt; This was used as a substitute for palm oil in clouding agents as a way to keep cost down and improve profits.&lt;ref name="pdo"/&gt; However, Wei Te Chemical Co., a manufacturer of clouding agents, claims that "the reason most businesses tended to utilize illegal clouding agents was not because of price, but rather the long preservation periods and esthetically&lt;!-- Do not change quote; "esthetically" is an alternative spelling of "aesthetically" ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/esthetically / http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/esthetically ). --&gt; pleasing effect of using DEHP-laced products."&lt;ref name="taipeiTimesFoodScare"&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/05/29/2003504450 FOOD SCARE WIDENS: Tainted additives used for two decades: manufacturer], Taipei Times, 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of May 2011, the Taiwanese government had begun seizures of contaminated products and announced a ban from exporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news19327.html|title='Tainted beverage' from Taiwan recalled by supermarkets in Xiamen|date=30 May 2011|publisher=Whats On Xiamen, Inc.|author=Whats On Xiamen, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the list for government safety checks was extended to syrups, tablets, pastries, and powders.&lt;ref name="tt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/06/05/2003504998|title=DEHP scare expands to pastry shops, baked goods|date=Jun 5, 2011|author1=Staff Writer |author2=with CNA |publisher=The Taipei Times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 27 May 2011, "up to 465,638 bottles of DEHP-tainted beverages have been pulled out from store shelves. Also, up to 270,822 boxes and 68,924 packs of powdered probiotics and 28,539 kilos of fruit juices, fruit jam, powder and syrup, and yoghurt powder have been removed from shelves",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taiwanese products with DEHP named|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/05/31/11/taiwanese-products-dehp-named|publisher=abs-cbnNEWS.com|accessdate=13 June 2011|author=Karen Galarpe|date=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to EcoWaste Coalition and a report from Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

As of mid June, there are roughly 900 products which have been recalled from nearly 40,000 Taiwanese retailers.&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18837149?story_id=18837149&amp;fsrc=rss|title=Food scandals in Taiwan Plastic unfantastic: Tainted products also poison the president's chances of re-election|date=Jun 16, 2011 |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|author=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some media reports, including in ''The Economist'', conclude that Taiwan's former reputation as a reliable and safe food manufacturing country has been damaged.&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt;

Taiwanese prosecutors alleges that one of the company Yu Shen at the centre of the crisis has used 5 tonne of DEHP every month to manufacture clouding agents which is supplied to food processing firms and pastry shops.&lt;ref name="atimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/MF07Cb01.html|title=Taiwan food scare 'dates back decades'|author=Jens Kastner|date=Jun 7, 2011 |publisher=Asia Times Online (Holdings), Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 95 Taiwanese manufacturers which has used the DEHP ingredient.&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt; A further 244 ingredient manufacturing firms had also used the DEHP.&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt;

They pointed out that DPP legislator Huang Sue-ying spoke against placing DEHP on the EPA's class-1 control list of toxic substances. KMT legislator [[Chiu Yi]] also alleged that the DPP had ties with the owner of the Yu Shen Company, Lai Chun-chieh. Lai's son also claimed on his Facebook that DEHP was not responsible for cancer, contrary to studies that show otherwise.

'''Agriculture in the Middle Ages''' describes the farming practices, crops, technology, and agricultural society and economy of [[Europe]] from the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE to approximately 1500 CE. The [[Middle Ages]] are sometimes called the Medieval Age or Period. The Middle Ages are also divided into the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]], [[High Middle Ages|High]], and [[Late Middle Ages]]. The [[early modern period]] followed the Middle Ages.   

Epidemics and climatic cooling caused a large decrease in the European population in the 6th century. Compared to the Roman period, agriculture in the Middle Ages in western Europe became more focused on self-sufficiency. The [[Feudalism|Feudal]] period began about 1000 CE.  The agricultural population under feudalism in northern Europe was typically organized into [[manor]]s consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a [[Lord]] of the Manor, with a [[Roman Catholic]] church and priest.  Most of the people living on the manor were [[peasant]] farmers or [[serf]]s who grew crops for themselves and either labored for the lord and church or paid rent for their land.  [[Barley]] and [[wheat]] were the most important crops in most European regions; [[oats]] and [[rye]] were also grown, along with a variety of vegetables and fruits. [[Oxen]] and [[horses]] were used as draft animals. [[Sheep]] were raised for wool and [[pigs]] were raised for meat.    

Crop failures due to bad weather were frequent throughout the Middle Ages and famine was often the result. Despite the hardships, there is [[anthropometry|anthropometric]] evidence that medieval European men were taller (and therefore presumably better fed) than the men of the preceding Roman Empire and the subsequent early modern era.    

The medieval system of agriculture began to break down in the 14th century with the development of more intensive agricultural methods in the [[Low Countries]] and after the population losses of the [[Black Death]] in 1347-1351 made more land available to a diminished number of farmers. Medieval farming practices, however, continued with little change in the Slavic regions and some other areas until the mid-19th century.  

==Setting the stage==
[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|left|250px|Europe and the Middle East in 476 CE after the fall of the last Roman Emperor.]]
Three events set the stage – and would influence agriculture for centuries – in Europe. First was the fall of the western [[Western Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] which began to lose territory to "barbarian" invaders about 400 CE. The last western Roman emperor abdicated in 476 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Heather, Peter (2006), ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 193-199, 429-430&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the lands and people of the former western Roman Empire would be divided among different ethnic groups, whose rule was often ephemeral and constantly in flux. Unifying factors of Europe were the gradual adoption of the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] by most Europeans&lt;ref&gt;Caltron, J.H Hayas (1953),''Christianity and Western Civilization'', Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; and in western Europe the use of [[Latin]] as a common language of international communication, scholarship, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Medieval Latin," http://www.dmlbs.ox.ac.uk/british-medieval-latin/language/latin-in-the-middle-ages, accessed 24 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Greek had a similar status in the Eastern Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard MacGillivray Dawkins|Dawkins, R.M.]] 1916. Modern Greek in Asia Minor. A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly was an era of global cooling which started in 536 CE and ended about 660 CE. The cooling was caused by volcanic eruptions in 536, 540, and 547. The Byzantine historian [[Procopius]] said that "the sun put forth it's light without brightness." Summer temperatures in Europe dropped as much as 2.5°C (4.5°F) and the sky was dimmed from volcanic dust in the atmosphere for 18 months, sufficient to cause crop failures and famine. Temperatures remained lower than the preceding Roman period for more than one hundred years. The [[Late Antique Little Ice Age]] preceded, and may have influenced, a number of disruptive events, including pandemics, human migration, and political turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;Zielinski, Sarah (2015), ''Smithsonian Magazine,'' https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/sixth-century-misery-tied-not-one-two-volcanic-eruptions-180955858/, accessed 23 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buntgen, Ulf et al (2016), "Cooling and societal change during the Late Antique Little Ice Age from 546 to around 600 AD, ''Nature Geoscience'', Vol. 9, https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2652, accessed 23 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, was the [[Plague of Justinian]] which began in 541 CE, spread throughout Europe, and recurred periodically until 750. The plague may have killed up to 25 percent of the people of the eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]] and a similar percentage in western and northern Europe. The double impact on population of climatic cooling and the plague led to reduced harvests of grain.&lt;ref&gt;Horgan, John, "Justinian's Plague," ''Ancient History Encyclopedia'', https://www.ancient.eu/article/782/justinians-plague-541-542-ce/, accessed 23 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[John of Ephesus]]'s account of travel through rural areas speaks of "crops of wheat...white and standing but there was no one reap them and store the wheat" and "Vineyards, whose picking season came and went" with nobody to pick and press the grapes. John also speaks of the "severe winter", presumably caused by volcanic dust.&lt;ref&gt;Little, Lester K., ed. (2007), ''Plague and the End of Antiquity: The Pandemic of 541-750'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The consequence of these factors was that the population of Europe was substantially less in 600 CE than it had been in 500 CE. The estimate of one scholar was that the population on the Italian peninsula decreased from 11 million in 500 to 8 million in 600 and remained at that level for nearly 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;Barbiera, Irene and Dalla-Zuanna, Gianpiero (June 2009), "Population Dynamics in the Middle Ages: New Insights from Archaeological Findings," ''Population and Development Review'', Vol. 35, No. 2, p. 368. This is a higher estimate for the Italian population than some other estimates. The important number however is the magnitude of the decline in the population of 25 to 30 percent in a single century.&lt;/ref&gt; The declines in the population of other parts of Europe were probably of similar magnitude.

==The Dark Ages==
The popular view is that the fall of the Western Roman Empire caused a "dark age" in western Europe in which "knowledge and civility", the "arts of elegance," and "many of the useful arts" were neglected or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Ward-Perkins, Bryan (2005), ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization,'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, however, the lot of the farmers who made up 80 percent or more&lt;ref&gt;Eberling, Richard M., "Lords and Serfs in Medieval Europe," ''Foundation for Economic Education", https://fee.org/articles/lords-and-serfs-in-medieval-europe/, accessed 24 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt; of the total population, may have improved in the aftermath of the Roman Empire. The fall of Rome saw the "shrinking of tax burdens, weakening of the aristocracy, and consequently greater freedom for peasants."&lt;ref&gt;Barbiera and Dall-Zuanna, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The countryside of the Roman Empire was dotted with "villas" or estates, characterized by [[Pliny the Elder]] as "the ruin of Italy."  The estates were owned by wealthy aristocrats and worked in part by slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, N. J. G. (1990), ''An Historical Geography of Europe," Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 63-64&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,500 villas are known to have existed in England alone.&lt;ref&gt;"The Emergency of Villa Landscapes," https://www2.rgzm.de/transformation/unitedKingdom/villas/VillaeLandscapes.htm, accessed 24 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of Rome, the villas were abandoned or transformed into utilitarian rather than elite uses. "In western Europe, then, we seem to see the effect of a release from the pressure of the Roman imperial market, army and taxation, and a return to farming based more on local needs."&lt;ref&gt;Lewit, Tamra (2009), "Pigs, presses and pastoralism: farming in the fifth to sixth centuries AD," ''Early Medieval Europe'', Vol 17, No. 1, pp 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;

The population declines of the 6th century, and, thus, a shortage of labor may have facilitated greater freedom among rural people who were either slaves or had been bound to the land under Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Maugh II, Thomas H. (6 May 2002), "An Empire's Epidemic," ''Los Angeles Times,'', http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/anempiresepidemic.html, accessed 24 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Europe 814.svg|thumb|left|250px|Europe at the death of [[Charlemagne]]. 814 CE.]]

'''The Eastern Roman Empire'''. Early in the Middle Ages the agricultural history of the Eastern Roman Empire differed from that of western Europe. The 5th and 6th centuries saw an expansion of market-oriented and industrial farming, especially of [[olive oil]] and [[wine]], and the adoption of new technology such as oil and wine presses. The settlement patterns in the east were also different than the west. Rather than the villas of the Roman Empire in the west, the farmers of the east lived in villages which continued to exist and even expand.&lt;ref&gt;Lewit, pp. 85-89&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iberian peninsula'''. The [[Iberian Peninsula]] seems to have experienced a different experience than eastern and western Europe. There is evidence of abandonment of farmland and reforestation due to depopulation, but also evidence of expanded grazing and market-oriented livestock raising of horses, mules, and donkeys.  The economy of the Iberian peninsula seems to have become disconnected from the rest of Europe and, instead, it became a major trading partner of North Africa in the fifth century,&lt;ref&gt;Lewit, pp. 88-91&lt;/ref&gt; long before the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad conquest of the peninsula]] in 711.

==Muslim Agriculture in Iberia==
[[File:The Albolafia Water Mill (10823918983).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Roman Bridge and an Islamic water wheel for irrigation in [[Cordova, Spain]].]]
In what historian Andrew Watson called the [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]], the Arab Islamic rulers of much of [[Al Andalus]] (8th through the 15th centuries CE) introduced or popularized a large number of new crops and new agricultural technology into the Iberian peninsula ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]). The crops introduced by the Arabs included [[sugar cane]], [[rice]], [[hard wheat]] (durum), [[citrus]], [[cotton]], and [[Common fig|fig]]s.  Many of these crops required sophisticated methods of irrigation, water management, and "agricultural technologies such as crop rotation, management of pests, and fertilizing crops by natural means."&lt;ref&gt;"Cities of Light: The Rise and fall of Islamic Spain," http://www.islamicspain.tv/Arts-and-Science/The-Culture-of-Al-Andalus/Agriculture.htm, accessed 28 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars have questioned how much of the Arab (or Muslim) Agricultural Revolution was unique, and how much was a revival and expansion of technology developed in the [[Middle East]] during the centuries of Roman rule. Whether credit of invention belongs mostly to the people of the Middle East during the Roman Empire or to the arrival of the Arabs, "the Iberian landscape changed profoundly" beginning in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, D. Fairchild (2000), ''Gardens, Landscape, and Vision in the Palaces of Islamic Spain.'' University Park, PA: Penn State Press. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feudalism==

Gradually, the Roman system of villas and agricultural estates using partly slave labor was replaced by [[manoralism]] and [[serfdom]].  Historian Peter Sarris has identified the characteristics of feudal society in sixth century Italy, and even earlier in the Byzantine Empire and Egypt. One of the differences between the villa and medieval manor was that the agriculture of the villa was commercially oriented and specialized while the manor was directed toward self-sufficiency. &lt;ref&gt;Sarris, Peter (Apr 2004), "The Origins of the Manorial Economy: New Insights from Late Antiquity," ''The English Historical Review,'' Vol 119, No. 481, pp. 302-311. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Slavery, important for the agricultural labor force of the Roman Empire, died out in western Europe by 1100 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fynn-Paul, Jeffrey (2009), "Empire, Monotheism and Slavery in the Greater Mediterranean Region from Antiquity to the Early Modern Era," ''Past and Present'', No. 205, p. 16. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves of the Roman Empire were property, like livestock, with no rights of personhood and could be sold or traded at the will of his owner.  Similarly, The serf was tied to the land and could not leave his servitude, but his tenure on the land was secure. If the manor changed owners the serfs remained on the land. Serfs had limited rights to property, although their freedom of movement was limited and they owed labor or rent to their lord.&lt;ref&gt;"Serfdom in Europe," ''Khan Academy'', https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/medieval-times/european-middle-ages-and-serfdom/a/serfdom-in-europe, accessed 26 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Feudalism was in full flower for most of northern Europe by 1000 AD and its heartland was the rich agricultural lands in the [[Seine River|Seine]] valley of France and the [[Thames River|Thames]] valley of England. The medieval population was divided into three groups: those who pray, those who fight, and those who work.&lt;ref&gt;"Those who pray, those who work, and those who fight," ''Medievalists.net'' http://www.medievalists.net/2016/01/those-who-pray-those-who-work-those-who-fight/, accessed 27 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The serf and farmer supported with labor and taxes the [[clergy]] who prayed and the noble lords, [[knight]]s, and warriors who fought.  In return the farmer received the benefits (or burden) of religion and protection by mounted and heavily armored soldiers. The church took its [[tithe]] and the soldiers required a large economic investment. A social and legal gulf resulted between the priest, the knight, and the farmer. Moreover, with the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] (800-888 CE), the power of kings declined and the central authority was little felt. Thus, the European countryside became a patchwork of small, semi-autonomous fiefdoms of lords and clergy ruling over a populace mostly of farmers, some relatively prosperous, some possessing land, and some landless.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, David, (2001), ''At the Dawn of Modernity,'' Berkley: University of California Press, pp. 18-21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medieval Ridge and Furrow above Wood Stanway - geograph.org.uk - 640050.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Farmers typically owned more than a dozen long and narrow strips of land scattered among the ridge and furrows]]  
A major factor contributing to the death of feudalism in most of Europe was the [[Black Death]] of 1347-1351 and subsequent epidemics which killed one-third or more of the people of Europe.  In the aftermath of the Black Death, land was abundant and labor was scarce and the rigid relationships among farmers. the church, and the nobility changed.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, pp. 376-377&lt;/ref&gt;  Feudalism is generally regarded as having ended in western Europe around 1500, although serfs were not finally freed in [[Russia]] until 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz-Diaz, Katherine E.,"Peasant Life and Serfdom under Tsarist Russia," http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/historians-craft/katherine-ruiz-diaz/, accessed 28 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt;    

'''The Manor'''.  Agricultural land in the Middle Ages under feudalism was usually organized in manors.  The medieval manor consisted of several hundred (or sometimes thousand) acres of land.  A large manor house served as the home or part-time home of the lord of the manor. Some manors were under the authority of [[bishop]]s or [[abbot]]s of the Catholic church. Some lords owned more than one manor, and the church controlled large areas. Within the lands of a manor, a parish church and a nucleated village housing the farmers was usually near the manor house.  The manor house, church, and village were surrounded by cultivated and fallow land, woods, and pasture.  Some of the land was the [[demesne]] of the lord; some was allocated to individual farmers, and some to the parish priest. Some of the woods and pasture were held in common and used for grazing and wood-gathering. Most manors had a mill for grinding grain into flour and an oven to bake bread.&lt;ref&gt;Gies. Frances and Joseph (1990) , ''Life in a Medieval Village,'' New York: Harper &amp; Row, pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, H. S. (1974), ''Life on the English Manor,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 56-60, 130-136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields==
[[File:Three Field System.svg|thumb|left|250px|The three field system common to Medieval Europe.]]
[[File:Aiketrigs.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The distinctive ridge and furrow pattern of the Middle Ages survive in this open field in Scotland.]]
The field systems in Medieval Europe included the [[open-field system]], so called because there were no barriers between fields belonging to different farmers. The landscape was one of long and uncluttered views.  In its archetypal form, cultivated land consisted of long, narrow strips of land in a distinctive [[ridge and furrow]] pattern.  Individual farmers owned or farmed several different strips of land scattered around the farming area.  The reason for farmers possessing scattered strips of land was apparently to reduce risk; if the crop in one strip failed, it might thrive in another strip.  The lord of the manor also had strips of land scattered around the fields as did the parish priest for the upkeep of the church. The open-field system required cooperation among the residents of the community and with the lord and the priest. "Strips of land were cultivated individually, yet were subject to communal rotations and (typically) communal regulation of cropping."&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, Rosemary L. (1999), ''Regions, Institutions, and Agrarian Change in Europe History,'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, Donald N. (Jun 1991). "The Prudent Peasant: New Findings on Open Fields" ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 51, No. 2, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;    

Two patterns of cultivation were typical of the open-field system.  In the first, the arable land was divided into two fields.  One half was cultivated and the other one was left fallow every year. Crops were rotated between the two fields every year, with the fallow field being allowed to recover its fertility and used for livestock grazing when not dedicated to crops. The two-field system continued to be  most prevalent throughout the Middle Ages in dry-summer Mediterranean climates in which grain crops were planted in fall and harvested in spring, the summer being too dry for spring-planted crops to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;     

A three-field pattern was typical of the later Middle Ages in northern Europe with its wetter climate.  One field was planted in fall, one field was planted in spring, and the third field was left fallow. Crops were rotated from year to year and field to field. Thus, cultivation was more intensive than it was under the two-field pattern.  In both patterns, common areas of wood and pasture as well as fallowed fields were used for communal grazing and wood-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;   

The woods and meadows comprising common lands were open to exploitation to all farmers in the manor, but under strict management of the number of livestock allowed each farmer to avoid over grazing.  Fallow fields were treated as common lands for grazing.&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, Barbara A. (1986), ''The Ties that Bind: Peasant Families in Medieval England,'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;     

The open-field system had a more individualistic, less-communal variant, usually prevalent in less productive areas for agriculture.  The strips of land cultivated by farmers were more concentrated, sometimes into a single block of land rather than scattered holdings. Crop decisions were often made by individuals or a small group of farmers rather than a whole village.  An individual farmer might possess not only cultivated land, but woods and pastures, rather than the commons of the pure open-field system.  Villages were often strung out along a road rather than nucleated as in the archetypal open-field system.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;

An enclosed field system was found mostly in pastoral areas, areas of mixed farming and pasture, and more marginal farming areas.  The enclosed field system was characterized by individual decision making.  Farmers typically enclosed their land with hedgerows, stones, or trees.  The village church was often at a prominent location and houses were scattered rather than collected into a village.  This individualistic field system was found in eastern and southwestern England, [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] in France, and scattered throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, pp. 22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farmers' holdings==

Farmers were not equal in the amount of land they farmed. In a survey of seven English counties in 1279, perhaps typical of Europe as a whole, 46 percent of farmers held less than {{convert|10|acre|ha}}, which was insufficient land to support a family. Some were completely landless, or possessed only a small garden adjacent to their house. These poor farmers were often employed by richer farmers, or practiced a trade in addition to farming.&lt;ref&gt;Giews, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thirty-three percent of farmers held about one-half [[virgate]] of land ({{convert|12|acre|ha}} to {{convert|16|acre|ha}}, sufficient in most years to support a family. Twenty percent of farmers held about a full virgate, sufficient not only to support a family but to produce a surplus. A few farmers accumulated more than a virgate of land and thus were relatively wealthy, although not belonging to the nobility. These rich farmers might have tenants of their own and would hire labor to work their lands.&lt;ref&gt;Giews, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-two percent of arable land was held by the lord of the manor.  The farmers of the manor were required to work for a specified number of days per year on the lord's land or to pay rent to the lord on the land they farmed.&lt;ref&gt;Giews, pp. 72-80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crops==
In the late Roman Empire in Europe the most important crops were [[bread wheat]] in Italy and [[barley]] in northern Europe and the [[Balkan]]s.  Near the Mediterranean Sea [[viticulture]] and [[olive]]s were important. [[Rye]] and [[oats]] were only slowly becoming major crops.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  The Romans introduced viticulture to more northerly areas such as Paris and the valleys of the [[Moselle River|Moselle]] and [[Rhine River|Rhine rivers]].&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivation of [[olive]]s in medieval France was traditional on the southeastern coast bordering on Italy, but apparently the cultivation of olives in [[Languedoc]] began on a large scale began in areas only in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ruas, Marie-Pierre (Dec 2005), "Aspects of early medieval farming from sites in Mediterranean France," ''Vegetation History and Archaeobotany'', Vol. 14, No. 4, pp. 400&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318456726_The_olive_industry_in_France, accessed 22 Jul 2018&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Le Roy Ladurie, Emmanuel (1976), ''The Peasants of languedoc,'' Urbana: University of Illinois Press, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In Roman times, [[spelt]], a kind of wheat, was the most common grain grown on the upper Danube River in [[Swabia]], [[Germany]], and spelt continued to be an important crop in many areas of Europe throughout medieval times. [[Emmer]] wheat was of much less importance in Swabia and most of Europe. Bread wheat was relatively unimportant in Swabia.&lt;ref&gt;Rosch, Manfred, Jacomet, Stefania, and Karg, Sabine (1992), "The History of cereals int he region of the former Duchy of Swabia from the Roman to the Post-medieval period: results of archaeobotanical research," ''Vegetation History ad Archaeobotany'', Vol 1, No 4, pp. 222-225. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the eighth through 11th century, in northern France, the most important crops were (in approximate order) [[rye]] (''Secale cereale''), bread wheat, barley, and, oats (''Avena sativa''). Barley and oats were the most important crops in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruas, pp. 406-407&lt;/ref&gt; Rye is more winter-hardy and tolerant of poor soils than wheat, and thus became the dominant crop on many marginal and northernmost European sites.&lt;ref&gt;"Gramene Secale", http://archive.gramene.org/species/secale/rye_intro.html, accessed 2 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Another hardy crop, [[bere (grain)|bere]], a kind of barley, was grown in Scandinavia and England and especially in marginal agricultural areas in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;"Bere (barley)," https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/izxSEht6Z2/bere-barl, accessed 2 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  
 	
In the lowlands of the Netherlands and adjacent France, soil influenced the crops planted. On [[sand]]y soils, in a three-field system, wheat was nearly absent as a crop with rye planted as a winter crop and oats and barley being the principle spring-planted crops.  On more fertile [[loess]] and [[loam]]y soils, wheat, including [[spelt]], became much more important replacing rye in many areas. Other crops included pulses (beans and peas) and fruits and vegetables. Farmers of loess and loamy soils planted a wider variety of crops than those on sandy soils.&lt;ref&gt;Bakels, Corrie C. (Dec 2005), "Crops produced in the southern Netherlands and northern France during the early medieval period: a comparison," ''Vegetation History and Archaeobotany'', pp. 394-399&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Wiltshire]] [[England]] in the 13th and 14th centuries, wheat, barley, and oats were the three most common crops, with varying percentages of each on different manors.  Legumes were planted on up to 8 percent of the common fields.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Barry (1995), "Field Systems and Demesne Farming on the Wiltshire Estates of Saint Swithun's Priory, Winchester, 1248-1340," ''The Agricultural History Review'', Vol. 43, No. 1, p. 10. Downloaded from JSTOR,&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the grain crops in the common fields of the open-field system, farmer's houses usually had a small garden ([[croft (land)|croft]]) near their house in which they grew vegetables such as cabbages, onions, peas and beans; an apple, cherry or pear tree; and raised a pig or two and a flock of geese.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, pp. 231-232&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Livestock'''. Livestock was more important in northern Europe than in the Mediterranean area where dry weather in summer reduced the fodder available for animals. Near the Mediterranean, sheep and [[goat]]s were the most important farm animals and [[transhumance]] (seasonal movement of livestock) was common. In northern Europe cattle, pigs, and horses were also important.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Mediterranean soils were lighter than those commonly found in northern Europe, thus reducing the need of Mediterranean farmers for [[oxen]] and horses as draft animals.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20051110162413/http://scholar.chem.nyu.edu/tekpages/heavyplow.html, accessed 8 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Cattle, especially oxen, were vital in northern Europe as draft animals.  Plow teams, ideally comprising eight oxen, were necessary to plow the heavy soils. Few farmers were wealthy enough to own a full team and thus plowing required cooperation and sharing of draft animals among farmers.  Horses in Roman times were owned mostly by the wealthy but they were increasingly used as draft animals to replace oxen after about 1000 CE. Oxen were cheaper to own and maintain, but horses were faster.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, John H. (Apr. 1961), "The Ox in the Middle Ages," ''Agricultural History,'' Vol. 35, No. 2, pp. 90-93. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; Pigs were the most important animals raised for meat in medieval England and other parts of northern Europe. Pigs were prolific and required little care. Sheep produced wool, skin (for parchment), meat, and milk, though less valuable in the marketplace than pigs.&lt;ref&gt;Gies, pp. 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productivity==

Crop yields in the Middle Ages were extremely low compared to those of the 21st century, although probably not inferior to those in much of the Roman Empire preceding the Middle Ages and the early modern period following the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Erdkamp, Paul (2005), ''The Grain Market in the Roman Empire,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 35-54. Erdkamp accepts 8 to l as an average yield on the best wheat lands on the best farms in Sicily and higher still in Egypt during the Roman Empire. Climatic conditions for growing grain in northern Europe were more difficult for medieval farmers.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common means of calculating yield was the number of seeds harvested compared to the number of seeds planted.  On several manors in [[Sussex]] England, for example, the average yield for the years 1350-1399 was 4.34 seeds produced for each seed sown for wheat, 4.01 for barley, and 2.87 for oats.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, P. F. (Aug 1972), "Cereal Yields on the Sussex Estates of Battle Abbey during the Late Middle Ages," ''The Economic History Review'', Vol. 25, No. 3, pg. 412. Downloaded from JSTOR,&lt;/ref&gt; (By contrast, wheat production in the 21st century can total 30 to 40 seeds harvested for each seed sown.)  Average yields of grain crops in England from 1250 to 1450 were 7 to 15 bushels per acre. (470 to 1000 kg per ha.)&lt;ref&gt;Broadberry, Stephen, Campbell, Bruce, van Leeuwen, Bas (2008), "English Agricultural Output 1250-1450: Some Preliminary Estimates" http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.562.1552&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf, accessed 13 Aug 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Poor years, however, might see yields drop to less than 4 bushels per acre.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Barry ((1995), "Field Systems and Demesne Farming of the Wiltshire Estates of Saint Swithun's Priory, Winchester, 1238-1340, ''The Agricultural History Review,'', Vol. 13, No. 1, p. 14-15. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; Yields in the 21st century, by contrast, can range upwards to 60 bushels per acre.&lt;ref&gt;''Food and Agricultural Organization''.http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5146e/y5146e07.htm, accessed 11 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The yields in England were probably typical for Europe in the Middle Ages.

Scholars have often criticized medieval agriculture for its inefficiency and low productivity.  The inertia of an established system was blamed. "Everyone was forced to conform to village norms of cropping, harvesting, and building."&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Two reputed inefficiencies of the predominant open-field system were the communal management of land which resulted in less that optimal allocation of resources and the fact that farmers had small, scattered strips of land to cultivate which was wasting of time in traveling from one strip to another. Belying the reputed inefficiencies, however. the open-field system existed for roughly one thousand years over large parts of Europe and only disappeared slowly from 1500 CE to 1800 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlman, Carl J. (1980), ''The Open Field System and Beyond,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 94-97&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the replacement of the open-field system by privately owned property was fiercely resisted by many elements of society. The "brave new world" of a harsher, more competitive and capitalistic society from the 16th century onward destroyed the securities and certainties of land tenure in the open-field system.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Bruce M.S., "The land" in ''A Social History of England, 1200–1500,'' ed. by Rosemary Horrox and W. Mark Ormrod. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Postan Thesis" is also cited as a factor in the low productivity of medieval agriculture. Productivity suffered because of inadequate fertilization to keep the land productive.  This was due to a shortage of pasture for farm animals and, thus, a shortage of nitrogen-rich [[manure]] to fertilize the arable land.  Moreover, because of population growth after 1000 CE, marginal lands, pasture, and woodlands were converted into arable lands which further reduced the number of farm animals and the quantity of manure.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Gregory (March 1992), "The Economies of Exhaustion: the Postan Thesis, and the Agricultural Revolution," ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol 51, No. 1, pp. 61-62. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;    

The earliest evidence of progress in increasing productivity comes in the 14th and 15th centuries from the [[Low Countries]] of the Netherlands and [[Belgium]], and [[Flanders]] in northern France. The agricultural practices there involved the near elimination of fallow land by planting [[cover crop]]s such as [[vetch]], [[beans]], [[turnips]], [[spurry]], and [[broom (plant)|broom]] and high-value crops such as [[rapeseed]], [[madder]] and [[hops]].  As opposed to the extensive agriculture of medieval times, this new technique involved intensive cultivation of small plots of land. Techniques of intensive cultivation quickly spread to [[Norfolk]] in England, agriculturally-speaking the most advanced area of England.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Bruce M. S. (February 1983), "Agricultural Progress in Medieval England: Some Evidence from Eastern Norfolk," ''The Economic History Review'', New Series, Vol 36, No. 1, pp. 26-28. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; These advancements aside, it was the 17th century before England saw widespread increases in agricultural productivity in what was called the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The low level of medieval yields persisted in [[Russia]] and some other areas until the 19th century.  In 1850, the average yield for grain in Russia was 600 kilograms per hectare (about 9 bushels per acre), less than one half the yield in England and the Low Countries at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Jermome (January 1960), "Russian Agriculture in the Last 150 Years of Serfdom," ''Agricultural History'', Vol. 34, No. 1, p. 6. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famines==
Famines caused by crop failures and poor crop years were an ever present danger in medieval Europe. It was often not possible to relive a famine in one area by importing grain from another area as the difficulty of overland transportation caused the price of grain to double for each 50 miles it was transported&lt;ref&gt;Heather, pp. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;    

One study concluded that famines in Europe occurred on an average every 20 years between the years 750 CE and 950 CE.  The principle causes were extreme weather and climatic anomalies which reduced agriculture production. Warfare was not found to be a major cause of famine.&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Timothy P. (2013), "The Contours, Frequency and Causation of Subsistence Crises in Carolingian Europe (750-950 CE)" in ''Crisis Alimentarian en la Edad Media,'' Lleida, Spain: Universidad de Lleida, pp 118, 169&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of crop failures in [[Winchester]], England from 1232 CE to 1349 CE found that harvest failure occurred an average of every 12 years for wheat and every 8 years for barley and oats. Localized famine may have occurred in years in which one or more crops failed.  Weather was again identified as the chief cause. [[Climatic change]] may have played a part as the [[Little Ice Age]] may have begun between 1275 and 1300 with a consequent shortening of the growing season.&lt;ref&gt;Dury, G. H. (1984), "Crop Failures on the Winchester Manors, 1232-1349," ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'', Vol. 9, No. 4, pp. 413-417. Downloaded from JSTOR.; ''AGU 100'', https://news.agu.org/press-release/unusual-volcanic-episode-rapidly-triggered-little-ice-age-researchers-find/, accessed 12 Aug 2018. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warfare was apparently responsible for a major famine in [[Hungary]] from 1243 to 1245.  These were the years in the aftermath of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion and widespread destruction.  Twenty to 50 percent of the population of Hungary is estimated to have died of hunger and war. Other areas of eastern Europe may also have been impacted by the Mongol invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Fara. Amdrea (2017), "Production of and Trade in Food Between the Kingdom of Hungary and Europe in the late Middle Ages and Early Modern Era (Thirteenth to Sixteenth Centuries)" The Roles of Markets in Crises and Famines," ''The Hungarian Historical Review,'' Vol. 6, No. 1, pp 152-153. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known and most extensive famine of the Middle Ages was the [[Great Famine of 1315-1317]] (which actually persisted to 1322) that impacted 30 million people in northern Europe of whom five to ten percent died. The famine came near the end of three centuries of growth in population and prosperity. The causes were "severe winters and rainy springs, summers and falls." Yields of crops fell by one-third or one-fourth and draft animals died in large numbers. The Black Death of 1347-1352 was more lethal, but the Great Famine was the worst natural catastrophe of the later Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, William Chester in ''Ecologies and Economies in Medieval and Early Modern Europe,'' edited by Scott G. Bruce, Leiden: Brill, pp. 45-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological innovation==
[[File:Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A medieval plow.]]
[[File:Medieval horse team.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Plow horses.  The lead horse has a breast collar; the rear horse wears a horsecollar.]]
The most important technical innovation for agriculture in the Middle Ages was the widespread adoption about 1000 CE of the [[mouldboard]] plow and its close relative, the heavy [[plow]]. These two plows enabled medieval farmers to exploit the fertile but heavy clay soils of northern Europe.  In the Roman era and on light soils, the [[Ard (plough)|ard]] or scratch plow had sufficed. The mouldboard and heavy plows turned the soil over which facilitated the control of weeds and their incorporation into the soil, increasing fertility. Mouldboard plowing also produced the familiar [[ridge and furrow]] pattern of medieval fields which facilitated drainage of excess moisture.  "By allowing for better field drainage, access [to] the most fertile soils, and saving of peasant labor time, the heavy plow stimulated food production and, as a consequence 'population growth, specialization of function, urbanization, and the growth of leisure.'"&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Thomas Barnebeck, Jensen, Peter Sandholt, and Skovsgaard, Christian Stejner (2013), "The Heavy Plough and the Agricultural Revolution in Medieval Europe", ''Discussion Papers on Business and Economics'', No 6, [http://www.medievalists.net/2013/01/the-heavy-plough-and-the-european-agricultural-revolution-of-the-middle-ages//]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two additional advances coming into general use in Europe about 1000 CE were the [[horse collar]] and the [[horseshoe]].  The horse collar increased the pulling capacity of a horse. The horseshoe protected a horse's hooves.  These advances resulted in the horse becoming an alternative to slow-moving oxen as a draft animal and for transportation.&lt;ref&gt;"Horse collar", https://www.britannica.com/technology/horse-collar, accessed 16 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Horses in the Middle Ages," http://horsehints.org/MiddleAgesHorse.htm, accessed 16 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

These technological innovations and the additional agricultural production they stimulated resulted in Europe experiencing a large increase in population from 1000 CE (or earlier) to 1300 CE, an increase that was reversed by the Great Famine and the Black Death of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, pp. 119-123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tall men of the Middle Ages== 
Although the Middle Ages is often portrayed as an era of deprivation and oppression of the farmer and other workers, there is evidence that the life of a medieval farmer was no more difficult -- and possibly better -- than that of the average citizen of the Roman Empire before the Middle Ages and the [[Early Modern Period]] (c. 1500 CE to 1800 CE) after the Middle Ages. For example, in an examination of skeletons, the average height of males in northern Europe ([[Scandinavia]], the Netherlands, and England) who died around the year 1000 CE was {{convert|173.4|cm|inch}}.  Average stature in northern Europe declined thereafter, reaching a low in the 17th and 18th century when the average height of males was {{convert|167|cm|inch}}. The average height of a population is a good measurement of the adequacy of its access to necessities such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care.  Cities were notoriously unhealthy until the 19th century and thus the rural life of the medieval farmer may have been healthy by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Steckel, Richard H. (Summer 2004), "New Light on the 'Dark Ages'", ''Social Science History,'' Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 218-223. Downloaded from [[Project Muse]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 9,477 skeletons collected from all of Europe reached a similar conclusion that European men in the Middle Ages were slightly taller than their Roman ancestors and early modern successors. The average height of men during the Roman Empire was about {{convert|170.0|cm|inch}}.  In the 6th century, shortly after the traditional date for the fall of Rome, average height jumped to {{convert|172.0|cm|inch}}, and men remained slightly taller than the Roman average for most of the Middle Ages. Average height of men in Europe reached a low point of less than {{convert|169.0|cm|inch}} in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Koepke, Nikola and Baten, Joerg (2005), "The biological standard of living in Europe during the last two millennia," ''European Review of Economic History,'' Vol 9, No. 1, p. 76.

'''Alexander von Frantzius''' (10 June 1821, in [[Danzig]] – 18 July 1877) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physician]] and [[natural history|naturalist]].

He studied medicine at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]], [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], where in 1846, he obtained his doctorate.&lt;ref name=AD&gt;[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Frantzius,_Alexander_von ADB:Frantzius, Alexander von] @ [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, with fellow naturalist, [[Karl Hoffmann (naturalist)|Karl Hoffmann]], he journeyed to [[Costa Rica]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I-kSmWLc6vYC&amp;pg=PA192 Google Books] The Eponym Dictionary of Mammals by Bo Beolens, Michael Watkins, Michael Grayson&lt;/ref&gt; where he would spend the next 15 years conducting [[geographical]], [[climatological]], [[ethnographical]] and [[zoological]] research.&lt;ref name=JS&gt;[http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000122075 JSTOR Global Plants] biography&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the zoological specimens he collected were sent to [[Jean Cabanis]] at the Berlin Museum.

After arriving in Costa Rica, he settled in [[Alajuela]] (1854), later setting up a successful [[pharmacy]] in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], an institution that eventually became known as the ''Botica Francesa''. Here he employed [[José Castulo Zeledón]] as an assistant. He returned to Germany in 1868, settling in Heidelberg, from where he served as secretary of the ''Gesellschaft für Anthropologie'' (German Anthropological Society). In July 1877, he died in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] from lung disease.&lt;ref name=AD/&gt;&lt;ref name=JS/&gt;

He is commemorated in the names of a number of animals, including the [[prong-billed barbet]] ''Semnornis frantzii'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://eol.org/pages/1177750/details Encyclopedia of Life] Semnornis frantzii&lt;/ref&gt; the [[fiery-billed aracari]] ''Pteroglossus frantzii'', the [[mountain elaenia]] ''Elaenia frantzii'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/species.jsp?avibaseid=97AD0B38E9213498 Avibase] Mountain Elaenia (Elaenia frantzii)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[ruddy-capped nightingale-thrush]] ''Catharus frantzii''. The botanical genus ''[[Frantzia]]'' ([[Cucurbitaceae]]) was named in his honor by [[Henri Pittier]].&lt;ref name=JS/&gt;

The '''American Association of [[Suicidology]] (AAS)''' is a [[501(c)(3) nonprofit organization]] which advocates for [[suicide prevention]]. It was established in 1968 by [[Edwin Shneidman]], who has been called "a pioneer in suicide prevention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104267986 | title=Pioneer In Study Of Suicide Dies At 91 | work=NPR | date=17 December 2009 | accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its official journal is ''[[Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior]]'', published six times a year by [[Wiley-Blackwell]].

== About American Association of Suicidology ==
The American Association of Suicidology encourages further study in the field of suicidology by clinicians as well as the general public. The AAS states their mission is to encompass advanced study into suicidology as a field of science, educate the public in efforts to reduce the number of suicides worldwide, analyze and break down suicidal behaviors, and promote further research and training in the growing field of suicidology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suicidology.org/about-aas/mission|title=Mission {{!}} American Association of Suicidology|website=www.suicidology.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAS hosts a campaign for both National Suicide Prevention Month and Week as well as public awareness campaigns to introduce new research and preventative measures for people who are currently dealing or have dealt with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The AAS offers handbooks for suicide survivors and their friends and families to promote healing and a better understanding of suicidal triggers and causes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Science of Suicidolody ==
Suicidology is the study of suicidal behaviors, risk factors of those behaviors, and suicide prevention. Suicidology combines both psychology and sociology to analyze the causes of suicidal behaviors and effective prevention methods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/462543007|title=Comprehensive textbook of suicidology|last=W.|first=Maris, Ronald|date=2000|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=157230541X|oclc=462543007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk Factors ===
Research has pointed towards hopelessness, impulsivity, social isolation, and exposure to violence as strong risk factors surrounding suicide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Support Groups ===
The Annual Healing Conference and the Survivors of Suicide are support groups that work to combat the risk factors of suicide through the emphasis on social interaction and interpersonal relationships. Educational programs and suicide specific skills and knowledge have proven effective in the treatment of suicidal patients.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klonsky|first=E.

== Training ==
Research points to an extreme lack of training in suicide prevention for many fields of psychology and social work. Numbers from a national survey reported less than 25% of social workers having been trained in suicide prevention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=tandfonline.com|title=Consultations for Research in Suicidology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAS is determined to prevent inadequately trained social workers and mental health professionals from working with potentially suicidal patients who display suicidal risk factors. The AAS believes promoting research and effective training for not only mental health professionals and social workers, but to the general public, will help prevent inadequate treatment in all psychological and social fields of work.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=William M.|last2=Allen|first2=Michael H.|last3=Feldman|first3=Barry N.|last4=Gutin|first4=Nina J.|last5=Jahn|first5=Danielle R.|last6=Kleespies|first6=Phillip M.|last7=Quinnett|first7=Paul|last8=Simpson|first8=Skip|date=2012-04-11|title=Preventing Suicide through Improved Training in Suicide Risk Assessment and Care: An American Association of Suicidology Task Force Report Addressing Serious Gaps in U.S. Mental Health Training|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1943-278x.2012.00090.x|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|volume=42|issue=3|pages=292–304|doi=10.1111/j.1943-278x.2012.00090.x|issn=0363-0234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plans for the Future ==
The AAS plans to spread suicidology as a field of scientific study and strives to reduce the number os suicide cases through research and analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In efforts to improve the field of suicidology, the International Academy for Suicide Research launched a task force to combat suicidal behaviors, causes, and risk factors to come up with better solutions and prevention programs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Image:Nordic Sami Naero Runic Shaman Drum Mythology from Friis 1871.jpg|thumb|250px|Sami [[Shamanism|Shaman]] [[drum]] found in [[Nærøy, Norway]]]]
'''Beaivi''', '''Beiwe''', '''Bievve''', '''Beivve''' or '''Biejje''', is the [[Sami people|Sami]] name of the [[Sun]] or might refer to the Sami [[Solar deity|Sun-deity]]. The Sami Sun-deity is mostly depicted female but sometimes also as male. In [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]], north of the [[Polar circle]], where the Sun during the winter-period, does not even reach the horizon, it is not hard to believe, that the Sun was appreciated and played a major role in the [[Cult (religious practice)|cultic]] coherence. Buorre beaivi means good day in [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sámi]] but doesn't have to associate with the Sun-deity.

Beaivi is the spring and [[sun goddess]] of [[fertility]] and sanity was worshiped by the Sami, one of the indigenous peoples of [[Fennoscandia]]. 

On the [[Winter solstice]], a white female [[reindeer]] or other white animals were [[sacrifice]]d in honor of Beivve, to ensure that she returned to the world and put an end to the long winter season. At the time of the year when the Sun was returning, [[butter]] (which melts in the sunshine) was smeared on the doorposts, as a sacrifice to Beivve, so that she could gain strength during her convalescence and go higher and higher in the sky. At [[Summer solstice]], people made sun-rings out of leaves and pinned them up in her honor. At these occasions, they also ate butter as a [[Sacred|sacral]] meal. 

Beivve was often accompanied by her daughter, Beaivi-nieida (the sun maiden) in an enclosure of reindeer [[antler]]s.

Beivve brought fertility back to the [[Arctic]] region, she made the plants grow, so that the reindeer flourished and reproduced, and brought wealth and prosperity to the humans.

At the time of the year when Beivve returned, [[prayer]]s were made for the people who were mentally ill.  The Sami considered - quite correctly - that madness in the shape of psychoses and depressions were provoked by the lack of sunshine and light during the dark winter-season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjatsi.fo/?side=491b24523f05ea96689d93e856f99618 www.tjatsi.fo]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sami myth, she travels with her daughter Beaivi-nieida through the sky in an enclosure covered by reindeer bones, bringing green plants back to the winter earth for the reindeer to eat. She was also called upon to restore the mental health of those who went insane because of the continual darkness of the long winter.

Worshipers of Beaivi used to sacrifice white female animals, and thread the meat onto sticks which they bend into rings and tie with bright ribbons. They also cover their doorposts with butter so Beaivi can eat it and begin her journey once again. This is called the Festival of Beaivi. 

She is associated with the fertility of plants and animals, in particular reindeer.

It also includes   the project, “Modeling Disease Dynamics on Large, Detailed, Co-Evolving Networks,” which supports  work to develop high-performance computer models for the study of very large networks,  .

The Cyberinfrastructure Division (CID) develops methods, infrastructure, and resources primarily for  infectious disease research. The  “Pathosystems Resource Integration Center - Bioinformatics Resource Center for Bacterial Diseases”  aims to  integrate information on pathogens, provide resources and tools to  analyzize genomic, proteomic and other data arising from infectious disease research. It is part  of the Middle-Atlantic Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (MARCE), which focuses on research to enable rapid defense against bioterror and emerging [[infectious diseases]]. Specific diseases and disease-causing agents under investigation include [[anthrax]], [[West Nile Virus]], [[smallpox]], and [[cryptosporidiosis]] The division collaborates  with [[Georgetown University]] and Social and Scientific Systems, Inc (SSS) on the Administrative Center of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-funded Proteomics Research Resource Center (PRC) for Biodefense Proteomics Research project. The team helps design, develop, and maintain a publicly accessible Web site containing data and technology protocols generated by each PRC, as well as a catalog that lists reagents and products  available for public distribution.

The Biological Systems Division develops computational methods for studying biochemical networks using experimental data . It developed COPASI (Complex Pathway Simulator), an open-source software package that allows users with limited experience in mathematics to construct models and simulations of biochemical networks. It also developed  GenoCAD, a web-based Computer Assisted Design environment for synthetic biology.

The Medical Informatics &amp; Systems (MIS) Division  focuses on  human genetics and disease, especially cancer and neurological disorders. It collaborates  with Carilion Clinics, [[Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine and Research Institute]], and other universities and government agencies.

== Major research laboratories ==

The Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory (NDSSL) at ACDIL pursues programs for interaction-based modeling, simulation, and associated analysis, experimental design, and decision support tools for understanding large and complex  systems. Extremely detailed, high-resolution, multi-scale computer simulations allow formal and experimental investigation of these systems.

Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory (SDAL) focuses on the use and development of analytical technology in the areas of public health policy, national and international security policy &amp; public and social policy.

The Nutritional Immunology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (NIMML) was founded in 2002 to investigate fundamental mechanisms of gut enteric immunity, and identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets for inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. The center has   discovered the mechanism of action underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of   [[Conjugated linoleic acid]] in inflammatory bowel disease,  and the insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects of [[abscisic acid]].  Its Center for Modeling Immunity to Enteric Pathogens  Program is applying high performance computing techniques to model and simulate human immunology systems and help immunologists conduct quick in silico experiments to narrow down experimental design, validate their hypotheses and save significant time and laboratory cost.  The NIMML is collaborating with the Center for Global Health at University of Virginia, the Department of Gastroenterology and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and other medical schools and leading several human clinical trials on safer therapies for inflammatory and immune mediated diseases. It has recently established a partnership with the Division of Gastroenterology at the Carilion Clinic to launch a joint translational research program in inflammatory bowel diseases.

It span the Rû Prévôt irrigation canal, and includes a large corridor covered by [[flagstone]]s. Another aqueduct-bridge, the '''Petit Arvou''', is located a few meters downstream.

==History==
In the late 13th-early 14th century, there was a series of programs aiming to improve the irrigation level in Aosta Valley, due to increased demand of animal husbandry. One of this was the construction of canal, the Rû Prévôt, by will of Henry of [[Quart, Italy|Quart]], [[Provost (religion)|provost]] (hence the name) of the [[Aosta Cathedral]]. This included also the couple of bridge-aqueducts which are now visible.
[[File:Ponte grand arvou 6.JPG|left|thumb|Interior view.]]
The income of the canal exploitation was later acquired by the Dukes (later Kings) of Savoy.

In the 20th century, the canal was mostly (11,9&amp;nbsp;km out of 12) channeled into pipes.

==Description==
The Grand Arvou is an [[arch bridge]], with a span of 68.5&amp;nbsp;m and an elevation of 13,60&amp;nbsp;m between the arch's top and the ground; the distance between the roof and the base of the arch is 10,5&amp;nbsp;m.

The bridge is built in [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and small incoherent stones, with partial plastering. The plan is irregular, with a general [[trapezoid]]al shape, but without the main parallel side; the walls's thickness varies from 50 to 55&amp;nbsp;cm. The roof is covered by [[flagstone]]s, which helped it resist to the centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9782">The '''Daughters of the Cross of [[Liège (city)|Liège]]''' ({{lang-fr|Filles de la Croix}}) are [[Religious Sister]]s in the Catholic Church who are members of a [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] founded in 1833 by the [[beatification|Blessed]] [[Marie Thérèse Haze]], F.C. (1782&amp;ndash;1876). The organization's original mission is focused on caring for the needs of their society through education and nursing care.

==History==

===Origins===
The founder, born Jeanne Haze in the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]], was forced into exile with her family in Germany when [[French Revolutionary Army]] forces occupied her principality. Her father died during that period, leaving the family in poverty.&lt;ref name=FC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daughtersofthecross.org.uk/history1.html|work=Daughters of the Cross|title=Our History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031185107/http://www.daughtersofthecross.org.uk/history1.html|archivedate=2013-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her family returned to Liège. After their return, because of their own experiences, Haze and her sister Ferdinande felt drawn to help people in most need. When their mother died in 1820, the sisters wanted to enter a religious community, but were not able to do so due to the restrictions of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Church law]] at the time. In an answer to a request by their [[pastor]], [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Cloes, the [[dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of [[St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|St Bartholomew]] [[Collegiate Church]], the sisters opened a school for poor children in the parish in 1829 in the home of the [[curate]] of the [[parish]], Canon Jean-Guillaume Habets.&lt;ref name=FC /&gt; The creation of an independent [[Kingdom of Belgium]] the following year allowed them to establish the school officially as a Catholic institution.

[[File:Daughters of the Cross.jpg|thumb|200px|The emblem of the Daughters of the Cross of Liège]]
Soon other young women joined the pair in their desire to follow the [[consecrated life]]. Habets, originally skeptical of their desire, came to support them. He helped the group to write their Constitutions.&lt;ref name=FC /&gt;

On September 8, 1833, the Haze sisters professed perpetual [[religious vows]], receiving the names Mother Marie Thérèse and Mother Aloysia in the [[Carmelite]] Church of Potay, next to their own convent. Two other companions, Sisters Clara and Constance, made their temporary vows for one year and two [[postulant]]s began their [[novitiate]]. Thus the Congregation of the Daughters of the Cross was established under a Rule of life based on [[Ignatian spirituality]].&lt;ref name=FC /&gt;

The Daughters of the Cross took over the administration of a women's prison in 1841 and a house for the rehabilitation of prostitutes the following year. In 1843 they opened a shelter for the homeless, which housed 125 residents.

The congregation was formally approved by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] on October 1, 1845, thereby raised to the status of a congregation of [[pontifical right]]. By that time the congregation had grown to 84 Sisters who operated 4 schools, with a total enrollment of about 1,000 girls. Of those girls, 80% were given a free education. Their Constitutions were approved by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1851.

===Expansion===
The Sisters began to serve in other countries with their establishing a foundation in Germany in 1849. At the invitation of the [[Vicar Apostolic]] of [[Bombay]], they opened schools in the [[British Raj]] in 1861. This led to their working in the United Kingdom in 1863.&lt;ref name=FC /&gt;

====United States &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecatholicconnection.org/?p=7757 |title=The Catholic Connection}}&lt;/ref&gt;====
In 1855, Auguste Martin, the Bishop of the Diocese of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]], held conversations with Mother Mary Hyacinth (1816 - 1897) of the Daughters of the Cross to ask for missionary workers in [[Louisiana]]. Her Order was interested in teaching in America. Permission was granted by the Bishop of France for ten nuns to undertake this task. On Oct. 19, 1855, the Daughters of the Cross arrived in Avoyelles Parish. In 1860, Rev. John Pierre invited them to [[Shreveport]] to found a school next door to [[Holy Trinity Catholic Church (Shreveport, Louisiana)]], which remained open until 1954. By 1870, the Order had opened six schools in North Louisiana. In totality, 21 schools in the state were established by the Order over the years, including St John Berchmans Catholic School in [[Shreveport]] in 1949. 

After the Civil War’s end in 1866, Pierre advised the Order about a parcel of land south of Shreveport that would be an excellent location for a girl’s boarding school. Mother Hyacinth then purchased 100 acres and a building. '''St. Vincent’s Academy''' opened in October, 1868, as a day and boarding school solely for girls. It was accredited to confer high school diplomas and college degrees, as well as to teach first through 12th grades.

The school's enrollment continued to rise until a devastating [[Yellow fever]] epidemic in 1873. Subsequent growth was mostly due to the efforts of Rev. Napoleon Joseph Roulleaux, who was chaplain of the convent and school. In 1906, a fire destroyed the school but the buildings were rebuilt with a gothic design from clay bricks on the same property. In September, 1962, the academy was transferred to a new site on Fairfield Avenue, where it remained until its closure due to economic struggles at the end of the 1987-88 session, culminating in 119 years of devoted service by the Daughters of the Cross. St. Vincent’s Academy declined to consider a merger at the time with [[Loyola College Prep]], which was a local all-male Catholic high school founded by the [[Jesuits]] in 1902.

Only a very small number of nuns from the Order remain in the Northern Louisiana community. They are retired and are no longer involved in the operations of any of the numerous remaining schools the Order founded in the region. The Order of the Daughters of the Cross, overall, now has a limited active presence in the United States, primarily restricted to ministries of caring for seniors, the sick, dying, and the homebound in [[Tracy, California]], which are organized and conducted under the auspices of the United Kingdom province. In 1958, four nuns from the Daughters of the Cross of England had come to Tracy to open St. Bernard's School. Over the years their ministry expanded to Angel's Camp, Lockford, Manteca, San Andreas, and Stockton. Today, the sisters work in Manteca, Stockton, and Tracy.

====United Kingdom====
Haze sent her Sisters to England in 1863. In the United Kingdom, the Daughters of the Cross are constituted as a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]]. In 2006–7 it had a gross income of £56,197,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1068661}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the 100 largest charities in the United Kingdom.

==Current status==
The congregation opened institutions in the [[Belgian Congo]] (1910), in Ireland (1920), in the Netherlands (1924), in Italy (1929) and in Brazil (1953). In 1975 the Sisters numbered about 1,500 members, serving in 113 institutions worldwide. By 2009 the membership had been reduced to 833 Sisters, a quarter of whom were [[Indian people|Indian]].

The General [[Motherhouse]] of the congregation was moved from Liège to England in 2012.

A '''family secret''' is a [[Secrecy|secret]] kept within a [[family]]. Most families have secrets, but the kind and importance vary. Family secrets can be shared by the whole family, by some family members or kept by an individual member of the family. The secret can relate to [[taboo]] topics, rule violations or just conventional secrets. Issues like [[homosexuality]], [[adultery]], [[infidelity]], [[divorce]], [[mental illness]]; [[crime]] such as [[rape]] or [[murder]]; [[Physical abuse|physical]] or [[psychological abuse]], [[child sexual abuse]]; [[sexual violence]] such as [[marital rape]] or [[pregnancy from rape]]; [[human sexual behavior]] like [[Legitimacy (family law)|premarital pregnancy]] or [[teenage pregnancy]]; [[substance abuse]] including [[alcoholism]]. More simple secrets may be personality conflicts, [[death]], [[religion]], [[academic]] performance and physical health problems.&lt;ref name="Fall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fall|first=Kevin A.|author2=Lyons, Christy|date=July 2003|title=Ethical Considerations of Family Secret Disclosure and Post-Session Safety Management|journal=[[The Family Journal]]|publisher=[[International Association of Marriage and Family Counselors]], [[SAGE Publications]]|volume=11|issue= 3|pages=281–285|issn=1066-4807|url=http://tfj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/3/281|accessdate=2008-10-30|doi=10.1177/1066480703252339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any topic that a family member thinks may cause anxiety may become a family secret.

A '''fistula''' is an abnormal [[anastomosis|connection]] between two hollow spaces (technically, two [[epithelium|epithelialized]] surfaces), such as [[blood vessel|blood vessels]], [[intestine]]s, or other hollow [[organ (biology)|organs]]. Fistulas are usually caused by injury or surgery, but they can also result from an infection or inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|002365|Fistula}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fistulas are generally a disease condition, but they may be surgically created for therapeutic reasons.

In [[botany]], the term is most common in its adjectival forms, where it is used in [[binomial names]] to refer to species that are distinguished by hollow or tubular structures.  [[Monarda fistulosa]], for example, has tubular flowers;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pick4.pick.uga.edu/nh/tx/Plantae/Dicotyledoneae/Lamiaceae/Monarda/fistulosa/Identification.html Identification of Monarda fistulosa] subpage of [http://pick4.pick.uga.edu/ Discover Life], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eutrochium fistulosum]] has a tubular stem; [[Allium fistulosum]] has hollow or tubular leaves, and ''Acacia seyal'' ssp. ''fistula'' is the subspecies with hollow spines.

==Types==

Various types of fistulas include:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Types
!Name
!Definition
|-
|{{Anchor|Blind fistula}} Blind
|with only one open end; blind fistulas may also be called sinus tracts
|-
|{{Anchor|Complete fistula}} Complete
|with both external and internal openings
|-
|{{Anchor|Incomplete fistula}} Incomplete
|a fistula with an external skin opening, which does not connect to any internal organ
|}

Although most fistulas are in forms of a tube, some can also have multiple branches.

==Causes==
Various causes of fistula include:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Causes
!Category
!Elaboration
|-
|Diseases
|Inflammatory bowel disease in the form of [[Crohn's disease]], but not [[ulcerative colitis]], are the leading causes of anorectal, enteroenteral, and enterocutaneous fistulas. A person with severe stage-3 [[hidradenitis suppurativa]] will also develop fistulas.
|-
|Medical treatment
|Complications from gallbladder surgery can lead to biliary fistula.  Radiation therapy can lead to vesicovaginal fistula. An arteriovenous fistula can be deliberately created, as described below in ''therapeutic use''.
|-
|Trauma
|Head trauma can lead to [[perilymph fistula]]s, whereas trauma to other parts of the body can cause arteriovenous fistulas. Obstructed labor can lead to vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulas. An [[obstetric fistula]] develops when blood supply to the tissues of the vagina and the bladder (and/or rectum) is cut off during prolonged obstructed labor. The tissues die and a hole forms through which urine and/or feces pass uncontrollably.  [[vesicovaginal fistula|Vesicovaginal]] and [[rectovaginal fistula]]s may also be caused by rape, in particular gang rape, and rape with foreign objects, as evidenced by the abnormally high number of women in conflict areas who have suffered fistulae.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2005/congo.asp Stephanie Nolen, "Not Women Anymore…" Ms. Magazine, Spring 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/news/news.cfm?ID=816 UNFPA: United Nations Population Fund. Press Release, 22 June 2006. "More Funding Needed to Help Victims of Sexual Violence"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, thousands of women in eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] presented themselves for treatment of traumatic fistula caused by systematic, violent gang rape that occurred during the country's five years of war. So many cases have been reported that the destruction of the vagina is considered a war injury and recorded by doctors as a crime of combat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14059-2003Oct24 Emily Wax, Washington Post Foreign Service. Saturday, October 25, 2003; Page A01 "A Brutal Legacy of Congo War"]&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

== Treatment ==

Treatment for fistula varies depending on the cause and extent of the fistula, but often involves surgical intervention combined with [[antibiotic]] therapy.  

Typically the first step in treating a fistula is an examination by a doctor to determine the extent and "path" that the fistula takes through the tissue. 

In some cases the fistula is temporarily covered, for example a fistula caused by [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]] is often treated with a [[palatal obturator]] to delay the need for surgery to a more appropriate age.

Surgery is often required to assure adequate drainage of the fistula (so that [[pus]] may escape without forming an [[abscess]]).  Various surgical procedures are commonly used, most commonly [[fistulotomy]], placement of a [[Seton stitch|seton]] (a cord that is passed through the path of the fistula to keep it open for draining), or an endorectal flap procedure (where healthy tissue is pulled over the internal side of the fistula to keep feces or other material from reinfecting the channel). Treatment involves filling the fistula with fibrin glue; also plugging it with plugs made of porcine small intestine submucosa have also been explored in recent years, with variable success. Surgery for anorectal fistulae is not without side effects, including recurrence, reinfection, and incontinence. High rate of recurrence and more chances of complications like incontinence are always there in fistula surgeries (Anal Fistula).

It is important to note that surgical treatment of a fistula without diagnosis or management of the underlying condition, if any, is not recommended.  For example, surgical treatment of fistulae in [[Crohn's disease]] can be effective, but if the Crohn's disease itself is not treated, the rate of recurrence of fistula is very high (well above 50%).

== Therapeutic use ==

In people with renal failure, requiring dialysis, a [[cimino fistula]] is often deliberately created in the arm by means of a short day surgery in order to permit easier withdrawal of blood for [[hemodialysis]].

As a radical treatment for [[portal hypertension]], surgical creation of a portacaval fistula produces an anastomosis between the [[hepatic portal vein]] and the [[inferior vena cava]] across the omental foramen (of Winslow).  This spares the portal venous system from high pressure which can cause esophageal varices, [[caput medusa]]e, and hemorrhoids.

==Etymology==
The [[Latin]] word fistula (plural ''fistulas'' or ''fistulae'' {{IPAc-en|-|l|i|,_|-|l|ai}}) literally means [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]] or [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]].

In [[statistics]], a '''floor effect''' (also known as a '''basement effect''') arises when a data-gathering instrument has a lower limit to the data values it can reliably specify. This lower limit is known as the "floor".

Floor effects are occasionally encountered in [[psychological testing]], when a test designed to estimate some psychological trait has a minimum standard score that may not distinguish some test-takers who differ in their responses on the test item content. Giving preschool children an [[IQ]] test designed for adults would likely show many of the test-takers with scores near the lowest standard score for adult test-takers (IQ 40 on most tests that were currently normed as of 2010). To indicate differences in current intellectual functioning among young children, IQ tests specifically for young children are developed, on which many test-takers can score well above the floor score. An IQ test designed to help assess [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] persons might intentionally be designed with easier item content and a lower floor score to better distinguish among individuals taking the test as part of an assessment process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">The '''Health Threat Unit''' of the [[Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection]] ([[European Commission]]), is responsible for terrorism surveillance and early warning of [[Bioterrorism|biological]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]], and [[Nuclear terrorism|radiological threats]] within the [[European Union]]. The Health Threat Unit runs the ''Rapid Alert System'', which conducts surveillance on communicable diseases and diseases caused by acts of [[bioterrorism]]. The surveillance data are coordinated and evaluated by the ''Health Emergency Operations Facility''. Health threat information and warnings are sent to the member states by the Communication and Crisis Center (''BICHAT'') and the Security Office in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].

==Criteria for notification==
The BICHAT sends a warning to the EU member states, within one hour of receiving a warning, when there is:
* Suspicion of danger
* Internationally relevant events; need for a complex response
* Need for coordination (investigative and control actions)
* Suspicion of deliberate action of a terrorist organization
* Risk of trans-frontier spread of the agent/event
* Need for assistance from other countries

==Other responsibilities==
Besides bioterrorism, the Health Threat Unit also has responsibility for other reportable diseases:
* Diseases preventable by vaccination
* [[Sexually transmitted disease]]s
* [[Viral hepatitis]]
* [[food-borne disease|Food]]- and [[water-borne disease]]s and diseases of environmental origin
* [[Air-borne disease]]s
* [[Zoonotic disease]]s
* Diseases transmitted by non-conventional agents
* Serious imported diseases
* Special Health Issues ([[nosocomial infection]]s; [[antimicrobial resistance]])

==Working groups==
Within the Health Threat Unit, there are seven working groups responsible for various aspects of bio-defense:
* Preparedness and response planning
* Chemical threats
* Prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine
* Incident investigation and sampling
* Medicinal products
* Co-operation between laboratories
* Risk communication

Health in [[Guatemala]] is focused on many different systems of prevention and care. Guatemala’s Constitution states that every citizen has the universal right to health care.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|v}} However, this right has been hard to guarantee due to limited government resources and other problems regarding access. The health care system in place today developed out of the Civil War in Guatemala. The Civil War prevented social reforms from occurring, especially in the sector of health care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Health Care System ==
Today, there have been many reforms to the health care system, but the current system continues to have significant problems.  The country is on its way to develop a solid health care system, and is working toward achieving many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in place.&lt;ref name="Pena1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Pena|first1 = Christine|title = Improving Access to Health Care Services through the Expansion of Coverage Program (PEC): The Case of Guatemala|journal = UNICO Studies Series|date = 2013|issue = 19|page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|v}} However, the inequalities that are associated with outcomes and access have not been addressed, making it difficult for Guatemala to move forward in the field of health care.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  The ratio of doctors to residents is low, at .9 doctors per 1,000 citizens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The system requires a lot of change in order to serve the whole Guatemalan community.

=== History ===
When the Civil War broke out in Guatemala, social improvements in health care were brought to a halt. The period of the 34-year Civil War (from 1954-mid 1980s) resulted in many changes within the health sector.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sickness and Wealth: The Corporate Assault on Global Health|last = Fort|first = Meredith|publisher = South End Press|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Cambridge, MS|pages = |chapter = The failures of neoliberalism: Health sector reform in Guatemala|last2 = Verduga|first2 = Juan Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59}} The focus on health care was generally abandoned throughout the period of war when the country experienced a period of "privatization through attrition,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|59}} which generated poor service and low health care coverage for decades to follow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|59}} As Verduga mentions, the total [[GDP]] expenditures on health was only about 1 to 2 percent during this period of war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|59}} Therefore, it was the emergence of [[NGOs]] and other community organizations that allowed for basic health care to be provided to the general population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|59}}

Once the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] ended in 1996 with the signing of the Peace Accords,&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt; health care was placed in the hands of a new democratic government. Immediately after the war, Guatemala saw little change in the healthcare sector.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Healthcare in Guatemala|last = Dunn|first = Rebecca|date = 2010|journal = General University Honors|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} However, starting in 1999, the health care system was improved with increased government spending and aid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Although this was a drastic improvement from the times of war, the system was still insufficient and did not come close to meeting all of the needs of the Guatemalan people.

=== Structure and Coverage ===
Today, the Guatemalan health care system is split into three separate divisions: the public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit sectors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|7}} Within the public sector, there is the [http://www.mspas.gob.gt/ Ministry of Health and Social Security (MOH)], the [http://www.igssgt.org/ Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS)], and the Military Health Service.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The health system of Guatemala|last = Becerril-Montekio|first = Victor|date = 2011|journal = Salud Pública de México|doi = |pmid = 21877085|access-date = |last2 = López-Dávila|first2 = Luis|issue = 2|volume = 53 |pages=s197-208}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sector of the health care system formally covers about 88% of the population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The private sector, which accounts for about 12% of the population, includes many for-profit providers, non-profit entities, and traditional local providers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/countryfocus/cooperation_strategy/ccsbrief_gtm_en.pdf|title = Guatemala|date = May 1, 2014|accessdate = |website = World Health Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The public sector works to provide care through hospitals, health facilities, and various health centers, whereas the private sector allocates resources within private offices, clinics, and hospitals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Very few funds are allocated to health care within Guatemala. As a share of GDP, health care spending in Guatemala is one of the lowest in [[Central America]] (2.6 percent).&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|3}} The GDP expenditure shows that few funds are allocated to the health care system in Guatemala. In total, the Guatemalan government's expenditures on health were about $196 US dollars in 2010.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|3}} This amount was significantly less than the total Central American average ($350) and the average [[Latin America]]n and the [[List of Caribbean islands|Caribbean]] (LAC) expenditures ($672).&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|3}} The health care system requires more funds to improve the coverage and overall health care system in Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

The Peace Accords, which were signed in 1996, called for a change in health provision goals. In 1997, the MOH established a program called the Expansion of Coverage Program (PEC), which worked to improve the availability of health and [[nutrition]] services to young children and women in rural areas of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|v}} As Pena explains, current MOH services do not cover the poor, rural population of Guatemala, making the PEC critical to the rural population.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|v}} Ever since its creation, the PEC has expanded immensely, now covering about 54% of the health and nutrition needs of rural Guatemalans.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|v}} The coverage program works with NGOs in the area to promote good health and nutrition to populations who lack sufficient health care.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|11}} However, important accountability systems regarding transparency and progress were not installed, limiting the program's effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/book/10.1596/978-0-8213-6278-5|title=Health System Innovations in Central America: World Bank Working Papers|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=9–48|language=en|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6278-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The services covered by the PEC include care for women and infants, illnesses and emergency care, and environmental care.&lt;ref name="Pena1" /&gt;{{rp|12}}

There is also an informal sector of healthcare that is often overlooked. Termed the "Maya Mobile Clinic" or the "Other Public Health", traveling salespeople (often men) are a medical resource for Guatemalans living in [[Guatemalan Highlands|the highlands]].&lt;ref name="mayamobile"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=T. S.|date=2011-03-01|title=Maya Mobile Medicine in Guatemala: The "Other" Public Health|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1387.2010.01135.x/abstract|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=47–69|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1387.2010.01135.x|issn=1548-1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; These salespeople offer raw and natural ingredients to mainly indigenous populations and give talks about their health qualities.&lt;ref name="mayamobile" /&gt; Maya Mobile Clinics act as a midpoint between the physical distance of the Guatemalan highlands and public clinic locations, and as a midpoint between the cultural gap that separates Maya medicinal norms and values from Guatemala's public health sector's medicinal norms and values.&lt;ref name="mayamobile" /&gt;

== Conditions ==
There are many [[communicable diseases]] and conditions that threaten the livelihood of the Guatemalan people on a day-to-day basis. [[Infectious diseases]] are still the number one cause of death for people in [[developing countries]], whereas in the developed world, infectious diseases are no longer a significant problem.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, in Guatemala, parasites, [[diabetes]], and [[malnutrition]] are huge health problems. Diabetes threatens development in many rural Mayan communities within Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Little|first1 = Matthew|title = Type 2 Diabetes in Rural Guatemala: Disease Perceptions, Service-Provision Difficulties and Management Techniques|journal = Undercurrent Journal|date = 2012|volume = 9|issue = 1|page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} In order to attack this problem head-on, “health service efforts must be culturally appropriate and emphasize awareness, prevention, early detection, and universal treatment”.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;{{rp|24}} Also, malnutrition remains a huge problem among children and adults in Guatemala. Given the prevalence of poverty, many residents have limited access to quality nutrition, limited education, and higher rates of disease.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Even though there have been improvements, Guatemala is still characterized by high infant and maternal [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate]]s, pervasive malnutrition, and high [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidences]] of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;"Poverty in Guatemala: Guatemala poverty assessment.

Washington, DC: World Bank. p. 64 http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1995/04/697460/guatemala-assessment-poverty&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Guatemala, the [[prevalence]] of Type 2 diabetes and obesity has risen.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;

=== Communicable Diseases ===
In Guatemala, communicable diseases for which treatment exists are still one of the major causes of death. Wealthy, more industrialized developed nations have been able to eliminate communicable diseases due to an [[epidemiological transition]], in which death rates due to degenerative diseases have surpassed those of communicable and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The epidemiological transition: the current status of infectious diseases in the developed world versus the developing world|last = Sanders|first = John W.|date = 2008|journal = Science Progress|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Fuhrer|first2 = Greg S.|issue = 1|volume = 91|last3 = Johnson|first3 = Mark D.|last4 = Riddle|first4 = Mark S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite is apparent in Guatemala. The high mortality rate for infants is a direct result of communicable and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Health and poverty in Guatemala|last = Gragnolati|first = Michele|date = 2003|journal = World Bank Policy Research Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Marini|first2 = Alessandra|volume = 2966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the epidemiological profile of Guatemala shows that some of the most prevalent infectious diseases, like [[diarrhea]] and [[Acute respiratory failure|acute respiratory infections]], are a direct result of poverty.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In Guatemala, 56 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|31}} Poverty levels are greatest in the indigenous communities of Guatemala, which account for about 81 percent of those living in poverty, and make up about 43 percent of Guatemala's total population.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|32}} High levels of poverty make the population more vulnerable to communicable diseases, which is why government funding of health care is necessary for the rural areas of Guatemala.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|32}}

Even though Guatemala has improved its health care system substantially since the end of the Guatemalan Civil War, mortality rates for communicable diseases still show that considerable progress needs to be made  to remove the burden of infectious diseases on the population. In a country like Guatemala, water is poor and frequently contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/guatemala|title = Health Information for Travelers to Guatemala: Traveler View|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to decrease common communicable diseases like diarrhea, [[tuberculosis]], [[pneumonia]], and respiratory disease, clean water and sanitation are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/guatemala/|title = CDC in Guatemala|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the health care system's provision of both clean water and food, the incidence of infectious and communicable diseases will decrease.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== [[Human parasite|Parasites]] ===
Parasites present one of the biggest threats to health in Guatemala. Many of the common parasites in developing countries like Guatemala are spread through contamination of both water and food.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Retrospective Analysis of Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Parasites among School Children in the Palajunoj Valley of Guatemala|last = Cook|first = David M.|date = 2015|journal = Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition|doi = 10.3329/jhpn.v27i1.3321|pmid = 19248646|last2 = Swanson|first2 = Chad R.|issue = 1|volume = 27|last3 = Eggett|first3 = Dennis L.|last4 = Booth|first4 = Gary M. |pages=31–40 |pmc=2761809}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}} Some of the effects of parasites include intestinal obstructions, which can hinder the body from absorbing nutrients, lead to a loss of appetite, impair long term growth, induce [[Vomiting reflex|vomiting]], cause [[anemia]] and [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], and in severe cases, cause death.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Symptoms can also include intense abdominal pain, loss of appetite, [[nausea]], diarrhea, and fever.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|32}}

[[File:Entamoeba histolytica.jpg|thumb|''[[Entamoeba histolytica|E. histolytica]]'', a parasite that is very common among children in Guatemala&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Retrospective Analysis of Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Parasites among School Children in the Palajunoj Valley of Guatemala|last = Cook|first = David M.|date = 2015|journal = Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition|doi = 10.3329/jhpn.v27i1.3321|pmid = 19248646|last2 = Swanson|first2 = Chad R.|issue = 1|volume = 27|last4 = Booth|first3 = Dennis L.|last3 = Eggett|first4 = Gary M. |pages=31–40 |pmc=2761809}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

It has been seen that the prevalence of parasites is significantly higher among younger children and those who are [[Malnutrition|malnourished]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Parasites are usually transferred through contaminated water, making them dangerous because they are able to induce malnutrition by consuming the body's nutrients, thus impeding a child's physical development.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Drawing the connection between Malnutrition and lack of safe drinking water in Guatemala|last = Braghetta|first = Anne|date = 2006|journal = Journal (American Water Works Association)|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 5|volume = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97}} For school children who are infected with parasites, cognitive functioning can drastically decrease, directly impacting their education.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries|last = Bundy|first = D|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = Washington DC|chapter = 58|work = School-based Health and Nutrition Programs|editor-last = Jamison|editor-first = DT|edition=2nd|pmid = 21250357}}&lt;/ref&gt; School children who have been treated for parasites immediately perform significantly better in school settings. Parasite infections can also vary based on access to clean water and whether or not sewage disposal is present.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|38}} The Millennium Development Goals discussed the importance of deworming to help meet the goals set by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/68876/1/WHO_CDS_CPE_PVC_2005.12.pdf|title = The Millennium Development Goals - The evidence is in: deworming helps meet the Millennium Development Goals|date = 2005|accessdate = |website = World Health Organization|publisher = WHO|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parasites can have serious long-term consequences in that they directly affect development and health for decades after. However, inexpensive, single-dose medications exist that can fully treat these parasitic infections.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Diabetes ===
Diabetes is a significant problem within the Guatemalan population. As a rising public health concern, diabetes largely threatens the indigenous population of Guatemala.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Determining adult type 2 diabetes-related health care in an indigenous population from rural Guatemala: a mixed-methods preliminary study|last = Chary|first = Anita|date = 2012|journal = BMC Health Services Research|doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-12-476|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Greiner|first2 = Miranda|last3 = Bowers|first4 = Peter|first3 = Cody|last4 = Rohloff|issue = 1|volume = 12 |pages=476}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because this population frequently has limited access to the Guatemalan health care system, knowledge about the emergence of diabetes is also incredibly limited.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Indigenous areas are particularly under-resourced with respect to doctors and overall health care programs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

A risk factor for diabetes within the indigenous population is dietary change over time.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;{{rp|25}} Changes in indigenous diets were a result of structural and economic changes, which forced the rural population to resort to energy-dense foods that are extremely high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;{{rp|25}} These simple carbohydrates can be found throughout Guatemalan cuisine, especially corn, which is one of the staple foods of the Guatemalan diet. This in turn leads to the higher prevalence of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 diabetes]], because the entire population has added more fats and sugars into their diets.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

A large issue for the indigenous population and the greater Guatemalan population in general is access to medication.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;{{rp|29}} Medication used to treat diabetes is very expensive and would require the Guatemalan government to devote significant resources to provide medication for every diabetic.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;{{rp|29}} However, diabetes is a manageable disease, and can also be treated with frequent physical activity and a change in diet, focused on management and healthy choices.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt;{{rp|29}}

=== Pesticide Poisoning ===
Due to farming conditions and yield pressures in Guatemala, many agricultural workers are at high risk of [[pesticide poisoning]].&lt;ref name="pesticide"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Bruce|date=January 1995|title=COMMENTARY: PLANTS, PESTICIDES  AND PRODUCTION IN GUATEMALA;  NUTRITION, HEALTH AND  NONTRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE|url=|journal=Ecology of Food and Nutrition|volume=33|pages=293–309|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People often handle pesticides without protective clothing or gear, soaking it in through their skin and inhaling it into their lungs.&lt;ref name="pesticide" /&gt; A large [[black market]] and lack of oversight over legal pesticide use in Guatemala also contributes to its rampant and unsafe use.&lt;ref name="pesticide" /&gt; Pesticide poisoning most likely disproportionately affects indigenous farm workers.&lt;ref name="pesticide" /&gt;

== Mayan Health ==
One aspect of the Guatemalan health care system is its focus on Mayan health. Because the Mayan population is so prevalent in  Guatemala, it is necessary to consider their barriers to quality health care. Taking into account the language barriers, diet, and living conditions, the Mayan population suffers enormously when it comes to proper health care. The life expectancy for Mayans can be up to 10 or 15 years lower than other Guatemalans.&lt;ref name="Minkowski"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=William L.|title=Mayan Indian health in Guatemala|journal=Western Journal of Medicine|date=1988|volume=148|issue=4|page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Civil War, the Mayan population generally resides in poverty stricken areas, and therefore has limited access to the healthcare that is available to the Ladinos, or non-indigenous population.&lt;ref name="Bhatt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhatt|first1=Sunil|title=Health Care Issues Facing the Maya People of the Guatemalan Highlands: The Current State of Care and Recommendations for Improvement|journal=Journal of Global Health Perspectives|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indian Corn Maize Zea mays 3008px.jpg|thumb|320x213px|Variations of maize that are a staple food in the Mayan diet]]

=== Medical Pluralism ===

Indigenous Guatemalan communities deal with [[Medical Pluralism|medical pluralism]], or the intersection of beliefs and uses regarding traditional and biomedical healthcare.&lt;ref name="pluralism"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/85622920|title=Health care in Maya Guatemala: confronting medical pluralism in a developing country|last=Randolph.|first=Adams, Walter|date=2007|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|others=Hawkins, John Palmer, 1946-|isbn=9780806138596|location=Norman|oclc=85622920}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} Traditional Maya medical care involves plant medicine and ethnomedical practitioners who learn in one-on-one or self-taught settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/657141480|title=Maya medicine: traditional healing in Yucatan|last=1958-|first=Kunow, Marianna Appel,|date=2003|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0826328644|edition= 1st|location=Albuquerque|oclc=657141480}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} Western medical systems and the Guatemalan public health system have been criticized for not considering ethnomedical practices to be legitimate, and interest among indigenous Guatemalans in taking on ethnomedical apprenticeships has been declining, resulting in tension between practices.&lt;ref name="pluralism"/&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Language and Diet ===
In Guatemala, about 45% of the Ladino population lives in poverty, while about 91% of the indigenous population succumbs to extreme poverty levels.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Barrier to access to health services in the indigenous population in Rabinal, Guatemala|last = Hautecoeur|first = Maeve|date = 2007|journal = Salud Pública de México|doi = 10.1590/s0036-36342007000200003|pmid = 17522734|access-date = |last2 = Zunzunegui|first2 = Maria Victoria|issue = 2|volume = 49|last3 = Vissandjee|first3 = Bilkis |pages=86–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large difference appears in other aspects of life as well, like family planning, susceptibility to disease, education level, and access to health care. Such inequalities can largely be attributed to a large language barrier between the indigenous population and the non-indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Generally, the indigenous people of Guatemala speak only a variety of local Mayan languages.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; In relation to health care, these language barriers can be significant. Most of the medical professionals that serve the indigenous communities are Ladino, and speak Spanish only.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Communicating health related issues to a patient under these conditions becomes an obstacle, which in turn causes indigenous people to avoid health care centers altogether. The indigenous population is unable to communicate with the doctors directly, which is both difficult and embarrassing.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Ishida et al. discovered that the combination of poverty and language barriers made indigenous women less likely to seek services from health care providers.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

The Mayan diet is different from the diet of non-indigenous Guatemalans. Throughout their history, the Maya have used [[maize]] as a principal crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Intensive Agriculture, Social Status, and Maya Diet at Pacbitun, Belize|last = White|first = Christine D.|date = 1993|journal = Journal of Anthropological Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Healy|first2 = Paul F.|issue = 4|volume = 49|last3 = Schawrez|first3 = Henry P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|353}} Staple foods of the Mayan diet today are corn and [[bean]]s.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mayan Indian health in Guatemala|last = Minkowski|first = William L.|date = 1988|journal = Western Journal of Medicine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 2|volume = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|476}} The better [[cash crop]]s like greens, tomatoes, fruits, eggs, and poultry are mainly sold to Ladinos and are not purchased by Mayans.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;{{rp|476}} Therefore, Mayan nutrition is very poor because it includes little besides [[starch]]es and protein. Corn has a significant amount of [[carbohydrate]]s, which in turn increases blood sugar levels. This increase in blood sugar makes diabetes a very common disease within the Mayan population.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Also, with this lack of crucial nutrients, malnutrition is very prominent in the indigenous population.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;{{rp|476}}

=== Living Conditions ===
The Mayan people frequently live in rural villages of Guatemala, which are generally known to be impoverished areas. About 80% of indigenous Guatemalans live below the "international poverty line."&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Electrifying rural Guatemala: central policy and rural reality|last = Taylor|first = Matthew J.|date = 2005|journal = Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|doi = 10.1068/c14r|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 23 |pages=173–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|173}} Very few Mayan families have the economic stability to devote money towards health care.&lt;ref name="Bhatt" /&gt; With the high prices of medications and the poor quality of health posts, impoverished patients refuse to use or trust the westernized health care system.&lt;ref name="Bhatt" /&gt; For centuries, the relationship between the Ladinos and the Mayans has been antagonistic. Throughout the period of the Guatemalan Civil War, Mayans were excluded from land and water resources as well as educational, health care, political, and economic resources.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;{{rp|176}}&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Who's Judging the Quality of Care? Indigenous Maya and the Problem of "Not Being Attended"|last = Berry|first = Nicole S.|date = 2008|journal = Medical Anthropology: Cross-Cultural Studies in Health and Illness|doi = 10.1080/01459740802017413|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 2|volume = 27 |pages=164–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} Even in today's modern age, the effects of exclusion and deprivation from the war are still felt my many indigenous Mayans.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;{{rp|181}} This directly affects health care because the Mayan population does trust Western medicine and hospitals. Similarly, the Ladino doctors that work in the health field make the indigenous people feel powerless and guarded instead of supported.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;{{rp|181}}

Many indigenous Guatemalans survive on below-subsistence agriculture.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;{{rp|174}} Farms are not large enough to sustain large-scale [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]], making the overall yield exceptionally low.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;{{rp|174}} Because of the limited amount of farmland, its unequal distribution, and the growing population, poverty continues to ravish the Mayan civilizations.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;{{rp|174}} The concrete living distance also plays a role in health care accessibility for indigenous population.&lt;ref name="Bhatt" /&gt; More than likely, these rural villages where the Mayans reside are located close to an hour walk away from any health clinic or post.&lt;ref name="Bhatt" /&gt; The inaccessibility of the clinics leads to fewer visits and more health complications in the indigenous population.

Government run hospitals are located in the main cities of several provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ketelhöhn|first=Niels|last2=Arévalo|first2=Rodrigo|title=The Guatemalan public hospital system|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0148296316301175|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=69|issue=9|pages=3900–3904|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous peoples' [[Guatemalan Highlands|highland]] locality - often distant from main cities - makes travel to these hospitals expensive, further limiting access.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Taking advantage of the importance of [[Midwifery in Maya society|midwifery]] in many indigenous traditional medicinal systems, the Ministry of Public Health decided to better reach indigenous populations through midwife training programs in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the quality, efficacy, and cultural sensitivity of these programs has been brought into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Linda|title=Midwife training programs in highland Guatemala|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0277953682902908|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=16|issue=18|pages=1599–1609|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(82)90290-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children and [[Women's Health]] ==
For women and children, the health discrepancies are very visible. In children, [[infant mortality]] and malnutrition are rampant. Severe health and nutritional deficiencies are associated with deaths of children under the age of 5.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|147}} Similarly, physical and mental development can be severely impacted by malnutrition in children.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Freeman|first1 = H.E.|title = Nutrition and cognitive development among rural Guatemalan children|journal = American Journal of Public Health|date = 1980|volume = 70|issue = 12|pages =1277–1285|doi=10.2105/ajph.70.12.1277|pmc = 1619650}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1277}} On the other hand, women’s health focuses on preventable deaths  related to [[pregnancy]], delivery, and post-pregnancy complications. Most of the time, services that are provided for contraceptive health do not reach the at-risk population.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|147}} At-risk women and infants frequently die because of their limited access to quality health care, as well as their perilous living conditions.&lt;ref name="Mendez"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franco de Mendez|first1=Nancy|title=Maternal mortality in Guatemala|journal=Population Reference Bureau|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs have been implemented to try and incorporate all levels of [[reproductive health]] in order to improve care for these populations.&lt;ref name="Mendez" /&gt;

=== Infants ===
In Guatemala, [[infant mortality]] continues to be a big problem. As of 2015, it is estimated that Guatemala's infant mortality rate is 22.73 for every 1,000 live births.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html|title = Country Comparison: Infant Mortality Rate|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = Central Intelligence Agency: The World Factbook|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned, rural areas of Guatemala exhibit the highest levels of morbidity and infant mortality because health care in those areas is largely inaccessible.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Effect of Health and Nutrition Interventions on Infant and Child Morality in Rural Guatemala|last = Delgado|first = H.L.|date = 1986|journal = Determinants of Morality and Change and Differentials in Developing Countries|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Valverde|first2 = V.|last3 = Hurtado|first3 = E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}} Generally, infant mortality rates are used as an indicator of general health levels in a particular country.

Infants are more susceptible to infectious diseases and conditions like [[malaria]], which can cause severe morbidity, and even death.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For infants, physical growth is critical to proper and successful development. Therefore, if there are insufficient nutrients being provided to the infant during this period of growth and [[Cell growth|cell proliferation]], the number of neurons will be permanently reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Relationship between Physical Growth and Infant Behavioral Development in Rural Guatemala|last = Lasky|first = Robert E.|date = 1981|journal = Child Development|doi = 10.2307/1129234|pmid = 7238146|access-date = |last2 = Klein|first2 = Robert E.|issue = 1|volume = 52|last3 = Yarbrough|first3 = Charles|last4 = Engle|first4 = Patricia L.|last5 = Lechtig|first5 = Aaron|last6 = Martorell|first6 = Reynaldo |pages=219–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220}} In Guatemala, this issue is particularly prominent. Nutrition and proper health care is crucial in early infant development in order to insure that these infants will thrive and grow into strong children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Infant mortality rates before, during, and after a nutrition and health intervention in rural Guatemalan villages|last = Donald|first = Rose|date = 1992|journal = Food and Nutrition Bulletin|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Martorell|first2 = Reynaldo|issue = 3|volume = 14|last3 = Rivera|first3 = Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the nutritional deficiencies, infectious diseases, and parasitic diseases directly lead to higher mortality rates for children under the age of 5 in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|147}} These higher mortality rates are prominent in both rural and urban areas of Guatemala when diseases are present. However, these rates are significantly higher in rural areas where limited access to health care, high levels of [[illiteracy]], poor sanitation, and nutritional deficiencies are factored into the rate.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|145}}

=== [[Malnutrition]] in Children ===
Malnutrition is a serious condition that threatens the health and [[well-being]] of many people in developing nations. In Guatemala, nutritional deficiencies have been shown to severely impact the growth and development of children both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;{{rp|1277}} [[Stunted growth|Stunting]] and [[underweight]] are both common physical indicators for acute and chronic malnutrition in children.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to Gragnolati and Marini, over 44 percent of the Guatemalan child population is chronically malnourished.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Malnutrition and Poverty in Guatemala|last = Marini|first = Alessandra|date = 2003|journal = Policy Research Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Gragnolati|first2 = Michele|volume = 2967}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} However, these numbers are even higher for indigenous populations of Guatemala (58 percent) in comparison to the non-indigenous population.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Although the incidence rate of stunting has decreased in Guatemala, the rate of decline is minuscule compared to other countries in the LAC region.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;{{rp|97}}

The high incidence of malnutrition within indigenous populations is a direct result of poor water sanitation and limited access to clean water.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;{{rp|97}} According to the MOH, about 98% of the water sources in Guatemala are contaminated.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;{{rp|97}} Disease and malnutrition are highly correlated with one another; both are causes and consequences of each other.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{rp|3}}  In order to improve the health system and reduce the prevalence of malnutrition, easy availability of safe drinking water, together with disease treatment and prevention, are critical for the survival of Guatemalan children.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;{{rp|98}} Improvement must be implemented at the community level, by renovating infrastructures in order to provide piped water and sanitary operations for the residents.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

One consequence of malnutrition and undernourishment is the degradation of cognitive performance, which can be studied and observed through schoolchildren and their performance in an educational setting.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; This can generally be observed in poorer settings. In poverty stricken areas of Guatemala, inadequate nutrient intake can lead to higher disease rates, which can in turn expedite the [[Cycle of poverty|poverty cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Risk analysis of poor health and growth failure of children in the central highlands of Guatemala|last = Immink|first = Maarten D.C.|date = 1999|journal = Social Science and Medicine|doi = 10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00383-9|pmid = 10390040|access-date = |last2 = Payongayong|first2 = Ellen|issue = 8|volume = 48 |pages=997–1009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|998}} [[Breastfeeding]] is also critical for infants to obtain sufficient nutrients and antibodies.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Malnutrition severely weakens children who are already weaker to begin with, making them more vulnerable to life-threatening illnesses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|18}} Similarly, civil conflict (from the Guatemalan Civil War period) has left the indigenous population with many barriers to combat malnutrition, which has only prevented positive outcomes of health within the population through social, political, and economic exclusion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

[[File:Lake Atitlán is one of the major sources of water in Guatemala.JPG|thumb|center|800x217px|An image of [[Lake Atitlán]], which is a major water source in Guatemala]]

=== Reproductive Health ===
Reproductive health focuses on the health of infants as well as mothers. Guatemala is only beginning their transition into a more health-centered nation. The overall Guatemalan population is very young, which not only affects infant mortality rates, but significantly impacts both reproductive age and fertility rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|2}} In Guatemala, the fertility rate is almost 5 children per mother, the highest in all of Latin America.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

When the reproductive age is young, there can be many catastrophic effects. The maternal mortality rate for younger mothers is much higher.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Guatemala is the country with the highest rate of maternal death related to pregnancy and delivery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|23}} This high rate is the result of many different factors, but mainly, it is a consequence of the scarcity of health care services, increased prevalence of illnesses, and the marginalization of women.&lt;ref name="Mendez" /&gt; Similarly, with a younger reproductive age, the chances of young mothers acquiring illnesses and transferring contaminants to their infants is very high.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

[[Maternal health]] problems affect women throughout Guatemala, but are significantly more prevalent in poorer, more rural areas.&lt;ref name="Mendez" /&gt; Indigenous women frequently have unsafe living conditions, which makes them more susceptible to health related problems. This population has the highest fertility rates in Guatemala, as well as a significantly higher maternal mortality rate than the non-indigenous population.&lt;ref name="Mendez" /&gt; Very few births are attended by either doctors or nurses, making the indigenous population much more prone to complications related to pregnancy, delivery, or postpartum.&lt;ref name="Mendez" /&gt;

In Guatemala, knowledge and education about [[Birth control|contraceptives]] and family planning is incredibly low, especially within the indigenous population.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Guatemalan Health Care System Fails Women|last = Darabi|first = Leila|date = 2006|journal = Guttmacher Institute|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; More education about the implications of reproduction can reduce population growth while simultaneously improving both maternal and infant health.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|62}} Since the end of the Civil War, the indigenous population of Guatemala had turned to  traditional practices for maternal deliveries because this group distrusted modern health care facilities and services provided by non-indigenous personnel.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ethnic Inequality in Guatemalan Women’s Use of Modern Reproductive Health Care|last = Ishida|first = Kanako|date = 2012|journal = International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|doi = 10.1363/3809912|pmid = 22832150|access-date = |last2 = Stupp|first2 = Paul|issue = 2|volume = 38|first5 = Evelyn|first3 = Reina|last3 = Turcios-Ruiz|last4 = William|first4 = Daniel B.|last5 = Espinoza|pages=99–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is very little knowledge about health care services related to pregnancy and abortions.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Induced Abortion and Unintended Pregnancy in Guatemala|last = Singh|first = Susheela|date = 2006|journal = Guttmacher Institute|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Prada|first2 = Elena|last3 = Kestler|first3 = Edgar|issue = 3|volume = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abortion]]s are illegal in Guatemala, and are only permitted if it will save the mother's life.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Guatemalan government is working to address maternal mortality by increasing public spending on health care to gain a greater understanding of "comprehensive reproductive health."&lt;ref name="Mendez" /&gt;

=== [[Family planning|Family Planning]] ===
Typically, in Guatemala, the general population is poor and has little access to quality health care services. The indigenous population and the Ladinos generally use traditional and formal health practices respectively.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Prenatal and delivery care and childhood immunization in Guatemala: Do family and community matter?|last = Pebley|first = Anne R.|date = 1996|journal = Demography|doi = 10.2307/2061874|pmid = 8827167|access-date = |last2 = Goldman|first2 = Noreen|issue = 2|volume = 33|last3 = Rodriguez|first3 = German |pages=231–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|231}} In both of these practices, family planning is very different. Differences in economic and social influences determine contraceptive use, child immunizations, prenatal care, and childbirth or delivery.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;{{rp|231}}

For the two populations within Guatemala, there are many large disparities between family planning actions. Family planning services are as scarce as health care services in the rural areas of Guatemala.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;{{rp|144}} Indigenous people in Guatemala are more likely to have little to no education and are often living in poverty.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Family Planning Among Indigenous Populations in Latin America|last = Terbough|first = Anne|date = 1995|journal = International Family Planning Perspectives|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Rosen|first2 = James E.|last3 = Galvez|last5 = Bertrand|first3 = Roberto Santiso|last4 = Terceros|first4 = Willy|first5 = Jane T.|last6 = Bull|first6 = Sheana E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} High poverty and illiteracy rates directly correlate with lower rates of contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;{{rp|144}} This lower rate is both a result of limited contraceptive knowledge and also the negative social stigma behind contraceptives.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;{{rp|144}} Guatemala's high fertility rate is a result of poor family planning initiatives, which result in young pregnancies, large families with many children, shorter birth intervals, and deficient growth within children.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Similarly, breastfeeding plays a huge role in family planning, both as a nutrient and antibody source for infants, as well as a way to inhibit immediate fertility (because of the absence of menstruation) and allow for greater birth spacing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

Family decisions about health care depend on many factors. Specific family dynamics, individual beliefs and decisions of the mother, and direct community influences are all aspects to take into consideration when looking at family choices.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;{{rp|233}} The Guatemalan government has worked to implement family education centers within its poorer populations. A family life education class provides information pertaining to [[sex education]], as well as reproductive health.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== [[Education]] ==

{{main|Education in Guatemala}}

Education is an aspect of health that is generally ignored by the Guatemalan health care system. Proper education on nutrition and contraceptives has proven to impact both education levels and survival. In children, proper nutrition has been shown to accelerate development, both mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="Behrman1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Behrman|first1 = John A.|title = The Impact of Nutrition during Early Childhood on Education among Guatemalan Adults|journal = PIER Working Paper|date = 2009|volume = 26|issue = 6|page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Also, there is a large association between maternal education and a lower mortality rate of infants as well as healthier habits while pregnant.&lt;ref name="Cleland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Cleland|first1 = John G.|title = Maternal education and child survival in developing countries: The search for pathways for influence|journal = Social Science and Medicine|date = 1988|volume = 27|issue = 12|pages =1357–1368|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(88)90201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1359}} Education can also reinforce preventative measures. There is a relationship between poverty and education, but there are many possibilities within Guatemala that will allow education to prosper and serve a larger community. The lack of [[health education]] is one reason why many children and adults, through simple illnesses and pregnancies, end up dying prematurely. Health education provides mothers with resources to handle health issues and gives them access to knowledgeable sources outside their specific communities.&lt;ref name="Cleland" /&gt;{{rp|1361}}

[[File:Education of Children in Guatemala.JPG|thumb|360x480px|An image of public health education, focused on hygiene, being implemented in an elementary school in rural Guatemala]]

=== Health Education ===
Many Guatemalans do not have enough knowledge about health care to make concrete health decisions and know the results of outcomes. Education is required in order to provide both indigenous and non-indigenous Guatemalans with the understanding to make personal health choices. The education of school children and quality nutrition status have both shown to affect adult education levels.&lt;ref name="Behrman1" /&gt;{{rp|31}} With the implementation of nutrition interventions as children, these adults were more likely to be more educated than others in the population.&lt;ref name="Behrman1" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Similarly, Desai and Soumya discovered that there was a great relationship between child health and maternal education; therefore, the greater the mother's education, the healthier the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Maternal education and child health: Is there a strong causal relationship?|last = Desai|first = Sonalde|date = 1998|journal = Demography|doi = 10.2307/3004028|pmid = 9512911|access-date = |first2 = Soumya|last2 = Alva|issue = 1|volume = 35 |pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}

Within the Mayan population of Guatemala, education is not as accessible. However, it has also been observed that the indigenous population does not utilize health care services as readily.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|161}} Delgado et al. discovered that the indigenous mothers actually did have a significant affinity for health seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|163}} Specifically, mothers determined which health services to frequent based on the illness of their child.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|163}} However, many mothers explained that they would "normally not attend a medical service when their children presented the symptoms," for a variety of reasons including accessibility and dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|163}} Education and accessibility are required in order to expand health care into the more rural areas of Guatemala and implement health care planning techniques.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;{{rp|167}}

=== Preventative Measures ===
Preventative measures, in the form of health care, work to improve the basic health services so that individuals can easily access them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|1}} Guatemala has shifted its focus onto preventative care, in order to serve the poorer communities that are more disadvantaged in health care.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Especially in the field of Children and Women's Health, education on preventative measures can result in great health outcomes. In considering [[hygiene]] and [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]], preventative education can alone hinder the onset of disease.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Mothers are more likely to use health services, both as a preventative and medicinal tool, when they are educated.&lt;ref name="Cleland" /&gt;{{rp|1361}}

In the field of education, knowledge about health outcomes is necessary, as well as poor health origins. The causes of illnesses are largely unknown or completely wrong.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Diffusion of ideas about personal hygiene and contamination in poor countries: evidence from Guatemala|last = Goldman|first = Noreen|date = 2001|journal = Social Science and Medicine|doi = 10.1016/s0277-9536(00)00122-2|pmid = 11144917|access-date = |last2 = Pebley|first2 = Anne R.|last3 = Beckett|first3 = Megan|volume = 52 |pages=53–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}} In considering the effects of hygiene on health, education is very limited. The indigenous population of Guatemala knows little about the transmission of disease or easy, hygienic techniques that can reduce severe health problems.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;{{rp|56}} Even with few years of education, women in the indigenous communities were more likely to understand and adopt different hygienic beliefs in order to prevent poor health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;{{rp|59}} However, because of past experiences in which Ladino communities tried to assimilate into indigenous societies, the indigenous people of Guatemala resist the idea of adopting "western" or "Ladino" health behaviors.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;{{rp|59}} Therefore, the implementation of education into these communities would allow for increased preventative measures as well as overall health benefits.

Many of the deaths that occur frequently in Guatemala are a result of preventable and treatable diseases.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Diarrheal illness and health utilization in Guatemala factors surrounding oral rehydration therapy use|last = Masterson|first = Erin E.|date = 2010|journal = OHSU Digital Commons: Scholar Archive|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Different preventative measures including sanitation, hygiene, [[vaccine]]s, and education work to improve the health outcomes for many people in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;{{rp|2}} There is a large discrepancy between those who are receiving preventative care and those who are not. In Guatemala, doctors only treat 24% of indigenous people, whereas they treat almost double that amount for non-indigenous Guatemalans.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{rp|45}} This statistic shows that more money can be spent working to provide preventative care services to the indigenous population of Guatemala. Preventable diseases can be eliminated with the implementation of these services and with the influence of education.

It is often served at special occasions. It is prepared in a number of varieties; however, the most distinctive flavoring is ground [[cardamom]] seeds.

The dough is given a decorative touch before baking. The design varies in detail, but in general is given the shape of a wheel with indentations to create several spokes (see picture).

Common additions to the recipe include candied [[ginger]] or [[raisin]]s, although plain varieties are common also.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">The '''Infectious Disease (Notification) Act''' first appeared on the UK national statute books in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889, 52 &amp; 53 Vic., c. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; It was compulsory in London and optional in the rest of the country. It later became a mandatory law with the Infectious Diseases Notification (Extension) Act, 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Infectious Diseases Notification (Extension) Act, 1899, 62 &amp; 63 Vic. c. 8&lt;/ref&gt; These acts required householders and/or general practitioners to report cases of infectious disease to the local sanitary authority. The following diseases were covered by the acts: [[smallpox]], [[cholera]], [[diphtheria]], membranous croup. [[erysipelas]], [[scarlatina]] or [[scarlet fever]], [[Typhus Fever|typhus fever]], [[typhoid fever]], [[enteric fever]], [[relapsing fever]], continued fever and [[puerperal fever]]. Householders or general practitioners who failed to notify a case of one of these diseases was liable to a fine of up to forty shillings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mooney|first1=Graham|title=Public Health versus Private Practice: The Contested Development of Compulsory Infectious Disease Notification in Late-Nineteenth-Century Britain|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|date=1999|volume=73|issue=2|pages=238–267|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bulletin_of_the_history_of_medicine/v073/73.2mooney.html|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1889 act came about after experiments in fifty provincial towns and cities that had adopted some form of infectious diseases notification through a local act of Parliament. These local laws were important forerunners of the national legislation, but they covered less than one-quarter of the country’s urban population and no rural sanitary authority had a local act in place in 1889. The 1889 act was widely taken up and by the time the mandatory 1899 act came into effect, notification reached almost all corners of the UK.

Following receipt of a notification certificate, the local sanitary authority's [[Medical Officer of Health]] could pursue existing public health laws, such as the [[Public Health Act 1875]], to isolate patients in hospital, disinfect property and belongings, suspend schooling, and temporarily close businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mooney|first1=Graham|title=Intrusive Interventions: Public Health, Domestic Space, and Infectious Disease Surveillance in England, 1840-1914|date=2015|publisher=University of Rochester Press|location=Rochester, NY|isbn=9781580465274|url=http://www.urpress.com/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=14810|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Blaxter was born on 19 June 1919 in [[Sprowston]], [[England]] and grew up in [[Norfolk]].&lt;ref name="rs" /&gt; His father made [[handicraft]]s and his mother came from a family of farm workers.&lt;ref name="rs" /&gt; Blaxter studied at the [[City of Norwich School]] until 1936. He was bored in school and received poor grades.&lt;ref name="rs" /&gt; As a teenager, Blaxter spent his spare time at the Norfolk Agricultural Station, a short distance from the family home.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Kenneth Lyon Blaxter | doi = 10.2307/770168| jstor = 770168| pages=36–58| doi-broken-date = 2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he enrolled in day classes in agriculture at the Norfolk County Council, winning the class prize for the highest mark.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; He also worked as a farmhand on a farm in [[Hoveton]].&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;

Blaxter studied agriculture, biology and botany at the [[University of Reading]] in 1936, graduating in 1939.&lt;ref name="rs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;

=== Nutrition research ===

After graduating, Blaxter worked at the National Institute for Research in Dairying (NIRD), located in [[Shinfield]].&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; With the onset of [[World War II]], Blaxter was conscripted and served with the 10th Field Regiment of the [[Royal Artillery]] from spring 1940 to the end of 1941, when he returned to NIRD.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; At this time, he began to write his [[Ph.D]] thesis, entitled ''The maintenance of the winter milk supply in wartime''; he completed the thesis in 1944.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, he requested to be seconded to the biochemistry department of the Ministry of Agriculture in [[Weybridge]], where he conducted blood analysis and researched lead toxicity in [[ruminant]]s.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; In 1946, Blaxter moved to Illinois to work with animal nutritionist Harold Mitchell at the [[University of Illinois]].&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;

=== Work as an independent scientist ===

In 1947, after returning to England, Blaxter applied for the headship of the Nutrition Department at the Hannah Dairy Research Institute in [[Ayr, Scotland]]&lt;ref name="rs" /&gt; and received the position in 1948.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; During his tenure at the Hannah Dairy Research Institute, Blaxter wrote over 200 papers,&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; focusing primarily on the issues of energy metabolism and feed usage by [[ruminant]]s.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; Blaxter also investigated nutritional diseases and magnesium deficiency in calves, the effect of temperature and other environmental effects on sheep, and ruminant digestion and feed intake.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;

In 1965, Blaxter was appointed director of the [[Rowett Research Institute]] in [[Aberdeen, Scotland]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolffund.org.il/index.php?dir=site&amp;page=winners&amp;cs=269 |title=Sir Kenneth Blaxter Winner of Wolf Prize in Agriculture – 1979 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2015 |website=[[Wolf Foundation]] |publisher= |access-date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Blaxter and his team of researchers studied topics of importance to the Scottish farmer,&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; including deer farming, llamas,&lt;ref name="glasgow"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19880615&amp;id=6TNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T1kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5530,3964864 |title=Institute Marks 75 Years of Research |last1=Smith |first1=Graeme |last2= |first2= |date=15 June 1988 |website=[[Google News]] |publisher=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |access-date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; human nutrition,&lt;ref name="aberdeen" /&gt; feed evaluation, environmental stress and animal calorimetry.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; He also took an interest in agriculture and worldwide food policy, culminating in the publication of a book, ''Food, People and Resources'', in 1986.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;

=== Retirement ===

Blaxter retired from the Rowett Research Institute in 1982.&lt;ref name="glasgow" /&gt; From 1985 to 1991, Blaxter was a visiting professor in the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]]'s Department of Agricultural Biochemistry and Nutrition. He also chaired a committee of the federal Department of the Environment and the Cabinet Committee on Individual Merit Promotion, a body that recognized and awarded candidates from various scientific fields.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt; He died on 18 April 1991 of a brain tumour.&lt;ref name="rs" /&gt;

'''Kurt Albert''' (January 28, 1954 – September 28, 2010)  was a  [[climbing|climber]] and [[photographer]]. He started climbing at the age of 14. Before he wholly committed his life to climbing in 1986 he was a mathematics and physics teacher.

At the age of seventeen he climbed the  Walkerpfeiler in the [[Grandes Jorasses]] and one year later he climbed the [[Eiger north face#Nordwand|north face of the Eiger]]. After a visit to the [[Saxon Switzerland]] climbing area in Saxony, Germany in 1973 he recognized the potential of [[free climbing]] (free climbing was practised in [[Saxony]] since the early 19th century). He started to free climb in his home climbing area, the [[Frankenjura]]. In the routes he would now try to ascend while free climbing, he would&amp;mdash;in between attempts&amp;mdash;paint a red 'X' on the rocks near pitons he did not need as holds or steps. Once he could place a red 'X' on all the pitons and hooks in the route, and was thus able to [[Free climbing|free climb]] the entire route, he would paint a red dot at the base of the route. From this comes the English term "[[Redpoint (climbing)|redpoint]]", which is derived from the German ''Rotpunkt'', meaning "red dot" or "red point". In many ways this was the origin of the free climbing movement that led to the development of [[sport climbing]] some years later.

Albert was severely injured in a climbing accident on September 26, 2010. Albert fell {{convert|18|m|ft}} while taking pictures at [[via ferrata]] ''Höhenglücksteig'' close to [[Hirschbach, Bavaria]]. Albert died two days later while hospitalised in [[Erlangen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://alpin.de/news/news/47589d7c-c5ef-4ece-b48d-f81e5d6b82fd | title = Rätselraten um Kurt Albert | accessdate = 2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">A '''leisure centre''' in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Australia]] (also called aquatic centres) and [[Canada]] is a  purpose built building or site, usually owned and operated by the [[city]], [[borough council]] or municipal district [[Non-metropolitan district|council]], where people go to keep fit or relax through using the facilities.

== Typical facilities ==
Facilities may include a [[swimming pool]] (many with water slide), large sports hall, [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts, [[cafeteria]], licensed bar, fitness suite, [[aerobics]] studios, outdoor grass and/or artificial pitches for [[football (soccer)]], [[hockey]] etc., a [[sunroom#Solarium|solarium]], [[sauna]] and/or [[steam room]].

Leisure centres Canada are staffed by leisure centre attendants employed by the local council.  They carry out a range of tasks to help and supervise people using leisure centre facilities and act as swimming pool life guards, gym instructors and coaches offering advice, motivation and expertise to users. Many of its functions may overlap with that of a [[community centre]].

Leisure centres are also popular in Australia, where they are mostly privately operated but Government funded. In that country they are often also called Recreation Centres, or most commonly Aquatic Centres due to the swimming facilities being the most popular facility that is available. 

In some areas of the UK and Canada (such as [[Calgary]]) these services are now operated by private companies on contract to the local authority.

Most towns in the UK are now introducing leisure facilities for the local community.

In 1901 another reservoir at Mount Misery, Heckenberg was constructed between this dam and Liverpool.

In 1933 the dam was cleaned out and the wall upgraded to increase its volume from {{convert|4|to|37|e6impgal|ML|abbr=out}}.

'''Medical community''' as used in this article refers to medical institutions and services offered to populations under the jurisdiction of the late [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]].

==Background==
Medical services of the late [[Roman Republic]] and early [[Roman Empire]] were mainly imports from the civilization of [[Ancient Greece]], at first through Greek-influenced [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] society and [[Magna Graecia|Greek colonies]] placed directly in [[Italy]], and then through Greeks [[Slavery in ancient Rome|enslaved]] during the Roman conquest of Greece, [[Greek people|Greeks]] invited to Rome, or Greek knowledge imparted to Roman citizens visiting or being educated in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/antiqua/ Antiqua Medicina], Health Sciences Library&lt;/ref&gt; A perusal of the names of Roman physicians will show that the majority are wholly or partly Greek and that many of the physicians were of servile origin.&lt;ref&gt;Names can be located by a search under "physician" of classical encyclopedias and dictionaries available on the Internet, such as are presented by [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/ the Perseus site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The servility stigma came from the accident of a more medically advanced society being conquered by a lesser.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} One of the cultural ironies of these circumstances is that free men sometimes found themselves in service to the enslaved professional or dignitary, or the power of the state was entrusted to foreigners who had been conquered in battle and were technically slaves. In Greek society, physicians tended to be regarded as noble. [[Asclepius]] in the Iliad is noble.

==Importation from Greece==
===Public medicine===
[[File:Roma-isola tiberina01.jpg|thumb|left|Tiber Island today, site of the first Aesculapium in Rome]]
A signal event in the Roman medical community was the construction of the first Aesculapium in the city of Rome, on [[Tiber Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Several ancient sources mention it; for one, Livy, ''History of Rome'', 10.47&lt;/ref&gt; In 293 BCE some officials consulted the [[Sibylline Books]] concerning measures to be taken against the plague and were advised to bring Aesculapius from [[Epidaurus]] to Rome. The sacred serpent from Epidaurus was conferred ritually on the new temple, or, in some accounts, the serpent escaped from the ship and swam to the island. Baths have been found there as well as votive offerings (''donaria'') in the shape of specific organs. In classical times the center covered the entire island and included a long-term recovery center. The emperor [[Claudius]]&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claudius'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; had a law passed granting freedom to slaves who had been sent to the institution for cure but were abandoned there. This law probably facilitated state disposition of the patients and recovery of the beds they occupied. The details are not available.

It was not the first time a temple had been constructed at Rome to ward off plague. The consul, [[Gnaeus Julius Mento]], one of two for the year 431 BCE, dedicated a temple to [[Apollo]] medicus ("the healer").&lt;ref&gt;Livy, Book IV, 25, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a temple to ''salus'' ("health") on the ''Mons Salutaris'', a spur of the [[Quirinal]]. There is no record that these earlier temples possessed the medical facilities associated with an Aesculapium; in that case, the later decision to bring them in presupposes a new understanding that scientific measures could be taken against plague. The memorable description of plague at Athens during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (430 BCE) by [[Thucydides]] does not mention any measures at all to relieve those stricken with it. The dying were allowed to accumulate at the wells, which they contaminated, and the deceased to pile up there. At Rome, [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;''De Natura Deorum'' 3.63&lt;/ref&gt; criticized the worship of evil powers, such as ''Febris'' ("Fever"), ''Dea Mefitis'' ("Malaria"), ''Dea Angerona'' ("Sore Throat") and ''Dea Scabies'' ("Rash").

The medical art in early Rome was the responsibility of the ''pater familias'', or patriarch. The last known public advocate of this point of view were the railings of [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Cato]] against Greek physicians and his insistence on passing on home remedies to his son.

The importation of the Aesculapium established medicine in the public domain. There is no record of fees being collected for a stay at one of them, at Rome or elsewhere. The expense of an Aesculapium must have been defrayed in the same way as all temple expenses: individuals vowed to perform certain actions or contribute a certain amount if certain events happened, some of which were healings. Such a system amounts to gradated contributions by income, as the contributor could only vow what he could provide. The building of a temple and its facilities on the other hand was the responsibility of the magistrates. The funds came from the state treasury or from taxes.

===Private medicine===
A second signal act marked the start of sponsorship of private medicine by the state as well. In the year 219 BCE ([[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] and  [[Marcus Livius Salinator]] were consuls), a ''vulnerarius'', or surgeon, Archagathus, visited Rome from the [[Peloponnesus]] and was asked to stay. The state conferred citizenship on him and purchased him a ''taberna'', or shop, near the ''compitium Acilii'' (a crossroads), which became the first ''officina medica''.&lt;ref&gt;The use of  the uncontracted ''opificina'' by [[Plautus]] gives a clue that it was the workplace of an ''opifex'', or "manufacturer" rather than the ''officium'' or "office" of a functionary. This label comes from the manufacture and sale of medicines at the ''opificina''. For the story refer to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', Book 29.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctor necessarily had many assistants. Some prepared and vended medicines and tended the herb garden. There were ''pharmacopolae'' (note the female ending), ''unguentarii'' and ''aromatarii'', all of which names are easily understood by the English reader. Others attended the doctor when required (the ''[[capsarii]]''; they prepared and carried the doctor's ''capsa'', or bag.). [[Jerome Carcopino]]'s study of occupational names in the [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]] turned up 51 ''medici'', 4 ''medicae'' (female doctors), an ''obstetrix'' ("midwife") and a ''nutrix'' ("nurse") in the city of Rome. These numbers, of course, are at best proportional to the true populations, which were many times greater.

At the bottom of the scale were the ubiquitous ''discentes'' ("those learning") or medical apprentices. Roman doctors of any stature combed the population for persons in any social setting who had an interest in and ability for practicing medicine. On the one hand the doctor used their services unremittingly. On the other they were treated like members of the family; i.e., they came to stay with the doctor and when they left they were themselves doctors. The best doctors were the former apprentices of the Aesculapia, who, in effect, served residencies there.

==The practice of medicine==
===Medical values===
The Romans valued a state of ''valetudo'', ''salus'' or ''sanitas''. They began their correspondence with the salutation ''si vales valeo'', "if you are well, I am" and ended it with ''salve'', "be healthy".  The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] roots are *wal-, "be strong", a wholeness were to some degree perpetuated by right living. The Hippocratic oath obliges doctors to live rightly (setting an example). The first cause thought of when people got sick was that they did not live rightly. [[Vegetius]]' brief section on the health of a [[Roman legion]] states only that a legion can avoid disease by staying out of malarial swamps, working out regularly and living a healthy life.

Despite their best efforts people from time to time did become ''aeger'', "sick". They languished, had nausea (words of Roman extraction) or "fell" (''incidere'') ''in morbum''.  They were vexed and dolorous. At that point they were in need of the ''medica res'', the men skilled in the ''ars medicus'', who would ''curare  morbum'', "have a care for the disease", who went by the name of ''medicus'' or ''medens''. The root is *med-, "measure". The medicus prescribed ''medicina'' or ''regimina'' as measures against the disease.&lt;ref&gt;The Oscan official, ''meddix'', appearing in inscriptions, was only a man who rendered judgements of a non-medical nature. The inscriptions also testify to a goddess in Republican Rome, ''Meditrina'', celebrated in the ''Meditrinalia'', who was a goddess of healing.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The physician===
The next step was to secure the ''cura'' of a ''medicus''. If the patient was too sick to move one sent for a ''clinicus'', who went to the ''clinum'' or couch of the patient. Of higher status were the ''chirurgii'' (which became the English word [[surgeon]]), from Greek ''cheir'' (hand) and ''ourgon'' (work). In addition were the eye doctor, ''ocularius'', the ear doctor, ''auricularius'', and the doctor of snakebites, the ''marsus''.

That the poor paid a minimal fee for the visit of a ''medicus'' is indicated by a wisecrack in [[Plautus]]:&lt;ref&gt;Aulularia 448&lt;/ref&gt; "It was less than a [[Roman currency|nummus]]."&lt;ref&gt;A coin, usually one [[sestertius]], made of about 1.125 g. of  silver in Plautus' time.  The price of silver is a variable. If silver is valued at $11.50 an ounce, one sesterce is about fifty cents.&lt;/ref&gt; Many anecdotes exist of doctors negotiating fees with wealthy patients and refusing to prescribe a remedy if agreement was not reached. Pliny says:&lt;ref name="Pliny29.8"&gt;Pliny, Book 29.8&lt;/ref&gt;
:"I will not accuse the medical art of the avarice even of its professors, the rapacious bargains made with their patients while their fate is trembling in the balance, …"

The fees charged were on a sliding scale according to assets. The physicians of the rich were themselves rich. For example, Antonius Musa treated [[Augustus]]' nervous symptoms with cold baths and drugs. He was not only set free but he became Augustus' physician. He received a salary of 300,000 [[Sestertius|sesterces]].&lt;ref&gt;By the standard of the previous note, that would be a relatively inexpensive $150,000 per annum, but the number does not take into consideration any economic standards.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that he was other than a private physician; that is, he was not working for the Roman government.

===Legal responsibility===
Doctors were generally exempt from prosecution for their mistakes. Some writers complain of legal murder. However, holding the powerful up to exorbitant fees ran the risk of retaliation. Pliny reports&lt;ref name="Pliny29.8"/&gt; that the emperor [[Claudius]] fined a physician,  Alcon, 180 million [[sesterce]]s and exiled him to Gaul, but that on his return he made the money back in just a few years. Pliny does not say why the physician was exiled,  but the blow against the man was struck on his pocketbook. He could make no such income in Gaul.

This immunity applied only to mistakes made in the treatment of free men. By chance a law existed at Rome, the [[Lex Aquilia]],&lt;ref&gt;Sponsored by the tribune, Aquilius&lt;/ref&gt; passed about 286 BCE, which allowed the owners of slaves and animals to seek remedies for damage to their property, either malicious or negligent. Litigants used this law to proceed against the negligence of medici, such as the performance of an operation on a slave by an untrained surgeon resulting in death or other damage.

===Social position===
While encouraging and supporting the public and private practice of medicine, the Roman government tended to suppress organizations of ''medici'' in society. The constitution provided for the formation of occupational ''collegia'', or guilds. The consuls and the emperors treated these ambivalently. Sometimes they were permitted; more often they were made illegal and were suppressed. The medici formed collegia, which had their own centers, the ''Scholae Medicorum'', but they never amounted to a significant social force. They were regarded as subversive along with all the other collegia.

Doctors were nevertheless influential. They liked to write. Compared to the number of books written, not many have survived; for example, Tiberius Claudius Menecrates composed 150 medical works, of which only a few fragments remain. Some that did remain almost in entirety are the works of [[Galen]], [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]], [[Hippocrates]] and the herbal expert, [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] who wrote the 5-volume ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]''. The ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] became a paradigm for all subsequent works like it and gave its name to the topic, although Pliny was not himself an observer of the natural world like [[Aristotle]] or [[Theophrastus]], whose ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'' included a book on their medicinal uses.

==Military medical corps==
===Republican===
The state of the military medical corps before [[Augustus]] is unclear. Corpsmen certainly existed at least for the administration of first aid and were enlisted soldiers rather than civilians. The commander of the legion was held responsible for removing the wounded from the field and insuring that they got sufficient care and time to recover. He could quarter troops in private domiciles if he thought necessary. Authors who have written of [[Roman military]] activities before Augustus, such as [[Livy]], mention that wounded troops retired to population centers to recover.

===Imperial===
The army of the early empire was sharply and qualitatively different. Augustus defined a permanent professional army by setting the enlistment at 16 years (with an additional 4 for reserve obligations), and establishing a special military fund, the ''[[aerarium militare]]'', imposing a 5% inheritance tax and 1% auction sales tax to pay for it. From it came bonus payments to retiring soldiers amounting to several years' salary. It could also have been used to guarantee regular pay. Previously legions had to rely on booty.

If military careers were now possible, so were careers for military specialists, such as ''medici''. Under Augustus for the first time occupational names of officers and functions began to appear in inscriptions. The ''valetudinaria'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/valetudinaria|title=Valetudinaria|website=www.sciencemuseum.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or military versions of the ''aesculapia'' (the names mean the same thing) became features of permanent camps. Caches of surgical instruments have been found in some of them. From this indirect evidence it is possible to conclude to the formation of an otherwise unknown permanent medical corps.

In the early empire one finds ''milites medici'' who were ''immunes'' ("exempt") from other duties. Some were staff of the hospital, which Pseudo-Hyginus mentions in ''[[De Munitionibus Castrorum]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Section 4&lt;/ref&gt; as being set apart from other buildings so that the patients can rest. The hospital administrator was an ''[[Optio|optio valetudinarii]]''. The orderlies aren't generally mentioned, but they must have existed, as the patients needed care and the doctors had more important duties. Perhaps they were servile or civilians, not worth mentioning. There were some ''noscomi'', male nurses not in the army. Or, they could have been the ''milites medici''. The latter term might be any military medic or it might be orderlies detailed from the legion. There were also ''medici castrorum''. Not enough information survives in the sources to say for certain what distinctions existed, if any.

The army of Augustus featured a standardized officer corps, described by [[Vegetius]]. Among them were the ''Ordinarii'', the officers of an ''Ordo'' or rank. In an ''acies triplex'' there were three such ''ordines'', the centuries (companies) of which were commanded by centurions. The ''Ordinarii'' were therefore of the rank of a centurion but did not necessarily command one if they were staff.

The term ''medici ordinarii'' in the inscriptions must refer to the lowest ranking military physicians. During his reign, Augustus finally conferred the ''dignitas equestris'', or social rank of knight, on all physicians, public or private. They were then full citizens (in case there were any Hellenic questions) and could wear the rings of knights. In the army there was at least one other rank of physician, the ''[[duplicarius|medicus duplicarius]]'', "medic at double pay", and, as the legion had ''milites sesquiplicarii'', "soldiers at 1.5 pay", perhaps the medics had that pay grade as well.

Augustan posts were named according to a formula containing the name of the rank and the unit commanded in the genitive case; e.g., the commander of a legion, who was a legate; that is, an officer appointed by the emperor, was the ''[[legatus legionis]]'', "the legate of the legion." Those posts worked pretty much as today; a man on his way up the ''cursus honorum'' ("ladder of offices", roughly) would command a legion for a certain term and then move on.

The posts of ''medicus legionis'' and a ''medicus cohortis'' were most likely to be commanders of the ''medici'' of the legion and its cohorts. They were all under the ''praetor'' or camp commander, who might be the ''legatus'' but more often was under the ''legatus'' himself. There was, then, a medical corps associated with each camp. The cavalry ''alae'' ("wings") and the larger ships all had their medical officers, the ''medici alarum'' and the ''medici triremis'' respectively.

===Practice===
As far as can be determined, the medical corps in battle worked as follows. [[Trajan's Column]] depicts medics on the battlefield bandaging soldiers. They were located just behind the standards; i.e., near the field headquarters. This must have been a field [[aid station]], not necessarily the first, as the soldiers or corpsmen among the soldiers would have administered first aid before carrying their wounded comrades to the station. Some soldiers were designated to ride along the line on a horse picking up the wounded. They were paid by the number of men they rescued. Bandaging was performed by ''[[capsarii]]'', who carried bandages (''fascia'') in their ''capsae'', or bags.

From the aid station the wounded went by horse-drawn ambulance to other locations, ultimately to the camp hospitals in the area. There they were seen by the ''medici vulnerarii'', or surgeons, the main type of military doctor. They were given a bed in the hospital if they needed it and one was available. The larger hospitals could administer 400-500 beds. If these were insufficient the camp commander probably utilized civilian facilities in the region or quartered them in the ''vici'', "villages", as in the republic.

A base hospital was quadrangular with barracks-like wards surrounding a central courtyard. On the outside of the quadrangle were private rooms for the patients. Although unacquainted with bacteria, Roman medical doctors knew about contagion and did their best to prevent it. Rooms were isolated, running water carried the waste away, and the drinking and washing water was tapped up the slope from the latrines.

Within the hospital were operating rooms, kitchens, baths, a dispensary, latrines, a mortuary and herb gardens, as doctors relied heavily on herbs for drugs. The ''medici'' could treat any wound received in battle, as long as the patient was alive. They operated or otherwise treated with [[scalpel]]s, hooks, levers, drills, probes, forceps, [[catheter]]s and arrow-extractors on patients anesthetized with [[morphine]] ([[opium poppy]] extract) and scopolamine ([[henbane]] extract). Instruments were boiled before use. Wounds were washed in vinegar and stitched. Broken bones were placed in traction. There is, however, evidence of wider concerns. A vaginal speculum suggests gynecology was practiced, and an anal speculum implies knowledge that the size and condition of internal organs accessible through the orifices was an indication of health. They could extract eye [[cataract]]s with a special needle. Operating room amphitheaters indicate that medical education was ongoing. Many have proposed that the knowledge and practices of the ''medici'' were not exceeded until the 20th century CE.

==Regulation of medicine==
By the late empire the state had taken more of a hand in regulating medicine. The law codes of the 4th century CE, such as the [[Codex Theodosianus]], paint a picture of a medical system enforced by the laws and the state apparatus. At the top was the equivalent of a surgeon general of the empire. He was by law a noble, a ''dux'' (duke) or a ''vicarius'' (vicar) of the emperor. He held the title of ''comes archiatorum'', "count of the chief healers."  The Greek word ''iatros'', "healer", was higher-status than the Latin ''medicus''.

Under the ''comes'' were a number of officials called the ''[[Archiater|archiatri]]'', or more popularly the ''protomedici'', ''supra medicos'', ''domini medicorum'' or ''superpositi medicorum''. They were paid by the state. It was their function to supervise all the ''medici'' in their districts; i.e., they were the chief  medical examiners. Their families were exempt from taxes. They could not be prosecuted nor could troops be quartered in their homes.

The archiatri were divided into two groups:
* ''Archiatri sancti palatii'', who were palace physicians
* ''Archiatri populares''. They were required to provide for the poor; presumably, the more prosperous still provided for themselves.

The ''archiatri''  settled all medical disputes. Rome had 14 of them; the number in other communities varied from 5 to 10 depending on the population.

{{Bolivarian Missions}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mision sucre.jpg|left|150px]] --&gt;
'''Mission Sucre''' (launched in late 2003) is one the [[Bolivarian Missions]] (a series of anti-poverty and social welfare programs) implemented by former [[Venezuela]]n president [[Hugo Chávez]].  The program provides free and ongoing higher (college and graduate level) education to the two million adult Venezuelans.

Mission Sucre was originally referred to as ''El Plan Extraordinario Mariscal Antonio José de Sucre'', shortened as ''Misión Sucre''. Named after the 18th century independence leader '''[[Antonio José de Sucre]]''', Mission Sucre establishes as a strategy the mass education and graduation of university professionals in three years, as opposed to the traditionally mandated five or more years. The mission is thus an attempt to popularize, reform, and expand Venezuelan higher education beyond its traditional role of educating the children of a proportion of Venezuelans that can pay for collateral costs involved while studying in a college or university, due to uneven geographically distributed high education institutes (transportation expenses, housing). The program is thus geared especially towards economically excluded high school students and the poorest and most marginalized segments of society, providing an opportunity for all people desiring a higher education.

In this mission, certain matters and subjects, such as foreign languages, are mostly left out of the curriculum. The program functions mostly at the margins of the Venezuelan tertiary education system, although several key institutions, such as Simon Bolivar University, have endorsed the program. For example, thousands of non-traditional, mostly low income students are currently undergoing training to become licensed physicians in a unique and accelerated curriculum.

Mission Sucre imparts tertiary education; other educational missions include [[Mission Robinson]] (for instructing the illiterate) and [[Mission Ribas]] (for obtaining secondary studies, classes, and graduation certificates).

== Objectives ==
The objectives of Mission Sucre are officially stated as follows: 'To harness institutional synergy and community participation to guarantee access to university education for all undergraduates and to transform the condition of those excluded from the subsystem of higher education. To combine a vision of social justice with the strategic character of higher education for sustainable all-round human development, national sovereignty and the construction of a democratic and participatory society, for which purpose it is indispensable to guarantee the participation of the whole society in the making, transformation, diffusion and creative exploitation of knowledge and deeds.'

== Origins of mass higher education ==
In the last decades of the 20th century, the Venezuelan government prior to the Chávez administration was steadily renouncing its support in areas involving education; specifically, it decreased support for tertiary education for the poor.

In fact, government funding and investment in higher education in Venezuela between 1989 and 1998 saw a marked downward trend. Chávez became president in 1999. The trend marked the government's desire to reduce resources and state support for education while furthering the project of privatization of higher education, as per the doctrines of the [[Washington Consensus]] and [[neoliberalism]].

This brought consequences such as a large accumulated "social debt" (the sum tabulation of governmental neglect of a given area, such as the total of all funds that could have been spent on education, but instead were spent elsewhere), because the number of university matriculations stagnated, resulting in the exclusion of students originating from Venezuela's poorest sectors. Numerous studies agree that entrance to higher education predisposes students from any background to eventually earn greater incomes, both of the population of the cities and to students originating from elite private schools. On a par with this phenomenon, the tertiary education turning out official governmental managers reduced its participation in the education of private (corporate) management. From 1999, the National Government has dedicated efforts to strengthen the Venezuelan educational system, for which it has been indispensable to rescue the initiative of the State as a guarantor of high quality educational opportunities for all. With respect to the access to higher education, the National Government has achieved an expansion in matriculations to the Institutes and Schools and in good part to the Experimental National Universities, in a joint work with the authorities and the established communities of these institutions.

In addition, starting from the beginning of Chávez's presidential mandate in 1999, five new universities have been founded. These universities are: [[Experimental National University of Yaracuy]] (created by decree in the government of [[Rafael Caldera]] and opened under the Chávez presidency); [[Maritime University of the Caribbean]]; [[National Experimental University of the Armed Forces]] (''UNEFA''); [[Experimental National University of South of the Lake]] (that is, south of [[Lake Maracaibo]]) and the [[Bolivarian University of Venezuela]]. Also, four new University Institutes of Technology have been created; these are: the IUT of [[Bolívar State (Venezuela)|Bolívar State]], the IUT of [[Apure State]], the IUT of [[Barinas State]] and the IUT in la Fría [[Táchira State]].

These institutions give new opportunities for study for the enormous number of college graduates who return to lower levels of education, and in addition they respond to the necessity to transform the system of tertiary education, in terms of geographic distribution, based on the construction of the Territorial Balance designed in the manner of the Economic and Social Plan of Development 2001–2007.

Nevertheless, this effort remains far short of meeting overall demand, such is the extent of the social debt accumulated by previous administrations' neglect of popularized higher education. There are around 500,000 bachelor's degree holders who remain excluded from professional tertiary education.

'''One-armed versus one-legged''' is a form of '''[[cricket]]''' in which one team has cricketers with only one arm while the members of the other team only have one leg.

There have been several matches of this sort, held for the annual [[benefit (sports)|benefit]] of the [[Greenwich pensioner]]s – sailors pensioned off from the [[Royal Navy]] and resident at the [[Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich]].  These sailors often lost limbs during naval service in the 18th century&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; and so the teams were drawn from the ranks of the pensioners.  In 1861, [[Charles Dickens]] reported a civilian match at [[Peckham Rye]] in his magazine, ''[[All the Year Round]]''.

==Matches==

===1796===
Two teams of [[Greenwich pensioner]]s played at [[Aram's New Ground]] in [[Walworth]] for a prize of a thousand [[guinea (coin)|guinea]]s.  The match was advertised and so there was a large crowd of spectators.  The teams arrived in three [[stagecoach]]es at 9 in the morning and play started at 10.  The one-legged team batted first, scoring 93 [[run (cricket)|run]]s in that [[inning]]s.  The one-armed team scored 42 runs in their first innings but there had been a great commotion while they were batting as a press of would-be spectators broke down a gate and some fencing to get in.  Some climbed on top of a stable which collapsed so they were bruised.   The one-legged team batted again and scored sixty more runs for the loss of six wickets.  The game finished that evening with the one-legged team winning by 153 runs to 42.  There was a [[replay (sports)|rematch]] on the following Wednesday and the one-legged team won again by 103 runs.  The spectacle then concluded with a [[100-yard dash]] in which the one-legged team raced for a prize pool of 20 guineas.&lt;ref name=Box/&gt;&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

Two teams of Greenwich pensioners played at Hall's ground in [[Camberwell]].&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;&lt;ref name=G/&gt;

===1848===
Two teams of Greenwich pensioners played at a ground formerly part of [[Lewisham Priory]].  The match was organised by Messrs Ingersoll and Stanton who managed to attract two thousand, four hundred spectators who were attracted by the novelty of the event.  The game was played over two days and the teams were well-provisioned throughout, being given a hearty lunch before play and dinners of roast beef and lamb with plenty of strong ale at the Bull Inn.  A band provided music for the occasion and the cricket players were additionally rewarded with a glass of [[grog]] and a fee of ten [[shilling]]s.  The one-legged men had difficulty connecting with the [[wide (cricket)|wide]] bowling, often being got out as they span around like a top.  The one-armed team was the betting favourite and won the match, scoring 50 runs in their first innings and 41 in the second.  The score of the one-legged team was 32 and 44, making the result 91 to 76 in favour of the one-armed team.&lt;ref name=ILN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;&lt;ref name=G/&gt;

[[File:Rosemary Branch tavern.png|thumb|right|550px|The "Rosemary Branch" tavern in 1800.&lt;ref name=ONL/&gt;]]
[[Charles Dickens]] reported a match in his magazine, ''[[All the Year Round]]'', having seen an advertisement in the window of a [[tobacconist]].  It was held at [[Peckham Rye]] in the grounds of the Rosemary Branch [[tavern]], which hosted many sporting events and pastimes.  The match was for the benefit of one of the one-armed men and the players were mostly locals but one was a well-known [[barbershop music|musical barber]] and dancer from [[Essex]], who bowled for the one-legged team.  Some spectators sat on benches but Dickens sat on the [[roller_(agricultural_tool)#Cricket_pitch_use|roller]] which was used to level the [[cricket pitch|pitch]].  He described the spectacle as "painfully wonderful and ludicrously horrible":&lt;ref name=CD/&gt;{{quote|The one-legged men were pretty well with the bat, but they were rather beaten when it came to fielding. There was a horrible [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbeinish]] fun about the way they stumped, trotted, and jolted after the ball. A converging rank of crutches and wooden legs tore down upon the ball from all sides; while the one-armed men, wagging their hooks and stumps, rushed madly from wicket to wicket, fast for a "oner", faster for "a twoer".&lt;br&gt; ...&lt;br&gt;The one-armed men had a much less invalid and veteran air about them. There was a shapely lad in a pink [[Jersey (clothing)|Jersey]], who, from having his hand off only at the wrist, merely looked at a distance like a stripling with his hand hidden by a long coat-cuff.   But then, again, there was a thickset, sturdy fellow, in a blue cap, of the "one-leg" party, who, though he had lost one foot, seemed to run and walk almost as well as ordinary people. Then, again, on the "one-leg" side, there was an ostentatious amount of infirmity in the shape of one or two pale men with crutches, yet everybody appeared merry and good natured, and determined to enjoy the game to his heart's content; while every time a player made a run, before the dull beat of the bat had died away, there was a shout that made the Peckham [[welkin]] ring again, and all the crutches and wooden legs beat tattoos of pure joy and triumph. And when the musical and [[Terpsichore|Terpsichorean]] barber rattled the wickets or made the balls fly, did not the very plates in the refreshment tent dance with pleasure!&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
Now, a lad who lost his leg when a baby, as a bystander told me, took up the bat and went in with calm self-reliance, and the game went forward with the usual concomitants. Now come the tips, the misses, the by-balls, the leg hits, the swinging blows that intend so much and do nothing, the echoing swashing cuts, the lost balls, the stumpings-out, the blocks, the slow treacherous balls, and the spinning, bruising roundhanders; not that our friends of the one leg and one arm swaddled themselves up in any timid paddings or bandages; they put on no india-rubber tubed gloves, no shelter-knuckles, they don no fluted leggings. What is a blow on the knuckles to a man who has lost a leg or an arm, who has felt the surgeon's saw and the keen double-edged knife? Yet all this time there was rather a ghastly reminder of suffering about the whole affair, to my mind. I could fancy the game played by out-patients in some outlying field of [[Guy's Hospital]]. I could believe it a party of convalescents in some field outside [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55)|Sebastopol]]. Well, I suppose the fact is, that men don't think much of misfortunes when they are once irretrievable, and that these men felt a pleasure in doing an eccentric thing, in showing how bravely and easily they could overcome an infirmity that to some men appears terrible. After all, one thinks, after seeing such a game, one-legged and one-armed men are not so miserable as people imagine. Nature is kind to us in her compensations.}}After much energetic play and incident, the one-armed team won by 14 runs.&lt;ref name=CD/&gt;

===1863===
There was a match in [[Manchester]] where a player nicknamed "No-Legs" bowled for one team.&lt;ref name=CC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cab/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to cuisines:

'''[[Cuisine]]''' – specific set of [[cooking]] traditions and practices, often associated with a specific [[culture]]. It is frequently named after the region or place where its underlining culture is present. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. [[Religion|Religious]] food laws can also exercise a strong influence on culinary practices.

==What is a cuisine?==
* Style of [[Outline of food preparation|food preparation]] – preparing food for eating, generally requires selection, measurement and combination of ingredients in an ordered procedure so as to achieve desired results. Food preparation includes but is not limited to cooking.
* Food and drink &amp;ndash; ''[[#Components of a cuisine|see 'Components of a cuisine', below]]''

==Types of cuisine==

: See: [[List of cuisines]]

==Components of a cuisine==

=== Food and drink ===
{{anchor|Drink}}
*[[Drink]] (beverages) of particular types &amp;ndash; drinks are liquids specifically prepared for human consumption. In addition to basic needs, beverages form part of the culture of human society. Although all beverages, including juice, soft drinks, and carbonated drinks, have some form of water in them, water itself is often not classified as a beverage, and the word beverage has been recurrently defined as not referring to water.''See [[List of beverages]].''
* [[Food]] of particular types, including the way it is presented &amp;ndash; food is any substance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Encyclopædia Britannica definition]&lt;/ref&gt; consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. ''See [[List of foods]].''
** [[Food presentation]] &amp;ndash; art of modifying, processing, arranging, or decorating food to enhance its aesthetic appeal. The visual presentation of foods is often considered by chefs at many different stages of food preparation, from the manner of tying or sewing meats, to the type of cut used in chopping and slicing meats or vegetables, to the style of mold used in a poured dish. The food itself may be decorated as in elaborately iced cakes, topped with ornamental sometimes sculptural consumables, drizzled with sauces, sprinkled with seeds, powders, or other toppings, or it may be accompanied by edible or inedible garnishes.
* Food preparation styles &amp;ndash; see ''[[Food preparation techniques]]''

=== Meals ===

[[Meal]]s &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of meals|outline]]) &amp;ndash; cuisine is generally served in the form of a meal. A meal is an eating occasion that takes place at a certain time and includes specific, prepared [[food]], or the food eaten on that occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/meal_1?q=meal meal noun (FOOD) - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/meal meal - Definition from Longman English Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The names used for specific meals in [[English (language)|English]] vary greatly, depending on the speaker's culture, the time of day, or the size of the meal. Meals are composed of one or more courses,&lt;ref name="Smith2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew F. Smith|title=The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=1 May 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530796-2|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn are composed of one or more dishes.

===Meal structure in cuisines===
Meal structure varies by culture.  Here are some examples:

[[File:Ramadan Dinner 2005-11-07.jpg|thumb|Ramadan dinner known as iftar in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].]]
[[File:Englishbreakfast.jpg|thumb|A full English breakfast with fried egg, [[sausage]], [[White pudding|white]] and [[black pudding]], bacon, mushrooms, baked beans, [[hash browns]], toast, and half a tomato]]
[[File:Buffet Germany.jpg|thumb|right|Typical German breakfast buffet]]

* [[Arab cuisine#Structure of meals|Meal structure in Arab cuisine]] &amp;ndash; includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner (including dessert). However, during Ramadan (9th month), fasting is paramount, and lasts from dawn to sunset.  Each day during Ramadan, before dawn, many Muslims observe a pre-fast meal called the suhoor. After stopping a short time before dawn, Muslims begin the first prayer of the day, Fajr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hadithcollection.com/sahihmuslim/134-Sahih%20Muslim%20Book%2006.%20Fasting/10921-sahih-muslim-book-006-hadith-number-2415.html |title= Sahih Muslim - Book 006 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 2415 |first= Abul-Hussain |last= Muslim-Ibn-Habaj | work= hadithcollection.com |year= 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hadithcollection.com/sahihbukhari/64-Sahih%20Bukhari%20Book%2031.%20Fasting/2446-sahih-bukhari-volume-003-book-031-hadith-number-144.html |title= Sahih Bukhari - Book 031 (The Book of Fasting), Hadith 144 |first= AbdAllah-Muhammad|last= Ibn-Ismail-Bukhari |work= hadithcollection.com |year= 2009 |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At sunset, families hasten for the fast-breaking meal known as iftar.
* [[Bolivian cuisine#Meal structure|Meal structure in Bolivian cuisine]] &amp;ndash; lunch ''(almuerzo)'' is the most important meal of the Bolivian day. Bolivians observe an afternoon tea time ''(té)''similar to those in England. Dinner ''(la cena)'' is a lighter, much more informal affair than lunch.
* [[Danish cuisine#Main meals|Meal structure in Danish cuisine]] &amp;ndash; usually consists of a cold breakfast with coffee or tea, a cold lunch at work and a hot dinner at home with the family. Some also have a snack in the middle of the afternoon or in the late evening.
* [[Dutch cuisine#Structure of meals|Meal structure in Dutch cuisine]] &amp;ndash; the Dutch eat at  breakfast and lunch (which differ little from each other), tea time, and dinner (including dessert)
* [[English cuisine#Meals|Meal structure in English cuisine]] &amp;ndash; Breakfast is traditional throughout England. Lower-middle-class and working-class people, especially from the North of England, the English Midlands, and Scotland, traditionally call their midday meal ''dinner'' and their evening meal (served around 6&amp;nbsp;pm) ''tea'', whereas the upper social classes call the midday meal lunch (or ''luncheon''), and the evening meal (served after 7&amp;nbsp;pm) dinner (if formal) or supper (often eaten later in the evening),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/03/tea-with-grayson-perry-supper-dinner |title=Tea with Grayson Perry. Or is it dinner, or supper? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-15 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''afternoon tea'' as a light meal typically eaten between 4 pm and 6 pm. 
* [[French cuisine#Structure of meals|Meal structure in French cuisine]] &amp;ndash; breakfast ''(le petit déjeuner)'', lunch ''(le déjeuner)'', dinner (le dîner) and dessert. Beverages that precede a meal are called ''apéritifs'' (literally: that opens the appetite), and can be served with amuse-bouches (literally: mouth amuser). Those that end it are called ''digestifs''.
* [[German cuisine#Structure of meals|Meal structure in German cuisine]] &amp;ndash; traditionally,the day starts with breakfast ''(frühstück)'', lunch ''(mittagessen)'' is the main meal, followed by a smaller dinner (''abendessen'' or ''abendbrot'') with dessert.
* [[Iranian cuisine#Structure of meals|Meal structure in Iranian cuisine]] &amp;ndash; breakfast is called ''sobhāneh.'' Lunch and dinner ''(naahaar va shaam)'' are not distinguished in Persian. You can usually find tea brewing throughout the day in most Iranian homes.
* [[Italian meal structure|Meal structure in Italian cuisine]] &amp;ndash; breakfast (colazione), lunch ''(pranzo)'', mid-afternoon snack ''(merenda)'', and dinner ''(cena)''

==History of cuisine==

[[List of historical cuisines]]
* [[History of cooking]] &amp;ndash; no known clear archeological evidence for the first cooking of food has survived. Most anthropologists believe that cooking fires began only about 250,000 years ago, when hearths started appearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Pennisi_99.html |title= Pennisi: Did Cooked Tubers Spur the Evolution of Big Brains? |publisher=Cogweb.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate= 7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* History of Asian cuisine
** [[History of Chinese cuisine]] &amp;ndash; marked by both variety and change. The archaeologist and scholar [[K.C. Chang]] says "Chinese people are especially preoccupied with food" and "food is at the center of, or at least it accompanies or symbolizes, many social interactions." Over the course of history, he says, "continuity vastly outweighs change." He explains basic organizing principles which go back to earliest times and give a continuity to the food tradition, principally that a normal meal is made up of ''fan（{{noitalics|饭/飯}}）'' (grains and other starches) and ''cai（{{noitalics|菜}}）'' (vegetable or meat dishes).&lt;ref name=casey&gt;Chang Kwang-chih (ed.)

** [[History of cuisine from the Indian subcontinent]] &amp;ndash; consists of the cuisines of the [[Indian subcontinent]], is rich and diverse. As a land that has experienced extensive immigration and intermingling through many millennia, the Indian subcontinent has benefited from numerous food influences. The diverse climate in the region, ranging from deep tropical to alpine, has also helped considerably broaden the set of ingredients readily available to the many schools of cookery in India.

* History of Latin cuisine
** [[History of Argentine cuisine]] &amp;ndash; is rich and diverse. As a land that has experienced extensive immigration through many years, the country has benefited from numerous food influences. The diverse climate in the region, ranging from subtropical to subpolar, has also helped considerably broaden the set of ingredients readily available.
* History of Middle Eastern cuisine 
** [[History of Iraqi cuisine]] &amp;ndash; among the ancient texts discovered in Iraq is a Sumerian-Akkadian bilingual dictionary, recorded in cuneiform script on 24 stone tablets about 1900 BC. It lists terms in the two ancient Iraqi languages for over 800 different items of food and drink. Included are 20 different kinds of cheese, over 100 varieties of soup and 300 types of bread – each with different ingredients, filling, shape or size.

Section 409 of the [[Packers and Stockyards Act]] regulates that [[meatpacking|meatpackers]] pay promptly for livestock that they purchase.

It requires that any [[meatpacking|meatpacker]] or dealer buying livestock to pay up in full to the seller before the end of the next [[business day]].&lt;ref name="United States  Department of  Agriculture"&gt;{{cite web|title=Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921|url=http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/Lawsandregs/PS_act.pdf|work=United States  Department of  Agriculture|accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

409(b) states that the purchaser is exempt from this requirement if the parties have other payment agreements in writing.&lt;ref name="United States Department of Agriculture" /&gt;

==History==
The law was passed in 1921 as part of the [[Packers and Stockyards Act]]  ([[Title 7 of the United States Code|7 U.S.C.]] §§ 181-229b; '''P&amp;S Act''') which was passed in order to "regulate interstate and foreign commerce in live stock, live-stock produce, dairy products, poultry, poultry products, and eggs, and for other purposes."

==Penalty==
A dealer who violates the law could be assessed a fine not exceeding 32,000 dollars for each violation. When determining the amount of the violation, the secretary should consider the gravity of the offence.&lt;ref name="United States Department of Agriculture" /&gt;

==Enforcement==
The only time&lt;ref name="Channel 7 Arutz Sheva Israel National News" /&gt; experts remember that a [[meatpacking|meatpacker]] was criminally charged for violating the law, was in 2010 when [[Sholom Rubashkin]] the [[CEO]] of [[agriprocessors]] was charged with failing to pay 31 cattle suppliers within 24 hours. [[Sholom Rubashkin|Rubashkin]] at times paid as much as 11 days late&lt;ref name="Justice - Web"&gt;{{cite web|title=1921 Law Used For First Time|url=https://justiceforsholom.org/unbelievable/psa-used-after-9-decades|accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  causing a loss of $3,800.51 of potential [[interest]]. [[Federal Judge]] [[Linda R. Reade]] added 4 years&lt;ref name="Justice - Web" /&gt;  in prison for this violation alone.&lt;ref name="Channel 7 Arutz Sheva Israel National News"&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Edwin|title=Is Life for Rubashkin Overkill?|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/9564#.U1h0-PldVyU|accessdate=2014-04-23|newspaper=Arutz Sheva Israel National News|date=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palace of the [[Inquisition]]''' stands on the corner of República de Brasil and República de Venezuela streets in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. While neither side of the building faces the Santo Domingo Plaza, the entrance does, as it is placed at the corner, which is canted to allow it to face in that direction. Its long association with the [[Mexican Inquisition|Inquisition]], which ended during the [[Mexican War of Independence]], made it difficult to convert to other purposes.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |page=108 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it eventually became the School of Medicine for the reconstructed National University (now the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM)). When UNAM moved to the [[Ciudad Universitaria]] in the 1950s, it retained ownership of this building, eventually converting the structure in what is today the '''Museum of Mexican Medicine'''.&lt;ref name="Horz"&gt;{{cite book

== Inquisition in New Spain ==
[[File:PortalInquisDF.JPG|thumb|left|Main portal]]
From nearly the beginning of the colonial period until the Mexican War of Independence, this spot has been the headquarters of the Inquisition in the colony of [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="Horz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GTM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Turistica de Mexico – Distrito Federal Centro 3 |last= Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promexa |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-34-0319-0 |pages=71–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tribunal of the Holy Inquisition was not fully established here until 1571, the first cleric with inquisitorial duties was [[Martin de Valencia]], who came to the colony in 1524. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], in whom the [[pope|papacy]] had invested Inquisition duties, arrived in 1526 and proceeded to build a monastery in the area occupied by both the current Palace and the [[Santo Domingo (Mexico City)|Church of Santo Domingo]]. The first official Inquisitor for the colony, [[Pedro Moya de Contreras]], worked in the section of the monastery where the later, 18th century Palace would be built.&lt;ref name="Horz"/&gt;

The Inquisition was officially established here due to a 1566 conspiracy led by [[Martín Cortés, 2nd Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca|Martin Cortes]], son of [[Hernán Cortés]], threatened to make the new colony independent of Spain. The plot was denounced by Baltazar de Aguilar Cervantes and Inquisition trials of various [[Creole peoples|Creole]]s began. The accused were subject to torture and harsh sentences, especially when before a magistrate by the name of Muñoz. The first victims of this series of trials were the brothers Alonso and Gil Gonzalez de Alvila Alvarado. Despite having the sympathy of the local citizens and of the chroniclers, both brothers were convicted. Their punishment was to be decapitated, and their house, located on part of the site of the [[Templo Mayor]], was razed to the ground,  and the site [[salting the earth|sown with salt]]&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

The Inquisition here heard a number of other famous cases during its time, including the prosecution of the Carbajal family for reversion to [[Judaism]], and the case of Martin Villavicencio, alias [[Martin Garatuza]], which would inspire one of the best-known 19th century Mexican novels, [[Vicente Riva Palacio]]'s ''Martín Gartuza''. [[Servando Teresa de Mier]] spent time in the jail here, and this court sentenced [[Miguel Hidalgo]] to [[defrocking]] and [[excommunication]] before his 1811 execution. Soon after, in 1820, the Inquisition was officially disbanded in Mexico.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

== Architectural history ==
The building that stands at the site now was built between 1732 and 1736 by [[Pedro de Arrieta]],&lt;ref name="Horz"/&gt;  who also worked on a number of other significant buildings in the city, including the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] and [[Temple of San Felipe Neri "La Profesa"|La Profesa Church]]. Even though Arrieta was famous for his work, he died broke shortly after the completion of the Palace of the Inquisition, for which he received a daily wage of two pesos.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; 

Originally Arrieta constructed a two-story building, with a third floor added in the 19th century.  As the headquarters of the Inquisition, this building had hearing rooms, judges chambers, a secret chamber, a jail and accommodations for two inquisitors.&lt;ref name="Horz"/&gt; The Palace was popularly known as the "Casa Chata" or "Squat-faced House." This referred to southwest corner, which faces Santo Domingo plaza that is seemingly cut off or pushed in. The Palace jail was known as "Of Perpetuity," since few left soon after being confined.&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt;

== Post-Inquistion history ==
[[File:MainPatioMusMedDF.JPG|thumb|Main patio]]
After the end of the Inquisition, in 1838, it was put up for sale by [[public auction]], but no one offered the minimum price. It was finally purchased by the archbishopric.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; Later it served as lottery offices, a primary school and a military barracks.&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt; In 1854, it was sold to the School of Medicine, which at the time was offering classes in professors' homes. After the purchase, a number of changes were made, and a boarding school created here.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;  Eventually, it would become the school of medicine and nursing of the National University (today's UNAM)&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt; In 1873, in despair over an unrequited love, romantic poet [[Manuel Acuña]] committed suicide by poison in a room here.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; In 1879, after modification, the old chapel became the Academy of Medicine and a third floor was added, which resulted in the removal of the crest which held the coat-of-arms of the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

When all the faculties of UNAM, including the School of Medicine, moved to the Ciudad Universitaria in the 1950s, this Palace was is such poor shape that a number of its arches were in danger of crashing to the ground. Restoration work commenced shortly afterwards and was completed in 1980. In 1982, the building that once was the prison was reintegrated into the main complex and since then has been used as a theater and to accommodate the lectures of visiting professors.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;
[[File:AntesalaMedMusDF.JPG|thumb|left|First exhibition room of the museum]]
Today the building still belongs to UNAM and functions as the Museum of Medicine. This museum was inaugurated on 22 December 1980, and designed as a way to preserve the history of medicine in Mexico as well as promote the values associated with this field. It was also considered to be a way to conserve one of the properties that UNAM still holds in the historic downtown area. The museum has 24 rooms that cover the history of medicine in this country from pre-Hispanic times to the 20th century. Among its collections are a room devoted to indigenous herbal medicine, various rooms devoted to old medical equipment and machines, a room about human development and a collection of wax figures used for the teaching of disease pathologies.&lt;ref name="museo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facmed.unam.mx/palacio/Museomm/MPresentacion.html |language=Spanish |title=Museo de la Medicina Mexicana – Presentación |accessdate=2009-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531145135/http://www.facmed.unam.mx/palacio/Museomm/MPresentacion.html |archivedate=2009-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:HangingArchMedMusDF.JPG|thumb|One of the "hanging arches"]]
Like many other buildings in the historic downtown, the facade is covered in ''tezontle'' (a blood-red porous volcanic stone), with windows and doors framed with ''chiluca'' (a grayish-white stone), but the building has two main notable features. This first is that its main portal is located at the southwest corner, which is "cut off" in order to face Santo Domingo Plaza. Arrieta came up with the idea, an innovation in the Viceroyalty of Nueva España. With this design, not only would the building face the plaza, its two side streets would lead to its door. Despite the fact that this very feature would earn the Palace the nickname of "squat-faced," his idea was initially declared innovative and beautiful. The other feature is the patio. The arches on the four corners do not rest on columns, but seem to hang from the ceiling. In fact, they are crossed arches that are supported by pillars attached to the walls and the first columns on each side.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

A '''patient lift''' ('''patient hoist''', '''jack hoist''', '''hydraulic lift''') may be either a '''sling lift''' or '''sit-to-stand lift'''. This is an assistive device that allows [[patient]]s in [[hospital]]s and [[nursing home]]s and people receiving [[home health care]] to be transferred between a bed and a chair or other similar resting places, by the use of electrical or hydraulic power. Sling lifts are used for patients whose mobility is limited. Sling lifts are mobile (or floor) lifts or overhead lifts (suspended from ceiling, wall-mounted or overhead tracks).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mpKNG260hIgC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=%22hoyer+lift%22 | title = Pocket Guide for the Home Care Aide | isbn = 978-0-8342-1161-2 | author1 = Gingerich | first1 = Barbara Stover | last2 = Ondeck | first2 = Deborah Anne | date = 1998-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T_h5ixNOjEEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA484&amp;dq=%22hoyer+lift%22 | title = Delmar's fundamental and advanced nursing skills | isbn = 978-1-4018-1069-6 | author1 = Altman | first1 = Gaylene | date = 2003-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sling lift has several advantages.  It allows heavy patients to be transferred while decreasing stress on caregivers while also reducing the number of nursing staff required to move patients. It also reduces the chance of orthopedic injury from lifting patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6DgTKGcGOwsC&amp;pg=PA621&amp;dq=%22hoyer+lift%22 | title = Nurses' guide to clinical procedures | isbn = 978-0-7817-5379-1 | author1 = Smith-Temple | first1 = Jean | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Joyce Young | date = 2005-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another kind of sling lift, which is called a ceiling lift, can be permanently installed on the ceiling of a room in order to save space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cP5Wi0Idxa0C&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=%22hoyer+lift%22 | title = Stroke and the family: A new guide | isbn = 978-0-674-01513-5 | author1 = Stein | first1 = Joel | date = 2004-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistakes using patient lifts may result in serious injury and some injuries that have been caused by improper use or malfunction of sling lifts have led to civil lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7Kp-_MhPHPIC&amp;dq=%22hoyer+lift%22&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;q=hoyer+lift | title = Legal nurse consulting: Principles and practice | isbn = 978-0-8493-1418-6 | author1 = Iyer | first1 = Patricia W | last2 = Consultants | first2 = American Association of Legal Nurse | date = 2002-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pharmaceutics''' is the discipline of [[pharmacy]] that deals with the process of turning a [[new chemical entity]] (NCE) or old drugs into a medication to be used safely and effectively by patients.  It is also called the science of dosage form design.  There are many chemicals with [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] properties, but need special measures to help them achieve therapeutically relevant amounts at their sites of action. Pharmaceutics helps relate the formulation of drugs to their delivery and disposition in the body.&lt;ref name="washington1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sop.washington.edu/pharmaceutics/about/what-is-pharmaceutics.html |title=What is Pharmaceutics? &amp;amp;#124; Pharmaceutics |publisher=Sop.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pharmaceutics deals with the formulation of a pure drug substance into a [[dosage form]].
Branches of pharmaceutics include:
*[[Pharmaceutical formulation]]
*
*[[Pharmaceutical manufacturing]]
*Dispensing pharmacy
*Pharmaceutical technology
*Physical pharmacy
*Pharmaceutical jurisprudence
Pure drug substances are usually white [[crystalline]] or [[amorphous]] powders. Historically before the advent of medicine as a science it was common for pharmacists to dispense drugs ''as is'', most drugs today are administered as parts of a dosage form. The clinical performance of drugs depends on their form of presentation to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=edited by Gilbert S.

'''Sheikh Sayera Khatun Medical College''' ({{lang-bn|শেখ সায়েরা খাতুন মেডিকেল কলেজ}}) is a [[Public university|government]] [[medical college]] in [[Bangladesh]], established in 2011. It is located in [[Gopalganj, Bangladesh|Gopalganj]]. The college is affiliated with [[Dhaka University]] as a [[constituent college]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.du.ac.bd/list_of_colleges.php|title=List of Constituent Colleges/Institutes under the University of Dhaka|website=University of Dhaka|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124215439/http://www.du.ac.bd/list_of_colleges.php|archive-date=24 November 2014|access-date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Sayera Khatun Medical College was named after [[Sheikh Sayera Khatun]], mother of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the "Father of the Nation",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rahman,_Bangabandhu_Sheikh_Mujibur|title=Rahman, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[grandmother]] of [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Sheikh Hasina|Sheik Hasina]].

Sheikh Sayera Khatun Medical College began with only 50 students and few [[infrastructure]] facilities. The first step in its creation and expansion was the training of [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] students.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Organization and administration==
In 2014, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) was reportedly unable to attract applicants for lectureships at the college in the basic subjects of [[anatomy]], [[biochemistry]], and [[physiology]]. As a [[Stopgap|stop gap]] measure, the college borrowed teachers from other medical schools in order to keep classes running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Uzzal |first=Moniruzzaman |date=9 March 2014 |title=Young doctors shy away from teaching  |url=http://archive.dhakatribune.com/education/2014/mar/09/young-doctors-shy-away-teaching |newspaper=Dhaka Tribune |access-date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrance examination==
Every year, after passing their Higher Secondary School Certificate examinations, nearly 90,000 applicants from all over the country sit for the medical college admission test. The top 3000 students get the opportunity to study at the Sheikh Sayera Khatun Medical College.

'''St John New Zealand''' (also often referred to as '''St John Ambulance of New Zealand''') is a charitable organisation providing healthcare services to the [[New Zealand]] public. The organisation provides [[Emergency medical services in New Zealand|ambulance services]] throughout New Zealand, and also plays an increasing role in meeting the broader health needs of New Zealand communities through a number of health services and products.

== Services ==
St John services include [[Emergency medical services in New Zealand|emergency]] and non-emergency ambulance treatment and transport, event medical services, [[first aid]] training, the sale of first aid kits and supplies, programmes offering non-clinical support for patients and their family and friends, [[medical alarm]]s, caring callers who phone to check on someone’s well-being and health shuttles to help people with impaired mobility attend essential appointments.

=== Ambulance services ===
St John provides [[ambulance]] services for approximately 90% of New Zealand’s population. The only area where the organisation does not provide emergency ambulance services is the [[Wellington Region|Greater Wellington region]] (specifically the areas of the Capital and Coast, Hutt Valley, and Wairarapa [[District Health Board|DHB]]s), where [[Wellington Free Ambulance]] is the provider. 
St John treated or transported 469,850 patients in the year ending 30 June 2017, attending more than 389,350 emergency incidents. The 655 ambulances or operational vehicles, based at 205 stations, covered more than 18 million kilometres in the same time.&lt;ref name="2012 annual report"&gt;{{cite book|title=St John Annual Report|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The St John Ambulance Service comprises:
* Owning and running the [[111 (emergency telephone number)|111 emergency]] Ambulance Communication Centres in Auckland and Christchurch and a third in Wellington, in a joint venture with [[Wellington Free Ambulance]]
* Emergency ambulance services (ambulance and first responders)
* Managing the PRIME (Primary Response in Medical Emergencies) programme. This project is funded by the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] and [[Accident Compensation Corporation|ACC]] to provide both the coordinated response and appropriate management of emergencies in rural locations, using the skills of specially trained general practitioners and registered nurses
* Transporting patients for arranged hospital admissions and to hospital outpatient clinics (Health Shuttles)
* Transferring patients between hospitals or from hospital to home (Patient Transfer Service)
* Coordinating and staffing air ambulance flights and connections with the four Westpac rescue helicopter services operating in New Zealand
* Clinical education

==== Ambulance communication centres ====
When a person dials [[111 (emergency telephone number)|111]] for an ambulance in New Zealand, the call goes to one of three Emergency Ambulance Control Centres (EACCs) located in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. St John owns and runs the Ambulance Communication Centres in Auckland and Christchurch. The Wellington Ambulance Control Centre is run in a joint venture with [[Wellington Free Ambulance]]. Dispatchers at the centres have medical knowledge and are trained to dispatch and coordinate all land, water and air ambulance services.

=== First aid ===
In addition to ambulance services, St John provide first aid training courses, kits and supplies, [[automated external defibrillator|automated external defibrillators (AEDs)]] and first aid smart phone applications.

St John offers various levels of first aid training ranging from basic training courses for the general public, to courses which help businesses meet the requirements of the Health and Safety in Employment Act, to advanced resuscitation training for health professionals. St John also offers specialised courses such as child, sports, electrical workers, outdoor and maritime first aid training.

St John is registered with the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]](NZQA). The organisation is also a member of the NZ Resuscitation Council (NZRC) and the Association of Emergency Care Training Providers (AECTP). 

Organisations can purchase [[Automated external defibrillator|AEDs]] from St John and learn how to use them. St John also sells first aid kits and supplies for home or business use.

=== Youth programmes ===
[[St John Youth New Zealand|St John Youth]] programmes help young New Zealanders to develop first aid, health care, leadership and life skills. Penguins are aged 6 to 8, Cadets are aged 8 to 18. These programmes are fully funded by donations.

St John Youth has 6,337 Youth Members and 1,119 Youth Leaders as of 30 June 2017

=== Community programmes ===
St John provides health shuttles, [[St John Youth New Zealand|youth programmes]], hospital friends, phone friends and [[Pet therapy|pet outreach therapy]] to help people live independently, get the social connections they need and improve their wellbeing. These services are run primarily by volunteers and are often free of charge.

==== Health Shuttles ====
The St John Health Shuttle is a free community service that transports people to essential medical and health-related appointments, and then brings them home again.

==== Caring Caller ====
Caring Caller is a service that St John provides for people who live alone or feel a bit lonely. Volunteers phone clients regularly to check that everything is OK. This free service is fully funded by donations.

==== Friends of the Emergency Department/Hospital Friends ====
St John runs hospital volunteer programmes called FEDs and Hospital Friends. Our people provide comfort and support to patients, their whanau and friends. Friends of the Emergency Department (FED) and Hospital Friends volunteers provide comfort and support to patients and their families in hospital emergency departments, as well as other departments and smaller hospitals.

==== ASB St John in Schools ====
The ASB St John in Schools programme visits schools to give children an understanding of how to recognise, and act appropriately in, a first aid emergency The topic range includes how to call an ambulance and basic first aid. The ASB St John in Schools programme visits schools in many parts of New Zealand to give children an understanding of how to recognise, and act appropriately in, a first aid emergency. The topic range includes how to call an ambulance, basic first aid skills and familiarisation with ambulances and the people and equipment children may interact with in a first aid emergency. ASB St John in Schools caters to a broad age group - from late pre-school age through to intermediate. Topics and teaching strategies are all appropriate to the age of the children.

==== Partnered programmes ====
St John partners with other organisations to provide Healthline (a free 24x7 health advice helpline), Outreach Therapy Pets and PRIME (a programme that uses the skills of specially-trained rural GPs and/or rural nurses to support the St John Ambulance Service during medical emergencies in remote areas).

=== Event medical services ===
St John is NZ’s number one provider of event medical services. They look after events of all sizes, from high-profile international sports matches to small community fairs. St John is New Zealand’s number one provider of medical services at events. They provide medical coverage at some of the largest and most high-profile events in the country but also look after small events, like school gala days and community fairs.

=== St John medical alarms ===
The St John [[Medical alarm|Medical Alarm]] service is designed to help people live independently for longer. The alarm is a pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist. If the person has an accident or feels unwell or at risk they can press the emergency button on the alarm. St John immediately calls the person, speaking through a loudspeaker in the alarm’s base unit. If the person does not answer, an ambulance is dispatched.

== Volunteers ==
St John is a charitable organisation which relies on its volunteer workforce to deliver health services to the New Zealand population. Volunteers outnumber paid employees by around three to one. In 2017, 9,232 people volunteered for St John and the organisation had 3,033 paid staff. If the St John volunteer contribution was valued at normal commercial rates it would equate to $30 million.&lt;ref name="2012 annual report" /&gt; St John volunteers receive specialised training and clinical education.

== Funding ==
[[File:St John ambulance Dunedin.jpg|thumb|right|234px|St John ambulance travelling with lights and siren (Priority 1) in [[Dunedin]]]]&lt;!-- this image is aligned to infobox width - please change if infobox width is changed --&gt;

Contracts with the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]], [[Accident Compensation Corporation|ACC]] and [[District Health Boards (New Zealand)|District Health Boards]] fund just under 80% of the direct operating costs of the St John ambulance service.&lt;ref name="2012 annual report" /&gt;

The difference is made up from community and corporate donations, fund-raising, revenue from commercial activities (first aid kits, first aid training, medical alarms and defibrillators), as well as income from emergency ambulance part charges.

These activities also fund the delivery of non-ambulance services such as the St John Youth programmes, Friends of the Emergency Department, Hospital Friends, Caring Caller, St John Safe Kids and Outreach Therapy Pets.

=== ASB partnership ===
In 2008, St John and [[ASB Bank]] initiated a partnership. The partnership helps to expand support for St John services and deliver programmes like [[CPR]] training on a wide scale. At the same time, the partnership gives ASB the opportunity to strengthen connections with local communities and give their employees the opportunity to get involved with community services by volunteering for St John.

The partnership was launched with ASB providing the opportunity for 1,000 school children at 10 schools to learn the lifesaving resuscitation skill CPR for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Local gym staff all heart, says Ken|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/593382|accessdate=26 November 2012|newspaper=Waikato Times|date=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Order of St John ==
[[Image:St John NZ Ambulance.JPG|thumb|right|234px|A St John ambulance in Auckland]]&lt;!-- this image is aligned to infobox width - please change if infobox width is changed --&gt;
St John in New Zealand has global links to the international [[Venerable Order of St John|Order of St John]]. [[Her Majesty the Queen]] is Sovereign Head of the Order and the [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] is the head or [[Prior]] of St John in New Zealand. 

In 1888, in recognition of its work, [[Queen Victoria]] made the Order of St John a [[Order of chivalry|Royal Order of Chivalry]]. In New Zealand, [[Order (honour)|Royal Honours]] continue to be awarded to members for outstanding contributions and commitment to care for their communities. These Royal Honours are an independent part of the [[New Zealand Honours System]]. Honours are conferred annually at St John [[Investiture|investiture services]].

== History ==
A branch of the [[St. John Ambulance|St John Ambulance]] was first founded in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, on 30 April 1885.&lt;ref name="inaugural meeting"&gt;{{cite news |title=St John Ambulance Association |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TS18850501.2.38 |accessdate=7 September 2013 |newspaper=Star |date=1 May 1885 |issue=6288 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided to appoint the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] ([[William Jervois]]) as president, and the mayors of [[Mayor of Christchurch|Christchurch]] ([[Charles Hulbert (mayor)|Charles Hulbert]]), [[Sydenham, New Zealand|Sydenham]] ([[William White (New Zealand politician)|William White]]), and [[St Albans, New Zealand|St Albans]] (Benjamin Bull) as vice-presidents.&lt;ref name="inaugural meeting" /&gt; Further branches quickly spread across the country providing first aid and patient transport and in 1946, due to the efforts of St John in New Zealand during the [[Second World War]], the organisation was elevated to a full [[Priory]], with the Governor-General of New Zealand as the Prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Graeme |title=First to Care |year=2009 |publisher=Libro International |location=[[Auckland]] |isbn=978-1-877514-03-6 |pages=30, 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the 1970s and 1980s much restructuring took place in response to changing social and economic conditions, moving away from the traditional militaristic structure and resulting in the current modern organisation.

Today, St John New Zealand is a major health service provider in New Zealand. They provide 90% of the emergency and non-emergency ambulance coverage for the New Zealand population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St John wants cash from Govt doubled|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10470517|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; emergency care and first aid at public events, support phone lines for the elderly and house-bound, hospital patient transport, public first aid training, health products and a youth programme.

The '''Transfer of the São Francisco River''' is a large-scale [[interbasin transfer]] to the dry [[sertão]] in the four northeastern states of [[Ceara]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Paraiba]] and [[Pernambuco]] in [[Brazil]]. The project, which was given the green light to go ahead by Brazil's government in 2005, is estimated to cost US$2 billion and is expected to improve the lives of 12m people. After legal challenges were brought against the project, the Supreme Court allowed it to go ahead in December 2007.

==Technical aspects==
The project would divert 1.4% of the river's water for municipal water supply, industry and irrigation. Municipal water supply would receive priority over other uses, which would only be catered for when the [[Sobradinho Reservoir]] behind the [[Sobradinho Dam]] on the [[São Francisco River]], which produces much of the region's electricity, is nearly full about 40% of the time. The project actually consists of two transfers:The East axis would transfer water to the [[Paraíba do Norte River]], while the North axis would transfer water to the [[Jaguaribe River|Jaguaribe]] and [[Piranhas River|Piranhas]] rivers. The project includes 700&amp;nbsp;km of canals and tunnels, as well as several dams. It is expected to displace almost a million people and construction is expected to take 20 years to complete.

==Criticism and controversy==
Critics of the project argue that beneficiary states should improve management of their own water before importing it from outside the region. Bishop Luiz Flávio Cappio from [[Bahia]] also wonders why water is being exported when 3m poor live along the Sao Francisco river's course, many of them without running water and proper sanitation. He argues that the transfer “will demand huge resources that could be spent on other projects much closer to the reality of the people”. It is also being said that the project will mainly benefit richer farmers who already have irrigation infrastructure in place and not rainfed farmers that are hardest hit by drought. The alleged insufficiency of water in the Sao Francisco River itself during the dry season, and its consequent impact on aquatic ecosystems, is another argument of critics. For example, João Alves Filho, governor of the state of [[Sergipe]], says that there are already “signs of mortality” where the river joins the sea. Marco Antônio Tavares Coelho, a prominent opponent, says that "aridity is the natural state of the sertão" and that soaking it would be like "removing ice from the North Pole".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=E1_VDNVJPG The bishop and the saint:Brazil's São Francisco river project], The Economist, Oct 13th 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the World Bank reportedly refused to finance the project because of its limited impact in combating poverty and drought.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in « Un projet d'eaux détournées risque d'assoiffer davantage le Nordeste », Le Temps, 13 octobre 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''VeNom Coding Group''' is a group of veterinary academics and practitioners from across Britain who have devised a standardized terminology for use in veterinary medicine.  These codes are available to academic or research institutes, software manufacturers or veterinary practices after a request for a permission.

==VeNom Codes Membership==
The VeNom Codes have been developed in the first opinion and referral hospitals at the RVC in collaboration with Glasgow Vet School and the PDSA and are now maintained by a multi-institution group of veterinary clinicians and IT specialists from the [[Royal Veterinary College|RVC]], [[Glasgow Veterinary College|Glasgow Vet School]] and the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals|PDSA]] called the [http://www.venomcoding.org VeNom Coding Group].

A small group of members from various institutes manage and maintain the list of terms, and invite or authorize others to use the term.  A second group of members provide the scientific input to ensure the list is peer reviewed and correct - these members can be any one who uses the list.  Any disputes over the list will be solved by a general consensus and overseen by the management group.

==VeNom Codes==
The VENOM codes comprise an extensive, standardised list of terms for recording the best available diagnosis at the end of an animal visit. It comprises mainly diagnoses but also includes terms appropriate for administrative transactions (e.g. non prescription diet sales, over the counter items, travel related items) and preventive health visits (vaccination(s), routine parasite control, neutering). In the event that the clinician seeing the animal feels unable to record a diagnosis for the visit (for example, on a first consultation when only limited diagnostic workup has been possible, e.g. coughing where a precise diagnosis is not yet available) it is also possible to select one or more presenting complaints (again, these are standardised in the list). If an item is missing from the list, please advise us and we will make the necessary adjustments if required. We are currently working on other lists (procedures etc.) and these will be added to the VENOM codes in due course.

The VENOM codes are a long list of conditions (Term name) identified by their unique numeric codes (Data Dictionary Id). There is a label field to identify the type of term (Container and Container ID–e.g. diagnosis, presenting complaint, administrative task etc.). The Top level modelling field includes the parent grouping / body system for each term. There is also a CRIS Active flag which is elected if the PMS prefers the referral centre version. In this version presenting complaints are stated without 'presenting complaint - ' prefix and the administrative tasks are excluded. For the first opinion version the Rx Active flag field allows selection of this version and includes presenting complaints with the prefix ‘presenting complaint -’ to highlight this is not strictly a diagnosis. The final field is the Active Flag key which indicates if the term is active or has been inactivated.

The VENOM Codes have been developed in the first opinion and referral hospitals at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in collaboration with Glasgow Vet School and the PDSA and the codes are now maintained by a multi-institution group of veterinary clinicians and IT experts from the RVC, Glasgow Vet School and the PDSA called the VENOM Coding Group. The codes are a long list identified by their unique numeric code and work best with a multi-letter search function–so clinicians type ‘abs’ and get all possible terms with abs as first letters of any of the words in the diagnosis–e.g. ‘anal sac abscess’, ‘abscess–neck (cervical)’,…etc. For some terms there are synonyms in brackets behind the main term to allow identification of the correct term if these letters are typed in the search box.

The main concern for VENOM Codes is that all PMS’s and other end-users that adopt the VENOM codes also adopt the rules of the VENOM Coding group–namely that the VENOM Coding group maintains the list. If, for example, a practitioner requests a new item, then you forward the request to us (or they go direct to us). We then put it to the VENOM Coding group to vote on and if approved it is added to the list, if not it doesn’t go on the list. Our turn around on new items is 3-5 working days currently. The new item would be added to the list and then emailed out to each computer management system that uses the codes to upload to their system and practices. We are now working to 3 monthly updates, though can issue additional updates if end-users require specific terms to be added sooner. We also request that the diagnostic lists used by the PMS’s and other end-users are kept restricted to the standard VENOM terms and that practitioners can not their own terms as they go along.

==The Data Dictionary==
The codes are a long list identified by their unique numeric codes (Data dictionary id) and work well with a multi-letter search function–so clinicians type ‘abs’ and get all possible terms with abs as first letters of any of the words in the diagnosis–e.g. ‘anal sac abscess’, ‘abscess–neck (cervical)’,…etc. For some terms there are synonyms in brackets behind the main term to allow identification of the correct term if these letters are typed in the search box. Apart from the Term name and data dictionary id (numeric code), there is a label field to identify the type of term and then currently the other fields of the codes include a 'CRIS active flag' which is elected if you want the referral version–presenting complaints without 'presenting complaint' prefix and without the admin tasks etc. Otherwise for the first opinion version the ‘Rx Active flag’ field allows selection of this version. The final field is the Active flag which indicates if the term is active or has been inactivated.

'''William B. Downs''' (1899–January 13, 1966) was an American [[orthodontics|orthodontist]] who is known for developing the first [[cephalometric analysis]] for orthodontics, [[cephalometric analysis#Downs analysis|the Downs analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGonagle|first1=Robert|title=Dr. William B.

==Life==
He was born in 1899 in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and was the oldest of three children. He moved to [[Batavia, Illinois]] in 1904 with his family where his father established his practice as a dentist. Downs went to [[Batavia High School (Batavia, Illinois)]] and became interested in studying agriculture. He went to [[Two Dot, Montana]] where he oversaw a sheep ranch for his father. Downs then returned to Illinois after two years and enrolled himself in [[University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry]]. He received his dental degree in 1926. He became a Professor in the Crown and Bridge Department of Dental School at UIC for next four years. He then enrolled himself in the first class of graduate Orthodontics at the University of Illinois and graduated with a master's degree in 1931.

==Career==
He then taught at UIC Dental School until 1955 in the graduate department. Dr. Downs was interested in facial growth and development throughout his career. He worked on the "''Cephalometric Appraisal of Treated Result'' and ''Variations in Facial Relationships: Their Significance in Treatment and Prognosis''. This paper won him first prize from the American Association of Orthodontists in 1948, and it led to the first cephalometric analysis in the field of Orthodontics. Dr. Downs developed what is called Downs Cephalometric Analysis which assess facial growth and development through the analysis of a Cephalometric Radiographic Image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGonagle|first1=Robert|title=Dr. William B. Downs: Man of his work|journal=Angle Orthodontist|date=1975|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219%281975%29045%3C0304%3ADWBDAM%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the Chicago Association of Orthodontists and Tweed Foundation.

Dr. Downs retired in 1965 due to ill health.

==Awards==
* [[Albert H. Ketcham]] Award, 1961
* Execute Council of Angle Society of Orthodontia
* Diplomate of American Board of Orthodontics

The '''Yellow Card Scheme''' is the UK system for collecting information on suspected [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) to medicines. The scheme allows the safety of the medicines and vaccines that are on the market to be monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/the-yellow-card-scheme/ |title=The Yellow Card Scheme |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scheme was founded in 1964 after the [[thalidomide]] disaster, and was developed by [[Bill Inman]].  It is run by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) and the [[Commission on Human Medicines]]. It was extended to hospital pharmacists in 1997, and to community pharmacists in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NHS70: major moments in pharmacy 1948–2018 |url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20205049.article?utm_campaign=2483_PJ_weekly_roundup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Pharmaceutical%20Journal |accessdate=4 September 2018 |publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal |date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspected adverse reactions are collected on all licensed medicines and vaccines, from those issued on prescription to medicines bought over the counter from a pharmacist or supermarket.  The Scheme also includes all herbal preparations and unlicensed medicines. Adverse reactions can be reported by anyone; this is usually done by healthcare professionals – including doctors, pharmacists and nurses – but patients and carers can also make reports.

The sort of adverse reactions that should be reported are:

* those that have caused death or a serious illness
* Any adverse reaction, however minor, if associated with a new medicine or one that is under continued monitoring (highlighted in the [[British National Formulary]] with a ▼ [[Black triangle (pharmacology)|black triangle]])
* Any adverse reaction, however minor, if associated with a child (under 18 years of age) or in pregnancy

Yellow Cards are available from pharmacies and a few are presented near the back of the BNF as tear-off pages, copies may also be obtained by telephoning +44 (0) 808 100 3352.&lt;ref&gt;''A side effect of your medicine? Report it using Yellow Card''  leaflet (2008) {{full|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme provides forms that allow members of the public to report suspected side effects, as well as health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/downloadable-information/reporting-forms/ |title=Downloadable information: Reporting forms |publisher=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHS Information Standards Board for Health and Social Care has issued an information standard for electronic submission of adverse reactions by IT systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isb.nhs.uk/library/standard/243/ Standard ISB 1582]&lt;/ref&gt; This is based upon the ICS E2B (R2) international standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E2B/Step4/E2B_R2__Guideline.pdf Maintenance of the ICH Guideline On Clinical Safety Data Management : Data Elements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports E2b(R2) ]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015 a Yellow Card [[smartphone]] app was launched for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], allowing patients, carers and healthcare workers to report adverse reactions to medications, as well as enabling them to set up alerts for news on particular drugs and find out how many Yellow Cards a medicine has received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Digital evolution for ground-breaking Yellow Card Scheme |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-evolution-for-ground-breaking-yellow-card-scheme|publisher=[[gov.uk]]|date=2015-07-14 |access-date=2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yellow Card Centre Scotland is a joint venture between MHRA and the [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yccscotland.scot.nhs.uk/Pages/default.aspx |title=Yellow Card Centre Scotland |publisher=Yellow Card Centre Scotland |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
