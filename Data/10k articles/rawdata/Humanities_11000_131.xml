      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">'''Alexander Golod''' is a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] former defense contractor and current scientist and alternative healer, focusing on [[Pyramidology|pyramid research]]. He has theorized that pyramid structures have energy forces that bring several benefits, for both man and the environment. He has constructed seventeen fiberglass pyramids throughout Russia, the tallest at a height of 132&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web| title =Russians Seek Healing in Pyramids| work =abc News| url =http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rust&gt;{{cite web| title =Moscow pyramid gives out good vibrations| work =Russia Today| publisher =YouTube| date =Sep 2, 2008| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGEip84wu7A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abo&gt;{{cite web| title =ABO Company| work =Abo| url =http://www.abo.ru/english.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pyrm&gt;{{cite web| title =About| work =pyramids.ru| url =http://www.pyramids.ru/english.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pyramid-golod.jpg|thumb|View of Golod's largest pyramid]]

He believes that the [[ancient Egypt]]ians had knowledge of this power and that it was the motivation, at least in part, for their building the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]].&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rust/&gt;

==Pyramid research==
Many paranormal researchers and writers have long speculated about the potential energy properties of pyramid structures. Many theories are prevalent in the research, with writers believing pyramids to have several beneficial properties. Golod's research has been done whilst coordinating a team of scientists. The [[Russian Academy of Medical Sciences]] supports his research.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=abo/&gt;&lt;ref name=pyrm/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{cite web| last =Stack| first =Megan| title =Russians seek wisdom, powers, peace of the mysterious pyramid| work =Los Angeles Times| date =Aug 10, 2008| url =http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2008/08/10/russians_seek_wisdom_powers_peace_of_the_mysterious_pyramid/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golod has constructed over twenty pyramids across Russia and former Soviet satellites out of fiberglass  and other materials. The largest of these structures is 44 meters high and weighs roughly 55 tons.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rust/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; Golod believes that the pyramid shape channels Earth's magnetic fields and creates positive energy fields that can be harnessed and controlled for man's use.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rust/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; Inside the largest he has placed a number of  benches and large globes – geographical, topographical, and astronomical - for tourists to enjoy.&lt;ref name=abo/&gt;&lt;ref name=pyrm/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

Among the many benefits Golod has claimed is a cause of these pyramids are:
* A boost in immune system strength in fighting pathogens;. He has claimed that persons who enter the pyramid “will not become ill with cancer, AIDS, Alzheimers disease, or other sicknesses.”&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; 
* Medicines becoming more effective after exposure to the pyramids; 
* Greater crop yield to seeds exposed to the pyramids;
* Presence of an ion column that reportedly repairs Ozone layer;
* Effects of radioactivity are lessened;
*Cure impotence;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rust/&gt;&lt;ref name=abo/&gt;&lt;ref name=pyrm/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; 
*Moderate weather.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

Golod also reported held an experiment on prisoners in which they were fed food that had been exposed to the pyramid. The prison reported that acts of violence diminished significantly. Russian astronauts were also reported to have taken objects and water from the pyramid on board the [[International Space Station]] to keep themselves healthy. He has also stated “If you put some cheap wine in here, it becomes superior to the finest vintage”.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rust/&gt;&lt;ref name=abo/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; Athletes are reported to visit the pyramid to receive a boost of energy and strength from its powers.&lt;ref name=pyrm/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

Tourists come from all around the former Soviet states, as well as globally, to see the pyramids, which can be visited free of charge. Golod earns revenues through merchandise reportedly “energized” by the pyramid, including crystals and bottled water. In addition, it is common for weddings and other special events to be held within. A number of tourists have claimed they experienced positive results after visiting the pyramid.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rust/&gt;&lt;ref name=abo/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; Success stories range from barren women being able to conceive after exposure, to the ozone layer above Russia being repaired.&lt;ref name=pyrm/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Many Russian doctors and scientists have claimed that the effects are likely psychological when someone enters the pyramid and expects to feel better. Many believe the pyramids are simply a tourist gimmick. There is no scientific consensus on the plausibility of Golod's research. Critics also state empirical evidence is lacking to prove that the pyramids are the actual cause of any healing or other benefits. Mainstream scientists, especially in the west, do not accept his theories due a substantial lack of published scientific evidence, with Golod relying heavily on observational inference.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rust/&gt;

There are also a number of tourists who do not share the same enthusiasm as others, claiming that they experienced no changes whatsoever from exposure to the pyramid. Those with ailments did not recover or feel any better. In one case, after hearing of the greater crop yield, one farmer brought his seeds to the pyramid, only to yield a worse crop than the previous season.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rust/&gt;

==Personal life==
Golod and his family live near one of the pyramids he has constructed. He is married with children and grandsons.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

[[File:Proudly UnAustralian.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Proudly UnAustralian'' by Azlan McLennan, confiscated by the Victoria Police in Melbourne, 2006.]]
Conceptually, McLennan's work tends to be unambiguous and antagonistic from a left-wing perspective, loosely following the traditions of [[agitprop]], [[anti-art]] and [[Institutional Critique]], incorporating elements of [[détournement]], [[readymade]] or [[installation art|installation]]. His works have often been characterised as controversial by conservative politicians, journalists and art critics, usually portraying the artist in a negative light.&lt;ref name="The politics"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/13/1084289821310.html "The politics of art"] ''The Age,'' 14 May 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, various liberal lawyers, academics and activists have defended his works, usually on the basis of [[free speech]], due to the offence sometimes caused by his art for its often overt left-leaning bias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visualarts.net.au/files/NQ%20Dec%2008_fin.pdf "25 Years: NAVA at the forefront of Australia’s cultural policy agenda"] ''NAVA Quarterly''. December 2008. Accessed 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The artist has expressed public criticisms over [[Zionism]], the [[War on Terror]], [[Australian nationalism]] and racism, the [[Mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention]] of [[asylum seekers]], various political figures and the [[managerial class]] of the [[art world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WhLNCpl6XgEJ:www.visualarts.net.au/files/Art_Censorship.pdf "Dealing With Art Censorship"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''National Association for the Visual Arts'' Media Release, 30 March 2009.

== Controversy ==

=== Victorian College of the Arts ===
In August 2003, McLennan hired a [[G4S|Group 4 Securicor]] guard to keep gallery punters out of an exhibition opening at the VCA. Group 4 run [[immigration detention]] centres in Australia, such as [[Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Baxter Detention Centre]] and the now closed [[Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|Woomera Detention Centre]]. The security guard was reportedly humiliated due to the incident which occurred at a time of high criticism of the [[John Howard]] government's treatment of [[Refugee#Asylum seekers|asylum seekers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121209182233/http://www.theage.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2003/09/03/1062548903857.html "VCA artwork raises ethics concerns"] ''The Age,'' 4 September 2003. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24seven ===
In May 2004, McLennan produced ''Fifty-six,'' an exhibition designed to coincide with [[Nakba Day]], the title drawing on the number of years since the establishment of [[Israel]]. The public exhibition in the shop front window space of 24seven Gallery on one of Melbourne CBD's busy streets, was censored by the [[City of Melbourne]] days after it was installed. The installation consisted of a large wall painting of an Israeli flag, with "debatable" statistics on the gallery's window about Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The scandal made international news, many pro-Israel individuals and groups accusing McLennan of [[antisemitism]]. This put a number of Victorian political figures such as former Premier [[Steve Bracks]], Lord Mayor [[John So]] and former City of Melbourne councillor Kimberly Kitching under pressure to respond. The use of taxpayer's money to fund the space fuelled a lot of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.discoverymedia.com.au/artzinePub/story.asp?id=375&amp;section=ExNews "Making Space – spanking the hand that feeds it"] ''Art Right Now,'' 16 June 2007. Accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan also deeply outraged some critics by insinuating that the [[Nazis]] had a similar position on what they termed [[degenerate art]]. McLennan maintains a strong criticism of Israeli policies.&lt;ref name="The politics" /&gt;

=== Citylights ===
In August 2004, McLennan displayed ''State Sponsored'', a collection of portraits of [[Hamas]] militants, including [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]] and [[Abdul Aziz Rantisi|Dr. Abdul Aziz Rantisi]] and the dates they were assassinated. The work was exhibited at Citylights project – a public art space in a Melbourne CBD lane way. McLennan was accused of glorifying terrorism by Ted Lapkin, a senior policy analyst of the [[Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council]]. Andrew Mac, Citylights' curator and director defended the work on the grounds of diversity of opinion stating the artist's use of "state sponsored" referred to [[state terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Jewish-group-blasts-offensive-artwork/2004/12/10/1102625519852.html "Jewish group blasts 'offensive' artwork"] ''The Age,'' 10 December 2004. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform Artists Group ===
In September 2005, the City of Melbourne intervened to terminate McLennan's ''Canberra's 18'' exhibition shortly before it was scheduled to be shown at the [[Platform artists group]]'s [[Artist-run initiative]] (ARI), Platform 2. The exhibition was to include images of the then 18 Islamic organisations proscribed as terrorists by the Australian Government and the basis for their formation. City of Melbourne Deputy Mayor [[Gary Singer]] claimed the proper guidelines were not followed. Human rights campaigner and barrister [[Julian Burnside]] claimed the censorship was about governments testing how much Australians would tolerate such occurrences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/war-on-terrorism-is-claiming-victims-on-the-walls-of-art-galleries/2005/09/15/1126750082623.html "War on terrorism is claiming victims on the walls of art galleries"] ''Sydney Morning Herald,'' 16 September 2005. Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McLennan accused City of Melbourne of political censorship and appeasing Zionists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/09/14/1126377376345.html "City council bans 'terror artwork'"] ''The Age,'' 15 September 2005. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Singer's areas of special interests ironically include [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&amp;pa=1317&amp;pg=1996 "Deputy Lord Mayor Gary Singer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725155111/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=190&amp;pa=1317&amp;pg=1996 |date=25 July 2008 }} ''City of Melbourne,'' Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monash University ===
[[Monash University Art and Design Faculty]] in Melbourne withdrew McLennan's video ''Mind the Gap'' in October 2005, ironically made for the same exhibition Monash had agreed to show the censored ''Canberra's 18'' work. The video contained graphic footage of the [[beheading]] of British contractor [[Kenneth Bigley]] by [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Tawhid and Jihad]] in 2004. The video criticised former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] for his role in the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html "Azlan McLennan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520005543/http://www.unmagazine.org/un7.html |date=20 May 2008 }} ''un Magazine,'' Volume 7, 2006. Accessed 27 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship is likely to have been motivated by the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill 2005]], particularly the controversial return to the crime of [[sedition]] introduced by the Howard government some weeks later and passed into law the following month; a move highly unpopular amongst the arts sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 "Artists 'at risk' under terror laws"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627104653/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=71006 |date=27 June 2006 }} ''NineMSN,'' 8 November 2005. Accessed 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Art ===
City of Melbourne and acting Transport Minister [[Bob Cameron (Victorian politician)|Bob Cameron]] censored ''Pay Your Way'' in January 2006 while McLennan was in residency in Indonesia. The posters – part of the Urbanart ARI program – were displayed in public tram shelters and pulled down only hours later due to complaints. The works featured images of [[Jean Charles de Menezes]], a Brazilian man shot dead by London police and accused Muslim terrorist, [[Joseph T. Thomas|Jack Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/fare-game-shelters-feel-the-brush-of-protest/2006/01/09/1136771500463.html "Fare game! Shelters feel the brush of protest"] ''The Age,'' 10 January 2006.

=== Trocadero Art Space ===
Only weeks after the ''Pay Your Way'' affair, McLennan's ''Proudly UnAustralian'' was removed by the [[Victoria Police]] in Melbourne. The exhibition – featuring a burnt Australian flag – took place at Trocadero Art Space who rents a public billboard to exhibiting artists. It was to coincide with the 2006 [[Australia Day]] in January. The work was removed some days prior this date and McLennan arrived back in Australia days later to a media furore. The scandal had been criticised as offensive by those such as Federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] MP [[Bronwyn Bishop]] who attempted to introduce a ban on [[Flag desecration|flag burning]], and the national president of the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned and Services League]]. [[Free speech]] advocates such as the [[National Association for the Visual Arts]] and criminal defence lawyer Rob Stary denounced the police's actions as an attack on [[civil rights]]. This took place only a few short months after the [[2005 Cronulla riots]] and fuelled the broader debate about [[racism in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm "Art prompts call for flag-burning law change"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211040610/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2006/s1563582.htm |date=11 February 2006 }} ''The 7.30 Report'' (Transcript), 6 February 2006.

McLennan wrote an article in 2006 criticising the Artistic Director of the [[Australian Centre for Contemporary Art]] (ACCA), Juliana Engberg over her reaction to artist and VCA student, Ash Keating and his appropriation of ACCA's waste disposal for the use of his art. The Engberg/Keating scandal became widely known amongst Melbourne art circles from the ACCA exhibition opening where it took place and later through the independent electronic magazine [[Crikey]]. McLennan's polemic further fuelled debate over Engberg's credentials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/power-of-one/2006/08/31/1156817027357.html "Power of one"] ''The Age,'' 1 September 2006.

'''''Behemoth''''', full title '''''Behemoth: the history of the causes of the civil wars of England, and of the counsels and artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1660''''', also known as '''''The Long Parliament''''', is a book written by [[Thomas Hobbes]] discussing the [[English Civil War]]. Published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1681, it was written in 1668, but remained unpublished at the request of [[Charles II of England]].

==Background==
''Behemoth'' was written in 1668 as a follow-up to a previous and scandalous political work, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651).  ''Leviathan'' is a representation of an ideal political world, and ''Behemoth'' has been considered to be a contrasting treatise on what happens when the very worst abuses of government come to pass.&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Martinich. ''Hobbes: A Biography''. (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 323.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbes applied his understanding of the science of human nature to explain why the English Civil War came to pass.  He was able to do this because he "did not make an impassable gulf between his rational understanding on the one hand and the particular events which he witnessed, remembered, or heard about on the other".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Peters. ''Hobbes''. (London: Penguin Books, 1967), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is written in the form of a discourse between two men.  The first speaker, called only "A", is an eyewitness and possible insider to the events of the English Civil War.  The second speaker, referred to as "B", is a student aiming to understand the breakdown in the government of England at that time.  

Hobbes was refused permission by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to publish ''Behemoth''. While the king recognised the correctness of the account of events and issues, he was concerned that the book would not be well received.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Malcolm]], ed. ''Thomas Hobbes: The Correspondence''. Vol. 2 1660–1679. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994), 771.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles withheld his permission to publish, in the hope that Hobbes would avoid further scandal, and perhaps see his reputation as a thinker restored.

The manuscript for ''Behemoth'' was pirated and printed in unauthorised editions in Europe during the 1670s and in a letter to his friend [[John Aubrey]], Hobbes stated his disappointment with this turn of events.&lt;ref name="Malcolm, 772"&gt;Malcolm, 772&lt;/ref&gt; An official edition was released three years after Hobbes' death in 1679, by his literary agent William Crooke. According to [[Aloysius Martinich]], "after its initial success the book was relatively unread and unstudied until there was a resurgence of interest in it in the last quarter of the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Martinich, 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Behemoth'' is not entirely factual, accurate or literal in retelling of the events of the English Civil War but still has value for students of the history of thought or revolution. As Royce MacGillivray puts it:

{{cquote|
"It is noteworthy, however, for the brilliance of the interpretation, the excellence of the prose, the revelation of what it was possible for a profoundly rationalist thinker to conclude about the religious issues of the war, and the interest of seeing this daring and powerful thinker, more fully than he had done elsewhere, apply his philosophy to the state of the catastrophe of the war."&lt;ref&gt;Royce Macgillivray.  "Thomas Hobbes' History of the English Civil War – A Study of ''Behemoth''", &lt;u&gt;''Journal of the History of Ideas''&lt;/u&gt;, Vol. 31, No.2, (Apr.-Jun. 1970), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Hobbes instead is drawing on his memories of the events and on two other possible sources, both written by [[James Heath (historian)|James Heath]] around 1663.&lt;ref&gt;MacGillivray, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; These are ''A Brief Chronicle of all the Chief Actions'' and the expanded ''A Brief Chronicle of the Late Intestine Warr''. It is possible they were simply used as prompts for Hobbes, already 80 years old when he wrote ''Behemoth''. According to MacGillivray very little material from these sources found its way directly into the text.

''The summation below is just that, a summation, and is only the most basic part of each section. No effort is made to correct any inconsistencies introduced into the discussion between the master and the student so that the information may be presented as it was written by Thomas Hobbes.''

== Preface: The Bookseller to the reader ==
The 1682 edition of the book begins with a note from William Crooke in answer to why he was publishing this edition.  Hobbes had made Crooke the caretaker of his literary estate in July 1679.&lt;ref name="Malcolm, 772"/&gt; Crooke knew of the editions of ''Behemoth'' published in Europe and he reasoned that these editions did not show the work in the best possible light due to the many textual errors and omissions.  It would therefore be best to publish an authorized edition to correct these errors and show the work as Hobbes wanted it to be read.  Crooke had as his source a manuscript copy of the text given to him by Thomas Hobbes around 1670.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. ''Behemoth: The History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England, and of the Counsels and Artifices by Which They Were Carried on from the Year 1640 to the Year 1660''. (New York: Burt Franklin, 1963), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Part One: Behemoth, or the Epitome of the Civil Wars of England ==
This is the longest section of the book and roughly covers the period 1640–1642.

The dialogue opens with the student asking the master how it was that a monarch as strong as Charles I should ever have had to face a rebellion.  The master relates that a growing opposition to the crown was promoted by seven factions, each of them for their own ends and not in concert, who stoked the fires of rebellion.  These factions were: Papists, Presbyterians, Independents including other sects of religious faith, those who were corrupted by their reading of the Latin and Greek classics, centres of commerce and trade such as London, those with no means of support who saw the war as a way to profit, and the lack of understanding as to the important role played by the monarchy in society.

The motivations of each of these groups and how they contributed to the Civil War is discussed by the master and the student throughout the first part of the book.  This section has been considered anti-clerical in its leanings as none of the actions of the religious groups involved are shown in any sort of positive light.

The Papists wanted to condemn any ruler who did not offer compliance to the will of Rome.  As Charles I was officially a Protestant, this was not popular.  There were not many Papists in England at this time but they still had a voice that could be heard by their own adherents.   

Presbyterian ministers did not like a king whose queen was a known and practising Catholic.  This translated itself into speeches calling for the exile of the queen and other Papists.  As Catholicism was already severely proscribed against in the late 17th century these calls for expulsion are not unexpected or difficult to understand.

The Independents and the other sects of the Protestant reformation were advocates of liberty and freedom in certain instances especially in the matter of religious choice.  Provided an individual did not want to follow the Roman church their religious views would be tolerated by most of the Protestant groups.

The issue of an absolute monarchy was a crucial cause of the Civil War according to Hobbes.  Many members of the House of Parliament who wanted a monarchy did not want it to be an absolute one.  Instead they desired that it act in consultation with the house before taking action.  Charles I did not see the powers of the crown as being answerable to any but God.  Parliament then acted to withhold required funds from the King in his quest to defeat the rebellious Scots.  The Scots, Hobbes tells us, were in arms over the practice of [[episcopacy]]. This weakened the power of the crown but Charles I drew on the nobility to supply the needed funds for the war. When this source ran out Charles turned to Parliament to raise the [[Ship Money]], a percentage of customs revenue given to the King for the upkeep of the navy, so that he could use these funds to continue the war against the Scots. Parliament declared that illegal and took the crown to court over the issue.

The universities are brought into the discussion at this point. They existed as places where one could learn the classics and supposedly sharpen their minds by doing so. Instead they did not have the wit to read the classics critically and took them at their face value. This translated into certain scholars advocating an idealised form of republic to their students. However they did not teach the many virtues of the monarch to their students who came to see the crown as irresponsible.

Hobbes reminds his student that obedience is all that is required to live a good and peaceful life. This obedience should extend to the crown as it does to God and one's parents but this is not what was preached by the Protestant clergy. Instead they advised disobedience of royal edicts such as the raising privately of funds for the king's use. When this directive for disobedience was coupled with the teachings of ancient rebellions as a way to remove so called despotic domains it left a fertile ground for revolution in England.

== Part Two: Both Sides Prepare for War==
The second section picks up the conversation on the following day and discusses how those who sought rebellion now began to make preparations for it to come to pass.

The people of England had become accustomed to hear from those whom they trusted, namely the bishops and the members of Parliament, how corrupted the crown had become.  Now the discussion turned to a supposed plot by the King and Queen to return the realm to the church of Rome.  The king responded by banishing some who had written pamphlets and sermons suggesting this return to Catholicism.  Parliament had three of them released and they were received triumphantly in London upon their return.

In an effort to further weaken the King Parliament sought to have removed those members who were supporters of the monarchy.  To this end the house impeached the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Lord of Strafford]] for treason to Parliament and had him beheaded. Next Parliament arrested and executed the [[William Laud|Archbishop of Canterbury]] for his preaching of the introduction of arbitrary government ruled in consultation of the bishops. This was opposed by many in Parliament but mainly by the Scots.

After this discussion Hobbes' master provides a history of the house of commons and its role in the governance of the realm. He reminds his student that the Parliament had always been an institution of counsel and not control over the monarchy. The present Parliament oversteps the ancient bounds imposed on it by its appointed role as representative of the people before the king.

The rising in Ireland of an army of Papist sympathies who busied themselves harassing and slaughtering Protestants becomes an issue before the Parliament. A truce is made with the king to arrange a militia to combat this uprising in Ireland. Charles I dismissed the charges of high treason but would not identify his informant in the commons. The solicitor general is accused of being an informer on the house and he flees to France to avoid the wrath of the Parliament.

Parliament next took control of the militia from the crown and insisted that no adherents of the Roman church be allowed to command the army being sent to Ireland. Parliament raised funds for this expedition by selling shares of land in the Irish [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]]. A small share, three pence on every acre, was reserved for the crown with the balance of the funds being set aside for Parliament. The king did not assent to this. Relations between the two sides once again broke down and the king issued a declaration that Parliament needed to be obedient to the established laws of the kingdom.

Both sides began to gather material and men for possible war. The Parliament sent a message to the king, a humble petition, with 19 propositions to prevent conflict. The nineteen points are:

# Ministers serving on the King's Privy Council must be approved by the House of Commons and Lords.
# Matters that concern the public must be debated only by Parliament.
# A number of high offices, those dealing with finances and laws of the kingdom, must be chosen with the consent of both houses of Parliament.
# The King's children's education and raising should be committed to those approved of by Parliament.
# Parliament shall approve of the marriage of the King's children to any person, from home or abroad.
#All laws against Papists must be strictly enforced.
#The vote of Papists in the Lords shall be taken away, and the children of Papists must receive a Protestant education.
#A reformation of the Church government must be made in a manner advised by both houses.
#The King will accept the ordering of the militia by Parliament.
#Members of Parliament that have recently been removed from the house must be allowed to return.
# Councilors and judges must take an oath to maintain certain Parliamentary statutes.
# All judges and officers approved of by Parliament shall hold their posts on condition of good behaviour.
# The justice of Parliament shall apply to all law-breakers, whether they are inside the country or have fled.
# The King's pardon must be granted, unless both houses of Parliament object.
# Parliament must approve the King's appointees for commanders of the forts and castles of the kingdom.
# The unnecessary military attachment guarding the King must be discharged.
# The Kingdom will formalise its alliance with the Protestant States of the United Provinces (the Dutch) to defend them against the Pope   and his followers.
# The King must clear the six members of Parliament of any wrongdoing.
# New peers of the House of Lords must be voted in by both Houses of Parliament.

These nineteen points were rejected by the king as they would further weaken the authority of the crown.  This left both Parliament and the king no choice but to go to war.

''See the related article [[Nineteen Propositions]] for a further discussion of this aspect of the English Civil War.

== Part Three: The English Civil War, Rise of Cromwell, and Execution of Charles I==
The discussion again continues after a break and now turns to the matter of the Civil war itself.  The student is concerned about what he sees as the inability of Charles I to stand up to the Parliament due to his overall lack of resources [[power of the purse|as Parliament has taken control of much of the necessary material]] to fight a war. The master reminds the student that the officers on the side of the crown were all well experienced men and that this was an advantage that the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] did not have. As for money, neither side had much on hand. Some of the forces supporting the king took future credit while those supporting the Parliament were funded by an appeal to the cities and by the placing of levies on the towns.

As the wars continued [[turncoats|men on both side of the struggle changed side]]. This at first was to the detriment of the Parliamentary forces but in time some of those loyal to the king began to support the cause of the Parliament. This was despite the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|king's ancient right]] to [[Commission of Array|call for arms]] in times of conflict from all land owners and high born people. The Parliamentarians had already abandoned most of the laws and so this most ancient call to arms for the king was largely ignored.

The progress of the wars showed that early on the victory was mainly had by the king's [[cavaliers]] over Parliament's forces. Mainly in the north and the west of the country Charles I had his successes. Scotland came into the war on the side of Parliament and this put some pressure on the crowns forces. This pressure was used by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1644 to win the [[Battle of Marston Moor]]. This marks the rise of Oliver Cromwell in the Parliamentary army and he would use these successes to eventually take over the control of the commonwealth as [[Lord Protector]].

In 1645 Cromwell reorganised Parliaments forces into the [[New Model Army]]. This was a more disciplined and better trained group of soldiers and with this the tide began to turn against the royalist cause. In 1646 the besieged Charles I received from Parliament the same nineteen points that had brought both sides to conflict. Charles again did not give assent to them. Instead an arrangement was brokered between Parliament and the king that would see him surrender himself to them and thus end the war. By the end of 1646 the great seal of the king was broken and power over England was now available to be taken.

1647 and 1648 saw the contention for control over the realm between Oliver Cromwell, with his [[New Model Army]], and the Parliament as the king was held prisoner and not permitted to govern. Cromwell controlled 55 members of the parliament and used them to gain further support for his control over the government. Cromwell made overtures to the king to gain those members who had supported the royalist cause. London tried to stand against Cromwell but was quickly put down. He continued to consolidate his power and eventually had control over the parliament. He did not turn control back to the king as he said he would.

Charles I was as unwilling to work with Parliament under the control of Cromwell and the generals as he had been before the Civil War. [[Pride's Purge|Cromwell removed opposition in the house]], leaving what became known as the [[Rump Parliament]], and began a charge against the king for his part in bringing about the war.

The king was brought before Parliament, [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the charges read]], and the king denied the authority of Parliament to charge him. This occurred three times and each time [[List of regicides of Charles I|Parliament]] asserted that they did have the necessary authority. Charles was found guilty of tyranny and executed at the gates of Whitehall on 30 January 1649.

== Part Four: The Protectorship of Oliver Cromwell, Failure of Richard Cromwell, Restoration of the Stuarts==
The Rump Parliament became an [[Oligarchy]] after the execution of Charles I. A [[English Council of State|forty-person council of state]], whose job was to carry out the directives of the [[Rump Parliament]], was established. The Parliament took the name ''Custodes Libertatis Angliae'' (Custodians of English Liberty) for use in legal matters. Hobbes saw this as being foolish as they did not have a good idea of what [[liberty]] actually meant.

Cromwell, not yet the sole head of the government, went with the army to [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Ireland]] and in a year subdued the entire country. In Scotland the [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]] failed to get the people behind a rising against the Parliament and was executed. Cromwell's rival, [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|General Fairfax]], resigned instead of taking an army into Scotland to fight fellow [[Covenanters|Presbyterian]]s. Cromwell was now made general of the entire army.

[[Charles II of England|Charles II]] went to Scotland, after agreeing to the demands of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scots Parliament]] and sat as king. Hostilities between England and Scotland recommenced. Cromwell and the army invaded Scotland to capture the young king. Charles II, after failing to hold [[Edinburgh]] or [[Stirling]], was able to [[Escape of Charles II|escape to the Continent]].

The Rump responded to an altercation with the Dutch and it began the [[First Anglo–Dutch War]] in 1652. Cromwell continued to fight the enemies of England while he solidified his hold over the Parliament. Cromwell was able to dissolve Parliament on 23 April 1653. A [[Barebone's Parliament|new parliament]] was composed of 142 of Cromwell's staunchest supporters from the army and the old Parliament. He gave them supreme power, and they in return appointed him [[The Protectorate|Protector of England]]. The Dutch were [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|defeated]] by the English, and Cromwell now had control of all of England.

In 1657 Cromwell was offered the title of king but refused it due to the opposition of the army, his source of power, to the idea. Parliament began to descend into disorder as factionalism again crept into its proceedings. Cromwell managed to keep the various factions in line.

After Cromwell's death the Parliament fell into disarray. [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]] saw that the only solution to the troubles was not to have [[Richard Cromwell]] succeed his father but to restore the monarchy. Monck occupied London with the army and forced parliament to offer the crown to Charles II. The monarchy was then [[English Restoration|restored]] when Charles II accepted the offer of the Parliament.

== Criticism of Hobbes' views on rebellion ==
[[Immanuel Kant]], one of the leading intellects of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], had a different view on the nature of rebellions from Hobbes. Howard Williams, of the [[University of Wales]], in 2003 wrote a study comparing the views of the two great thinkers on the subject of revolution amongst other things. Hobbes saw all revolution as something that should be avoided at all costs. Hobbes expressed society as a combination of the people, as the body of the society, and the monarchy, as the soul of the society, making a healthy commonwealth. Without the soul the body dies and so it is with society for Hobbes. Civil war should be avoided because it is "the process of a society losing its soul".&lt;ref&gt;Howard Williams. "Kant's Critique of Hobbes: Sovereignty and Cosmopolitanism", (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this book Williams describes Hobbes writing of ''Behemoth'' as an attempt to "capture the spirit of those awful times and to suggest emphatically that they should not be repeated".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes did not believe that anything positive came out of the civil war.

Kant, according to Williams, shares the same basic attitude to the resistance of sovereign power but does not think that all outcomes of Rebellion are necessarily negative.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant is writing about the [[French Revolution]], not the English Civil War, in his book ''The Conflict of the Faculties''. Written more than 100 years after Hobbes wrote ''Behemoth'', it has as its focus the idea that rebellions arouse sympathy in other countries for the people caught up in them. Kant says that this is due to a "moral disposition within the human race".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 34&lt;/ref&gt; Going further Kant, according to Williams, implies that uprisings are the wrong solution to a problem with governance but that there can still be something positive in the results of that uprising.

Hobbes does not think that there is any sort of innate morality in society and that rebellion is either "an unwise or failed experiment as a complete blunder arising from ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, according to Williams, Hobbes has sympathy not for the common people caught up in the rebellion but instead for those who were the victims of the rebellion. This is in keeping with the royalist stance taken by Hobbes in ''Behemoth''.
''
The French Revolution was not the only source for Kant's views on rebellion. He took into account the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the English Civil war as well as the views of classical thinking on the nature of republics.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes, of course, could not do this. Kant as well was more of an observer than a participant in the events of these revolutions. Hobbes was deeply affected by the Civil war and believed that rebellion would not be a solution. Instead "only an absolute sovereign power could teach 'the science of just and unjust', fixing meanings in a stable way and thus inducing social cohesion".&lt;ref&gt;David Norbrook, "''The English Revolution and English Historiography''" in &lt;u&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Writing of the English Revolution&lt;/u&gt;, Ed. N.H. Keeble, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes then is a supporter of an "absolute sovereignty, embodied in a monarch or corporate body of individuals; Kant is a supporter of popular sovereignty, embodied in the law-making powers of a group of the people's representatives".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another key difference between the two philosophers is the way that the laws of the land should be administered.  An absolute monarch, for Hobbes, implies that the authority of that monarch "must be beyond question, whereas for Kant the sovereign's authority is best safeguarded through the possibility of public debate and criticism".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  These fundamental differences in thinking are perhaps more to do with the differences in the eras the two philosophers lived in.  Hobbes lived a hundred years before Kant.  Additionally Hobbes experienced rebellion first hand, even to the point of fleeing England for fear of his personal safety, whereas Kant did not directly suffer during the rebellions that occurred in his lifetime.  Another consideration was that in the course of a century much more had been written on the subject of the rights of the people and of liberty and this too must have been an influence on Kant's point of view.  This does not negate Hobbes' views on rebellion but does illuminate a probable cause for his position on them.

The '''''Business History Review''''' is a scholarly quarterly published by [[Cambridge University Press]] for [[Harvard Business School]]. ''Business History Review'' is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering the field of business history. It was established in 1954 by Harvard University Press as the continuation of the ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = JSTOR: All Volumes and Issues - Browse - The Business History Review|url = https://www.jstor.org/journal/busihistrevi|website = www.jstor.org|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is one of the leading scholarly journals in the field of [[business history]] alongside ''[[Enterprise &amp; Society]]'' and ''[[Business History (journal)|Business History]]''.

The ''Business History Review'' traces it origins to 1926 with the publication of Harvard’s ''Bulletin of the Business Historical Society''. The Bulletin aimed “to encourage and aid the study of the evolution of business in all periods and in all countries” and devoted much space to describing the growing archival collections of [http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/ Harvard’s Baker Library]. Henrietta Larson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Henrietta M.

In 1954, the ''Bulletin'' changed its name to ''Business History Review'' and took its current format of publishing peer-reviewed research articles and book reviews.  In these years, the intellectual framework of the field of business history was defined by the work of [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred D. Chandler Jr.]], who published 11 research articles in the journal.  One of the most popular (with 212 Google Scholar cites) was his 1959 piece “The Beginnings of ‘Big Business’ in American Industry,” which explored the question of why large, vertically integrated [[corporations]] were formed in the late nineteenth-century and why they took the structure they did. Another highly cited article (240 Google Scholar cites) from 1970 was “The Emerging Organizational Synthesis in American History” by Louis Galambos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Louis Galambos {{!}} Department of History {{!}} Johns Hopkins University|url = http://history.jhu.edu/directory/louis-galambos/|website = history.jhu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also focused on explaining the growth of bureaucratic structures in the United States.

In 1974, ''Business History Review'' published its first special issue on the [[multinational corporation]].  Included in the issue was an article on oil companies operating in South America by Mira Wilkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mira Wilkins|url = http://economics.fiu.edu/people/emeritus-faculty/mira-wilkins/|website = Department of Economics|accessdate = 2015-08-12|first = John|last = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered the field of international business history. The journal also expanded its focus beyond the workings of business enterprise to cover business-government relations.  In 1975, [[Thomas K. McCraw]], who edited the journal from 1994 to 2005, published “Regulation in America: A Review Article.” In 2011, the current editors, Walter A. Friedman and [[Geoffrey Jones (academic)|Geoffrey Jones]] (academic), listed the ''BHR''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s core subjects as innovation, globalization, entrepreneurship, business and the environment, business and government, and business and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Business History: Time for Debate|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0007680511000201|journal = Business History Review|date = 2011-03-01|issn = 2044-768X|pages = 1–8|volume = 85|issue = 01|doi = 10.1017/S0007680511000201|first = Walter A.|last = Friedman|first2 = Geoffrey|last2 = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the journal had an impact factor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Journal Citation Reports - IP &amp; Science - Thomson Reuters|url = http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/analytical/jcr/|website = wokinfo.com|accessdate = 2015-08-12|first = Thomson|last = Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; of .625 (with a 5-year impact factor of .895) and was rated as a 4 by the British Academic Journal Guide (a 4* is the highest rating).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Academic Journal Guide 2015 - Chartered Association of Business Schools|url = http://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide-2015/|accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Byblos Castle''' is a [[Crusader castle]] in [[Byblos]], [[Lebanon]]. In Crusader times it was known as the '''castle of Gibelet''' or '''Giblet'''.&lt;ref name="Notre Dame"&gt;{{cite web |title= Crusader Castle, Byblos: Overall view, castle and surrounding groves |author=G. Massiot &amp; cie |work= Architectural Lantern Slides of Lebanon |publisher= Hesburgh Libraries, University of Notre Dame, Indiana |date= |url= https://curate.nd.edu/show/pn89d507r18 | quote= Byblos... Under the name of Gibelet or Giblet... |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The castle was built by the [[Crusaders]] in the 12th century from indigenous limestone and the remains of Roman structures. The finished structure was surrounded by a moat. It belonged to the [[Genoa|Genoese]] [[Embriaco family]], whose members were the Lords of Gibelet. [[Saladin]] captured the town and castle in 1188 and partially dismantled the walls in 1190. Later, the Crusaders recaptured Byblos and rebuilt the fortifications of the castle in 1197. In 1369, the castle had to fend off an attack from [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] vessels from [[Famagusta]].&lt;ref name="Byblos Castle"&gt;{{cite web |title=Byblos Castle |url= http://travelinos.com/castles/n22-18625-Byblos_Castle |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Byblos Castle has distinguished historical buildings for neighbors. Nearby stand a few Egyptian temples, the [[Phoenicia]]n royal [[necropolis]] and the [[Roman amphitheatre]].&lt;ref name="Byblos Castle"/&gt;

==Description==
The Crusader castle of Gibelet is "the finest example" (Boas) of a new 12th-century type, which mixes the ''[[castrum]]''-type with the ''[[donjon|turris]]''-type castle:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Archaeology of the Military Orders: A Survey of the Urban Centres, Rural Settlements and Castles of the Military Orders in the Latin East (c.1120-1291) |author=Adrian Boas |year=2006 |publisher= Routledge |url={{Google books |id=e-2BAgAAQBAJ |page=57 |plainurl=yes}} |isbn=9781134422838 |accessdate=15 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a roughly square set of walls strengthened by corner towers, built around a central [[donjon]],&lt;ref&gt;David Nicolle, ''Crusader Castles in the Holy Land 1097-1192'', Osprey, 2004, [http://faravashi.ir/download/2004-28579.pdf  pp. 11-12]&lt;/ref&gt; thus forming two layers of defense.

The castle houses the Byblos site museum. It displays remains of the excavations undertaken on the site of the archeological preserve of Byblos, although the most important finds are displayed in the [[National Museum of Beirut]]. Moreover, the history of Byblos from prehistory to the medieval periods, is illustrated with thematic panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livelovelebanon.com/en/byblos-site-museum The Byblos Site Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chalkley McArtor "Chalk" Beeson''' (April 24, 1848 – August 9, 1912) was a well-known businessman, lawman,  cattleman and musician but was best known for his ownership of the famous [[Long Branch Saloon]] in [[Dodge City, Kansas]].

== Biography ==
Originally from [[Salem, Ohio]], Beeson was the seventh-born child of Samuel and Martha Beeson. The family moved to Marshalltown, [[Iowa]] shortly after his birth. In 1866 the 18-year-old Beeson left Marshalltown and headed west to Texas, where he found employment as a [[cowboy]]. Years later, Charles Goodnight would say of Beeson: "He was the best cowboy on the trail ... could stampede or quiet a herd quicker than any rustler I ever met."&lt;ref&gt;Beeson Collection, Boot Hill Museum, Inc., Dodge City, Kansas.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1872 the 24-year-old Beeson was living in Colorado. He worked, for a time, as a guide to [[American bison|buffalo]] hunters, with his clients including [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia]], [[Phil Sheridan]], and [[George Custer]].

=== Life in Colorado ===

When the hunt ended, Beeson returned to Pueblo, Colorado where he participated in many civic activities. He was a member of the volunteer fire department and also Pueblo's baseball team. For employment, he drove a stagecoach between Denver and Colorado Springs. By 1875 Beeson grew bored with Pueblo and relocated to the three-year-old town of Dodge City, Kansas.

=== Marriage ===
In 1876, Chalk Beeson returned home to Marshalltown, Iowa, where he married 22-year-old Ida Gause on July 17, 1876. The newlyweds intended to locate in Kansas City, Missouri. Before they could do so, Chalk had to return to Dodge City to collect money owed him by A.J. Peacock, the owner of the Billiard Hall Saloon. Peacock was unable to pay Beeson in cash and handed him the deed to the establishment as payment.

=== Dodge City Saloon owner ===

Ida Beeson had to adjust to the fact that her husband  was a Dodge City saloon owner. She was able to take some comfort in the fact that her husband provided an alternative to "entertainment" usually provided by frontier saloons – namely prostitutes. What Beeson provided may not have been as exciting to a Texas cowboy just arriving from a long drive, but it was certainly more cultural. Chalk Beeson offered a full orchestra. Beeson changed the name of his business to the Saratoga Saloon. According to a local paper: "It is a rare treat to drop in at the Saratoga upon Mr. Beeson, and listen to his last and best musical combination. Mr. Beeson is a thorough lover of good music, and by his skillful selection of good performers ... draws crowds of attentive listeners."&lt;ref&gt;''Dodge City Times'', September 29, 1877.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long Branch Saloon ===

Encouraged by his success with the Saratoga, Beeson decided to take a chance on another saloon. The Long Branch Saloon had been founded early in 1873 by Charles E. Bassett and A.J. Peacock. The saloon changed hands several times. On March 1, 1878, Beeson purchased the Long Branch from the firm of Dexter D. Colley and James M. Manion. Soon after purchasing the Long Branch, Beeson took William H. Harris as his partner. Also with Harris, Beeson established the COD Cattle Ranch, south of Dodge City. During the next several years, the firm of Beeson &amp; Harris became a minor conglomerate whose holdings were located in such far-flung locations as Las Animas, Colorado and Tombstone, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Fredric R. ''Dodge City: Up through a Century in Story and Pictures''. Dodge City: Boot Hill Museum, Inc., 1972, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; After owning it for five years, Beeson grew bored with the Long Branch and sold his share of the business to Luke Short on February 6, 1883.&lt;ref&gt;''Ford County Globe'' (Dodge City), February 6, 1883.
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 Beeson purchased a farm some two miles from Dodge City and moved his family there.

=== Dodge City Cowboy Band ===

In 1884 Beeson formed the "Dodge City Cowboy Band. The group was well received wherever it played. The band members cut dashing figures in full "cowboy" regalia – enormous white stetsons, blue flannel shirts and boots festooned with ornamental spurs. Their fame finally spread far enough that they were featured performers in the March 4, 1889, inaugural parade of President Benjamin Harrison. The parade marked the Dodge City Band's finest hour, and also their final hour. Soon after their return to Dodge City, Beeson sold the ownership of the band to a man from Colorado. The transaction included most of the musical instruments and the right to use the name – all for a purchase price of $750.

=== Sheriff of Ford County, Kansas ===
In November 1891, 43-year-old Chalk Beeson was elected sheriff of Ford County, Kansas. On November 1, 1892, Oliver Yantis and two accomplices robbed a Speareville, Kansas bank of $1,697. After Yantis was identified as being in Oklahoma, Sheriff Beeson journeyed there and secured a warrant for him. On November 30, 1892, Beeson, accompanied by three Oklahoma lawmen, tracked Yantis to the residence where he was hiding. A gunfight with the posse followed in which Yantis was mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Daniel D. and Snell, Joseph W. "Who Killed Oliver Yantis?," ''True West'', January–February, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Beeson served two terms as sheriff with distinction and left office in 1896. For the remainder of his life, Beeson concentrated on his cattle ranching. He was occasionally called upon for public service and served four separate terms in the Kansas State legislature between 1903 and 1908.

=== Death and legacy ===

On the morning of Tuesday, August 6, 1912, with routine ranch chores to attend to, Chalk mounted a horse that was unusually skittish. When he attempted to dismount, the horse bucked and sent Beeson flying. On Friday, August 9, 1912 Chalk Beeson died. His family managed to keep his memory alive for decades after his death. In 1915 his sons, Merritt and Otero, opened the Beeson Theater on First Avenue in Dodge City. His widow, Ida Beeson, remained a prominent member of Dodge City society until her death on June 15, 1928. In 1932, Merritt Beeson opened the Beeson Museum, which became a popular tourist attraction. After Merritt Beeson died on January 28, 1956 his widow managed the museum until 1964, when its large collection of historic documents, photos and artifacts were sold to Dodge City's Boot Hill Museum, Inc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3793">The '''Cochise Tradition''' (also '''Cochise Culture''') refers to the southern [[archeological]] [[tradition]] of the four [[Southwestern Archaic Traditions]], in the present day [[Southwestern United States]].

The Cochise Tradition (? before 5000 to c. 200 BC) lasted for a very long time, with its earliest manifestations, known as ''Sulphur Spring'', perhaps before 5000 BC.  Its two later phases, the ''Chiricahua'' and ''San Pedro'', are much better known. The Cochise Tradition was named after [[Lake Cochise]], an ancient lake which is now [[Willcox Playa]] in [[Cochise County, Arizona]]. The Cochise Tradition appears to be ancestral to the prehistoric [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]] (Mimbres) and [[Hohokam]] traditions.

The Cochise Tradition is part of the [[Picosa culture]], which encapsulates the [[Archaic period of the Americas|Archaic]] lifestyles of people from three locations with interconnected artifacts and lifestyles.  It was named by [[Cynthia Irwin-Williams]] in the 1960s for those areas: Pinto Basin (PI), Cochise Tradition (CO) and San Jose (SA), which all together is "Picosa".&lt;ref name=Gibbon640&gt;Gibbon, Guy E., and Kenneth M. Ames. (1998). Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia. New York: Taylor and Francis. p. 640. {{ISBN|0-8153-0725-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chiricahua phase==

Chiricahua Cochise tools include a variety of projectile points and many seed-processing artifacts.  The phase has been dated to between about 3500 and 1500 BC, but the chronology is open to doubt and the beginnings may be much earlier, and has been formulated on the basis of occupations in [[Ventana Cave]], near [[Sells, Arizona]], and from other locations in the state, as well as in western [[New Mexico]].

==San Pedro phase==

San Pedro follows the Chiricahua in the southern Southwest, characterized by large [[projectile point]]s with corner or side notches and straight or convex bases.  Provisional [[radiocarbon]] dates have San Pedro flourishing from about 1500 to 200 BC. By this time, the Archaic population of the Southwest appears to have grown, with groups exploiting a wider range of environmental zones and sometimes living in larger, perhaps more permanent, settlements.  Some San Pedro sites contain oval [[pithouse]]s excavated about 1.6&amp;nbsp;ft. below the ground level, dwellings requiring sufficient effort to build that they must have been occupied for some time.  Without question, some of San Pedro communities were cultivating [[maize]] and other crops.

{{Politics of Russia}}
The '''Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-ru|Конституционный Суд Российской Федерации}}) is a high court within the [[judiciary of Russia]] which is empowered to rule on whether certain laws or presidential decrees are in fact contrary to the [[Constitution of Russia]]. Its objective is only to protect the Constitution (in Russian constitutional law this function is known as "[[constitutional control]]" or "constitutional supervision") and deal with a few kinds of disputes where it has original jurisdiction, whereas the highest court of appeal is the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]].

==History==
[[Image:Moscow 05-2017 img35 Kitay-Gorod.jpg|thumb|left|Former headquarters of the Constitutional Court in [[Kitai-gorod]] of Moscow, by [[Marian Peretiatkovich]] and [[Fyodor Rerberg]].]] 
Before the 1980s in the [[USSR]] the importance of judicial supervision over compatibility of legislation and executive actions with the provisions and principles of the constitution was not recognized. It was not until December 25, 1989 when Constitutional Control in the USSR Act was passed, that such "judicial review" was initiated. Accordingly, the Constitutional Supervision Committee was created. It started functioning mid-1990 and was dissolved towards the end of 1991. In December 1990 the [[1978 RSFSR Constitution|Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) was amended with provisions which provided for creation of Constitutional Court (whereas a similar USSR body was called a Committee, not a Court). On July 12, 1991 Constitutional Court of the RSFSR Act was adopted. In October the Fifth [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR]] has elected 13 members of the Court and the Constitutional Court de facto started functioning. From November 1991 till October 1993 it rendered some decisions of great significance. For example, it declared unconstitutional certain decrees of [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], which were adopted [[ultra vires]], and forbade the practice of extrajudicial eviction. More often, however, it declared President Yeltsin's decrees unconstitutional, leading critics to argue it took the side of the Supreme Soviet in the power struggle. 

{{main|Russian constitutional crisis of 1993}}
On October 7, 1993 [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s decree suspended work of the Constitutional Court. According to the decree, the Constitutional Court was "in deep crisis". On December 24 another presidential decree repealed the Constitutional Court of the RSFSR Act itself. 
In July 1994 the new Constitutional Court Act was adopted. However, the new Constitutional Court started working only in February 1995, because the [[Federation Council|Federation Council of Russia]] refused several times to appoint judges nominated by Yeltsin.

In 2005 the federal authorities proposed to transfer the court from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. The transfer, involving controversial allocation of land on [[Krestovsky Island]] for cottages of the judges and relocation of the [[Russian State Historical Archive]] from the former [[Senate and Synod Building]], now occupied by the court headquarters, had been completed by 2008.

President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] on May 8, 2009, proposed to the legislature and on June 2 signed a law for an amendment whereby the chairperson of the court and his deputies would be proposed to the parliament by the president rather than elected by the judges, as was the case before.&lt;ref&gt;http://itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=14005381&amp;PageNum=99{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional Court Judge [[Vladimir Yaroslavtsev (judge)|Vladimir Yaroslavtsev]] in an interview to the Spanish newspaper [[El País]] published on August 31, 2009, claimed that the [[Presidential Administration of Russia|presidential executive office]] and [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|security services]] had undermined [[judicial independence]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Rusia/mandan/organos/seguridad/epoca/sovietica/elpepiint/20090831elpepiint_6/Tes&lt;/ref&gt; In October the Constitutional Court in an unprecedented motion accused Yaroslavtsev of "undermining the authority of the judiciary" in violation of the judicial code and forced him to resign from the [[Council of Judges]]. Judge [[Anatoly Kononov]], who had frequently dissented from decisions taken by the majority of the court, in his interview to Sobesednik supported Yaroslavtsev, claiming that there was no independent [[judiciary in Russia]] and criticized the new amendments concerning appointment of the court chairman as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sobesednik.ru/politics/kononov_sb_41_09/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208002419/http://www.sobesednik.ru/politics/kononov_sb_41_09/ |archive-date=2009-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Court forced Kononov to step down from the Constitutional Court on January 1, 2010, 7 years ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1284828&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/2-senior-judges-quit-after-criticism/390815.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125979340320873615&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation consists of 19 judges, one being the Chairman (currently – [[Valery Zorkin]]) and another one being Deputy Chairman. The Chairman is responsible for the allocation of cases to chambers, has considerable powers in the matters of appointment, and makes the initial recommendation for disciplinary measures, in particular dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= A/HRC/11/41/Add.2 Promotion and Protection of All Human Rights, Civil, Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Including the Right to Development, Addendum: Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers | first= Leandro | last= Despouy | date= 23 March 2009 | page= 17| publisher= [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] | accessdate= 6 August 2012 | url= http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/11session/A.HRC.11.41.Add.2_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges are nominated by the [[President of Russia|President]] and appointed by the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]] for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= World Criminal Justice Systems: A Survey | first= Richard J. | last= Terrill | page= 423 | publisher= [[Elsevier]] | year= 2009 | edition= 7 | isbn= 978-1-59345-612-2 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hJaEzC1CBe8C&amp;pg=PA423}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to become a judge of the Constitutional Court a person must be a [[Citizenship of Russia|citizen]] of [[Russia]], at least 40 years of age, have legal education, have served as a lawyer for at least 15 years and have "recognized high qualification" (quotation from Constitutional Court Act) in law.

The Constitutional Court consists of two chambers with 10 and 9 judges respectively. The Chairman presides over one of the chambers, the Deputy Chairman presides over the other chamber. Constitutionality of laws, disputes concerning competence of governmental agencies, [[impeachment]] of the president of Russia and Constitutional Court's proposals of legislations must be dealt with on plenary session. Besides, Constitutional Court may by its discretion submit to plenary sessions any other issue.

== Powers ==

Certain powers of the Constitutional Court are enumerated in the [[Constitution of Russia]]. The Constitutional Court declares laws, presidential and governmental decrees and laws of [[federal subject]]s unconstitutional if it finds that they are contrary to the Constitution (i.e. they violate certain rights and freedoms of citizens enumerated in and protected by the Constitution). In such instances, that particular law becomes unenforceable, and governmental agencies are barred from implementing it. Also, before an [[international treaty]] is ratified by the [[State Duma]], the [[constitutionality]] of the treaty may be observed by the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court is not entitled to judge constitutionality of laws on its own initiative; the law may be submitted to the Constitutional Court by the [[President of Russia]], the [[government of Russia]], the [[State Duma]], the [[Federation Council of Russia]], one-fifth of members of the State Duma or the Federation Council, the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]], the [[Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation]], or a legislative body of a [[Federal subjects of Russia|Federal subject]]. Any federal court may request the Constitutional Court to judge on the constitutionality of a law if the law is to be implemented in a case, and a judge of the federal court is in doubt about whether the law is contrary to the Constitution. Also, any private citizen may submit in the Constitutional Court a claim challenging constitutionality of a particular law if that law was implemented in a particular case and thus violated rights of that citizen.

Another power of the Constitutional Court is to resolve disputes concerning competence of governmental agencies. Whenever the [[President of Russia]] is [[impeachment|impeached]], the Constitutional Court renders a resolution concerning complying with the due order of indictment.

== Procedure ==
The Constitutional Court deals with cases either in chambers or in plenary sessions. All judges must be present unless he or she is sick or may have interest in the case and must not abstain from voting on the resolution. Apart from judges, claimant and his representatives governmental agencies involved are present. In order for resolution or decision to pass two-thirds of judges must be in favor of it.

'''[[Defeminization]] and [[masculinization]]''' are the processes that a fetus goes through to become a male. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

It has often been said by biologists that in [[sexual differentiation]] in [[mammals]], the female is the "default" developmental pathway, in the sense that elimination of any of several gene actions necessary for formation of male genitalia leads to the development of external female genitalia (though development of functional ovaries requires effective action of several less understood sex-specific genes). {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Two processes: [[defeminization]], and [[masculinization]], are involved in producing [[male]] typical morphology and behavior.  Disruption of either of these processes in males produces female-typical development. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The opposite is not true; disruption of normal sexual development in females does not lead to male-typical endpoints. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Defeminization]] involves the suppression of the development of female typical morphology (development of the [[Müllerian ducts]] into the fallopian tubes, uterus and [[vagina]]) and behavioural predispositions.  [[Masculinization]] involves the production of male typical morphology (development of the [[Wolffian ducts]] into male reproductive structures) and behavioural predispositions.  Both defeminization and masculinization are required for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male.

A brief version of the female default paradigm can be stated as follows:

#A set of specific genetic instructions must be present and a series of differentiating events mediated by hormones must occur in order for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male.
##The [[Y chromosome]], [[SRY]], [[SOX9]], and SF1 genes must be present and functional.
##Functional [[Leydig cell]]s must form in the [[gonad]]s.
##The Leydig cells must be able to produce [[testosterone]].
##The target cells must have the [[hormone receptor]]s to respond to the testosterone. The target cells of the [[external genitalia]] must have functional [[5-alpha-reductase]] enzyme to convert some of the testosterone to more active [[dihydrotestosterone]].
##There is some evidence that the brain must be exposed and respond to [[androgen]]s either prenatally or early in life to produce characteristic mating behavior. This is well demonstrated in many animal species but remains mostly speculative with respect to humans.
#To a large extent, each step builds on the previous. If anything goes wrong at any of the first four steps, the subsequent pathway of development results in female anatomy and behavior.
#No [[ovary|ovarian]] organizing gene [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to SRY has been discovered. Both sexes are exposed to maternal estrogen prenatally. No hormones have yet been discovered that are necessary early in life to produce female sexual development. [[Estrogen]] seems not to be necessary until puberty for purposes of differentiation.
##The full development of male characteristics also includes personal experience throughout life, determining [[gender identity]], [[gender roles]] and [[sexual orientation]]. However, there is much debate on the balance between [[nature and nurture]] in the determination.

==History==
This paradigm dates back to the 1950s. Even stronger versions were commonly stated in the 1960s and 1970s. One version, perhaps most associated with [[John Money]], (who termed it the ''Adam principle''), held that additional steps in the cascade to male identity were the recognition by parents and doctor that the external genitalia were male, which resulted in a male [[sex assignment]], which in turn resulted in a male [[sex of rearing]] by parents and society, which in turn (coupled with the reinforcing appearance of male genitalia) resulted in a male gender identity. At least by implication, female gender identity simply required a female sex of rearing and lack of an obvious penis.

In Germany in the 1970s, [[Günter Dörner]] extrapolated the cascade to include direct testosterone effect on the brain as necessary for a male gender identity and [[sexual orientation]], proposing that [[transsexualism]] and or [[homosexuality]] in biological males could result from deficiency of prenatal or early postnatal testosterone effect on the brain.

The '''emblem of [[Angola]]''' reflects the recent past of the new nation.  There is heavy [[Marxism|Marxist]] imagery found on the device (as can be seen when comparing with other examples of so-called "[[socialist heraldry]]"), expanded from what is found on the [[Flag of Angola|national flag]].  

In the center is a [[machete]] and hoe, representing the revolution through which the nation gained independence and the importance of agricultural workers. Above both emblems is a [[red star|star]], a common symbol in socialist emblems. The star is taken to represent progress. The rising sun is the traditional symbol of a new beginning. These emblems are all enclosed within a circle whose right half is formed by cog-wheel, representing the industrial workers, and whose left half is a half-[[wreath]] of [[maize]] and [[cotton]] leaves, representing agriculture. At the bottom is an open book that represents education.

The banner at the bottom reads ''{{lang|pt|República de Angola}}'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "Republic of Angola". This was changed from ''{{lang|pt|República Popular de Angola}}'' ("People's Republic of Angola") in 1990; at the same time the cog-wheel was also changed from gold to silver.

Details of the insignia are laid down in Article 163 of the [[Constitution of Angola]].

When Angola was a Portuguese colony and later a Portuguese province (and thus legally a part of Portugal proper), Angola used coats of arms to represent the nation. These consisted of a shield parted per pale, with the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese arms]] without its usual bordure in the dexter (viewer's left) half and in the sinister (viewer's right) half the arms for Angola itself: a golden elephant and a golden zebra on a purpure field. The wavy bars in the base (''enté en point'') represented Angola's location overseas from metropolitan Portugal.

Born in Jalcocotan in the Mexican state of Nayarit, Galarza immigrated with his mother and two uncles to California.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garcia|first1=Mario T.|title=Houghton Mifflin Companion to US History: Galarza, Ernesto|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/ernesto-galarza|website=Answers.com|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As recalled in his autobiography, ''Barrio Boy'', the young Galarza successfully navigated the cultural differences in the public school system, received a scholarship to [[Occidental College]] in Los Angeles, and then went on to earn a master's degree in history at [[Stanford University]] in 1929.

Galarza worked with the Pan-American Union (now the [[Organization of American States]]) in Washington D.C. from 1936 through 1947 publishing analyses on educational, labor and infrastructure issues in Latin America. In 1947, he completed his doctoral dissertation on the electricity industry in Mexico and earned a Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://departments.oxy.edu/library/geninfo/collections/special/galarza/list%20of%20works.htm accessed 10/11/10  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612035007/http://departments.oxy.edu/library/geninfo/collections/special/galarza/list%20of%20works.htm |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galarza worked as a labor organizer and a key leader in laying the groundwork for the emergence in California of the farm labor movement.  [[National Farm Labor Union]]. Galarza began organizing farm workers in California in 1948 as research and education director of the American Federation of Labor's short-lived National Farm Labor Union.  

Galarza organized a 1947 strike against the [[DiGiorgio Corporation]] in [[Arvin, California]] that lasted 30&amp;nbsp;months, and entangled the company and the union in suits and counter-suits for the following 15&amp;nbsp;years. Altogether between 1948 and 1959, Galarza and the union initiated some twenty strikes and labor actions.&lt;ref name=OAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Ernesto Galarza Papers, 1936-1984|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf2290026t/|website=Online Archives of California|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although primarily an intellectual and scholar whose weapons were words, Galarza initially played an activist's role with the AFL as the leader of several strikes. But he was completely thwarted by the bracero program and so abandoned the union leader's weapon of direct economic action for the intellectual's weapon of words in hopes of killing the program. 

A prolific writer, Galarza's best-known work is ''Merchants of Labor'' (1964), an exposé of the abuses within the [[Bracero Program]]. The book was instrumental in the ending of the program, which in turn opened the door for [[Cesar Chavez]] to begin unionizing immigrant farmworkers in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Latino civil rights history By Francisco Arturo Rosales page 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956 Galarza was awarded the Bolivian [[Order of the Condor of the Andes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://departments.oxy.edu/library/geninfo/collections/special/galarza/timeline.htm accessed 10/11/10 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612030021/http://departments.oxy.edu/library/geninfo/collections/special/galarza/timeline.htm |date=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ernesto Galarza Applied Research Center at the [[UCR College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences|University of California Riverside]] and other California elementary and secondary schools bear his name. His many books include:  

* ''Barrio Boy'', 1971
* ''Merchants of Labor: The Mexican Bracero Story'', 1964
* ''Spiders in the House and Workers in the Field'', 1970

==Salinas Valley tragedy==

In the wake of a [[1963 Chualar bus crash|bus crash in the Salinas Valley]] in September 1963 that claimed the lives of 32 braceros, Galarza was appointed to investigate the tragedy by [[Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Committee on Education and Labor]] of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. His report, published by the committee in April 1964,&lt;ref name="Galarza report"&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Farm Labor Transportation Accident at Chualar, Calif., on Sept. 17, 1963 | publisher=U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education and Labor,  CRDC-Id: CMP-1964-EDL-0001 | year=1964 | location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the accident was directly caused by negligence, exemplifying a practice in which flatbed trucks were illegally converted to buses, driven by poorly trained personnel. With safety officials and regulators indifferent to the situation, and businesses showing disregard for human life, he found that the accident had been imminent. &lt;ref name="Flores"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Town Full of Dead Mexicans: The Salinas Valley Bracero Tragedy of 1963, the End of the Bracero Program, and the Evolution of California's Chicano Movement | author=Flores, Lisa A. | journal=The Western Historical Quarterly |date=Summer 2013  | volume=44 | issue=2 | pages=124-143 | doi=10.2307/westhistquar.44.2.0124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Countering"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PetNsyuGKAMC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=The+Tragedy+at+Chualar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jVDjpQt195&amp;sig=WdGtS2CqBRrqIDVllMzUTtPeUhk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h0caU769EonK0wHasoDoCw&amp;ved=0CHAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Tragedy%20at%20Chualar&amp;f=false | title=Countering the Counterculture: Rereading Postwar American Dissent from Jack Kerouac to Tomás Rivera | publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press | author=Martinez, Manuel Luis | year=2003 | pages=288-290 | isbn=0299192849}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a book on the accident, ''Tragedy at Chualar'' (1977).

'''Benjamin Franklin Wedekind''' (July 24, 1864 &amp;ndash; March 9, 1918), usually known as '''Frank Wedekind''', was a German [[playwright]].  His work, which often criticizes [[bourgeois]] attitudes (particularly towards sex), is considered to anticipate [[expressionism]] and was influential in the development of [[Epic theater|epic theatre]].&lt;ref name="express"&gt;See Banham (1998) and Willett (1959). In his ''[[Messingkauf Dialogues]]'', Brecht cites Wedekind, along with [[Georg Büchner|Büchner]] and [[Karl Valentin|Valentin]], as his "chief influences" in his early years: "he", Brecht writes of himself in the third person, "also saw the writer ''Wedekind'' performing his own works in a style which he had developed in cabaret. Wedekind had worked as a [[ballad]] singer; he accompanied himself on the [[lute]]." (1965, 69).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2006, Wedekind was best known for the "Lulu" cycle, a two-play series --''[[Earth Spirit (play)|Erdgeist]]'' (''Earth Spirit'', 1895) and ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Die Büchse der Pandora]]'' (''Pandora's Box'', 1904) -- centered on a young dancer/adventuress of mysterious origin.

==Life and career==
Benjamin Franklin Wedekind was born on July 24, 1864 in Hannover, Germany. His mother was Swiss and became pregnant with him in San Francisco. His father, a German, had a Swiss castle in which Wedekind grew up.  Until [[World War I]], when he was forced to obtain a German passport, he was an American citizen and traveled throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite web|author=John Simon; John Simon is the former theater critic of New York magazine and National Review. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/18/books/how-sex-killed-frank-wedekind.html?pagewanted=all |title=How Sex Killed Frank Wedekind - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1990-11-18 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived most of his adult life in [[Munich]], though he had a brief period working in advertising, for the [[Maggi]] soup firm, in Switzerland in 1886.&lt;ref name="soup"&gt;Willett (1959, 98n).&lt;/ref&gt;

Having worked in business and the circus, Wedekind went on to become an actor and singer. In this capacity he received wide acclaim as the principal star of the [[satire|satirical]] cabaret ''Die elf Scharfrichter'' (''The Eleven Executioners''), launched in 1901.&lt;ref name="cabaret"&gt;See Banham (1998) and Willett (1959, 87)&lt;/ref&gt;  Wedekind became an important influence on the tradition of German satirical writing for the theatre, paving the way for the cabaret-song satirists [[Kurt Tucholsky]], [[Walter Mehring]], [[Joachim Ringelnatz]] and [[Erich Kästner]] among others, who after Wedekind's death would invigorate the culture of the [[Weimar Republic]]; "all bitter social critics who used direct, stinging satire as the best means of attack and wrote a large part of their always intelligible light verse to be declaimed or sung".&lt;ref name="cabaret2"&gt;Willett (1959, 87).&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 34, after serving a nine-month prison sentence for "[[Lèse majesté|lèse-majesté]]" (thanks to the publication in ''[[Simplicissimus]]'' of some of his satirical poems), Wedekind became a [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]] (a play-reader and adapter) at the [[Munich Kammerspiele|Munich Schauspielhaus]].&lt;ref name="dramaturg"&gt;Willett (1959, 87, 106).&lt;/ref&gt;

His sex life was promiscuous and he frequented prostitutes, contracting syphilis. He also enjoyed the pleasure of platonic female company and kept his tendencies toward homosexuality and sadism in check.&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt; He had an affair with [[Frida Uhl]] who bore him a child.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Michael. ''Strindberg: A Biography'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987, p.363.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1906, he married the Austrian actress Tilly Newes, 22 years his junior and became strictly monogamous. His relationship with his wife was turbulent, with Wedekind prone to jealousy and he felt pressure to maintain strenuous creative and sexual activity in order to please her. They had two daughters, Pamela and Kadidja,&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1361159/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm] Bio of Tilly Wedekind on the IMDB website&lt;/ref&gt; but his jealousy led his wife to attempt both separation and suicide.&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt;

Near the end of his life, Wedekind underwent an [[appendectomy]] and immediately began acting again, leading to a hernia. His doctor refused to operate immediately but Wedekind insisted and complications from the surgery led to his death at the age of 53 on March 9, 1918.&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt;

Tilly Wedekind went on to appear in such films as ''[[Travelling People (film)|Travelling People]]'' and was romantically linked to the author [[Gottfried Benn]].&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt; In 1969, at age 83, she published an autobiography in German, ''Lulu: Die Rolle meines Lebens'' (Lulu: The Role of My Life).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45440083.html |title=DER SPIEGEL 47/1969 - Ehe und Atlas |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=1969-11-17 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Wedekind's first major play, ''[[Spring Awakening (play)|Frühlings Erwachen]]'' (''Spring Awakening'', 1891), which concerns sexuality and puberty among some young German students, caused a scandal as it contained scenes of [[homoeroticism]], implied group male masturbation, actual male masturbation, [[sado-masochism]] between a teenage boy and girl, rape and suicide, as well as references to abortion.

The "Lulu" plays ''[[Earth Spirit (play)|Erdgeist]]'' (''Earth Spirit'', 1895) and ''[[Pandora's Box (play)|Die Büchse der Pandora]]'' (''Pandora's Box'', 1904) were probably his best known works until the 2006 adaptation of ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]''. Originally conceived as a single play, the two pieces tell a continuous story of a sexually-enticing young dancer, who rises in German society through her relationships with wealthy men but who later falls into poverty and prostitution.&lt;ref name="mueller"&gt;Mueller, Carl R. "Introduction" to''Frank Wedekind: Four Major Plays'', Vol 1, Lyme, New Hampshire: Smith and Krauss, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The frank depiction of sexuality and violence in these plays, including  [[lesbianism]] and an encounter with  [[Jack the Ripper]] (a role which Wedekind played in the original production),&lt;ref name="willett"&gt;Willett (1959, 73n).&lt;/ref&gt; pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time. [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] also helped Wedekind stage it in Vienna.&lt;ref name="Bru06"&gt;Bru, Sascha and Martens, Gunther (2006) ''The invention of politics in the European avant-garde (1906–1940)'' pp.52-3&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Court-Singer (play)|Der Kammersänger]]'' (''The Court-Singer'', 1899) is a one-act character study of a famous opera singer who receives a series of unwelcome guests at his hotel suite.

In ''[[Franziska (play)|Franziska]]'' (1910), the title character, a young girl, initiates a [[Faust|Faustian pact]] with the Devil, selling her soul for the knowledge of what it is like to live life as a man (reasoning that men seem to have all the advantages).

A number of Wedekind's works have been translated into English by [[Samuel Atkins Eliot, Jr.]]

==Adaptations==

The "Lulu" plays formed the basis for [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst|G. W. Pabst]]'s acclaimed [[silent film]] ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929), starring [[Louise Brooks]] as Lulu and also [[Alban Berg]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' (1937), which is considered to be one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century opera.&lt;ref name="Kobbe"&gt;Harewood, Earl of. ''The Definitive Kobbe's Opera Book'', New York: Putnam, 1987. p.875&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walerian Borowczyk]] based his 1980 film ''Lulu'' on these plays. Currently the plays are being adapted into comics by John Linton Roberson.&lt;ref&gt;Roberson, John Linton. [http://www.jlroberson.org/comix/lulu/index.html "Lulu"]&lt;/ref&gt; They also form the basis for the 2011 album ''[[Lulu (Lou Reed and Metallica album)|Lulu]]'', a collaboration between the rock musician [[Lou Reed]] and the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Metallica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loureedmetallica.com/ |title=Lou Reed &amp; Metallica - Lulu |publisher=Loureedmetallica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hidalla'' was used as a source for a libretto by [[Franz Schreker]], intended to be set by [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], but later set by Schreker himself in 1915 as the opera [[Die Gezeichneten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Les Stigmatisés|url=http://www.opera-lyon.com/spectacle/opera/les-stigmatises-0|website=Opera-Lyon|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Der Kammersänger'' was adapted by composer [[Hugo Weisgall]] for his English-language opera "The Tenor."

Wedekind's [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] [[novella]] ''[[Mine-Haha, or On the Bodily Education of Young Girls]]'' (1903) was the basis for the films ''[[Innocence (2004 film)|Innocence]]'' (2004) by [[Lucile Hadžihalilović]] and ''[[The Fine Art of Love]]'' (2005) by [[John Irvin]].

In 2006, ''Frühlings Erwachen'' was adapted into the successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]''.

[[File:Arthur Boyd Houghton00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Arthur Boyd Houghton]] cartoon published by ''Fun'' magazine in 1886]]
'''''Fun''''' was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] weekly [[magazine]], first published on 21 September 1861.&lt;ref&gt;''Fun'', volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was founded by the actor and playwright [[H. J. Byron]] in competition with ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine. ''Fun'' ceased publication in 1901, when it was absorbed into ''Sketchy Bits''.

==Description==
[[Image:Darwin sexual caricature.gif|thumb|upright|Caricature of Darwin contemplating a [[bustle]], from ''Fun'', 16th Nov, 1872]]
Like ''Punch'', the journal published satiric verse and parodies, as well as political and literary criticism, sports and travel information. These were often illustrated or accompanied by topical cartoons (often of a political nature). The ''Punch'' mascot, Mr. Punch, and his dog Toby were lampooned by Fun's jester, Mr. Fun, and his cat.&lt;ref name=storyboard&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/projects/disraeli/funstoryboard.html ''Fun'' (1861–1901)], [[Bodleian Library]], accessed 21 July 2012 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206171634/http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/projects/disraeli/funstoryboard.html |date=2007-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was aimed at a well-educated readership interested in politics, literature, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Vann, J. Don, "Comic Periodicals," in ''Victorian Periodicals &amp; Victorian Society'' (Aldershot: Scholar Press, 1994), pp. 284-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fun'' was sold for a penny and was sometimes characterised as a 'poor man's ''Punch'''. [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] called it "Funch".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Alvin, ''British Literary Magazines: The Victorian and Edwardian Age'', 1837-1913 (London: Greenwood Press, 1984), p. 135)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fun'' silenced its critics by publishing lively fare, whereas ''Punch'' was criticised as dull and tired. One area in which ''Fun'' clearly bested its rival was in its close connection to popular theatre.

Byron and his successor as editor, [[Tom Hood]], the son of the first ''Punch'' contributor, assembled a vivacious, bohemian and progressive staff. Notable contributors included playwrights [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]], Hood, [[Clement Scott]], [[F. C. Burnand]] (who defected to ''Punch'' in 1862), satirist [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[G. R. Sims]] and especially [[W. S. Gilbert]], whose [[Bab Ballads]] were almost all published in its pages, among other articles, poems, illustrations and drama criticism over a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert &amp;ndash; A Classic Victorian and His Theatre|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Cartoonists included [[Arthur Boyd Houghton]], [[Matt Morgan (cartoonist)|Matt Morgan]] and James Francis Sullivan (1852–1936). The ''Fun'' gang frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the ''Punch'' 'Round table'.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/NCTF/V30I2/300001.pdf Schoch, Richard, ''Performing Bohemia'' (2004)] (accessed March 13, 2007). See also Tom Robertson's play ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', which fictionalised the evenings in Evans's café in one scene.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though ''Fun'' was seen as liberal in comparison with the increasingly conservative ''Punch'', it could cast satirical scorn or praise on either side of the political spectrum. For instance, [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]], whose unorthodox character and ethnic lineage made him a popular focus of attack, was praised in the magazine, including for his Reform Bill of 1867.&lt;ref name=storyboard/&gt;

==History==
Byron ceded the editorship of the paper to Hood in 1865 and sold ''Fun'' to engravers and publishers [[dalziel Brothers|George and Edward Dalziel]] in 1870, who had previously engraved drawings for ''Punch''. Two years later they transferred it to their nephew Gilbert Dalziel (1853–1930). After the death of Hood and the end of contributions from Gilbert by 1874, the quality of the content began a slow decline. During the 1870s, the circulation of ''Fun'' is estimated at 20,000, compared with ''Punch'''s 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ellegard, Alvar, "The Readership of the Periodical Press in Mid-Victorian Britain," in ''Victorian Periodicals Newsletter'', 3 (September, 1971), p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt; Hood was succeeded as editor by Henry Sampson until 1878, and then the editorship devolved to Charles Dalziel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data127.html Publisher and editor data]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the Dalziels withdrew from the journal.

''Fun'' ceased publication in 1901, when it was absorbed into ''Sketchy Bits''.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, Nicholas. [http://find.galegroup.com/ukpc/topicguide/ncup_15.htm "Comic Periodicals"], ''19th Century UK Periodicals'', Detroit: [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] (2008), accessed May 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Godless: The Church of Liberalism''''' is a book by best-selling author and [[American conservatism|conservative]] columnist [[Ann Coulter]], published in 2006. The book is an argument against [[American liberalism]], which Coulter regards as so anti-scientific and [[faith|faith-based]] that it amounts to a "primitive [[religion]]" which she claims has "its own [[cosmology]], its own explanation for why we are here, its own gods, and its own clergy." Coulter asserts that "the basic tenet of liberalism is that nature is god and men are monkeys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ann Coulter's "Godless" Makes the Liberals' Heads Spin With Obfuscation! |url=http://www.independentconservative.com/2006/06/12/coulters_godless/ |accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book drew criticism for its statements on the [[Jersey Girls]], alleged [[plagiarized]] content and promotion of the [[pseudoscientific]] view of [[intelligent design]].

== Central thesis ==
Coulter argues that liberalism rejects the idea of [[God]] and reviles people of faith, yet bears all the attributes of a religion itself. Coulter argues that the tenets of the liberal "church" are:
* [[Creation myth]]s (the [[theory of evolution]])
* [[Sacrament]]s - Coulter compares [[abortion]] to "virgin sacrifice"
* Holy Writ (''[[Roe v. Wade]]'')
* [[Martyr]]s (from [[Alger Hiss]] to [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]])
* [[Clergy]] (public school teachers)
* [[Place of worship]] (government schools, where Coulter claims that [[prayer]] is prohibited but [[condom]]s are free)
* [[Infallibility of the church|Doctrine of infallibility]] (as manifest in the "absolute moral authority" of spokespeople from [[Cindy Sheehan]] to [[Max Cleland]])
* [[Cosmology]] ([[Big Bang|The Big Bang Theory]], by which Coulter concludes that mankind is an inconsequential accident)

== The 9/11 "Jersey Girls" ==

Throughout the book, Coulter criticizes the four 9/11 widows, known as the "[[Jersey Girls]]", who helped push for the [[9/11 Commission]] and have been critical of US security policies writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These broads are millionaires, lionized on TV and in articles about them, reveling in their status as celebrities and stalked by grief-arazzis. These self-obsessed women seemed genuinely unaware that 9/11 was an attack on our nation and acted as if the terrorist attacks happened only to them. ... I've never seen people enjoying their husbands' deaths so much ... the Democrat ratpack gals endorsed [[John Kerry]] for president ... cutting campaign commercials ... how do we know their husbands weren't planning to divorce these [[Harpy|harpies]]?  Now that their shelf life is dwindling, they'd better hurry up and appear in ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref name="godless"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coulter |first=Ann |title=Godless: The Church of Liberalism |publisher=Crown Forum |location=New York City |date=June 6, 2006 |asin=B001GUQV7O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These statements received national attention after an interview on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', and were widely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christine Grimaldi |title=Writer's claims disturb families of 9/11 victims |url=http://nbs.gmnews.com/news/2006/0615/Front_Page/036.html |publisher=North Brunswick Sentinel |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104012221/http://nbs.gmnews.com/news/2006/0615/Front_Page/036.html |archivedate=November 4, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="attack911"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/07/entertainment/main1690954.shtml |title=Ann Coulter attacks 9/11 widows |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=June 7, 2006 |accessdate=July 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lathemalgar"&gt;Lathem, Niles; Algar, Selim.

Also on June 8, [[New Jersey]] Assemblywomen [[Joan M. Quigley]] and [[Linda Stender]] issued a joint press release, calling on "... New Jersey retailers to ban the sale of her book throughout the state."&lt;ref name="Taranto"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110008497 |title=The Coulter Kerfuffle |last=Taranto |first=James |date=June 9, 2006 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==
The book begins with a quotation from the Bible: "They exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the creator ... Therefore, God gave them up to passions of dishonor, for their females exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature. — Romans 1:25-26".

Coulter also says in a footnote, "Throughout this book, I often refer to Christians and Christianity because I am a Christian and I have a fairly good idea of what they believe, but the term is intended to include anyone who subscribes to the [[Bible]] of the God of [[Abraham]], including Jews and others."

==Jews==
Echoing the author's contention is this passage from Norman Podhoretz's book, ''Why Are Jews Liberals?''
* To most American Jews, then, liberalism is not, as has often been said, merely a necessary component of Jewishness: it is the very essence of being a Jew. Nor is it a 'substitute for religion': it is a religion in its own right, complete with its own catechism and its own dogmas and, [[Tertullian]]-like, obdurately resistant to facts that undermine its claims and promises.[http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=36422]

[[Christopher Hitchens]] noted that Coulter implied [[neoconservative]]s and Jews are one and the same:&lt;ref name=chris/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If liberals are on Red Alert with one born-again Christian in the cabinet of [[George W. Bush|a Christian president]], imagine how they would react if there were five. Between 25 and 45 percent of the population calls itself "born-again" or "evangelical" Christian. Jews make up less than 2 per cent of the nation's population, and yet Clinton had five in his cabinet. He appointed two to the Supreme Court. Now guess which administration is called a neoconservative conspiracy?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Science and intelligent design ==
Coulter, citing various critics of [[evolution]] and proponents of [[intelligent design]],&lt;ref name="science_background"&gt;Coulter, Ann, ''Godless: The Church of Liberalism''.  From the book jacket: I couldn't have written about evolution without the generous tutoring of [[Michael Behe]], [[David Berlinski]], and [[William Dembski]], all of whom are fabulous at translating complex ideas, unlike liberal arts types, who constantly force me to the dictionary to relearn the meaning of quotidian."&lt;/ref&gt; devotes approximately one-third of the book to attacks on evolution, which Coulter terms "[[Darwinism]]." Coulter turned to leading intelligent design proponents for tutors in writing this section of the book: "I couldn't have written about evolution without the generous tutoring of [[Michael Behe]], [[David Berlinski]], and [[William Dembski]] ..."&lt;ref name="science_background"/&gt; Behe, Dembski and Berlinski are all fellows of the [[Discovery Institute]], the hub of the intelligent design movement, which Coulter endorses in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/csc/fellows.php CSC - Center for Science and Culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040714104028/http://www.discovery.org/csc/fellows.php |date=2004-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 8, "The Creation Myth: On the Sixth Day, God Created Fruit Flies", advances the book's thesis that liberalism is a religion, this time by attempting to show what she argues is its [[cosmogony]]. The chapter begins:

{{quote|Liberals' creation myth is Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is about one notch above [[Scientology]] in scientific rigor. It's a make-believe story, based on a theory that is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], with no proof in the scientist's laboratory or the fossil record—and that's after 150 years of very determined looking. We wouldn't still be talking about it but for the fact that liberals think evolution disproves God.}}

Later in the chapter, she presents a [[parody]]—the "Giant Raccoon's Flatulence Theory"—to illustrate what she sees as fallacious arguments of those who espouse the theory of evolution. The "theory" states:

{{quote|''Imagine'' a giant [[raccoon]] passed gas and ''perhaps'' the resulting gas ''might'' have created the vast variety of life we see on Earth. And if you don't accept the giant raccoon flatulence theory for the origin of life, you must be a fundamentalist Christian nut who believes the Earth is flat.}}

The ''imagine'', ''perhaps'' and ''might'' (italicized by Coulter in the book) refer to what she believes is the speculative, mythical, 'made-up-story' nature of the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]] theory that species evolved through mutation and non-random selection. Chapter 9, entitled ''Proof for How the Walkman Evolved into the iPOD by Random Mutation'', begins

{{quote|Darwiniacs do not have a single observable example of one species evolving into another by the Darwinian mechanism of variation and selection. All they have is a story. It is a story that inspires fanatical devotion from the cult simply because their story excludes a creator. They have seized upon something that looks like progress from primitive life forms to more complex life forms and invented a story to explain how the various categories of animals originated. But animal sequences do not prove that the Darwinian mechanism of natural selection caused the similarities. It is just as likely that the similarities are proof of intelligent design, creationism, or the Giant Raccoon's Flatulence theory. The animal-sequence drawings allegedly demonstrating evolution by showing, for example, a little runt horse gradually becoming a grand stallion, are just that: drawings.}}

To back her opinion, Coulter refers to examples of evolution used in long-standing evolutionary arguments against creationism, but also to examples that were later shown to be misinterpreted, or hoaxes. She presents the [[Galápagos finches]], the [[Peppered moth evolution|peppered moth]], [[Piltdown man]], [[Archaeoraptor]], [[Recapitulation theory|Haeckel's drawings]], and the [[Miller–Urey experiment]], as flawed, discredited, or made-up evidence and stating arguments to support her case. While portraying evolution theory as a "religion", Coulter portrays intelligent design as legitimate "science":

{{quote|Nor are intelligent design scientists looking at things they can't explain: Quite the opposite. They are looking at things they ''can'' explain but which Darwin didn't even know about, like the internal mechanism of the cell, and saying, That wasn't created by natural selection—that required high-tech engineering. By contrast, the evolution cult members look at things they can't explain and say, We can't explain it, but the one thing we do know is that there is no intelligence in the universe. It must have been random chance, or it's not 'science'.}}

Coulter's reliance on intelligent design and creationist sources for science, has prompted some critics of the [[intelligent design movement]] to analyze her claims. [[P. Z. Myers]], countering Coulter's claim that there is no evidence for the theory of evolution, points to the [[scientific literature]] that contains hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of articles about various aspects of evolution.  He also argues that Coulter has it backwards: The issue is not whether there is evidence that supports evolution theory, but whether there is evidence that is explained by evolution theory, since [[theory|theories]] are explanations for data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php Ann Coulter: No evidence for evolution?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622031856/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |date=2006-06-22 }} PZ Myers. Pharyngula, scienceblogs.com June 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Coulter's citing of [[Jonathan Wells (intelligent design advocate)|Jonathan Wells]]' arguments concerning [[peppered moth evolution]], Ian Musgrave argues that Coulter misrepresents the significance of the peppered moth experiments, makes a number of factual errors, and a "wildly ignorant misrepresentation of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/06/anne_coulter_cl_1.html Ann Coulter: Clueless] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121005418/http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/06/anne_coulter_cl_1.html |date=2013-01-21 }} Ian Musgrave. ''The Panda's Thumb'', June 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; James Downard criticized Coulter's favoring of [[secondary source]]s over [[primary source]]s, saying "she compulsively reads inaccurate antievolutionary sources and accepts them on account of their reinforcement of what she wants to be true."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/coulter1.cfm Secondary Addiction: Ann Coulter on Evolution Part I] [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/coulter2.cfm Part II] [http://www.talkreason.org/articles/coulter3.cfm Part III] James Downard. TalkReason, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Media Matters for America]] responded to Coulter's "[[strawman]]" arguments against evolution by noting 11 types of "distortions" in her writing and going into detail explaining why her claims are false and contrary to science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/items/200607070010 Ann Coulter's "Flatulent Raccoon Theory"] [[Media Matters for America]] Jul 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A satirical account of Coulter's take on evolution was written by probabilist Peter Olofsson, whose tongue-in-cheek argument was that Coulter had in fact written a veiled criticism of the intelligent design movement, much like [[Alan Sokal]] did to the postmodern movement in his famous hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/polofsson/research/TheCoulterHoax.pdf The Coulter Hoax: How Ann Coulter Exposed the Intelligent Design Movement.] Peter Olofsson, ''Skeptical Inquirer'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligent design and public education ===
Coulter argues that intelligent design proponents' challenges to the theory of evolution are immediately disqualified as being based on religious beliefs. For example:
#The world's largest general scientific society, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], representing 262 affiliated societies and academies of science and 10 million individuals, has said that "although advocates of Intelligent Design usually avoid mentioning a specific creator, the concept is in fact religious, not scientific" and that efforts to teach "the controversy" are flawed as "there is no significant controversy within the scientific community about the validity of the theory of evolution. The current controversy surrounding the teaching of evolution is not a scientific one."&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf AAAS Statement on the Teaching of Evolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221000000/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf |date=February 21, 2006 }} [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. February 16, 2006 (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt;
#The ruling in ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' found that intelligent design is not science but is essentially religious in nature.

Coulter claims this is evidence of a "liberal-left" conspiracy to create generations of atheists taught through the public school system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
Coulter also asserts that students in the public school system should have the opportunity to debate evolution versus intelligent design in a classroom setting.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Reception ==
[[Christopher Hitchens]], in a critical review of ''Godless'' for ''[[The Liberal]]'', pointed to the book's incoherent prose and factual inaccuracy.&lt;ref name=chris&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|title=Non-Fiction Review - Godless|url=http://www.theliberal.co.uk/hitchens.htm|website=theliberal.co.uk|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deities depicted with horns or antlers are found in many different religions across the world.

==Horned goddess Hathor==
{{Main|Hathor}}
[[File:MekauraHeldByGoddessHathor MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|right|Close-up of a triad statue depicting the pharaoh Mekaura being held by the goddess [[Hathor]].]]
Hathor is commonly depicted as a cow goddess with head horns in which is set a sun disk with [[Uraeus]]. Twin feathers are also sometimes shown in later periods as well as a {{not a typo|menat}} necklace. Hathor may be the cow goddess who is depicted from an early date on the Narmer Palette and on a stone urn dating from the 1st dynasty that suggests a role as sky-goddess and a relationship to Horus who, as a sun god, is "housed" in her.
{{Main|Hathor#Relationships, associations, images and symbols}}
Hathor had a complex relationship with [[Ra]], in one myth she is his [[eye of Ra|eye]] and considered his daughter but later, when Ra assumes the role of Horus with respect to Kingship, she is considered Ra's mother. She absorbed this role from another cow goddess 'Mht wrt' ("Great flood") who was the mother of Ra in a creation myth and carried him between her horns. As a mother she gave birth to Ra each morning on the eastern horizon and as wife she conceives through union with him each day.
{{Main|Bat (goddess)}}
Bat was a cow goddess in [[Egyptian mythology]] depicted as a human face with cow ears and horns. By the time of the Middle Kingdom her identity and attributes were subsumed within the goddess Hathor. The worship of Bat dates to earliest times and may have its origins in Late Paleolithic cattle herding. Bat was the chief goddess of Seshesh, otherwise known as Hu or Diospolis Parva, the 7th nome of Upper Egypt.
The imagery of Bat as a divine cow was remarkably similar to that of Hathor the parallel goddess from Lower Egypt. The significant difference in their depiction is that Bat's horns curve inward and Hathor's curve outward slightly. It is possible that this could be based in the different breeds of cattle herded at different times.

==Cult of the bull deities==

{{main|Bull (mythology)#Egypt}}
In Egypt, the bull was worshiped as [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]], the embodiment of [[Ptah]] and later of [[Osiris]]. A long series of ritually perfect bulls were identified by the god's priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and encased in a giant [[sarcophagus]]. A long sequence of monolithic stone sarcophagi were housed in the [[Serapeum]], and were rediscovered by [[Auguste Mariette]] at [[Saqqara]] in 1851. The bull was also worshipped as [[Mnevis]], the embodiment of [[Atum-Ra]], in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  ''Ka'' in Egyptian is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull.
{{main|Mnevis}}
Mnevis was identified as being a living bull. This may be a vestige of the sacrifice of kings after a period of reign, who were seen as the sons of [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]] or [[Hathor]] (see:[[Horned deity#Horned goddess Hathor|horned goddess Hathor]]), the ancient cow deity of the early solar cults. Thus, seen as a symbol of the later sun god, Ra, the Mnevis was often depicted, in [[art]], with the solar disc of their mother, Hathor between its horns.
[[File:Isis Enthroned-Egyptian-650-BCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Isis]] with horns]]{{main|Bull (mythology)#Levant}}
The [[Canaan]]ite deity [[Moloch]] (according to the bible) was often depicted as a bull, and became a bull demon in [[Abrahamic]] traditions. The bull is familiar in [[Judeo-Christian]] cultures from the [[Biblical]] episode wherein an [[idolatry|idol]] of the [[Golden Calf]] is made by [[Aaron]] and worshipped by the Hebrews in the wilderness of Sinai (''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'').  The text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] can be understood to refer to the idol as representing a separate god, or as representing the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] himself, perhaps through an association or syncretization with Egyptian or [[Levant]]ine bull gods, rather than a new deity in itself.

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Exodus 32:4] "He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt'."

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Nehemiah 9:18] "even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' They committed terrible blasphemies."

Calf-idols are referred to later in the Tanakh, such as in the Book of [http://bible.cc/hosea/10-5.htm Hosea], which would seem accurate as they were a fixture of near-eastern cultures.

[[King Solomon|King Solomon's]] "bronze sea"-basin stood on twelve brazen bulls, according to [http://bible.cc/1_kings/7-25.htm 1. Kings 7:25].

Young bulls were set as frontier markers at [[Tel Dan]] and at [[Bethel]] the frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]].

==Ram deities in ancient Egypt==
[[File:Banebdjedet of Mendes.jpg|thumb|left|Banebdjedet]]
The ram was revered in [[ancient Egypt]] in matters of fertility and war. Early gods with long wavy ram horns include [[Khnum]] and the equivalent god in [[Lower Egypt]], [[Banebdjedet]], the "Ram Lord of Djedet" ([[Mendes]]), who was typically shown with four ram heads to represent the four souls (''[[Ba (Egyptian soul)|Ba]]'') of the sun god.&lt;ref name="pinch"/&gt; Banebdjedet may also be linked to the first four gods to rule over Egypt, [[Osiris]], [[Geb]], [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[Ra]]-[[Atum]], with large granite shrines devoted to each in the Mendes sanctuary. The ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'' describes the "Ram of Mendes" as being the Ba of Osiris, but this was not an exclusive association.&lt;ref name="pinch"&gt;''Handbook of Egyptian mythology'', Geraldine Pinch, p 114-115, Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-517024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

List of Egyptian gods  associated with the ram:
* [[Khnum]] (one of the earliest Egyptian deities)
* [[Heryshaf]] (a ram god of [[Herakleopolis Magna|Heracleopolis]])
* [[Kherty]] (a variant of [[Aken (god)|Aken]], The chief deity in Egyptian mythology)
* [[Andjety]] (precursor of Osiris, Auf "Efu Ra").
* [[Horem Akhet]] (a god depicted as a [[sphinx]] with the head of a man, lion, or ram)
* [[Banebdjedet]] (ram god linked to the first four Egyptian gods: Osiris, Geb, Shu, Ra-Atum)
* [[Amun#Cult in Nubia, Libya, and Greece|Amun]] (the ram deity that inspired the cult of Ammon)

==Cult of Ammon==
{{Main|Amun#Cult in Nubia, Libya, and Greece}}
[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|thumb|right|Roman cast terracotta of ram-horned Jupiter Ammon, 1st century AD (Museo Barracco, Rome)]]
The worship of Ammon was introduced into Greece at an early period, probably through the medium of the Greek colony in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], which must have formed a connection with the great oracle of Ammon in the Oasis soon after its establishment. Ammon had a temple and a statue, the gift of [[Pindar]], at Thebes,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' ix.16 § 1&lt;/ref&gt; and another at [[Sparta]], the inhabitants of which, as [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' iii.18 § 2&lt;/ref&gt; consulted the oracle of Ammon in Libya from early times more than the other Greeks. At [[Aphytis]], Chalcidice, Ammon was worshipped, from the time of [[Lysander]], as zealously as in Ammonium. Pindar the poet honoured the god with a hymn. At [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] the god was represented with the head of a ram (Paus. viii.32 § 1), and the Greeks of Cyrenaica dedicated at Delphi a chariot with a statue of Ammon.

Such was its reputation among the Classical Greeks that [[Alexander the Great]] journeyed there after the [[battle of Issus]] and during his occupation of Egypt, where he was declared ''the son of Amun'' by the oracle.  Alexander thereafter considered himself divine.  Even during this occupation, Amun, identified by these Greeks as a form of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref&gt;Jerem. xlvi.25&lt;/ref&gt; continued to be the principal local deity of Thebes.
{{Main|Berber mythology#Before the battle of Irassa (570 BC)}}
The Cyrenaican Greeks built temples for the Libyan god Amon instead of their original god [[Zeus]]. They later identified their supreme god [[Zeus]] with the Libyan Amon.&lt;ref&gt;Oric Bates, The Eastern Libyans.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them continued worshipping Amon himself.
Amon's cult was so widespread among the Greeks that even [[Alexander the Great]] decided to be declared as the son of Zeus in the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwan]] temple by the Libyan priests of Amon.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, revue Tifinagh...&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SFEC EGYPT KARNAK 2006-001.JPG|thumb|left|Ram statues line the entrance to Amun's Temple]]{{Main|Berber mythology#Amun as a common deity}}
Although the most modern sources ignored the existence of Amun in the Berber mythology, he was maybe the greatest ancient Berber god.&lt;ref&gt;H. Basset, Les influences puniques chez les Berbères, pp 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored by the Ancient Greeks in Cyrenaica, and was united with the Phoenician/Carthaginian god [[Baal-hamon]] due to Libyan influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, Revue Tifinagh...&lt;/ref&gt; Some depictions of the [[Sheep|ram]] across North Africa belong to the lythic period which is situated between [[9th millennium BC|9600 BC]] and 7500 BC. &lt;br /&gt;
The most famous Amun's temple in Ancient Libya was the temple at the oasis of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]].
The name of the ancient Berber tribes: ''[[Garamantes]]'' and ''Nasamonians'' are believed by some scholars to be related to the name ''Amon''.&lt;ref&gt;Helene Hagan, The Shining Ones: An Etymological Essay on the Amazigh Roots of the Egyptian civilization, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Berber mythology#Solar and lunar worship}}
In Awelimmiden [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], the name ''Amanai'' is believed to have the meaning of "[[God]]". The [[Ancient Libya]]ns may have worshipped the setting sun, which was personified by Amon, who was represented by the [[Sheep|ram]]'s [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Baʿal#Baʿal of Carthage}}
In Carthage and North Africa [[Baal-hamon]] was especially associated with the ram and was worshiped also as Baʿal Qarnaim ("Lord of Two Horns") in an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein ("the two-horned hill") across the bay from Carthage.
{{Main|Alexander the Great in the Qur'an#The two-horned one}}
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|right|Silver tetradrachmon (ancient Greek coin) issued in the name of Alexander the Great, depicting Alexander with the horns of Ammon.]]

The [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian god]] [[Ammon-Ra]] was depicted with [[Sheep|ram]] horns. Rams were considered a symbol of [[virility]] due to their [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] behavior. The horns of Ammon may have also represented the East and West of the Earth, and one of the titles of [[Ammon]] was "the two-horned." Alexander was depicted with the horns of Ammon as a result of his conquest of [[ancient Egypt]] in 332 BC, where the priesthood received him as the son of the god Ammon, who was identified by the ancient Greeks with [[Zeus]], the [[King of the Gods]]. The combined [[deity]] Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity ([[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Diodorus]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], and [[Plutarch]]), Alexander visited the [[Oracle of Ammon]] at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert and rumors spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the [[deity]] Ammon, rather than Philip.&lt;ref name=coin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/15880/From-the-Persian-Wars-to-Alexander-the-Great-490-336-bc|title=Coin: from the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490–336 bc|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Green2007|Green 2007]]. p.382&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plutarch&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+27.1 ''Alexander'', 27]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own [[divinity]] and to have required its acceptance by others ... The cities perforce complied, but often ironically: the [[Sparta]]n decree read, '' 'Since Alexander wishes to be a god, let him be a god.' ''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Alexander III, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence on demonology==

[[File:MuseoArchNapoliGSpancapra3122.jpg|thumb|right|Pan enjoying a goat]]

===Christian demonology===
{{main|Christian demonology#Appearance}}
The idea that demons have horns seems to have been taken from the [[Book of Revelation]] chapter 13. The book of Revelation seems to have inspired many depictions of demons. This idea has also been associated with the depiction of certain ancient gods like [[Moloch]] and the [[shedu]], etc., which were portrayed as bulls, as men with the head of a bull, or wearing bull horns as a crown.

===Baphomet of Mendes===
The satanic "horned god" symbol known as the [[baphomet]] is based on an [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] ram deity that was worshipped in [[Mendes]], called [[Banebdjed]] (literally [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|Ba]] of the lord of [[djed]], and titled "the Lord of Mendes"), who was the soul of [[Osiris]]. According to ''Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of ancient Egypt'', the book's author [[Geraldine Harris]], said the ram gods Ra-[[Amun]] (see: [[Horned deity#Cult of Ammon|Cult of Ammon]]), and Banebdjed, were to mystically unite with the [[Great Royal Wife|queen of Egypt]] to sire the heir to the throne (a theory based on depictions found in several Theban temples in Mendes).

Occultist [[Eliphas Levi]] in his ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' (1855), combined the images of the [[Tarot of Marseilles]]' [[The Devil (Tarot card)|Devil card]] and refigured the ram Banebdjed as a he-goat, calling it the "[[Baphomet]] of Mendes," (or, "Goat of Mendes"). The inaccurate description can be traced back to ''Herodotus' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] Book II'', where [[Herodotus]] describes the deity of Mendes as having a goat's head and fleece, when Banebdjedet was really represented by a [[Sheep|ram]], not a [[goat]].
[[File:RWS Tarot 15 Devil.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] in the [[Rider-Waite Tarot deck]].]]{{Main|Baphomet#Aleister Crowley}}
The Baphomet of Lévi was to become an important figure within the cosmology of [[Thelema]], the mystical system established by [[Aleister Crowley]] in the early twentieth century.  Baphomet features in the Creed of the [[Gnostic Catholic Church]] recited by the congregation in ''[[The Gnostic Mass]]'', in the sentence: "And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His name BAPHOMET" (see: [[Aleister Crowley#Occult|Aleister Crowley: Occult]]).
{{Main|Baphomet#As a demon}}
Lévi's Baphomet is the source of the later [[The Devil (Tarot card)|Tarot image of the Devil]] in the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider-Waite design]]. The concept of a downward-pointing [[pentagram]] on its forehead was enlarged upon by Lévi in his discussion (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosmic man]] arranged within a similar but upright pentagram. The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' by [[Stanislas de Guaita]], later adopted as the official symbol—called the [[Sigil of Baphomet]]—of the [[Church of Satan]], and continues to be used among [[Satanism|Satanists]].

Few neopagan reconstructionist traditions recognize Satan or the Devil outright.  However, many neopagan groups worship some sort of [[Horned God]], for example as a consort of the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Great Goddess]] in [[Wicca]]. These gods usually reflect [[mythology|mythological]] figures such as [[Cernunnos]] or [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], and any similarity they may have to the Christian Devil seems to date back only to the 19th century, when a Christian reaction to Pan's growing importance in literature and art resulted in his image being translated to that of the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title=Triumph of the Moon |page=46 |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford UniverUniversity Press |location=Oxford |ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an implied connection between Satan and [[Beelzebub]] (lit. ''Lord of the Flies''), originally a [[Semitic deity]] called [[Baal]] (lit. "lord"). Beelzebub is the most recognized demon in the Bible, whose name has become analogous to Satan. Occult and metaphysical author [[Michelle Belanger]] believes that Beelzebub (a mockery of the original name&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=498&amp;letter=B] Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;) is the horned god Ba'al [[Hadad]], whose cult symbol was the bull.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Demons: Names of the Damned By Michelle Belanger -Page 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca'', Beelzebub reigned over the Witches' Sabbath ("synagoga"&lt;ref&gt;Witch hunts in the western world: persecution and punishment from the ...

{{main|Beelzebub#Christian demonology and occult}}
Beelzebub was also imagined to be sowing his influence in Salem, Massachusetts: his name came up repeatedly during the [[Salem witch trials]], the last large-scale public expression of witch hysteria in North America or Europe, and afterwards Rev. [[Cotton Mather]] wrote a [[pamphlet]] entitled ''Of Beelzebub and his Plot.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020921203915/http://www.4literature.net/Cotton_Mather/Of_Beelzebub_and_His_Plot|title=Of Beelzebub and His Plot by Cotton Mather|date=21 September 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
{{main|Horned God}}
In 1933, the Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]] published the book, ''The God of the Witches'', in which she theorised that Pan was merely one form of a [[horned god]] who was worshipped across Europe by a [[Witch Cult hypothesis|witch-cult]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Ronald Hutton]], page 199&lt;/ref&gt; This theory influenced the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] notion of the Horned God, as an [[archetype]] of male virility and sexuality. In [[Wicca]], the archetype of the Horned God is highly important, and is thought by believers to be represented by such deities as the Celtic [[Cernunnos]], Indian [[Pashupati]] and Greek Pan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Horned God in Wiccan based neopagan religions represents a [[Solar deity|solar god]] often associated with [[vegetation deity|vegetation]], that's honored as the ''Holly King'' or ''Oak King'' in [[Neopagan]] rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/yulethelongestnight/p/Holly_KIng_Yule.htm] The Legend of the Holly King and the Oak King
By Patti Wigington&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, the Horned God is considered a male [[List of fertility deities|fertility god]].&lt;ref&gt;The Quest: A Search for the Grail of Immortality by Rhuddlwm Gawr pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt; The use of horns as a symbol for power dates back to the ancient world. From ancient [[Egyptians|Egypt]] and the [[Ba'al]] worshipping [[Canaanite religion|Cannanites]], to the [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Celts]], and various other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Myth and Territory in the Spartan Mediterranean by Irad Malkin pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Horns have ever been present in religious imagery as symbols of fertility and power.&lt;ref&gt;Wicca: The Complete Craft by Deanna J. Conway pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Language of God in the Universe by Helena Lehman pg. 301&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until Christianity attributed horns to [[Satan]] as part of his iconography that horned gods became associated with evil in Western mythology:&lt;ref&gt;The Devil: perceptions of evil from antiquity to primitive Christianity by Jeffrey Burton Russell pg. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[Neopaganism|neo-Pagans]] focus their worship on a horned god, or often "the" Horned God and one or more goddesses. Deities such as [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and [[Dionysus]] have had attributes of their worship imported into the [[Neopagan]] concept as have the Celtic [[Cernunnos]] and [[Gwynn ap Nudd]], one of the mythological leaders of the [[Wild Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;Fabulous creatures, mythical monsters, and animal power symbols: a handbook by Cassandra Eason pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism By Shelley Rabinovitch, James Lewis pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford companion to world mythology by David Adams Leeming pg. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The outer temple of witchcraft: circles, spells, and rituals by Christopher Penczak  pg. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9168">The '''Langston Hughes Library''' is a private non-circulating library designed by [[Maya Lin]], and located on the Haley Farm in [[Clinton, Tennessee]].  It contains a 5,000-volume reference collection focusing on works by African-American authors and illustrators, and books focused on the Black experience.&lt;ref&gt;from http://www.childrensdefense.org/who-is-cdf/cdf-contacts-state-offices/cdf-haley-farm/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and history==
Haley farm was once owned by writer Alex Haley, and was purchased by the [[Children's Defense Fund]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Y. R. (1994, June 30). CURRENTS; A New Role for Alex Haley's Farm. New York Times, p. C3.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now run as a retreat center, with training and conference facilities, the Riggio-Lynch Interfaith Chapel, guest cottages, and the library.   The farm consists of {{convert|157|acre|km2}} surrounded by ridges of the Appalachian mountains, and is {{convert|25|mi|km}} north of Knoxville.&lt;ref&gt;from http://www.childrensdefense.org/who-is-cdf/cdf-contacts-state-offices/cdf-haley-farm/; Lamb, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;   The grounds of the farm include streams, a lake, an apple orchard, and a ropes course.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, 1994; Abif, K. K. (2002, February) Respite on the farm. American Libraries, 33(2), 52-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Langston Hughes Library was dedicated on March 19, 1999.  The dedication ceremony was attended by such important figures as Maya Angelou, Hillary Rodham Clinton, John Franklin, and Toni Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-zing.net/LHL/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The Children's Defense Fund and its sister organization, the Black Community Crusade for Children, run this library  "as an incubator for the CDF's "Leave No Child Behind" movement.&lt;ref&gt;Abif, 2002, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==The building==
The Library is a 1,200 square foot 2-story building with a single reading room upstairs and entryway and a small bookstore in the south corn crib.&lt;ref&gt;: http://goodchurchdesign.blogspot.com/2008/01/maya-lins-langston-hughes-library.html; (Arcady, 2008); Lin, M. Y. (2000). Boundaries. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 10:24&lt;/ref&gt;   The reading room was designed to be a flexible space, allowing for public readings or personal study areas, as needed.

An 1860s refurbished barn and two corn cribs comprise the exterior skin of the building.&lt;ref name="prelectur.stanford.edu"&gt;http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/lin/&lt;/ref&gt;  The rustic exterior, which evokes the "architectural vernacular of 19th-century East Tennessee, a plain language of silvery, time-worn siding, rough logs, and minimal geometries" is melded with modern Shaker-like simplicity on the interior.&lt;ref&gt;Kreyling, C. (2000). Lin Finds New Use for Old Barn at Langston Hughes Library. Architectural Record, 188(5), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya Lin pointed out that the function of the exterior and that of the interior were different and thus she "wanted to make a real cut between outside and inside…there didn't seem to be much point in preserving the rustic feel of the barn's interior".&lt;ref name="Kreyling, 2000"&gt;Kreyling, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most striking aspects of the design are the glass-encased corn cribs that act as a base for the cantelievered barn that sits atop them.  Margaret Butler of Martella Associates states that the glass between the logs "glows like a Chinese lantern" at night.&lt;ref name="Kreyling, 2000"/&gt;

===The architect===
The Library was designed by Maya Lin, most famous for her Vietnam Veteran's Memorial in Washington DC., and who also created the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] in Montgomery, AL.  Martella Associates, Knoxville, were the architect of record.&lt;ref name="Kreyling, 2000"/&gt;

Lin explains her vision: "The idea was to maintain the integrity and character of the old barn yet introduce a new inner layer…expressing the idea of a separate inner skin slipping inside the old barn".&lt;ref&gt;Lin, 2000, p. 10:24&lt;/ref&gt;  "I'd never seen a shape like that before and wanted to save it….once I realized that the book collection was small and the library would be used as an intimate gathering space, I came up with the concept of an elevated reading room".&lt;ref name="Kreyling, 2000"/&gt;

===Building materials===
The exterior skin consists of a reclaimed barn and two corncribs, held together with glass and steel bars. "Crib walls are supported by threaded steel rod, expressing this new architectural element, instead of hiding it".&lt;ref&gt;Crosbie, M.J. (2003). Architecture for the Books. Victoria, Australia: The Images Publishing Group p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior spaces use new materials: maple and particleboard, sisal mats and recycled soybean husk tabletops designed by Lin.&lt;ref&gt;Crosbie, 2003, p. 221; Lin, 2000, p. 10:29,&lt;/ref&gt; The materials chosen were either recycled or "green".  Natural daylight floods the interiors via large skylights and windows, reducing the need for artificial lighting.  The exterior space between the two cribs incorporates a small stone fountain that gives the "'transitory' space a new life and making a positive space out of a void".&lt;ref name="Lin, 2000, p. 10:29"&gt;Lin, 2000, p. 10:29&lt;/ref&gt; A nearby pond is used "as a natural heat exchanger to help reduce the library's energy costs".&lt;ref name="Lin, 2000, p. 10:29"/&gt;

===Critical response===
A critic for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer appreciates "the quiet, reductive clarity of her work" and states that Lin "has transformed a barn into a Frank Gehry-like marvel of colored light and air".&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, R. (2000, October 19). Maya Lin emerges from the shadows. Seattle Post-Intelligencer.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alex Ross &lt;ref name="prelectur.stanford.edu"/&gt; of Stanford University considers the library a "marvelous example of adaptive re-use."

==The library==
The Children's Defense Fund purpose in building the Langston Hughes Library was to "connects young leaders and activists with the glorious heritage of the struggle for freedom, and is where policy makers and community builders come to connect, recharge their spiritual and physical batteries" and act as a "training ground for the next generation of leadership, advocacy and service for children and families".&lt;ref name="childrensdefense.org"&gt;http://www.childrensdefense.org/who-is-cdf/cdf-contacts-state-offices/cdf-haley-farm/&lt;/ref&gt;
Architect Maya Lin states that her mission in creating the library was to "create a fluid transition between a building and its site, so that you will always feel connected to the land"(.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, 2000, p. 12:29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection===
"The collection specializes in publications about children's advocacy; spirituality; nonviolence; the Civil Rights Movement, with particular attention to the role of women; women's leadership; African American history, literature, and culture; African culture and history; and children's literature. Special highlights of the collection are the hundreds of books that have been chosen as CDF Freedom Schools books".&lt;ref name="childrensdefense.org"/&gt;  Original manuscripts of seminal works in African-American literature are being collected.&lt;ref&gt;Abif, 2002, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet-based access Tennessee Electronic Library (TEL) databases is available for academic research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-zing.net/LHL/collection.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Users===
The Langston Hughes Library's patrons include activists, students, tourists, dignitaries, scholars.  Class visits are held, festivals are hosted and retreats are accommodated at the Haley Farm.  Events such as the Langston Hughes Library Roundtable, Langston Hughes Children's Literature Festival and African American Read-In are regularly held at the Haley Farm.&lt;ref name="childrensdefense.org"/&gt;

===Librarians===
Khafre Abif, currently at the Cleveland Public Library, was the first director of the library.  He expressed his desire to reach children directly as his impetus to seek his MLS.&lt;ref name="sis.pitt.edu"&gt;http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~sisint/archives/faculty_news/facnews12_06_02.pdf, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;   Abif spoke about children's library services, "this is where it begins, if you do it right at this age you will have library lovers for life and you won't have to convince adults of the power of libraries, they'll already know".&lt;ref name="sis.pitt.edu"/&gt;  He acted as director of the Langston Hughes Library  through at least 2002.

===Funding and future projects===
The building project was partially funded by from Barnes &amp; Noble CEO Len Riggio and his wife Louise.&lt;ref name="childrensdefense.org"/&gt;  Ongoing funding for acquisitions and operations are provided by the Children's Defense Fund. 
Planned improvements to the Haley Farm include "a Walking Path to Commemorate the Cloud of Witnesses for Social Justice" and an Outward Bound camp.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-zing.net/LHL/visitus.htm; Abif, 2002, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Maya Lin also designed the Riggio-Lynch Chapel located on Haley Farm, built in 2004, making Haley Farm "the only site in the United States with two Maya Lin structures".&lt;ref name="childrensdefense.org"/&gt;

This is a '''list of people declared ''persona non grata'''''. ''[[Persona non grata]]'' ([[Latin]], [[plural]]: ''personae non gratae''), literally meaning "an unwelcome person", is a legal term used in [[diplomacy]] that indicates a proscription against a foreign person entering or remaining in the country. It is the most serious form of censure that one country can apply to foreign diplomats, who are otherwise protected by [[diplomatic immunity]] from [[arrest]] and other normal kinds of prosecution.

"'''Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!'''" is a famous phrase typically featured on the American [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which runs on the [[NBC]] broadcast network. It is generally used as a way to end a [[cold opening]] sketch and lead into the opening titles/montage and cast introductions for the program.

== Origin ==
During the show's first season, the show was known simply as ''NBC's Saturday Night'', due to the existence of an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show titled ''[[Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell]]''. This is how the phrase received its wording. The phrase was kept intact even after ABC's ''SNL'' was canceled and ''NBC's Saturday Night'' adopted the ''SNL'' name for itself.

== Instances used ==
[[File:Chevy Chase 1980 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Chevy Chase]] said the line on the first show that aired, October 11, 1975.]]
The phrase is typically spoken by a host, cast member(s), and/or musical guest, and has been used in every season except one (the 1981-1982 season, the first full season with [[Dick Ebersol]] as producer). It was first said live on air by [[Chevy Chase]], on ''SNL''{{'}}s first show on October 11, 1975. For all but two of the first season's 24 episodes, Chase delivered the phrase after a [[Pratfall effect|pratfall]] of some kind. Even when the show is not aired on a Saturday—such as the ''[[Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday]]'' specials aired from 2008 to 2012, and again in 2017—the traditional line is used. 

The person delivering the phrase usually [[Breaking character|breaks character]] and the [[fourth wall]], in that the phrase is normally not spoken to other cast members as part of the regular dialogue in the opening sketch. Instead, the person suddenly turns (if not already facing downstage) and delivers the phrase directly to the audience and the camera with a full-throated shout. At the same time, the camera zooms in for a tight [[close-up]] shot of the person's face, followed by a [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] to the show's opening montage and titles.

== Readings by special guests ==
The line has occasionally been given to a non-host/non-cast member for [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] purposes. This could be for stars like [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]], or for more unusual celebrities like [[Monica Lewinsky]], ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' winner [[John Carpenter (game show contestant)|John Carpenter]], [[WWE]] chairman [[Vince McMahon]] (on March 18, 2000), [[Carolyn Kepcher]] (on April 3, 2004), [[Al Sharpton]] (on November 2, 2013), and [[Stormy Daniels]] (on May 5, 2018).

=== Presidents and Presidential hopefuls ===
[[Gerald Ford]] opened the show with the phrase on April 17, 1976, which came during his presidency.
A series of Presidential and Vice Presidential hopefuls have also announced the phrase on their appearances on the show, beginning with [[Bob Dole]] on November 16, 1996 (coming after the 1996 election). It was announced by [[Barack Obama]] on November 3, 2007, by [[Hillary Clinton]] on March 1, 2008, by [[Sarah Palin]] on October 18, 2008, and by [[John McCain]] on November 1, 2008.

'''Malecite–Passamaquoddy''' (also known as Maliseet–Passamaquoddy) is an endangered [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language spoken by the [[Maliseet]] and [[Passamaquoddy people|Passamaquoddy]] peoples along both sides of the border between [[Maine]] in the [[United States]] and [[New Brunswick]], Canada. The language consists of two major dialects: Malecite, which is mainly spoken in the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River Valley]] in New Brunswick; and Passamaquoddy, spoken mostly in the [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|St. Croix River Valley]] of eastern Maine. However, the two dialects differ only slightly, mainly in accent. Malecite-Passamaquoddy was widely spoken by the indigenous people in these areas until around the post-[[World War II]] era, when changes in the education system and increased marriage outside of the speech community caused a large decrease in the number of children who learned or regularly used the language.&lt;ref name="Leavitt"&gt;Leavitt, Robert M. ''Passamaquoddy-Maliseet''. 1996. Newcastle: Lincom Europa.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in both Canada and the U.S. today, there are only 600 speakers of both dialects, and most speakers are older adults.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Although the majority of younger people cannot speak the language (particularly the Passamaquoddy dialect), there is growing interest in teaching the language in community classes and in some schools.&lt;ref name="Leavitt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="native-languages.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.native-languages.org/mali.htm |title=Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language (Maliseet-Passamaquoddy Language) |publisher=Native-languages.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology and orthography==

The Malecite-Passamaquoddy standard [[orthography]] consists of 17 letters and an apostrophe. The following tables are based on the sound system described by Robert M. Leavitt in ''Passamaquoddy-Maliseet'' (1996). The bold letters are the spelling in the standard orthography and the symbols in square brackets give the respective [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] pronunciation:

=== Consonants ===

|
| '''l''' {{IPAslink|l}}
| '''y''' {{IPAslink|j}}
|
| '''w''' {{IPAslink|w}}
| 
|}

Additionally, the standard orthography uses an apostrophe ({{'}}) to represent word-initial consonants that are no longer pronounced due to historic [[sound change]]s. It occurs only word-initially before ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', ''q'', ''s'', or ''c''. These "missing consonants" can appear in other forms of the word. For example, the stem ''ktomakéyu'' produces the word ''{{'}}tomakéyu'' "s/he is poor" (where the apostrophe indicates that the initial ''k'' has been dropped) as well as the word ''nkótomakey'' "I am poor" (where the ''k'' remains pronounced because it occurs after the pronoun ''n-'').&lt;ref name="Leavitt"/&gt;

=== Vowels ===
There are six [[monophthong]]s, five of which are spelled with a single letter and one which is spelled with the combination ''eh''. There are also five [[diphthong]]s, which are spelled as a combination of a vowel and a [[Semivowel|glide]]:

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center

|'''eh''' {{IPA|[æ]}}
| '''a''' {{IPA|[a]}}
| 
|}

(When ''o'' appears before ''w'', it is written as ''u'' to reflect the [[Roundedness|rounding]] of the vowel due to the influence of the ''w''). (/e/ may also be pronounced as /ɛ/).

|}

=== Phonological processes ===
There are many phonological processes that occur in Malecite-Passamaquoddy, the most important of which are outlined below:

* Several consonants have two [[allophone]]s, which [[Alternation (linguistics)|alternate]] depending on where they appear in the word. When they appear adjacent to another consonant or following an apostrophe, they use the default [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] pronunciation given in the consonant chart above. When they appear only adjacent to vowels or the prefix ''n-'', they use the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] equivalent of the same sound. For example, in the word ''peciye'' "he/she arrives", ''c'' is voiced: [bed͡ʒije]. But the word ''pihce'' "far away" the ''c'' is unvoiced because it is adjacent to ''h'': [bit͡ʃe]. The following table summarizes these consonants and their voiced and unvoiced allophones:

| {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}}
|}

* [[syncope (phonetics)|Syncope]] of unstressed ''o'' is very common. This often occurs when ''o'' is in the first syllable of a verb stem used without a prefix. For example, in the word ''ktomakeyu'' "if s/he is poor" (from the verb stem ''-kotomakey-''), the first ''o'' drops out because it is unstressed. But in ''nkotomakey'' "I am poor", which is built off the same verb stem, the first syllable is stressed. Therefore, the first ''o'' is not dropped. There are many more environments where this occurs, but the changes due to syncope are usually entirely predictable. LeSourd describes many of the syncope rules in ''Accent and Syllable Structure in Passamaquoddy'' (1993).
* Verbs with ''o'' (or an underlying ''o'' that has undergone syncope) in the first syllable of their stem have an [[Apophony|ablaut]] form in the Changed Conjunct mode, where the ''o'' changes to an ''e''. For example, the verb stem ''-wotom-'' ("smoke") becomes ''wetomat'' ("when he/she smoked").
* With verb stems that end in ''h'', the vowel preceding the ''h'' changes to match the first vowel in the inflectional ending that follows the stem. The vowel preceding the ''h'' is therefore left as a blank underscore when writing out the stem. In the following example, the verb stem is ''-nehp_h-'' "kill":
:* ''nehpah·a'' "I kill him/her"
:* ''nehpeh·eq'' "when you killed him/her"
:* ''knehpih·i'' "you kill me"
:* ''nehpoh·oq'' "he/she kills me"
:* ''nehpuh·uku·k'' "they kill me"

* The monophthongs (except "o") are lengthened when they occur in certain positions, although vowel length is not contrastive. One notable difference between the two dialects is that vowels are generally not as long in Passamaquoddy as in Malecite, but the distribution of long and short vowels are similar. LeSourd describes the following generalizations about vowel lengthening:
:* vowels are lengthened before a ''hC'' cluster but remain short before other consonant clusters
:* vowels are lengthened in [[Syllable#Coda|open]] penultimate syllables if that syllable is stressed or if the final syllable is stressed
:* word final vowels are sometimes lengthened, especially when they occur before a pause

=== Distributional restrictions and syllable structure ===
Every phoneme except "o" and "h" can occur initially, medially, or finally; "o" and "h" are never word-final. Clusters of two obstruents, geminate consonant pairs, and clusters of a sonorant followed by an obstruent are all common. Consonant clusters ending in a sonorant usually don't occur except in geminate pairs or when they occur initially through the use of one of the personal pronoun prefixes. Clusters of three consonants can occur, and are almost always of the form ''CsC''.&lt;ref name=LeSourd&gt;LeSourd, Philip S. [https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/14451 ''Accent and Syllable Structure in Passamaquoddy'']. 1993. New York: Garland Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most basic and common syllable structures are ''CV'' and ''CVC''.

=== Stress and pitch accent ===
Stress is assigned based on a set of very complex rules, and difference in stress and accent systems is one of the clearest distinguishing features between Malecite and Passamaquoddy. According to LeSourd, in Passamaquoddy there are vowels that are considered stressable and ones that are considered unstressable. Stressable vowels are available to be acted on by stress rules, while unstressable vowels might undergo syncope. Stress is assigned (to stressable vowels only) to initial syllables and even-numbered syllables, counting from right to left. There is a simultaneous left to right process that reassigns some unstressable vowels as stressable. Unstressable vowels which do not become stressable based on the left to right process are subject to syncope based on five rules LeSourd outlines in ''Accent and Syllable Structure in Passamaquoddy''. Malecite has a similar process but the finer details of the stress assignment rules are different.

In addition to stress rules, there are also rules that assign [[Pitch accent|pitch]] to some syllables based on their position in the words. As LeSourd describes, Passamaquoddy stressed syllables can be relatively high-pitched or low-pitched, and final unstressed syllables can be distinctively low-pitched.&lt;ref name="LeSourd"/&gt; Malecite has similar pitch assignments, but again, differs from Passamaquoddy in ways which serve to distinguish the two dialects.

== Morphology ==
There are four categories of words in Malecite-Passamaquoddy: nouns, pronouns, verbs, and [[Grammatical particle|particles]]; every type except particles are [[Inflection|inflected]]. Like other Algonquian languages, Malecite-Passamaquoddy is [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]], often combining many [[morpheme]]s into one word unit. It is also fairly [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], with many morphemes generally corresponding to a single unit of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bruening, Benjamin. (2001). ''Syntax at the edge: cross-clausal phenomena and the syntax of Passamaquoddy'' (Ph.D.). Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nouns ===
A basic characteristic of Malecite-Passamaquoddy is that all nouns and pronouns have [[noun class]]es: Like other Algonquian languages, nouns are either [[Animacy|animate or inanimate]]. All abstract nouns (such as "prayer", "happiness", "the past") are inanimate; people, personal names, animals, and trees are all animate. There is not a perfect correspondence between the inherent "animateness" of a noun and its class for all words, however: the words for "fingernail" and "knee" are animate, but the words for "heart" and "tongue" are inanimate.&lt;ref name="Leavitt"/&gt; Verbs impose restrictions on the noun class that one of their [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] must be. The easiest way to distinguish animate and inanimate nouns is by their plural forms. Animate plural nouns end in ''-k'', and inanimate plural nouns end in ''-l''.

In addition to class and number, animate nouns and pronouns (except "I," "we," and "you") are marked in sentences as either proximate or [[obviative]]. Inanimate nouns are never marked as obviative. Proximate nouns refer to something that is near the speaker or most central to the discourse, whereas obviative nouns refer to something that is distanced or more remote from consideration. When two nouns or pronouns are [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjoined]], they can both be proximate or both obviative. In all other cases, when two or more animate nouns or pronouns appear in the same clause, one will be proximate (the focus of the clause) and the others will be obviative. Proximate is the "default" noun ending; obviative forms use different endings.

Additionally, nouns can also be inflected for the absentative, [[locative case|locative]], and (with some nouns) vocative cases. The Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language Portal includes a [https://pmportal.org/sites/default/files/reference-documents/Noun%20Charts.pdf chart] showing all the possible declensions of nouns in various forms. Notably, the absentative case is marked not only with endings, but also changes in pitch contour.

Nouns can also be marked with [[diminutive]] and/or feminine suffixes. When these are combined with case markings, the order of suffixes is as follows:
# Noun stem
# Feminine suffix
# Diminutive suffix
# Locative, absentative, or vocative ending
# Number/gender/obviation ending

Some nouns cannot appear in an unpossessed form—that is, they must appear with one of the personal pronoun prefixes. All body parts and kinship terms are in this class. For each of these words there is a corresponding word that can appear unpossessed. For example,'' 'temisol'' "dog" must appear in a possessed form, but ''olomuss'' "dog" is usually never possessed.

Nouns can be used in apposition with other nouns and function like adjectives (which do not exist as a separate class of words).

Participles can be formed from the Changed Conjunct form of a verb and use the special plural endings ''-ik'' (animate) or ''-il'' (inanimate).

=== Pronouns ===
There are five types of pronouns: [[Personal pronoun|personal]], [[Demonstrative pronoun|demonstrative]], [[Interrogative pronoun|interrogative]], the word "other", and a hesitator/[[Filler (linguistics)|filler]] pronoun.

Personal pronouns differ from nouns and other pronouns in that they do not use plural markers but instead each form is unique. The third person is [[Gender-neutral pronoun|gender-neutral]] and there are both [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive]] forms of the second person plural pronoun. The first and second person singular also have longer [[Intensive pronoun|emphatic]] forms:

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
|+ Personal Pronouns
|- 
! 
! Singular
! Plural
|- 
! rowspan="2" | First person
| rowspan="2" | ''nìl, nilá'' "I, me"
| ''nilùn'' "we, us (exclusive)"
|- 
| ''kilùn'' "we, us (inclusive)"
|- 
! Second person
| ''kìl, kilá'' "you (singular)"
| ''kiluwìw'' "you (plural)"
|- 
! Third person
| ''nékom'' "he/she, him/her"
| ''nekomàw'' "they, them"
|-
|}
(In the above chart, acute accents show relatively high pitch and grave accents show relatively low pitch. Pitch is usually not marked except in dictionaries to distinguish similar words.)

There are three demonstrative pronouns, which have both animate and inanimate forms and are inflected for number, obviation, and absentativity:
* ''wot-yut'' "this, near me"
* ''not-nit'' "that, near the listener"
* ''yat-yet'' "that, far from the speaker and listener but in sight"

The interrogative pronouns are ''wen'' "who? (referring to animate noun)" and ''keq'' "what? (referring to inanimate noun)". They are also inflected for number, obviation, and absentativity.

The word ''kotok'' "another, other" is a pronoun that also has animate and inanimate forms that can be inflected with various endings.

One of the most interesting features is the pronoun that functions similarly to English "uh..." or "er...", but which is inflected to match the anticipated word. Compare the bolded pronoun in:
* ''nkisi puna ntahtuwossomut '''ihik'''... tuwihputik'' "I put my cup on the '''uh'''... table."
to:
* ''nkisewestuwama '''iyey'''... Mali'' "I spoke to '''uh'''... Mary".

=== Verbs ===
Verbs are built from word stems, which consist of one or more roots. Roots can be initial, medial, or final, and can be combined to build rich levels of meaning into a verb:
* '''Initial''': usually adjectival or adverbial in meaning, such as color, quality, or state
** '''''pus'''kosone'' "he/she has wet shoes" ('''''pus-''''' "wet")
* '''Medial''': can be nominal, adjectival, or adverbial; denote things such as body parts, geographic features, shapes, and arrangements; can be final if verb is very "noun-like"
** ''tomi'''ptine'''ssu'' "he/she breaks his/her own arm" ('''''-ptine-''''' "hand, arm")
** ''kini'''ptine''''' "he/she has big hands" ('''''-ptine-''''' "hand, arm")
* '''Final''': verbal meanings, denoting actions, emotions or states
** ''nmemi'''hp''''' "I have had enough to eat" ('''''-hp(i)-''''' "eat")

Verbs are classified by the final root in their stem, which marks them as [[Transitive verb|transitive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. Some verbs that have a direct object when they are translated into English are in reality intransitive verbs where the noun has been [[Noun incorporation|incorporated]] into the verb: ''posonut•ehk•e'' (basket-do.AI-3.sg) "he/she makes baskets".

Because Malecite-Passamaquoddy is polysynthetic, a large amount of grammatical information is expressed in one verb through the use of various inflections and affixes:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! 
! Possibilities
! Expressed by
|-
! Gender
| animate, inanimate
| final root vowels, inflectional endings
|-
! Transitivity
| transitive, intransitive
| final root vowels, inflectional endings
|-
! Person
| first, second, third, third obviate
| inflections
|-
! Number
| singular, plural
| inflectional endings; theme markers in ''ai'' verbs
|-
! Hierarchy
| direct, inverse; reflexive, reciprocal
| prefixes; theme markers in ''ta'' verbs
|-
! [[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]]
| positive, neg
| separate endings in most forms
|-
! [[Grammatical mood|Mode]]
| [[Realis mood|indicative]], [[Subjunctive mood|conjunct]], subordinative, [[Imperative mood|imperative]]
| stem shape, inflection
|-
! [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]
| [[Present tense|present]], absentative, dubitative, [[preterite]]
| inflectional endings
|-
|}

The possible modes and how they are used in sentences are:
* '''Independent indicative''': used in main clauses of statement and yes–no questions
* '''Changed conjunct''': usually used in adverbial clauses or in "who", "what", and "why" questions
* '''Unchanged conjunct''': used in "if" clauses and sentences beginning with ''nopal'' "if only"
* '''Subordinative''': used mainly in clauses to express subsequent or resulting action; can also be used alone as a "polite" imperative or as a second command following an imperative; also used in "how" questions
* '''Imperative''': used for direct commands
* '''Conjunct imperative''': used for indirect commands (third person subjects)

The possible tenses are:
* '''Present''': actions in present time; also used as basic past tense or for future when combined with particles such as 
* '''Preterite''': past completed action; used with Independent Indicative, Changed Conjunct, and Subordinative modes
* '''Dubitative preterite''': expresses doubt or uncertainty; used with Independent Indicative, Changed Conjunct, Unchanged Conjunct, and Subordinative modes; also marked for Preterite when in Independent Indicative or Unchanged Conjunct
* '''Absentative''': refers to an absentative noun; used with Independent Indicative or Subordinative modes

The Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language Portal also includes verbs charts showing extensive conjugations of different classes of verbs.[http://pmportal.org/]

=== Particles ===
Particles are all the words in the language that aren't inflected. They include:
* [[Cardinal numbers]] ([[ordinal numbers]] are nouns)
* [[Yes and no|Negative and positive particles]]
* [[Interjections]]
* [[Conjunctions]]
* Emphatic particles

==Syntax==

The verb system is [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]], meaning that the subjects of intransitive verbs behave like the objects of transitive verbs. Because of this, transitive and intransitive verbs have subcategories based on which gender one of their arguments must be, so that there are four major verb types:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
!
! Animate
! Inanimate
|-
! Intransitive
| animate-intransitive &lt;br&gt; ''AI'' &lt;br&gt;
| inanimate-intransitive &lt;br&gt; ''II'' &lt;br&gt;
|-
! Transitive
| transitive-animate &lt;br&gt; ''TA'' &lt;br&gt;
| transitive-inanimate &lt;br&gt; ''TI'' &lt;br&gt;
|-
|}

AI intransitive verbs can only be used with animate subjects, TI verbs can only be used with inanimate objects, etc.

Because of the polysynthetic nature of verbs, subjects and objects are often not separate words but rather affixes attached to the verbs; therefore, one word "sentences" are possible and even common.

=== Person hierarchy ===

Malecite-Passamaquoddy, along with other Algonquian languages, is also a [[direct–inverse language]], which means the subjects and objects of transitive verbs are marked differently in different contexts according to where they fall relative to each other on a "person hierarchy". The person hierarchy lays out which word is considered more salient or takes precedence over another form. Leavitt's grammar gives the following hierarchy:

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
|+ Person hierarchy
|- 
! 1
| Second person and first plural inclusive (''kil'', ''kiluwaw'', ''kilun'')
|- 
! 2
| First person, not including "you" (''nil'',''nilun'')
|- 
! 3
| Third person (''nekom'', ''nekomaw'')
|-
! 4
| Obviate forms
|-
! 5
| Inanimate nouns
|}

The hierarchy comes into play in sentences with transitive-animate (TA) verbs. When the subject of a TA verb is higher on the person hierarchy than the object, the verb is conjugated in the direct form. If the subject is lower on the hierarchy than the object, the verb is conjugated in the inverse form. The direct form is considered [[Markedness|unmarked]], and the inverse is shown by theme markers. Because of the direct–inverse system, Malecite-Passamaquoddy does not have a clear way of otherwise showing [[voice (grammar)|active–passive]] distinction on verbs.

Another case for which the hierarchy is relevant is in [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]] verb forms. For them, the action is considered "self-contained" because they occur on the same level of the hierarchy. Thus, reflexive and reciprocal verbs are no longer transitive but become intransitive, with only one argument being shown and a reflexive or reciprocal theme marker used.

Some first- and second-person pronouns overlap in meaning; for example ''kilun'' "we (inclusive)" includes within its meaning ''nil'' "I". Overlapping pairs of this sort cannot be used as the subject-object pair of a transitive verb. Leavitt gives the following chart outlining the restrictions on how first- and second-person subject-object pairs can occur for transitive verbs:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! 
! '''''nil'''''
! '''''kil'''''
! '''''nilun'''''
! '''''kilun'''''
! '''''kiluwaw'''''
|-
! '''''nil'''''
| '''R'''
| 
| '''--'''
| '''--'''
|
|-
! '''''kil'''''
| 
| '''R'''
|
| '''--'''
| '''--'''
|-
! '''''nilun'''''
| '''--'''
| 
| '''R'''
| '''--'''
|
|-
! '''''kilun'''''
| '''--'''
| '''--'''
| '''--'''
| '''R'''
| '''--'''
|-
! '''''kiluwaw'''''
| 
| '''--'''
|
| '''--'''
| '''R'''
|-
|}
('''R''' means that a form will be reflexive or reciprocal and intransitive; '''--''' means a combination is not allowed.)

===Building sentences===
Because so much grammatical information is encoded in each word, word order is very free, and there are few restrictions on the order words can appear, especially in simple one-verb sentences. One of the only restrictions is that the negative particle must precede the verb, but other words may intervene.&lt;ref name="Leavitt"/&gt;

There is no word for the verb "to be" in the language so identity sentences with no verb are possible. The word order is less free than in sentences with verbs and is fixed in negative identities.

Complex and compound sentences with two or more verbs can be created in multiple ways, such as these:
* the use of conjunctions
* a main clause plus an embedded clause in the changed conjunct mode
* a main clause plus a conditional clause in the changed or umchanged conjunct mode
* sequential commands, with the first verb in the Imperative mode and the second in the subordinative mode

==Status and revitalization==

Today Malecite-Passamaquoddy has a ranking of 7 on the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS);  a 7 corresponds to "Shifting: The child-bearing generation can use the language among themselves, but it is not being transmitted to children."&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|pqm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of this bleak assessment, there are significant efforts to revitalize the language and teach both children and adults who did not learn the language natively.

Since 2006, a project known as [http://www.languagekeepers.org Language Keepers], which attempts to document endangered languages and increase public group discourse carried out in these languages, has worked with the Passamaquoddy and Maliseet communities and done extensive documentation of the language. In their first three years of work, they filmed over 50 hours of natural group conversation with 70 speakers, which led to the production of eight DVDs in Malecite-Passamaquoddy subtitled in English.&lt;ref name="pmportal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pmportal.org |title=Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language Portal|date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language Portal, this film "stimulated language revival programs for people who understand but cannot speak, and identified new sources of resiliency and leadership in the language-speaking community."&lt;ref name="pmportal"/&gt; Their approach to documentation is fairly novel and has garnered praise: "In contrast to 'elicitation,' in which linguists ask speakers questions to learn about a language, Language Keepers videos show how the language works in practice, and have provided many "new" words for the dictionary. They also document traditional Passamaquoddy culture—activities, like canoe-building, and views of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/reviving-passamaquoddy-community-finds-healing-through-its-own-language|title=Reviving Passamaquoddy: A Community Finds Healing Through Its Own Language|date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the film, the Language Keepers project—along with other linguists and community activists—has helped compile the [http://pmportal.org/browse-dictionary Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Dictionary], which was started in the 1970s by linguists Philip LeSourd and today includes over 18,000 entries, many of which include audio and video files of native speaker pronunciations.

Along with the various resources available online, recent revitalization efforts have included Malecite-Passamaquoddy classes being taught at the University of New Brunswick, with efforts to increase inter-generational communication and transmission of knowledge and culture.

{{short description|British media studies researcher}}
'''Martin Barker''' is a British author and researcher specialising in the study of media audiences. He co-founded ''Participations: Journal of Audience &amp; Reception Studies'' in 2003 and serves as editor. He is now an [[Emeritus|Emeritus Professor]] at [[Aberystwyth University]], Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/tfts/staff-profiles/listing/profile/mib/ |title=Martin Barker, Aberystwyth University| accessdate=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is overseeing an international audience research project on ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/15/how-game-of-thrones-put-tv-drama-to-the-sword |title=How Game of Thrones puts TV drama to the sword| last=Hughes |first=Sarah | work=Guardian | accessdate=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Barker worked for 29 years at the [[University of West England]], becoming Head of the School of Cultural Studies, before spending 2 years as a reader at the [[University of Sussex]]. In January 2001, Barker was appointed as a Professor of [[Film Studies|Film and Television Studies]] at Aberystwyth University, where he is now an Emeritus Professor.

==Research and publications==
Early in his academic career, Barker researched and published work on racism in the UK and children’s comics, including ''[[Action_(comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[2000_AD_(comics)|2000 AD]]''. He coined the term "[[new racism]]" in 1981 in the context of [[racist]] [[public discourse]] about [[immigration]] to the UK during the reign of [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2111369|title = The New Racism|last = Pettigrew|first = |date = 1991|journal = American Journal of Political Science|doi = 10.2307/2111369|pmid = |volume=35|pages=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Barker became an outspoken critic of the [[video nasties]] censorship campaign in the UK, which was led by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and public pressure group the [[National Viewers' and Listeners' Association]], spearheaded by [[Mary Whitehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O' Connor |first=Maureen |date=1984-03-06 |title=Nasty Controversy |work=The Guardian |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later book, ''Ill Effects: The Media Violence Debate'', co-edited with Julian Petley, dismantled theories of [[Influence_of_mass_media|“media effects”]] and “copycat violence” inspired by violent media which were reported often as “common sense” in the British press.

Later in his career, Barker focused much more on studies of media audiences, drawing upon his background in [[cultural studies]]. His co-authored study of audiences of the [[Sylvester Stallone]] film, ''[[Judge_Dredd_(film)|Judge Dredd]]'', was influential in the field of audience studies. In response to the censorship campaign against [[David Cronenberg]]’s ''[[Crash_(1996_film)|Crash]]'', again by the [[Daily Mail]], Barker, along with Jane Arthurs and Ramiswami Harindranath, oversaw and authored a study on the film’s reception in the press and conducted an audience study. This was published as ''The Crash Controversy: Censorship Campaigns and Film Reception'' by Wallflower Press in 2001. Over the course of these and other audience studies, Barker developed a methodology for studying audiences which to date remains very influential in the field. 

At [[Aberystwyth University]], Barker was commissioned by British film censors, the [[BBFC]], to produce research on audiences and issues around watching sexual violence on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/26/ohthehorror | last=Jancovich |first=Mark |date=2007-11-26 |title=Oh the horror |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/Audiences%20and%20Receptions%20of%20Sexual%20Violence%20in%20Contemporary%20Cinema_0.pdf|title=Audiences and Receptions of Sexual Violence in Contemporary Cinema | accessdate=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has recently been an outspoken critic of recent research used by the [[BBFC]] to justify implementing tighter censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://doi.org/10.3366/jbctv.2016.0299 | last=Barker | first=Martin | work=Journal of British Cinema and Television | title=Knowledge-U-Like: The British Board of Film Classification and its Research | accessdate=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker served as director on an [[Economic_and_Social_Research_Council|ESRC]]-funded international audience research project on ''[[The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/20/jrrtolkien.research |title=Worldwide quest for the magic of Middle Earth| last=Wainwright |first=Martin | work=Guardian | accessdate=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in ''Watching Lord of the Rings: Tolkien's World Audiences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144570911|title=Watching the Lord of the rings : Tolkien's world audiences|last=Barker|first=Martin|last2=Mathijs|first2=Ernest|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|others=|year=|isbn=9780820463964|location=New York|pages=|oclc=144570911}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up project was overseen by Barker, studying audience responses to ''[[The_Hobbit_(film_series)|The Hobbit]]'', which involved 145 researchers in 46 countries. It received 36, 109 responses and is the largest audience study ever conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2015/02/17/97029-world-hobbit-project-survey-hits-30000-responses/ |title=World Hobbit Project survey hits 30,000 responses| work=TheOneRing.net|  date=2015-02-17

'''Myazedi inscription''' ({{lang-my|မြစေတီ ကျောက်စာ}} {{IPA-my|mja̰ zèdì tɕaʊʔ sà|}}; also '''Yazakumar Inscription''' or the '''Gubyaukgyi Inscription'''), inscribed in 1113, is the oldest surviving stone inscription of the [[Burmese language|Burmese]]. "Myazedi" means "emerald stupa" ("zedi" being akin to the Pali "[[cetiya]]" and Thai "[[stupa|chedi]]"), and the name of the inscription comes from a pagoda located nearby. The inscriptions were made in four languages: Burmese, [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], [[Mon language|Mon]], and [[Pali language|Pali]],&lt;ref name=Coedes&gt;{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}} which all tell the story of Prince [[Yazakumar]] and King [[Kyansittha]]. The primary importance of the Myazedi inscription is that the inscriptions allowed for the deciphering of the written Pyu language.

There are two main inscriptions in Burma today. One exists on the platform of the Myazedi Pagoda, in the village of Myinkaba (south of [[Bagan]]), in [[Mandalay Division]]. The other was discovered by German Pali scholar Dr. [[Emil Forchammar]] in 1886-1887, and is currently in display at the Bagan Archaeological Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2760">In [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]], a theory of [[linguistic]] meaning, '''null instantiation''' is the name of a category used to [[Annotation#Linguistics|annotate]], or [[Tag (metadata)|tag]], absent [[semantic constituent]]s or [[frame element]]s ([[Charles J. Fillmore|Fillmore]] et al. 2003, Section 3.4).  Frame semantics, best exemplified by the [[FrameNet]] project, views words as evoking frames of knowledge and frames as typically involving multiple components, called frame elements (e.g. buyer and goods in an acquisition). The term '''null''' refers to the fact that the frame element in question is absent.  The logical object of the term '''instantiation''' refers to the frame element itself.  So, '''null instantiation''' is an empty instantiation of a frame element. Ruppenhofer and Michaelis&lt;ref&gt;Ruppenhofer and Michaelis 2014&lt;/ref&gt; postulate an implicational regularity tying the interpretation type of an omitted argument to the frame membership of its predicator: "If a particular frame element role is lexically omissible under a particular interpretation (either anaphoric or existential) for one LU [lexical unit] in a frame, then for any other LUs in the same frame that allow the omission of this same FE [frame element], the interpretation of the missing FE is the same." (Ruppenhofer and Michaelis 2014: 66)

==Definite null instantiation==
Definite null instantiation is the absence of a frame element that is recoverable from the context.  It is similar to a [[Zero anaphor|zero]] [[anaphor]].

==Indefinite null instantiation==
Indefinite null instantiation is the absence of the object of a potentially [[transitive verb]] such as ''eat'' or ''drink.''

==Constructional null instantiation==
Constructional null instantiation is the absence of a frame element due to a syntactic construction, e.g. the optional omission of agents in passive sentences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11402">[[File:IMA Objects conservator 2.jpg|thumb|Objects conservator Laura Kubick examines an artwork at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].]]
An '''Objects conservator''' is a professional, working in a [[museum]] setting or private practice, that specializes in the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of three-dimensional works.  They undergo specialized education, training, and experience that allows them to formulate and implement preventative strategies and invasive treatment protocols to preserve cultural property for the future.&lt;ref name="AIC Definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of Conservation Terminology|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/definitions#.Uwy7NvldV8E/|work=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objects conservators typically specialize in one type of material or class of cultural property, including metals, [[archaeological artifacts]], [[ethnographic]] artifacts, glass, and [[ceramic art]].  Objects conservation presents many challenges due to their three-dimensional form and composite nature.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The diverse nature of artifacts that fall into the category of three dimensional objects presents a unique challenge to compiling a set of common procedures.  However, preventative measures and treatment methodologies involve similar considerations that need to be addressed, regardless of the object's composition.  In the words of Cesare Brandi, "Restoration must aim to reestablish the potential unity of the work of art, as long as this is possible without producing an artistic or historical forgery and without erasing every trace of the passage of time left on the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage|date=1996|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-892363-98-8|editor=Price, N. |editor2=Talley Jr. M. K. |editor3=Vaccaro, A. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  This means that an Objects Conservator needs to know when to draw the line, and communicate that limit to the object's custodian.

===Preventative Measures===
[[File:IMA Objects conservator 3.jpg|thumb|left|Mallory Marty prepares an object to be moved  at the Indianapolis Museum of Art to prevent damage while in transit.]]
While not as glamorous or hands-on as the other steps in this process, collections care, or [[Preventive conservation|preventative conservation]], is arguably the most important.  To truly preserve cultural heritage for the future, it is imperative to minimize deterioration by developing and implementing procedures to minimize the amount of physical and chemical stress an object encounters.  This includes its environmental conditions (relative humidity, temperature, exposure to light), [[integrated pest management]] protocols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Pest MAnagement|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management|work=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; use of specialized storage containers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Housing a Collection of Artifacts Representing American Cultural Traditions|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/conservators/legacies/3D.html|work=Library of Congress|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategies for packing and shipping, exhibition conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental and Display Guidelines for Paintings and Polychrome Sculptures|url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/publications/notes/10-4-eng.aspx|work=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Emergency response (museum)|emergency preparedness plan]].  The initial expense of such measures often causes institutions and private collectors to balk, but in comparison to the expense of the invasive treatments that will be needed if one does not take such preventative measures, the benefit outweighs the initial investment.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|edition=5|editor=Buck, R. |editor2=Gilmore, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preventative conservation is also something that a private collector can implement for their own pieces.  Controlling the amount of light an object is exposed to, the source of illumination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Lighting Research Lighting Case Studies|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/lighting/case.html|work=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ambient temperature of its environment, and protecting it from rapid changes in relative humidity goes a long way towards ensuring that an object will be around to pass down to future generations.

===Treatment Protocol===

While each object is unique, conservators begin with a similar process regardless of the artifact being assessed.   A Conservator may need to stabilize an object at any stage in the process to prevent further loss, or, in extreme cases, begin by stabilizing an object before further examination can occur.  Documentation takes place during every step of treatment, including: original condition, sample sites (if taken), different types of damage, areas of significant weakness before and after stabilization, and potential infestation sites.  It is also important to document the objects condition before and after moving it, especially in the case of off-site transport.  The ultimate goal of treatment is to preserve both the physical object and its interpretation, or cultural context.&lt;ref name="Barbara Appelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=San Bernardino, CA|isbn=978-1-453682-11-1|author=Barbara Appelbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examination====
The first step of any treatment protocol is a thorough examination of the object.  This includes both its physical components and its cultural importance.  Physical components include the materials used, its construction, and the appearance of the object's surface.  The conservator often employs different techniques for this portion of the examination, including photographs taken in different light conditions such as visible, raking, and Ultraviolet to examine the surface, and x-rays to reveal the structure within.  Cultural significance is more challenging to determine, including the object's meaning, function, intended use, and importance to society.

Thorough examination and research allows the Conservator to reconstruct an object's history and, together with the object's custodian (the owner, a [[curator]], [[Registrar (museum)|registrar]], or [[collection manager]]) determine the object's ideal state and determine a realistic treatment goal.&lt;ref name="Barbara Appelbaum"/&gt;
[[File:IMA Objects conservator 1.jpg|thumb|Laura Kubick treats an object at the Indianapolis Museum of Art]]

====Treatment====
Following examination the Conservator will prepare a pre-treatment report that discusses the treatment goal for the object and the planned course of action.  As defined by AIC, treatment is "The deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence.&lt;ref name="AIC Definitions"/&gt;" This can be something as minimal as reinforcing flaking paint, or something as complex as the migration of metals and salts through a wooden statue, leading to loss of strength, shrinkage, separation between the wooden support, metal fastenings, and decorative outer surface.

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
Objects Conservators must be an expert collaborator, working with members of the public and museum professionals alike. Conservation is not a vacuum and practitioners collaborate with colleagues around the world, lending expertise and receiving guidance.  They need to advocate for the object, explain their treatment protocol, the importance of preventative measures, and stand firm when asked to reconsider a "no". They must also be open to alternate interpretations, have an understanding of different materials and construction techniques,keen observation skills, and deft hands.

==Education &amp; training==

Most museums and prestigious private firms require graduate degrees in Conservation.  Without graduate level education, knowledge of chemistry, hands-on experience, and a thorough foundation in documentation, evaluation, and treatment an institution or firm is taking a serious risk.  Anyone can call themselves a conservator, but it is the specialized training gained through graduate programs or similar experiences that count.

Gaining admission to a conservation graduate program includes an undergraduate degree, a concentration in chemistry (specifically organic chemistry), and a significant number of hours working under a trained Conservator.  This ensures that the candidate has a through foundation upon which to build and is already familiar with many aspects of the process.

These programs include [http://www.artcons.udel.edu/masters University of Delaware], [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/conservation/ NYU], [http://artconservation.buffalostate.edu/ Buffalo State University], [https://web.archive.org/web/20140415152849/http://www.queensu.ca/art/artconservation.html Queens University], [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/studying/masters/degrees/msc_conservation University College London], [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/share/degreeprogrammes/archaeology/postgraduate/conservationpracticemsc/index.html Cardiff University]

The evolutionary emergence of language in the [[human|human species]] has been a subject of speculation for several centuries. The topic is difficult to study because of the lack of direct evidence. Consequently, scholars wishing to study the origins of language must draw inferences from other kinds of evidence such as the [[human evolution|fossil record]], archaeological evidence, contemporary language diversity, studies of [[language acquisition]], and comparisons between human [[language]] and systems of communication existing [[Animal communication|among animals]] (particularly [[Great ape language|other primates]]). Many argue that the origins of language probably relate closely to the origins of [[behavioral modernity|modern human behavior]], but there is little agreement about the implications and directionality of this connection.

This shortage of [[empirical evidence]] has led many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study. In 1866, the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the western world until late in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Stam, J. H. 1976. Inquiries into the origins of language. New York: [[Harper and Row]], p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are various hypotheses about how, why, when, and where language might have emerged.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2012"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Tallerman | first1 = Maggie | last2 = Gibson | first2 = Kathleen Rita. | title = The Oxford handbook of language evolution | year = 2012 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford  ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-954111-9 | oclc = 724665645 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, there is scarcely more agreement today than a hundred years ago, when [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] by [[natural selection]] provoked a rash of armchair speculation on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, F. M. 1996 [1861]. The theoretical stage, and the origin of language. Lecture 9 from Lectures on the Science of Language. Reprinted in R. Harris (ed.), The Origin of Language. Bristol: [[Thoemmes Press]], pp. 7–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1990s, however, a number of [[linguist]]s, [[archaeologist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, and others have attempted to address with new methods what some consider one of the hardest problems in science.&lt;!--Unbalanced opinion to call it the hardest problem in science.

==Approaches==
One can sub-divide approaches to the origin of language according to some underlying assumptions:&lt;ref name="Ulbæk 1998"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Ulbæk | first1 = Ib | title = The origin of language and cognition|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | pages = 30–43 | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Continuity theories" built on the idea that language exhibits so much complexity that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form; therefore it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our primate ancestors. 
* "Discontinuity theories" take the opposite approach—that language, as a unique trait which cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans, must have appeared fairly suddenly during the course of [[human evolution]]. 
* Some theories see language mostly as an [[innate]] faculty—largely genetically encoded.
* Other theories regard language as a mainly [[cultural]] system—learned through social interaction.

[[Noam Chomsky]], a prominent proponent of discontinuity theory, argues that a single chance mutation occurred in one individual in the order of 100,000 years ago, installing the language faculty (a component of the mid-brain) in "perfect" or "near-perfect" form.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N, 1996. ''Powers and Prospects. Reflections on human nature and the social order.'' London: Pluto Press, p 30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A majority of linguistic scholars {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} hold continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they envision language development. Among those who see language as mostly innate, some—notably [[Steven Pinker]]&lt;ref name="Pinker 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinker | first1 = S. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P. | year = 1990 | title = Natural language and natural selection | url = http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/99/index.html | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 707–784 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00081061 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051123085422/http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/04/99/index.html | archivedate = 2005-11-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;—avoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved in the usual gradual way.&lt;ref name="Pinker 1994"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Others in this intellectual camp—notably Ib Ulbæk&lt;ref name="Ulbæk 1998"/&gt;—hold that language evolved not from primate communication but from primate cognition, which is significantly more complex.

Those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as [[Michael Tomasello]], see it developing from the cognitively controlled aspects of primate communication, these being mostly gestural as opposed to vocal.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 1996"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Tomasello | first1 = Michael | title = The cultural roots of language| editors = B M Velichkovskiĭ; Duane M Rumbaugh; Universität Bielefeld.

A very specific social structure—one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust—must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on "cheap signals" (words) an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]].

Because the [[emergence]] of language lies so far back in [[human prehistory]], the relevant developments have left no direct historical traces; neither can comparable processes be observed today. Despite this, the emergence of new sign languages in modern times—[[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], for example—may potentially offer insights into the developmental stages and creative processes necessarily involved.&lt;ref&gt;Kegl, J., A.

The time range for the evolution of language and/or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of ''[[Homo]]'' (2.3 to 2.4 million years ago) from ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' (5 to 6 million years ago) to the emergence of full [[behavioral modernity]] some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that ''[[Australopithecus]]'' probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of [[great ape]]s in general,&lt;ref name="Arcadi 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arcadi | first1 = AC. | title = Vocal responsiveness in male wild chimpanzees: implications for the evolution of language. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–23 |date=Aug 2000 | doi = 10.1006/jhev.2000.0415 | pmid = 10968929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (''[[proto-language]]'') as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'', while others place the development of [[symbolic communication]] only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or with ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with ''[[Homo sapiens]],'' currently estimated at less than 200,000 years ago.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages, [[Johanna Nichols]]—a linguist at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]—argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in our species at least 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Nichols, 1998. The origin and dispersal of languages: Linguistic evidence. In Nina Jablonski and Leslie C. Aiello, eds., ''The Origin and Diversification of Language,''  pp. 127–70. (Memoirs of the California Academy of Sciences, 24.) San Francisco: California Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; A further study by Q. D. Atkinson&lt;ref name="Atkinson 2011"/&gt; suggests that successive population bottlenecks occurred as our African ancestors migrated to other areas, leading to a decrease in genetic and phenotypic diversity. Atkinson argues that these bottlenecks also affected culture and language, suggesting that the further away a particular language is from Africa, the fewer [[phonemes]] it contains. By way of evidence, Atkinson claims that today's African languages tend to have relatively large numbers of phonemes, whereas languages from areas in [[Oceania]] (the last place to which humans migrated), have relatively few.  Relying heavily on Atkinson's work, a subsequent study has explored the rate at which phonemes develop naturally, comparing this rate to some of Africa's oldest languages. The results suggest that language first evolved around 50,000–150,000 years ago, which is around the time when modern ''Homo sapiens'' evolved.&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Perreault | first1 = C. | last2 = Mathew | first2 = S. | title = Dating the origin of language using phonemic diversity | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35289 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035289 | pmid = 22558135 | pmc = 3338724| bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735289P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of this kind are not universally accepted, but jointly considering genetic, archaeological, palaeontological and much other evidence indicates that language probably emerged somewhere in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] during the [[Middle Stone Age]], roughly contemporaneous with the speciation of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Botha 2009"&gt;

* '''Bow-wow'''. The ''bow-wow'' or ''cuckoo'' theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds.
* '''Pooh-pooh'''. The ''pooh-pooh'' theory saw the [[Interjectional theory|first words as emotional interjections and exclamations]] triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise, etc.
* '''Ding-dong'''. Müller suggested what he called the ''ding-dong'' theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words.
* '''Yo-he-ho'''. The ''yo-he-ho'' theory claims language emerged from collective rhythmic labor, the attempt to synchronize muscular effort resulting in sounds such as ''heave'' alternating with sounds such as ''ho.''

===Problems of reliability and deception===
{{further|Signalling theory}}

From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one. Rather, it is the fact that symbols—arbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings—are unreliable and may well be false.&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1993"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zahavi | first1 = A. | title = The fallacy of conventional signalling. | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 340 | issue = 1292 | pages = 227–230 |date=May 1993 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1993.0061 | pmid = 8101657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the saying goes, "words are cheap".&lt;ref name="Smith 1994"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Smith| first1=J.Maynard|title=Must reliable signals always be costly?|journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=47|issue=5|year=1994|pages=1115–1120|issn=0003-3472|doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionary theorists.

Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. We trust the signal, not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just cannot fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason—because they are hard to fake.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodall | first1 = Jane | title = The chimpanzees of Gombe : patterns of behavior | year = 1986 | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-11649-8 | oclc = 12550961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primate social intelligence is "[[Machiavellian]]"—self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples.

Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt;

Words are easy to fake. Should they turn out to be lies, listeners will adapt by ignoring them in favor of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must be confident that those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest.&lt;ref name="Power 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Power| first1 =  Camilla|title = Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peculiar feature of language is "[[displacement (linguistics)|displaced reference]]", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate "here" and "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. This stability is born of a longstanding mutual trust and is what grants language its authority. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see [[signalling theory]]).

====The 'mother tongues' hypothesis====
The "mother tongues" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Fitch| first1 = W. T.| chapter = Kin selection and "mother tongues": a neglected component in language evolution | editors =  Ulrike Griebel; D Kimbrough Oller | title = Evolution of communication systems : a comparative approach | year = 2004 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-262-15111-5 |oclc = 845673575| pages = 275–296 |url= http://homepage.univie.ac.at/tecumseh.fitch/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/FitchKin2004_large.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]] suggested that the Darwinian principle of '[[kin selection]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I, II | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 1–52 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 | pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the convergence of genetic interests between relatives—might be part of the answer. Fitch suggests that languages were originally 'mother tongues'. If language evolved initially for communication between mothers and their own biological offspring, extending later to include adult relatives as well, the interests of speakers and listeners would have tended to coincide. Fitch argues that shared genetic interests would have led to sufficient trust and cooperation for intrinsically unreliable signals—words—to become accepted as trustworthy and so begin evolving for the first time.

Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2013"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Tallerman | first1 = Maggie| title = Kin selection, pedagogy and linguistic complexity: whence protolanguage? | editors =  Rudolf P Botha, Martin Everaert| work = The evolutionary emergence of language : evidence and inference | year = 2013 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = Oxford, UK | isbn = 978-0-19-965485-7 | oclc = 856795812| pages = 77–96  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other primate mothers also share genes with their progeny, as do all other animals, so why is it only humans who speak? Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that early humans restricted linguistic communication to genetic kin: the incest taboo must have forced men and women to interact and communicate with more distant relatives. So even if we accept Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited 'mother tongue' networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained.&lt;ref name="Tallerman 2013"/&gt;  Fitch argues, however, that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal [[encephalization|growth of the human brain]] give the human-infant relationship a different and more extended period of intergenerational dependency than that found in any other species.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2004"/&gt;

====The 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' hypothesis====
Ib Ulbæk&lt;ref name="Ulbæk 1998"/&gt; invokes another standard Darwinian principle—'[[reciprocal altruism]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | year = 1971 | title = The evolution of reciprocal altruism | url = | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 35–57 | doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve. 'Reciprocal altruism' can be expressed as the principle that ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours''. In linguistic terms, it would mean that ''if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you''. Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals. For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation.

Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom 'obligatory reciprocal altruism' could possibly have been enforced.&lt;ref name="Knight 2006"/&gt; Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect.&lt;ref name="Knight 2006"/&gt; A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to [[Signalling theory|advertise to the world]] their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting that information without expectation of reciprocity to anyone who will listen.&lt;ref name="Dessalles 1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 =  Dessalles| first1 =  Jean L. |title = Altruism, status and the origin of relevance|editors = James R Hurford; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; Chris Knight| work = Approaches to the evolution of language : social and cognitive base | year = 1998 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-63964-4 | oclc = 37742390 | pages = 130–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The gossip and grooming hypothesis====

Gossip, according to [[Robin Dunbar]] in his book ''[[Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language]]'', does for group-living humans what [[social grooming|manual grooming]] does for other primates—it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances on the basis of the principle: ''if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours''. Dunbar argues that as humans began living in increasingly larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dunbar | first = R. I. M. | title = Grooming, gossip and the evolution of language | publisher = Faber and Faber | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780571173969 |oclc = 34546743}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this problem, humans developed 'a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming'—''vocal grooming''. To keep allies happy, one now needs only to 'groom' them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks. Vocal grooming then evolved gradually into vocal language—initially in the form of 'gossip'.&lt;ref name="Dunbar 1996"/&gt; Dunbar's hypothesis seems to be supported by the fact that the structure of language shows adaptations to the function of narration in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=von Heiseler, Till Nikolaus|year=2014|contribution=Language evolved for storytelling in a super-fast evolution|editor=R.

Critics of this theory point out that the very efficiency of 'vocal grooming'—the fact that words are so cheap—would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Power, C.|year=1998|contribution=Old wives' tales: the gossip hypothesis and the reliability of cheap signals|editor=J. R. Hurford|editor2=M. Studdert Kennedy|editor3=C. Knight|title=Approaches to the Evolution of Language: Social and Cognitive Bases|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pp=111 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming—the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds—to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech.

====Ritual/speech coevolution====
The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by social anthropologist [[Roy Rappaport]]&lt;ref name="Rappaport 1999"/&gt; before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight,&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt; Jerome Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis 2009"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Lewis| first1 = Jerome| title = As Well as Words: Congo Pygmy Hunting, Mimicry, and Play,| editors = Rudolf P Botha; Chris Knight| work = The cradle of language | year = 2009 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford ; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5| oclc = 804498749| pages = 236–256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Enfield,&lt;ref name="Enfield 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enfield | first1 = N.

Norton | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-393-03838-5 | oclc = 807018262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a 'theory of the origins of language'. This is because language is not a separate adaptation but an internal aspect of something much wider—namely, human [[symbolic culture]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Knight 2010"/&gt; Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have spectacularly failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Can we imagine a historian attempting to explain the emergence of credit cards independently of the wider system of which they are a part? Using a credit card makes sense only if you have a bank account institutionally recognized within a certain kind of advanced capitalist society—one where electronic communications technology and digital computers have already been invented and fraud can be detected and prevented. In much the same way, language would not work outside a specific array of social mechanisms and institutions. For example, it would not work for a nonhuman ape communicating with others in the wild. Not even the cleverest nonhuman ape could make language work under such conditions.

{{quotation|Lie and alternative, inherent in language ... pose problems to any society whose structure is founded on language, which is to say all human societies.

As digital hallucinations{{Clarification needed|date=May 2018}}, they are intrinsically unreliable. Should an especially clever nonhuman ape, or even a group of articulate nonhuman apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalizations that do carry conviction—those they actually use—are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake.

Language consists of digital contrasts whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world — they are a theoretical impossibility.&lt;ref name="Zahavi 1993"/&gt; Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if you can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society—namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called 'institutional facts') can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J. R. 1996. ''The Construction of Social Reality''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; In any hunter-gatherer society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ''ritual''.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. 1947 [1915]. "Origins of these beliefs". Chapter VII. In É. Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life: A study in religious sociology''. Trans. J. W. Swain. Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, pp. 205–239.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human symbolic culture as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component.

Critics of the theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the 'non-existence' hypothesis—a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15475441.2011.584041 |title=Language and Other Cognitive Systems.

===Tool culture resilience and grammar in early Homo===

While it is possible to imitate the making of tools like those made by early Homo under circumstances of demonstration, research on primate tool cultures show that non-verbal cultures are vulnerable to environmental change. In particular, if the environment in which a skill can be used disappears for a longer period of time than an individual ape's or early human's lifespan, the skill will be lost if the culture is imitative and non-verbal. Chimpanzees, macaques and capuchin monkeys are all known to lose tool techniques under such circumstances. Researchers on primate culture vulnerability therefore argue that since early Homo species as far back as Homo habilis retained their tool cultures despite many climate change cycles at the timescales of centuries to millennia each, these species had sufficiently developed language abilities to verbally describe complete procedures, and therefore grammar and not only two-word "proto-language".&lt;ref&gt;The multiple roles of cultural transmission experiments in understanding human cultural evolution, Alex Mesoudi, Andrew Whiten&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chimpanzee Material Culture: Implications for Human Evolution, William Clement McGrew&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that early Homo species had sufficiently developed brains for grammar is also supported by researchers who study brain development in children, noting that grammar is developed while connections across the brain are still significantly lower than adult level. These researchers argue that these lowered system requirements for grammatical language make it plausible that the genus Homo had grammar at connection levels in the brain that were significantly lower than those of Homo sapiens and that more recent steps in the evolution of the human brain were not about language.&lt;ref&gt;New Frontiers in Language Evolution and Development: Introduction to the topics Volume, D. Kimbrough Oller, Rick Dale, Ulrike Griebel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birdsong, speech, and language: exploring the evolution of mind and brain, JJ Bolhuis, M Everaert&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structuralist theory===

[[Structural linguistics]] is an approach to the study of language founded by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and popularised through his posthumously published book ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' (1916).

According to [[Structural anthropology|structural anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], language and meaning—in opposition to "knowledge, which develops slowly and progressively"—must have appeared in an instant:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever may have been the moment and the circumstances of its appearance in the ascent of animal life, language can only have arisen all at once. Things cannot have begun to signify gradually. In the wake of a transformation which is not a subject of study for the social sciences, but for biology and psychology, a shift occurred from a stage when nothing had a meaning to another stage when everything had meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lévi-Strauss |first1=Claude |title=Introduction to the work of Marcel Mauss |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |isbn=0-7100-9066-8 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lévi-Strauss's hypothesis is a necessary consequence of Saussure's view of language as a formal system of differential elements: if a signifier only acquires meaning through its difference from other signifiers, then a hypothetical "first signifier" always already implies another signifier ("everything else" or "the rest of the universe") from which the first signifier is different. Thus, language, according to [[structuralism]], must have appeared all at once and not gradually since a semi-language is impossible.

===Chomsky's single step theory===

According to Chomsky's single mutation theory, the emergence of language resembled the formation of a crystal; with [[digital infinity]] as the [[seed crystal]] in a super-saturated primate brain, on the verge of blossoming into the human mind, by physical law, once [[Universal Darwinism|evolution]] added a single small but crucial keystone.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (2004). ''Language and Mind: Current thoughts on ancient problems.'' Part I &amp; Part II. In Lyle Jenkins (ed.), ''Variation and Universals in Biolinguistics.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 379–405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Three factors in language design"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chomsky | first1 = N. | year = 2005 | title = Three factors in language design | url = | journal = Linguistic Inquiry | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1162/0024389052993655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst some suggest it follows from this theory that language appeared rather suddenly within the history of human evolution, Chomsky, writing with computational linguist and computer scientist Robert C. Berwick, suggests it is completely compatible with modern biology. They note "none of the recent accounts of human language evolution seem to have completely grasped the shift from conventional Darwinism to its fully [[stochastic]] modern version—specifically, that there are stochastic effects not only due to sampling like directionless drift, but also due to directed stochastic variation in fitness, migration, and heritability—indeed, all the "forces" that affect individual or gene frequencies. ...  All this can affect evolutionary outcomes—outcomes that as far as we can make out are not brought out in recent books on the evolution of language, yet would arise immediately in the case of any new genetic or individual innovation, precisely the kind of scenario likely to be in play when talking about language's emergence."

Citing evolutionary geneticist [[Svante Pääbo]] they concur that a substantial difference must have occurred to differentiate ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from [[Neanderthal]]s to "prompt the relentless spread of our species who had never crossed open water up and out of Africa and then on across the entire planet in just a few tens of thousands of years. ... What we do not see is any kind of "gradualism" in new tool technologies or innovations like fire, shelters, or figurative art." Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the arrival of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa, and the last exodus from Africa, respectively). "That leaves us with about 130,000 years, or approximately 5,000–6,000 generations of time for evolutionary change. This is not 'overnight in one generation' as some have (incorrectly) inferred—but neither is it on the scale of geological eons. It's time enough—within the ballpark for what Nilsson and Pelger (1994) estimated as the time required for the full evolution of a [[vertebrate]] eye from a single cell, even without the invocation of any 'evo-devo' effects."&lt;ref name="Berwick and Chomsky 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last = Berwick | first = Robert | last2 = Chomsky |first2= Noam | title = Why Only Us: Language and Evolution | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780262034241 | oclc = 934433881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gestural theory===
The gestural theory states that human language developed from [[gesture]]s that were used for simple communication.

Two types of evidence support this theory.
# Gestural language and vocal language depend on similar neural systems. The regions on the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] that are responsible for mouth and hand movements border each other.
# Nonhuman [[primates]] can use gestures or symbols for at least primitive communication, and some of their gestures resemble those of humans, such as the "begging posture", with the hands stretched out, which humans share with chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, David &amp; Premack, Ann James. ''The Mind of an Ape'', {{ISBN|0-393-01581-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found strong support for the idea that [[oral communication|verbal language]] and sign language depend on similar neural structures. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-[[cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] [[lesion]], showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.&lt;ref name="Kimura 1993"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kimura | first1 = Doreen. | title = Neuromotor mechanisms in human communication | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press  | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-505492-7 | oclc = 26396505 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Critical Period for Right Hemisphere Recruitment in American Sign Language Processing |author=Newman, A.

Primate gesture is at least partially genetic: different nonhuman apes will perform gestures characteristic of their species, even if they have never seen another ape perform that gesture. For example, gorillas beat their breasts. This shows that gestures are an intrinsic and important part of primate communication, which supports the idea that language evolved from gesture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arbib MA, Liebal K, Pika S |title=Primate vocalization, gesture, and the evolution of human language |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=1053–63; discussion 1063–76 |date=December 2008  |pmid=19391445 |doi=10.1086/593015|last2=Liebal |last3=Pika }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence suggests that gesture and language are linked. In humans, manually gesturing has an effect on concurrent vocalizations, thus creating certain natural vocal associations of manual efforts. Chimpanzees move their mouths when performing fine motor tasks. These mechanisms may have played an evolutionary role in enabling the development of intentional vocal communication as a supplement to gestural communication. Voice modulation could have been prompted by preexisting manual actions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is also the fact that, from infancy, gestures both supplement and predict speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2004/015) |pmid=15072537 |title=Gesture Development |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=173–86 |year=2004 |last1=Capone |first1=Nina C. |last2=McGregor |first2=Karla K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ozçalişkan S, Goldin-Meadow S |title=Gesture is at the cutting edge of early language development |journal=Cognition |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=B101–13 |date=July 2005  |pmid=15996556 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.01.001|last2=Goldin-Meadow }}&lt;/ref&gt; This addresses the idea that gestures quickly change in humans from a sole means of communication (from a very young age) to a supplemental and predictive behavior that we use despite being able to communicate verbally. This too serves as a parallel to the idea that gestures developed first and language subsequently built upon it.

Two possible scenarios have been proposed for the development of language,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rizzolatti, G. (2008). Giacomo Rizzolatti on the Evolution of Language. Retrieved from http://gocognitive.net/interviews/evolution-language-gestures{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which supports the gestural theory:
# Language developed from the calls of our ancestors.
# Language was derived from gesture.
The first perspective that language evolved from the calls of our ancestors seems logical because both humans and animals make sounds or cries. One evolutionary reason to refute this is that, anatomically, the center that controls calls in monkeys and other animals is located in a completely different part of the brain than in humans. In monkeys, this center is located in the depths of the brain related to emotions. In the human system, it is located in an area unrelated to emotion. Humans can communicate simply to communicate—without emotions. So, anatomically, this scenario does not work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, we resort to the idea that language was derived from gesture (we communicated by gesture first and sound was attached later).

The important question for gestural theories is why there was a shift to vocalization. Various explanations have been proposed: 
# Our ancestors started to use more and more tools, meaning that their hands were occupied and could no longer be used for gesturing.&lt;ref name="Corballis 2002"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 =  Corballis | first1 = Michael C. | editors = Alison Wray| title = The transition to language | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-925066-0 | oclc = 48532303 | pages = 161–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Manual gesturing requires that speakers and listeners be visible to one another. In many situations, they might need to communicate, even without visual contact—for example after nightfall or when foliage obstructs visibility.
# A composite hypothesis holds that early language took the form of part gestural and part vocal [[mimesis]] (imitative 'song-and-dance'), combining modalities because all signals (like those of nonhuman apes and monkeys) still needed to be costly in order to be intrinsically convincing. In that event, each multi-media display would have needed not just to disambiguate an intended meaning but also to inspire confidence in the signal's reliability. The suggestion is that only once community-wide contractual understandings had come into force&lt;ref name="Knight 2007"&gt;{{Cite book  |last1=Knight|first1=Chris| title=Language co-evolved with the rule of law| editors = Angelo Cangelosi; Andrew D M Smith; Kenny Smith | work = The evolution of language : proceedings of the 6th international conference (EVOLANG6), Rome, Italy, 12–15 April 200 | year = 2006 | publisher = World Scientific | location = New Jersey | isbn = 9789812566560 | oclc = 70797781| doi=10.1007/s11299-007-0039-1|url = http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knight-springer-online-fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; could trust in communicative intentions be automatically assumed, at last allowing ''Homo sapiens'' to shift to a more efficient default format. Since vocal distinctive features (sound contrasts) are ideal for this purpose, it was only at this point—when intrinsically persuasive body-language was no longer required to convey each message—that the decisive shift from manual gesture to our current primary reliance on ''spoken'' language occurred.&lt;ref name="Knight 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knight 2000"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Knight | first1 = Chris |  title = Play as precursor of phonology and syntax| editors = Chris Knight; Michael Studdert-Kennedy; James R Hurford|  work = The Evolutionary emergence of language : social function and the origins of linguistic for | year = 2000 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-78157-2 | oclc = 807262339 | pages = 99–1119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A comparable hypothesis states that in 'articulate' language, gesture and vocalisation are intrinsically linked, as language evolved from equally intrinsically linked dance and song.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Whishaw  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |edition=5th |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-0-7167-5300-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also, of course, a great number of [[sign languages]] still in existence, commonly associated with [[deaf]] communities. These sign languages are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. The cognitive functions are similar and the parts of the brain used are similar. The main difference is that the "phonemes" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} (Compare the [[motor theory of speech perception]].)

Critics of gestural theory note that it is difficult to name serious reasons why the initial pitch-based [[vocal]] communication (which is present in primates) would be abandoned in favor of the much less effective non-vocal, gestural communication.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} However, [[Michael Corballis]] has pointed out that it is supposed that primate vocal communication (such as alarm calls) cannot be controlled consciously, unlike hand movement, and thus is not credible as precursor to human language; primate vocalization is rather homologous to and continued in involuntary reflexes (connected with basic human emotions) such as screams or laughter (the fact that these can be faked does not disprove the fact that genuine involuntary responses to fear or surprise exist).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Also, gesture is not generally less effective, and depending on the situation can even be advantageous, for example in a loud environment or where it is important to be silent, such as on a hunt. Other challenges to the "gesture-first" theory have been presented by researchers in [[psycholinguistics]], including [[David McNeill]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Tool-use associated sound in the evolution of language===

Proponents of the motor theory of language evolution have primarily focused on the visual domain and communication through observation of movements. The ''Tool-use sound hypothesis'' suggests that the production and perception of sound also contributed substantially, particularly ''incidental sound of locomotion'' (''ISOL'') and ''tool-use sound'' (''TUS'').&lt;ref name="Larsson, M. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsson | first1 = M | year = 2015 | title = Tool-use-associated sound in the evolution of language | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 993–1005 | doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0885-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human bipedalism resulted in rhythmic and more predictable ''ISOL''. That may have stimulated the evolution of musical abilities, auditory working memory, and abilities to produce complex vocalizations, and to mimic natural sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Larsson | first1 = M | year = 2014 | title = Self-generated sounds of locomotion and ventilation and the evolution of human rhythmic abilities | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 1–14 | doi=10.1007/s10071-013-0678-z| pmc = 3889703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the human brain proficiently extracts information about objects and events from the sounds they produce, ''TUS'', and mimicry of ''TUS'', might have achieved an iconic function. The prevalence of sound symbolism in many extant languages supports this idea. Self-produced TUS activates multimodal brain processing ([[motor neuron]]s, hearing, [[proprioception]], touch, vision), and ''TUS'' stimulates primate audiovisual mirror neurons, which is likely to stimulate the development of association chains. Tool use and auditory gestures involve motor-processing of the forelimbs, which is associated with the evolution of vertebrate vocal communication. The production, perception, and mimicry of ''TUS'' may have resulted in a limited number of vocalizations or protowords that were associated with tool use.&lt;ref name="Larsson, M. 2015"/&gt; A new way to communicate about tools, especially when out of sight, would have had selective advantage. A gradual change in acoustic properties and/or meaning could have resulted in arbitrariness and an expanded repertoire of words. Humans have been increasingly exposed to ''TUS'' over millions of years, coinciding with the period during which spoken language evolved.

===Mirror neurons and language origins===

In humans, [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey [[mirror neuron]] system in the [[frontal lobe|inferior frontal cortex]], close to [[Broca's area]], one of the language regions of the brain. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles, John R.]], ''Gesture, Language Origins, and Right Handedness'', Psycholoqy: 11,#24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is supported by some [[Cytoarchitectonics|cytoarchitectonic]] homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area.&lt;ref name="Petrides 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Petrides | first1 = M. | last2 = Cadoret | first2 = G. | last3 = Mackey | first3 = S. | title = Orofacial somatomotor responses in the macaque monkey homologue of Broca's area | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7046 | pages = 1235–8 |date=Jun 2005 | doi = 10.1038/nature03628 | pmid = 15988526 | bibcode = 2005Natur.435.1235P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of [[vocabulary]] expansion link to the ability of [[children]] to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations.

Analysis of the data using [[Granger Causality]] revealed that the mirror-neuron system of the observer indeed reflects the pattern of activity of in the motor system of the sender, supporting the idea that the motor concept associated with the words is indeed transmitted from one brain to another using the mirror system.&lt;ref name=Schippers&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1001791107 |last=Schippers |first=MB |last2=Roebroeck |first2=A |last3=Renken |first3=R |last4=Nanetti |first4=L |last5=Keysers |first5=C |title=Mapping the Information flow from one brain to another during gestural communication |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |year=2010 |volume=107 |issue=20 |pages=9388–93 |pmid=20439736 |pmc=2889063 |bibcode=2010PNAS..107.9388S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all linguists agree with the above arguments, however.

===Putting the baby down theory===
According to [[Dean Falk]]'s 'putting the baby down' theory, vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and infants sparked a sequence of events that led, eventually, to our ancestors' earliest words.&lt;ref name="Falk 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Falk | first1 = D. | title = Prelinguistic evolution in early hominins: whence motherese? | journal = Behav Brain Sci | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–503; discussion 503–83 |date=Aug 2004 | url = http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS260/Falk2004.pdf | pmid = 15773427 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their counterparts in other primates, couldn't move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned. Mothers responded by developing 'motherese'—an infant-directed communicative system embracing facial expressions, body language, touching, patting, caressing, laughter, tickling and emotionally expressive contact calls. The argument is that language somehow developed out of all this.&lt;ref name="Falk 2004"/&gt;

In ''[[The Mental and Social Life of Babies]]'', psychologist [[Kenneth Kaye]] noted that no usable adult language could have evolved without interactive communication between very young children and adults. "No symbolic system could have survived from one generation to the next if it could not have been easily acquired by young children under their normal conditions of social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaye|first=K.|title=The Mental and Social Life of Babies|year=1982|publisher=Univ.

=== From where to what theory ===
[[File:Language processing in the brain.png|thumb|Language is processed in 2 pathways in the human brain: the auditory ventral stream and auditory dorsal stream. The auditory ventral stream begins in the anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG), which projects to the anterior superior temporal sulcus (aSTS), middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and Temporal pole (TP). These regions then project to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This pathway is responsible for sound recognition. The auditory dorsal stream begins in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), which projects to the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), Sylvian parieto-temporal junction (Spt), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). These regions then also project to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This pathway is responsible for sound localization and for the articulation of speech. Modified with permission from: Poliva, O.

[[File:From where to what.png|thumb|The 'from where to what' model of language evolution hypotheses 7 stages of language evolution: 1. The origin of speech is the exchange of contact calls between mothers and offspring used to relocate each other in cases of separation. 2. Offspring of early Homo modified the contact calls with intonations in order to emit two types of contact calls: contact calls that signal low level of distress and contact calls that signal high-level of distress. 3. The use of two types of contact calls enabled the first question-answer conversation. In this scenario, the offspring emits a low-level distress call to express a desire to interact with an object, and the mother responds with a low-level distress call to enable the interaction or high-level distress call to prohibit it. 4. The use of intonations improved over time, and eventually, individuals acquired sufficient vocal control to invent new words to objects. 5. At first, offspring learned the calls from their parents by imitating their lip-movements. 6. As the learning of calls improved, babies learned new calls (i.e., phonemes) through lip imitation only during infancy. After that period, the memory of phonemes lasted for a lifetime, and older children became capable of learning new calls (through mimicry) without observing their parents' lip-movements. 7. Individuals became capable of rehearsing sequences of calls. This enabled the learning of words with several syllables, which increased vocabulary size. Further developments to the brain circuit responsible for rehearsing poly-syllabic words resulted with individuals capable of rehearsing lists of words (phonological working memory), which served as the platform for communication with sentences.

The ‘from where to what’ model argues that the co-localization of sound localization, audio-visual integration and discrimination of voices is evidence that speech originated for the purpose of exchanging contact calls (stage 1 in figure). These calls are used by con-specifics in order to announce to the troop of their presence or location. In this scenario, speech could have began when a mother and offspring accidentally separated in the forest, and the two took turns emitting contact calls until they were re-united.

A possible transition from contact call to speech is that due to a mutation in the auditory dorsal stream, early hominans (i.e., Homo habilis) became capable of modifying the contact calls with intonations (stage 2 in figure). This enabled infants to emit two types of contact calls, one that signals the mother the infant is safe but desires her attention and another that signals immediate danger. Such a development would have provided the mother with an advantage as it informs her whether she needs to drop everything she carries and rush to the baby, or she can take her time. As generations passed and vocal control improved, mothers and offspring became capable of communicating with very simple yes-no question answer conversations (stage 3 in figure). In such a scenario, a baby is emitting a low-level distress call to signal desire to eat berries, and the mother responding with a low-level distress call to permit the activity or high-level distress call to prohibit it. This use of intonations in order to emit two types of calls, one for low level of distress and another for high level of distress could explain why humans today use intonations to transform words into questions or commands (for example, converting the word ‘food’ into a question or command with different intonations).

In accordance with the model, as generations passed, vocal control increased from just modifying calls with intonations to emitting novel calls (stage 4 in figure). During this time, infants learned these call by imitating their parents’ lip-movements (stage 5 in figure). This hypothesis explains the role of the auditory dorsal stream in many studies of lip-speech integration as occurs in lip-reading&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. A role for reading lips as a mean for the acquisition of novel calls can also explain the distinctive large human lips, which are not found with other apes. Supporting the model are studies of patients with damage to the auditory dorsal stream that were reported with impaired ability to repeat sentences and nonsense words ([[conduction aphasia]])&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, or impaired ability to name objects ([[Anomic aphasia|anomia]])&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

Learning calls by offspring imitating the lip-movements of their parents eventually reached a maximum limit of efficiency. At this point, the offspring were able to learn new vocalizations soon after hearing them, and the memory lasted for their entire life (stage 6 in figure). Such a transition could explain the tendency of babies, at their first year, to mimic their parents by imitating their lip-movements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tenenbaum|first=Elena J.|last2=Shah|first2=Rajesh J.|last3=Sobel|first3=David M.|last4=Malle|first4=Bertram F.|last5=Morgan|first5=James L.|date=2012-06-20|title=Increased Focus on the Mouth Among Infants in the First Year of Life: A Longitudinal Eye-Tracking Study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00135.x|journal=Infancy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=534–553|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00135.x|issn=1525-0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kubicek|first=Claudia|last2=de Boisferon|first2=Anne Hillairet|last3=Dupierrix|first3=Eve|last4=Lœvenbruck|first4=Hélène|last5=Gervain|first5=Judit|last6=Schwarzer|first6=Gudrun|date=2013-02-25|title=Face-scanning behavior to silently-talking faces in 12-month-old infants: The impact of pre-exposed auditory speech|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0165025412473016|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=106–110|doi=10.1177/0165025412473016|issn=0165-0254}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewkowicz|first=David J.|date=2010|title=Infant perception of audio-visual speech synchrony.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0015579|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=66–77|doi=10.1037/a0015579|issn=1939-0599}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that after the first year this mimicry process ends&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K.|date=November 2004|title=Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1533|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|language=En|volume=5|issue=11|pages=831–843|doi=10.1038/nrn1533|issn=1471-003X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The development of a memory store for vocalizations in the parietal lobe of the auditory dorsal stream could have provided the neurological infra-structure for rehearsing lists of calls, thus resulting with poly-syllabic words (stage 7 in figure). Eventually the rehearsal of lists of syllables enabled the rehearsal of lists of words, which made the communication with sentences possible. 

===Grammaticalisation theory===
'[[Grammaticalization|Grammaticalisation]]' is a continuous historical process in which free-standing words develop into grammatical appendages, while these in turn become ever more specialized and grammatical. An initially 'incorrect' usage, in becoming accepted, leads to unforeseen consequences, triggering knock-on effects and extended sequences of change. Paradoxically, grammar evolves because, in the final analysis, humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood.&lt;ref&gt;Sperber, D. and D. Wilson 1986.

Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, we can legitimately infer similar principles at work among our distant ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Deutscher | first1 = Guy | title = The unfolding of language : an evolutionary tour of mankind's greatest invention | year = 2005 | publisher = Metropolitan Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-8050-7907-4 | oclc = 57311730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, P.

In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, we need to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not. In order to convey abstract ideas, the first recourse of speakers is to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery, very often deploying [[metaphor]]s rooted in shared bodily experience.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, G 1980"&gt;Lakoff, G. and M. Johnson 1980. ''Metaphors We Live By.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A familiar example is the use of concrete terms such as 'belly' or 'back' to convey abstract meanings such as 'inside' or 'behind'. Equally metaphorical is the strategy of representing temporal patterns on the model of spatial ones. For example, English speakers might say 'It is going to rain,' modeled on 'I am going to London.' This can be abbreviated colloquially to 'It's gonna rain.' Even when in a hurry, we don't say 'I'm gonna London'—the contraction is restricted to the job of specifying tense. From such examples we can see why grammaticalization is consistently unidirectional—from concrete to abstract meaning, not the other way around.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"/&gt;

Grammaticalization theorists picture early language as simple, perhaps consisting only of nouns.&lt;ref name="Heine 2007"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;111&lt;/sup&gt; Even under that extreme theoretical assumption, however, it is difficult to imagine what would realistically have prevented people from using, say, 'spear' as if it were a verb ('Spear that pig!'). People might have used their nouns as verbs or their verbs as nouns as occasion demanded. In short, while a noun-only language might seem theoretically possible, grammaticalization theory indicates that it cannot have remained fixed in that state for any length of time.&lt;ref name="Deutscher 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heine Kuteva 2012"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 =  Heine

Creativity drives grammatical change.&lt;ref name="Heine Kuteva 2012"/&gt; This presupposes a certain attitude on the part of listeners. Instead of punishing deviations from accepted usage, listeners must prioritize imaginative mind-reading. Imaginative creativity—emitting a leopard alarm when no leopard was present, for example—is not the kind of behavior which, say, [[vervet monkey]]s would appreciate or reward.&lt;ref name="Cheney Seyfarth 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheney|first1=Dorothy L.|last2=Seyfarth|first2=Robert M.|title=Constraints and preadaptations in the earliest stages of language evolution|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=22|issue=2–4| pages = 135–59|year=2005|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~seyfarth/Publications/LinguisticReview.pdf|doi=10.1515/tlir.2005.22.2-4.135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creativity and reliability are incompatible demands; for 'Machiavellian' primates as for animals generally, the overriding pressure is to demonstrate reliability.&lt;ref name="Maynard Smith 2003"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Maynard Smith | first1 = John | last2 = Harper | first2 = David | title = Animal signals | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852684-1 | oclc = 54460090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If humans escape these constraints, it is because in our case, listeners are primarily interested in mental states.

To focus on mental states is to accept fictions—inhabitants of the imagination—as potentially informative and interesting. Take the use of metaphor. A metaphor is, literally, a false statement.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, R. D. 1979. What metaphors mean. In S. Sacks (ed.), ''On Metaphor.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 29–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Think of Romeo's declaration, 'Juliet is the sun!' Juliet is a woman, not a ball of plasma in the sky, but human listeners are not (or not usually) pedants insistent on point-by-point factual accuracy. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalization is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, G 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G. and R. Núñez 2000. ''Where mathematics comes from.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalization theory might explain language change today, it does not satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge—explaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as we know it. Rather, the theory assumes that language already exists. As Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva acknowledge: "Grammaticalization requires a linguistic system that is used regularly and frequently within a community of speakers and is passed on from one group of speakers to another".&lt;ref name="Heine 2007"/&gt; Outside modern humans, such conditions do not prevail.

=== Evolution-Progression Model ===

Human language is used for self-expression; however, expression displays different stages. The consciousness of self and feelings represents the stage immediately prior to the external, phonetic expression of feelings in the form of sound, i.e., language. Intelligent animals such as dolphins, Eurasian magpies, and chimpanzees live in communities, wherein they assign themselves roles for group survival and show emotions such as sympathy.&lt;ref name="Gallup"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Gallup, GG Jr.| title = Chimpanzees: Self recognition| journal = Science

Human survival became easier with the development of tools, shelter, and fire, thus facilitating further advancement of interaction, self-expression, and tool-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ko|first1=Kwang Hyun|title=Origins of human intelligence: The chain of tool-making and brain evolution|journal=ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTEBOOKS|date=2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=5–22|url=http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2016_1/Anthropological_Notebooks_XXII_1_Ko.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing brain size allowed advanced provisioning and tools and the technological advances during the Palaeolithic era that built upon the previous evolutionary innovations of bipedalism and hand versatility allowed the development of human language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Self-domesticated ape theory===
According to a study investigating the song differences between [[white-rumped munia]]s and its domesticated counterpart ([[society finch|Bengalese finch]]), the wild munias use a highly stereotyped song sequence, whereas the domesticated ones sing a highly unconstrained song. In wild finches, song syntax is subject to female preference—[[sexual selection]]—and remains relatively fixed. However, in the Bengalese finch, natural selection is replaced by breeding, in this case for colorful plumage, and thus, decoupled from selective pressures, stereotyped song syntax is allowed to drift. It is replaced, supposedly within 1000 generations, by a variable and learned sequence. Wild finches, moreover, are thought incapable of learning song sequences from other finches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., &amp; Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song sintax |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363–370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3|last2=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|last3=Okanoya}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[bird vocalization]], brains capable of producing only an innate song have very simple neural pathways: the primary forebrain motor center, called the robust nucleus of [[arcopallium]], connects to midbrain vocal outputs, which in turn project to brainstem motor nuclei. By contrast, in brains capable of learning songs, the arcopallium receives input from numerous additional forebrain regions, including those involved in learning and social experience. Control over song generation has become less constrained, more distributed, and more flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Soma, M., Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, M., &amp; Okanoya, K.|year=2009|title=Early ontogenetic effects on song quality in the Bengalese finch (''Lonchura striata var. domestica''): laying order, sibling competition and song syntax |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume= 63|pages=363–370|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1085n85073j6174/fulltext.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0670-9|issue=3|last2=Hiraiwa-Hasegawa|last3=Okanoya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way to think about human evolution is that we are self-domesticated apes. Just as domestication relaxed selection for stereotypic songs in the finches—mate choice was supplanted by choices made by the aesthetic sensibilities of bird breeders and their customers—so might our cultural domestication have relaxed selection on many of our primate behavioral traits, allowing old pathways to degenerate and reconfigure. Given the highly indeterminate way that mammalian brains develop—they basically construct themselves "bottom up", with one set of neuronal interactions setting the stage for the next round of interactions—degraded pathways would tend to seek out and find new opportunities for synaptic hookups. Such inherited de-differentiations of brain pathways might have contributed to the functional complexity that characterizes human language. And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid time-frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Graham Ritchie|author2=Simon Kirby|lastauthoramp=yes|year=2005|title=Selection, domestication, and the emergence of learned communication systems|journal=Second International Symposium on the Emergence and Evolution of Linguistic Communication|volume=|pages=|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121153322/http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0237680/pubs/ritchie_05_selection.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speech and language for communication ==
{{See also|Animal communication|Animal language|Origin of speech}}
A distinction can be drawn between [[speech]] and [[language]]. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably the most natural one.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeilage, P. 1998. Evolution of the mechanism of language output: comparative neurobiology of vocal and manual communication. In J. R. Hurford, M. Studdert Kennedy and C. Knight (eds), Approaches to the Evolution of Language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 222 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars view language as an initially cognitive development, its 'externalisation' to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is [[recursion]],&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hauser | first1 = MD. | last2 = Chomsky | first2 = N. | last3 = Fitch | first3 = WT. | title = The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5598 | pages = 1569–79 | date = Nov 2002 | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 | pmid = 12446899 | url = http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases). Other scholars—notably [[Daniel Everett]]—deny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g. [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]]) which allegedly lack this feature.&lt;ref name="Everett 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Everett|first1=Daniel L.|title=Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Piraha Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language|journal=Current Anthropology| volume=46| issue=4|year=2005| pages=621–646| doi=10.1086/431525|url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to ask questions is considered by some to distinguish language from non-human systems of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zhordania | first = I. M. | title = Who asked the first question : the origins of human choral singing, intelligence, language and speech | publisher = Logos Tbilisi Ivane Javakhishvili State University | location = Tbilisi, Georgia | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789994031818 | oclc= 224993377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some captive primates (notably [[bonobos]] and [[chimpanzees]]), having learned to use rudimentary signing to communicate with their human trainers, proved able to respond correctly to complex questions and requests. Yet they failed to ask even the simplest questions themselves. {{Citation needed|reason=The chimp Washoe, pointing first doll, and then the mouth was able to ask the simple question: Time to eat?|date=January 2014}} Conversely, human children are able to ask their first questions (using only question [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]) at the babbling period of their development, long before they start using syntactic structures. Although babies from different cultures acquire native languages from their social environment, all languages of the world without exception—tonal, non-tonal, intonational and accented—use similar rising "question intonation" for [[yes–no question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bolinger, Dwight L. (Editor) 1972. ''Intonation''. Selected Readings. Harmondsworth: Penguin, pg.314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruttenden 1986"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Cruttenden | first1 = Alan | title = Intonation | year = 1986 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge [Cambridgeshire] ; New York | isbn = 978-0-521-26028-2 | oclc = 12103838| pages = 169–174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact is a strong evidence of the universality of [[question intonation]]. In general, according to some authors, sentence intonation/pitch is pivotal in spoken grammar and is the basic information used by children to learn the grammar of whatever language.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

==Cognitive development and language==
One of the intriguing abilities that language users have is that of high-level [[reference]] (or [[deixis]]), the ability to refer to things or states of being that are not in the immediate realm of the speaker. This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions. According to Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002), there are six main aspects of this high-level reference system:

* [[Theory of mind]]
* Capacity to acquire non-linguistic conceptual representations, such as the object/kind distinction
* Referential vocal signals
* Imitation as a rational, intentional system
* Voluntary control over signal production as evidence of intentional communication
* [[Numerical cognition|Number representation]]&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt;

===Theory of mind===
[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] (1999) argues that theory of mind must have preceded language use, based on evidence{{clarify|date=October 2017}} of use of the following characteristics as much as 40,000 years ago: intentional communication, repairing failed communication, teaching, intentional persuasion, intentional deception, building shared plans and goals, intentional sharing of focus or topic, and pretending. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Call and Tomasello's research on [[chimpanzees]] supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs. Many primates show some tendencies toward a theory of mind, but not a full one as humans have.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Number representation===
In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Matsuzawa (1985) attempted to teach chimpanzees Arabic numerals. The difference between primates and humans in this regard was very large, as it took the chimps thousands of trials to learn 1–9 with each number requiring a similar amount of training time; yet, after learning the meaning of 1, 2 and 3 (and sometimes 4), children easily comprehend the value of greater integers by using a successor function (i.e. 2 is 1 greater than 1, 3 is 1 greater than 2, 4 is 1 greater than 3; once 4 is reached it seems most children have an [[A-Ha! moment|"a-ha!" moment]] and understand that the value of any integer ''n'' is 1 greater than the previous integer). Put simply, other primates learn the meaning of numbers one by one, similar to their approach to other referential symbols, while children first learn an arbitrary list of symbols (1, 2, 3, 4...) and then later learn their precise meanings.&lt;ref name="Carey 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=Susan|title=Cognitive Foundations of Arithmetic: Evolution and Ontogenisis|journal=Mind and Language| volume=16|issue=1|year=2001| pages=37–55 |doi=10.1111/1468-0017.00155|url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/carey2001c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the "open-ended generative property" of language in human numeral cognition.&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt;

==Linguistic structures==

===Lexical-phonological principle===
Hockett (1966) details a list of features regarded as essential to describing human language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hockett|first1=Charles F.|title=The Origin of Speech|journal=Scientific American| volume=203| issue=3|year=1960|pages=88–96|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0960-88|url=http://www.gifted.ucalgary.ca/dflynn/files/dflynn/Hockett60.pdf|bibcode=1960SciAm.203c..88H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the domain of the lexical-phonological principle, two features of this list are most important:

* Productivity: users can create and understand completely novel messages.
** New messages are freely coined by blending, analogizing from, or transforming old ones.
** Either new or old elements are freely assigned new semantic loads by circumstances and context. This says that in every language, new idioms constantly come into existence.
*Duality (of Patterning): a large number of meaningful elements are made up of a conveniently small number of independently meaningless yet message-differentiating elements.

The sound system of a language is composed of a finite set of simple phonological items. Under the specific [[phonotactic]] rules of a given language, these items can be recombined and concatenated, giving rise to [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and the open-ended lexicon. A key feature of language is that a simple, finite set of phonological items gives rise to an infinite lexical system wherein rules determine the form of each item, and meaning is inextricably linked with form. Phonological syntax, then, is a simple combination of pre-existing phonological units. Related to this is another essential feature of human language: lexical syntax, wherein pre-existing units are combined, giving rise to semantically novel or distinct lexical items.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Certain elements of the lexical-phonological principle are known to exist outside of humans. While all (or nearly all) have been documented in some form in the natural world, very few coexist within the same species. Bird-song, singing nonhuman apes, and the songs of whales all display phonological syntax, combining units of sound into larger structures apparently devoid of enhanced or novel meaning. Certain other primate species do have simple phonological systems with units referring to entities in the world. However, in contrast to human systems, the units in these primates' systems normally occur in isolation, betraying a lack of lexical syntax. There is new evidence to suggest that Campbell's monkeys also display lexical syntax, combining two calls (a predator alarm call with a "boom", the combination of which denotes a lessened threat of danger), however it is still unclear whether this is a lexical or a morphological phenomenon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Pidgins and creoles===
{{Main|Creole language|pidgin}}
Pidgins are significantly simplified languages with only rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary. In their early stage pidgins mainly consist of nouns, verbs, and adjectives with few or no articles, prepositions, conjunctions or auxiliary verbs. Often the grammar has no fixed [[word order]] and the words have no [[inflection]].&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Jared M. | title = The third chimpanzee : the evolution and future of the human animal |chapter = Bridges to human language | year = 1992 | publisher = HarperCollins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-06-018307-3 | oclc = 24246928| pages = 141–167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If contact is maintained between the groups speaking the pidgin for long periods of time, the pidgins may become more complex over many generations. If the children of one generation adopt the pidgin as their native language it develops into a [[creole language]], which becomes fixed and acquires a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. The syntax and morphology of such languages may often have local innovations not obviously derived from any of the parent languages.

Studies of creole languages around the world have suggested that they display remarkable similarities in grammar{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and are developed uniformly from pidgins in a single generation. These similarities are apparent even when creoles do not share any common language origins. In addition, creoles share similarities despite being developed in isolation from each other. [[Language bioprogram theory|Syntactic similarities]] include [[subject–verb–object]] word order. Even when creoles are derived from languages with a different word order they often develop the SVO word order. Creoles tend to have similar usage patterns for definite and indefinite articles, and similar movement rules for phrase structures even when the parent languages do not.&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"/&gt;

===Primate communication===
Field primatologists can give us useful insights into [[great ape]] communication in the wild.&lt;ref name="Arcadi 2000"/&gt; An important finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signalers' emotional and bodily states. Nonhuman apes seemingly find it extremely difficult to produce vocalizations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states.&lt;ref name="Goodall 1986"/&gt; In captivity, nonhuman apes have been taught rudimentary forms of sign language or have been persuaded to use [[lexigrams]]—symbols that do not graphically resemble the corresponding words—on computer keyboards. Some nonhuman apes, such as [[Kanzi]], have been able to learn and use hundreds of lexigrams.&lt;ref name="Savage-Rumbaugh 1994"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Savage-Rumbaugh | first1 = E.

The [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s in the primate brain are responsible for controlling the muscles of the face, tongue, mouth, and larynx, as well as recognizing sounds. Primates are known to make "vocal calls", and these calls are generated by circuits in the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]].&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;Freeman, Scott; Jon C. Herron., ''Evolutionary Analysis'' (4th ed.), Pearson Education, Inc. (2007), {{ISBN|0-13-227584-8}} pages 789–90&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wild, the communication of [[vervet monkey]]s has been the most extensively studied.&lt;ref name="Diamond 1992"/&gt; They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a "leopard call", a "snake call", and an "eagle call".&lt;ref name="Seyfarth Cheney 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seyfarth|first1=Robert M.|last2=Cheney|first2=Dorothy L.| last3=Marler| first3=Peter| title=Vervet monkey alarm calls: Semantic communication in a free-ranging primate|journal=Animal Behaviour| volume=28| issue=4| year=1980| pages=1070–1094 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(80)80097-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each call triggers a different defensive strategy in the monkeys who hear the call and scientists were able to elicit predictable responses from the monkeys using loudspeakers and prerecorded sounds. Other vocalizations may be used for identification.

Similarly, researchers have demonstrated that chimpanzees (in captivity) use different "words" in reference to different foods.

===''Ardipithecus ramidus''===

A study published in ''Homo: Journal of Comparative Human Biology'' in 2017 claims that ''A. ramidus'',  a hominin dated at approximately 4.5Ma, shows the first evidence of an anatomical shift in the hominin lineage suggestive of increased vocal capability.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej |volume=68 |pages=101–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study compared the skull of ''A. ramidus'' with twenty nine chimpanzee skulls of different ages and found that in numerous features ''A. ramidus'' clustered with the infant and juvenile measures as opposed to the adult measures. Significantly, such affinity with the shape dimensions of infant and juvenile chimpanzee skull architecture was argued may have resulted in greater vocal capability. This assertion was based on the notion that the chimpanzee vocal tract ratios that prevent speech are a result of growth factors associated with puberty—growth factors absent in ''A. ramidus'' ontogeny.  ''A. ramidus'' was also found to have a degree of cervical lordosis more conducive to vocal modulation when compared with chimpanzees as well as cranial base architecture suggestive of increased vocal capability.

What was significant in this study was the observation that the changes in skull architecture that correlate with reduced aggression are the same changes necessary for the evolution of early hominin vocal ability. In integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production, the authors argue that [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to date have failed to grasp the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and language capacity.

While the skull of ''A. ramidus'', according to the authors, lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees, it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were. While they suggest ''A. ramidus''—based on similar vocal tract ratios—may have had vocal capabilities equivalent to a modern human infant or very young child, they concede this is obviously a debatable and speculative hypothesis. However, they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were a necessary prerequisite for language evolution. As they write:

{{quote|We propose that as a result of paedomorphic morphogenesis of the cranial base and craniofacial morphology ''Ar. ramidus'' would have not been limited in terms of the mechanical components of speech production as chimpanzees and bonobos are. It is possible that ''Ar. ramidus'' had vocal capability approximating that of chimpanzees and bonobos, with its idiosyncratic skull morphology not resulting in any significant advances in speech capability. In this sense the anatomical features analysed in this essay would have been exapted in later more voluble species of hominin. However, given the selective advantages of pro-social vocal synchrony, we suggest the species would have developed significantly more complex vocal abilities than chimpanzees and bonobos.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

===Early ''Homo''===
Regarding articulation, there is considerable speculation about the language capabilities of early ''[[Homo]]'' (2.5 to 0.8 million years ago). Anatomically, some scholars believe features of [[bipedalism]], which developed in [[australopithecine]]s around 3.5 million years ago, would have brought changes to the skull, allowing for a more L-shaped vocal tract. The shape of the tract and a larynx positioned relatively low in the neck are necessary prerequisites for many of the sounds humans make, particularly vowels.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Other scholars believe that, based on the position of the larynx, not even [[Neanderthals]] had the anatomy necessary to produce the full range of sounds modern humans make.&lt;ref name="Aronoff 2001"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Aronoff | first1 = Mark. | last2 = Rees-Miller | first2 = Janie. | title = The handbook of linguistics | year = 2001 | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Malden, Mass. | isbn = 978-0-631-20497-8 | oclc = 43115110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitch 2000"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Fitch | first1 = WT. | title = The evolution of speech: a comparative review | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 258–267 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01494-7 | pmid = 10859570 | url = http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic151491.files/Fitch2000TICS.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was earlier proposed that differences between ''Homo sapiens'' and Neanderthal vocal tracts could be seen in fossils, but the finding that the Neanderthal [[hyoid bone]] (see below) was identical to that found in ''Homo sapiens'' has weakened these theories.

''Hmmmmm'' is an acronym for ''h''olistic (non-compositional), ''m''anipulative (utterances are commands or suggestions, not descriptive statements), ''m''ulti-''m''odal (acoustic as well as gestural and facial), [[origin of music|''m''usical]], and ''m''imetic.&lt;ref name="Mithen 2006"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Mithen | first1 = Steven J. | title = The singing neanderthals : the origins of music, language, mind, and body | year = 2006 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 978-0-674-02192-1 | oclc = 62090869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Homo heidelbergensis'' was a close relative (most probably a migratory descendant) of ''[[Homo ergaster]].''

However, although Neanderthals may have been anatomically able to speak, [[Richard G. Klein]] in 2004 doubted that they possessed a fully modern language. He largely bases his doubts on the fossil record of archaic humans and their stone tool kit. For 2 million years following the emergence of ''Homo habilis,'' the stone tool technology of hominins changed very little. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the crude stone tool kit of archaic humans as impossible to break down into categories based on their function, and reports that Neanderthals seem to have had little concern for the final aesthetic form of their tools. Klein argues that the Neanderthal brain may have not reached the level of complexity required for modern speech, even if the physical apparatus for speech production was well-developed.&lt;ref name="kleinbio"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0402190101 |pmid=15079069 |pmc=395972 |title=Biography of Richard G.

Based on computer simulations used to evaluate that evolution of language that resulted in showing three stages in the evolution of syntax, Neanderthals are thought to have been in stage 2, showing they had something more evolved than proto-language but not quite as complex as the language of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0959774303000040 |title=Pleistocene Exchange Networks as Evidence for the Evolution of Language |journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal |volume=13 |pages=67–81 |year=2003 |last1=Marwick |first1=Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The descended larynx===
[[File:Illu larynx.jpg]]

The '''[[larynx]]''' or '''voice box''' is an organ in the neck housing the [[vocal folds]], which are responsible for [[phonation]]. In humans, the larynx is ''descended''. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls.&lt;ref name="Fitch.

Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how "special" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent.&lt;ref name="Nishimura 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nishimura | first1 = T. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = A. | last3 = Suzuki | first3 = J. | last4 = Matsuzawa | first4 = T. | title = Descent of the hyoid in chimpanzees: evolution of face flattening and speech. | journal = J Hum Evol | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–54 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.03.005 | pmid = 16730049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costs—increasing the risk of choking while swallowing food—we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefit—so it is claimed—must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact ''not'' seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;M. Clegg 2001. The Comparative Anatomy and Evolution of the Human Vocal Tract Unpublished thesis, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of ''Homo sapiens.''&lt;ref name="Perreault 2012"/&gt; A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was ''initially'' driven by selection pressures for speech, thus not excluding that it was selected for e.g. improved singing ability.

==== The size exaggeration hypothesis ====
To lower the larynx is to increase the length of the vocal tract, in turn lowering [[formant]] frequencies so that the voice sounds "deeper"—giving an impression of greater size. John Ohala argues that the function of the lowered larynx in humans, especially males, is probably to enhance threat displays rather than speech itself.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Ohala, 2000. [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/lowered_larynx.pdf The irrelevance of the lowered larynx in modern Man for the development of speech.] Paris, ENST: ''The Evolution of Language,'' pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. In fact, females invariably outperform males in verbal tests,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in our species. Although (according to Fitch) the initial lowering of the larynx in humans had nothing to do with speech, the increased range of possible formant patterns was subsequently co-opted for speech. Size exaggeration remains the sole function of the extreme laryngeal descent observed in male deer. Consistent with the size exaggeration hypothesis, a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty in humans, although only in males. In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability.&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. T. (2002). Comparative vocal production and the evolution of speech: Reinterpreting the descent of the larynx. In A. Wray (ed.), ''The Transition to Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonemic diversity===
In 2011, Quentin Atkinson published a survey of [[phoneme]]s from 500 different languages as well as [[language families]] and compared their phonemic diversity by region, number of speakers and distance from Africa.  The survey revealed that African languages had the largest number of phonemes, and [[Oceanic languages|Oceania]] and South America had the smallest number.  After allowing for the number of speakers, the phonemic diversity was compared to over 2000 possible origin locations.  Atkinson's "best fit" model is that language originated in central and southern Africa between 80,000 and 160,000 years ago.  This predates the hypothesized [[Coastal migration|southern coastal peopling]] of Arabia, India, southeast Asia, and Australia.  It would also mean that the origin of language occurred at the same time as the emergence of symbolic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atkinson |first=Quentin |title=Phonemic Diversity Supports a Serial Founder Effect Model of Language Expansion from Africa |url=http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~pmcc/prelims/2011/Atkinson-346-9.pdf |work=Science Magazine |volume=332 |pages=346–349 |date=2011 |access-date=9 July 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.1199295 |pmid=21493858|bibcode=2011Sci...332..346A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In religion and mythology===
{{Main|Mythical origins of language}}
{{See also|Divine language|Adamic language}}
The search for the origin of language has a long history rooted in [[mythology]]. Most mythologies do not credit humans with the invention of language but speak of a [[divine language]] predating human language. Mystical languages used to communicate with animals or spirits, such as the [[language of the birds]], are also common, and were of particular interest during the [[Renaissance]].

[[Vāc]] is the Hindu goddess of speech, or "speech personified". As [[Brahman]]'s "sacred utterance", she has a cosmological role as the "Mother of the [[Veda]]s". The [[Aztecs]]' story maintains that only a man, [[Coxcox]], and a woman, [[Xochiquetzal]], survived a flood, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begat many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a [[dove]], were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, P. and Russell-Coulter, C. (2001) ''Dictionary of Ancient Deities'' (Oxford: OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Old Testament, the Book of Genesis (11) says that God prevented the [[Tower of Babel]] from being completed through a miracle that made its construction workers start speaking different languages.  After this, they migrated to other regions, grouped together according to which of the newly created languages they spoke, explaining the origins of languages and nations outside of the fertile crescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert T. |last=Pennock |title=Tower of Babel: The Evidence against the New Creationism |publisher=Bradford Books |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aC1OccYnX0sC&amp;dq=Tower+of+Babel:+The+Evidence+Against+the+New+Creationism|isbn=9780262661652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical experiments===
{{main|Language deprivation experiments}}
History contains a number of anecdotes about people who attempted to discover the origin of language by experiment. The first such tale was told by [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 2.2). He relates that Pharaoh Psammetichus (probably [[Psammetichus I]], 7th century BC) had two children raised by a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. When one of the children cried "bekos" with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for "bread". From this, Psammetichus concluded that the first language was Phrygian. King [[James V of Scotland]] is said to have tried a similar experiment; his children were supposed to have spoken [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Both the medieval monarch [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and [[Akbar]] are said to have tried similar experiments; the children involved in these experiments did not speak. The current situation of [[deaf people]] also points into this direction.

===History of research===
{{Main|Evolutionary linguistics}}
Modern linguistics does not begin until the late 18th century, and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[animism#Philosophy|animist]] theses of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Johann Christoph Adelung]] remained influential well into the 19th century. The question of language origin seemed inaccessible to methodical approaches, and in 1866 the [[Linguistic Society of Paris]] famously banned all discussion of the origin of language, deeming it to be an unanswerable problem. An increasingly systematic approach to [[historical linguistics]] developed in the course of the 19th century, reaching its culmination in the [[Neogrammarian]] school of [[Karl Brugmann]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

However, scholarly interest in the question of the origin of language has only gradually been rekindled from the 1950s on (and then controversially) with ideas such as [[universal grammar]], [[mass comparison]] and [[glottochronology]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The "origin of language" as a subject in its own right emerged from studies in [[neurolinguistics]], [[psycholinguistics]] and [[human evolution]]. The ''[[Linguistic Bibliography]]'' introduced "Origin of language" as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics. Dedicated research institutes of [[evolutionary linguistics]] are a recent phenomenon, emerging only in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Name ==

Coming from the archaic Serbian name for cave, ''peštera'' ([[Cf.|cf.]] [[Pešter]]) means the "great cave". It is also known as the Jelašnica Cave ({{lang-sr|Јелашничка пећина|Jelašnička pećina}}).&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt;

== Geology ==

The cave is located on the hillock on the northern slopes of the [[Suva Planina]] mountain at an altitude of {{convert|330|m|abbr=on}}. The entrance is oriented to the west, it is {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} high. The cave itself is {{convert|22|m|abbr=on}} long. Stones are accumulated at the entrance, while the [[parent rock]] protrudes above the ground in the back part of the cave.&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt;

== Excavations ==

Pešturina has been excavated on three occasions. In 2006, the back of the cave was explored, where a trench (or probe) was dug. The search yielded artifacts from later prehistory on top, rock blades and numerous bones in the central, light-brown sediment, while the lowest section, at the depth of {{convert|1.3|m|abbr=on}}, was estimated to be from the Middle Paleolithic. At that level the parent rock was reached so the excavation stopped. In 2008 and 2010-12 the remaining sections were explored. The thickest sediments are near the entrance. The depth reached so far is {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} and the bedrock still hasn't been hit.&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt;

== Layers ==

[[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|Stratigraphically]], the site has been divided in four layers.&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt;

=== Layer 1 ===

Humus layer, with objects from later prehistory.

=== Layer 2 ===
[[Image:Heinrichshöhle 7.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Most abundant remains of the predator species belong to [[cave hyena]]]]
[[Image:Ur-painting.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Numerous remains of [[aurochs]] were excavated in all cave [[strata]]]]
Made of light-brown compact sediment. Artifacts from the Upper Paleolithic were discovered: [[Bladelet (archaeology)|bladelets]], [[Blade (archaeology)|unretouched blades]], [[Projectile point|straight backed points]] and combined tools. They were characteristic for the [[Gravettian]] and early [[Epi-Gravettian]] periods. The layer is disturbed by the rodent activities but also as the later inhabitants leveled and dug the terrain. As a result, some Middle Paleolithic artifacts can be found but they do not originate in this layer. Fauna remains are very fragmented. Most abundant remains of the carnivorous animals belong to the [[grey wolf]] while the [[prey animal]]s include [[aurochs]], horse and [[Alpine ibex]]. Remains were also found of the hares, [[cave hyena]], [[Mustelidae]] and [[red deer]]. Over 100 artifacts were found. They were mostly made of [[chalcedony]] and the beige and brown [[flint]] stone and their structure point to the short term habitation.&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="research"/&gt;

=== Layer 3 ===

Consists of brown sediment. Artifacts generally belong to the Denticulate Mousterian culture, from the Middle Paleolithic period. It is quite disturbed in the later periods, with rodent holes. Fauna remains are numerous, mostly corresponding to the one discovered in Layer 4. Most plentiful are those of horses and aurochs while the main predators found is the cave hyena. Other remains include hares, [[red fox]], [[cave bear]], [[Eurasian lynx]], Mustelidae, [[roe deer]] and Alpine ibex. The structure of artifacts found in the layer for the most part also corresponds to Layer 4. Apart from chalcedony and the beige and brown flint, the grey-green flint is also used but the most common are tools made of [[quartz]].&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="research"/&gt;

=== Layer 4 ===

Reddish and loose in structure, the layer consists of larger crumbs. In the back section large fragments of rock were discovered and the sediment is dark brown. Because of that, the layer is divided into Layer 4-a (reddish) and Layer 4-b (dark brown), which hasn't been fully explored yet. The [[assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] is dated to the Middle Paleolithic and as part of the Charentian Mousterian period, with [[Quina Mousterian]] elements. There are many fauna remnants and they are well preserved. Predominant are the bones of horse and aurochs with red deer and Alpine ibex to the lesser extent. Bones of [[rhinoceros]] and [[woolly mammoth]] have also been found. Remains of the cave hyena, fragmentation of the bones, marks of the hyena teeth on the bones and huge amount of [[coprolites]], points to hyenas being on top of the food chain in this period. Other animal remnants include [[Eurasian beaver]], hare, cave bear, [[leopard]], Mustelidae and [[chamois]]. Over 100 artifacts were discovered, which mostly made of quartz, while the flint and chalcedony were also found. Though artifacts from all three phases of the flint-[[knapping]] were discovered (blades, tools, pressure flaking), the cores were not discovered which means that the tools were most likely made somewhere else and then brought into the cave.&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="research"/&gt;

Mammals belonged to the different [[biome]]s (forest, mountain, steppe), with the steppe animals being more numerous in the upper layers. It suggests that savanna (with the grazing horse and aurochs herds), temperate forest (red deer, roe deer) and rocky cliffs (Alpine ibex, chamois) were all located within walking distance from the cave. Though majority of the remains were brought into the cave by hyenas, remains of large animals like rhinoceros and mammoths, so as the artifacts, show that some remains were human kills.&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="research"/&gt;

A major roof collapse near the entrance, or the possible bedrock which separated two caves, is later labeled the Layer 4-c. It still remains unexplored.&lt;ref name="research"/&gt;

=== Hominids ===

All Paleolithic sites in the Central [[Balkans]], including  Pešturina, have the noticeable absence of the [[Aurignacian]] layers. That points to the theory that the expansion of the [[early modern human]]s into [[Europe]] occurred via the [[Danube]] corridor, which allowed for the small Neanderthal communities to survive beyond 40,000 BP in some isolated pockets.&lt;ref name="glasnik"/&gt; Based on the dating of the animal remains, and comparing it to the corresponding tools, Pešturina is the first site in the region with the quasi-continuous habitation from 102,000 BP&lt;u&gt;+&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;5,000 to 39,000 BP&lt;u&gt;+&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;3,000.&lt;ref name="research"/&gt;

The '''Pinson Mounds''' comprise a prehistoric [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] complex located in [[Madison County, Tennessee]] in the region that is known as the Eastern Woodlands. The complex, which includes 17 [[mound]]s, an [[earthen]] geometric [[enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]], and numerous habitation areas, was most likely built during the [[Woodland period|Middle Woodland period]] (c. 1-500 [[AD]]).  The complex is the largest group of Middle Woodland mounds in the United States.  Sauls' Mound, at 72 feet, is the second-highest surviving mound in the United States.

The Pinson Mounds are now part of '''Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park''', one of two [[archaeology|archaeological]] parks in Tennessee (the other being [[Old Stone Fort (Tennessee)|Old Stone Fort]] near [[Manchester, Tennessee|Manchester]]). Pinson Mounds is a [[National Historic Landmark]] and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==Geographic setting==

[[Image:Pinson-mounds-saul-view1.jpg|right|325px|thumb|The view from atop Sauls' Mound, looking east]]

The Pinson Mounds are located on a plateau-like upland above the [[wetland]]s that line the banks of the South Fork of the [[Forked Deer River]]. The river and its wetlands form the complex's southern boundary. The Pinson Mounds are located amidst three distinctive biotic zones: the [[oak]] forests atop the plateau, the [[cypress]] forests in the wet bottomlands, and the [[beech]] forests on the slopes between the uplands and the bottomlands.  The ground is mostly composed of [[Tertiary period]] rocks known for producing high-quality clay.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mainfort (ed.), et al., ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Area: 1974, 1975, and 1978 Field Seasons'' (Nashville, Tenn.: Tennessee Department of Conservation - Division of Archaeology, 1980), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mounds complex can be roughly divided into three sections&amp;mdash; the Inner section, situated at the center of the complex around Saul's Mound, the Western (or Ozier) section, and the Eastern section, which includes the geometric enclosure. A stream known as Hudson Branch runs perpendicular to the Forked Deer River and divides the Inner section from the Western section. The Eastern and Western sections are both roughly 1,500 meters from the Inner section. ([http://www.state.tn.us/environment/parks/PinsonMounds/map.pdf click&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;map])

The Pinson Mounds complex is managed by the [[Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation]]. The Western section is managed by the Tennessee Division of Forestry and includes a nursery and irrigation pond. Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park is located appx. 2.5 miles east of the town of [[Pinson, Tennessee|Pinson]] and approximately 10 miles southeast of [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]].

==Archaeological features==

The Pinson Mounds complex covers approximately {{convert|400|acre|km2}} and contains at least 30 mounds, 17 of which have been identified as being completely or partially constructed by prehistoric peoples.&lt;ref name=norton&gt;Mark Norton, "The Pinson Mounds Complex," ''West Tennessee Historical Society Papers'' 55 (2001). Copy obtained at Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mounds range in height from the prominent 72-foot Saul's Mound to barely noticeable rises.  Most mounds were probably constructed between 100 and 300 AD, based on [[radiocarbon dating]] and the predominance of Woodland-period artifacts found at the site. The following are major features at the Pinson Mounds site:

===Inner Complex===

[[Image:Pinson-mounds-mound10.jpg|right|210px|thumb|The view across the top of Mound 10 into a field below]]

* '''Sauls' Mound''' (Mound 9), at the center of the complex. The mound was named after John Sauls, the owner of the property before its purchase by the state. Sauls' Mound is the second-highest prehistoric mound in the United States.&lt;ref name=tehc&gt;Robert Mainfort and Mary Kwas, "[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1062 Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park]", ''The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2002. Retrieved: 9 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mound is rectangular in formation, with each corner aligned with one of the four [[cardinal directions]]. The mound's function was believed to be ceremonial. A viewing platform has been constructed atop the mound for park visitors. Dimensions: base&amp;mdash; 112 x 91 meters, height&amp;mdash; 22 meters.&lt;ref name=signs&gt;Information  obtained from on-site interpretive signs, except where otherwise noted. Information accessed: 8 December 2007. Dimensions converted to metric for consistency.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mound 10''', a few meters to the east of Sauls' Mound. Mound 10 is believed to have been a [[platform mound]] with a ceremonial function. Dimensions: base&amp;mdash; 61 x 40 meters, height&amp;mdash; 1.3 meters.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;
* '''Mound 11 Sector''', a few meters to the north of Sauls' Mound, behind the museum. Mound 11 is a natural rise that is believed to have been a habitation area during the Middle Woodland period.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;
* '''Mound 12''', several meters southwest of Sauls' Mound. Mound 12 was a [[burial]] mound built upon an Early Woodland habitation area. Dimensions: base&amp;mdash; 23 x 17 meters, height&amp;mdash; 1.3 meters.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;
* '''Mound 14 Sector''', several meters southwest of Sauls' Mound. The Mound 14 Sector was a late-Woodland/early-[[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] habitation area.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;
* '''Mound 15''', several hundred meters southwest of Sauls' Mound. Part of Mound 15 has been destroyed by cultivation. Dimensions: base&amp;mdash; 46 x 50 meters, height&amp;mdash; appx. 1 meter.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;
* '''Mound 17''', several hundred meters southeast of Sauls' Mound. Dimensions: appx. 12 meters long with a height of 1 meter.&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort, et al., ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Section===

[[Image:Pinson-mounds-mound29.jpg|right|210px|thumb|The view from atop Mound 29 into the area enclosed by the walls of the Eastern Citadel below]]

* The '''Eastern Citadel''', an earthen geometric enclosure located approximately {{convert|1500|m|ft}} east of Sauls' Mound.  William Myer gave the enclosure its present name in the early 20th century, although [[archeologists]] believe its function to have been primarily ceremonial rather than defensive.  The walls form a near-perfect semicircle with a diameter of {{convert|366|m|ft}}, enclosing approximately {{convert|06|km2|acre}}. The height of the walls is, on average, approximately {{convert|1.5|m|ft}}.  The enclosed area is not level, with the western edge being approximately {{convert|12|m|ft}} lower than the eastern edge.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;
* '''Mound 29''', a rectangular platform mound located along the eastern edge of the geometric enclosure. Mound 29 is aligned with Sauls' Mound in the direction of the [[equinox]] sunrise. Dimensions: base&amp;mdash; {{convert|49|x|52|m|ft}}, height&amp;mdash; {{convert|3.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;
* '''Mound 30''', a bird-shaped mound a few meters south of Mound 29.  The bird shape is thought to have been due to recent cultivation and subsequent erosion. Dimensions: approximately {{convert|24|m|ft}} long with a height {{convert|1|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;
* '''Mound 28''', a rectangular platform mound located approximately {{convert|1500|m|ft}} northeast of Sauls' Mound and several hundred meters north of the Eastern Citadel.  Mound 28 is almost aligned with Sauls' Mound in the direction of the summer solstice sunrise. Dimensions: base&amp;mdash; {{convert|62|x|65|m|ft}}, height&amp;mdash; {{convert|4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=signs /&gt;

===Western (Ozier) Section===

* The '''Ozier Mound''' (Mound 5), a rectangular platform mound with an earthen ramp facing northeast. At 33 feet, the Ozier Mound is the second-largest mound in the complex. Dimensions: approximately {{convert|80|m|ft}} in diameter, height of {{convert|10|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mainfort, et al., ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Twin Mounds''' (Mound 6), a double-conical mound located a few meters south of the Ozier Mound. The Twin Mounds were burial mounds. Base approximately {{convert|30|x|50|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* '''Mound 31''', a burial mound located a few meters south of the Ozier Mound. Base appx. 40 x 60 meters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
* The '''Cochran Area''', a site located approximately {{convert|200|m|ft}} west of the Ozier Mound section. The Cochran Area is believed to have been a temporary habitation area. The Cochran area covers appx. {{convert|5000|m2|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort, et al., ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pinson Mounds in recorded history ==

After the [[Chickasaw]] ceded much of West Tennessee in 1818, land speculator Joel Pinson arrived in what is now Madison County to survey the area. Pinson "discovered" the complex which was named after him in 1820.  The complex did not receive much attention until a [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]]-area [[journalist]] named J.G. Cisco began writing about it in the late 19th century.  Cisco's articles drew the interest of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

In 1916 the Smithsonian dispatched the [[archaeologist]] [[William E. Myer]] to investigate the site.  Myer suggested that the entire complex was built according to a master plan, and created a map for the site. In 1947, the Tennessee Division of Forestry purchased the Western section of the Pinson site.&lt;ref name=norton /&gt;

===Archaeological surveys and excavations===

[[Image:Pinson-mounds-mound14sector.jpg|right|210px|thumb|The Mound 14 Sector]]

At the request of the Jackson Archaeological Society and the [[National Park Service]], in December 1961 the [[University of Tennessee]] archaeologists Fred Fisher and [[Charles Harrison McNutt|Charles McNutt]] carried out the first major excavation of the Pinson Mounds.  In the Mound 14 Sector, Fisher and McNutt discovered the remains of a {{convert|21|x|18|ft|m}} house surrounded by a posthole-lined wall-trench and containing a central hearth and [[storage pit (archaeology)|storage pits]].  Based primarily on the vast amount of pre-[[Mississippian culture]] debris found at the site and [[radiocarbon dating]] of [[charcoal]], Fisher and McNutt concluded that the Pinson Mounds were probably built during the Middle Woodland period, c. 1-500 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Fisher and C.H. McNutt, "Test Excavations at Pinson Mounds, 1961," ''Tennessee Archaeologist'' 18, no. 1 (1962), pp. 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pinson-mounds-mound12.jpg|left|210px|thumb|Mound 12]]

Excavations by [[Dan Morse (archaeologist)|Dan Morse]] and Richard Polhemus in 1963 uncovered what they believed was an oval-shaped house, a large hearth, and various refuse pits.&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort, et al., ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Area'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Morse and Polhemus agreed that the mounds were mostly built during the Middle Woodland period.  The state purchased the prehistoric property in 1965 from the Williams and Saul families. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] that same year.&lt;ref name=norton /&gt;

In the 1970s, John Broster of the [[Tennessee Division of Archaeology]] carried out extensive investigations of the site's Western section and the Mound 12 Sector.  Broster uncovered a human [[cremation]] pit and evidence of [[Early Woodland]]-period habitation at Mound 12.&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort, et al., ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds'', pp. 16-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Broster's team also found a number of "exotic" [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s at the Cochran area.  This suggested Pinson Mounds may have been a "manufacture" area for grave goods, or a regional trade center.&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort, et al., ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds'', pp. 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Robert Mainfort discovered six tombs in the Twin Mounds, one of which contained the remains of eight young women wearing headdresses with [[copper]] adornments.  Another tomb had four older men, one of whom had been buried with two round rattles bearing abstract designs.  Mainfort also uncovered a single burial in Mound 31 and evidence of food offerings at the base of the mounds.&lt;ref name=norton /&gt;

Excavations carried out prior to construction of park facilities uncovered a possible habitation area at Mound 11 and a large number of 19th-century artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Toplovich, "Archaeological Mitigations at Pinson Mounds (40MD1) State Archaeological Area: 1978", ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Area: 1974, 1975, and 1978 Field Seasons'' (Nashville, Tenn.: Tennessee Department of Conservation - Division of Archaeology, 1980), pp. 92-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1990s, four additional mounds were verified as prehistoric, bringing the total to 17.&lt;ref name=norton /&gt;

===The function of the Pinson Mounds===
[[Image:Pinson-mounds-mound28.jpg|right|210px|thumb|The southwest corner of Mound 28]]

The Middle Woodland natives most likely built the Pinson Mounds primarily for religious ceremonial purposes, although their motives have yet to be established definitively. The Ozier Mound contains no burials and because of its shape, ramped and flat-topped, it was most likely used as a ceremonial platform.&lt;ref&gt;Dean R. Snow, ''Archaeology of Native North America'' (2010), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the oldest such mounds in the Eastern Woodlands region. At least three of the mounds&amp;mdash; 6, 12, and 31&amp;mdash; contain burials or cremations.&lt;ref name=tehc /&gt;  Excavations have turned up a relatively scant amount of cultural material (e.g., arrowheads and pottery fragments), which points to a lack of permanent habitation at the Pinson Mounds site.&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort, et al., ''Archaeological Investigations at Pinson Mounds'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence suggests that the layout of the Pinson Mounds might be due to [[astronomical]] alignment, and expresses the people's [[cosmology]], as is the case at some later mound complexes, such as [[Cahokia]].  The corners of Sauls' Mound, for instance, face the four cardinal directions.  The Eastern and Western sections of the complex are roughly equidistant (appx. 1,500 meters) from the Inner complex, although the alignment is not exact.  Mound 29 in the Eastern section is aligned with Sauls' Mound in the direction of the [[equinox]] sunrise, and Mound 28 is ''almost'' aligned with Sauls' in the direction of the Summer [[solstice]] sunrise.  To date, no mound has been found in the direction of the Winter solstice sunrise.&lt;ref name=norton /&gt;

==Pinson Mounds State Archaeological Park==

[[Image:Pinson mounds museum 1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|The Pinson Mounds Museum]]

The park's museum is built within a "replica" of a platform mound. Its exhibits include artifacts obtained from the various excavations at the Pinson site, as well as various other artifacts from around the region. The museum is also home to the West Tennessee Regional Archaeology offices and an archaeological library.

The park contains approximately 6 miles of walking trails, most of which explore the mounds and associated features. South of Sauls' Mound, a boardwalk looks out over the South Fork of the Forked Deer River and its wetlands. The park is also the site of Archaeofest, an event held every September that celebrates the site's prehistoric builders.

== In popular culture ==
*A novel by [[R. S. Pierpoint]] entitled ''[[After the Mardi Gras]]'' tells the tale of a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailor who wanders to the Indian mounds at Pinson hundreds of years ago, marries the chief's granddaughter and founds a line of [[Melungeons]].

'''Popular culture studies''' is the [[academic discipline]] studying [[popular culture]] from a [[critical theory]] perspective. It is generally considered as a combination of [[communication studies]] and [[cultural studies]]. The first department to offer Popular Culture bachelor's and master's degrees is the [[Bowling Green State University Department of Popular Culture]] which was founded by [[Ray B. Browne]].&lt;ref name="raybrowne"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/education/28browne.html?_r=0 | title=Ray Browne, 87, Founder of Pop-Culture Studies, Dies | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=27 October 2009 | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Fox, Margalit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the work of the [[Frankfurt School]], popular culture has come to be taken more seriously as a terrain of academic inquiry and has also helped to change the outlooks of more established disciplines. Conceptual barriers between so-called [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]] have broken down, accompanying an explosion in scholarly interest in popular culture, which encompasses such diverse media as [[comic books]], [[television]], and the [[Internet]]. Reevaluation of mass culture in the 1970s and 1980s has revealed significant problems with the traditional view of mass culture as degraded and elite culture as uplifting. Divisions between high and low culture have been increasingly seen as political distinctions rather than defensible aesthetic or intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji &amp; Schudson 1991:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional theories of popular culture==

===The theory of mass society===
[[Mass society]] formed during the 19th-century [[industrialization]] process through the [[division of labor]], the large-scale industrial organization, the concentration of urban populations, the growing centralization of decision making, the development of a complex and international communication system and the growth of mass political movements. The term "mass society", therefore, was introduced by [[anticapitalism|anticapitalist]], aristocratic ideologists and used against the values and practices of industrialized society. Theories of popular culture are often subjected to bias and originate from a generalist perspective.

As [[Alan Swingewood]] points out in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:5-8&lt;/ref&gt; the aristocratic theory of mass society is to be linked to the moral crisis caused by the weakening of traditional centers of authority such as family and religion. The society predicted by [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and others would be dominated by philistine masses, without centers or hierarchies of moral or cultural authority. In such a society, art can only survive by cutting its links with the masses, by withdrawing as an asylum for threatened values. Throughout the 20th century, this type of theory has modulated on the opposition between disinterested, pure autonomous art and commercialized mass culture.

===The theory of culture industry===
Diametrically opposed to the aristocratic view would be the theory of [[culture industry]] developed by [[Frankfurt School]] [[critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]]. In their view, the masses are precisely dominated by an all-encompassing culture industry obeying only to the logic of [[consumer capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s concept of hegemony (see: [[cultural hegemony]]), that is, the domination of society by a specific group which stays in power by partially taking care of and partially repressing the claims of other groups, does not work here anymore. The principle of hegemony as a goal to achieve for an oppressed [[social class]] loses its meaning. The system has taken over; only the state apparatus dominates.

===The theory of progressive evolution===
A third view on popular culture, which fits in the liberal-pluralist ideology and is often called "progressive evolutionism", is overtly optimistic. It sees capitalist economy as creating opportunities for every individual to participate in a culture which is fully democratized through mass education, expansion of leisure time and cheap records and paperbacks. As Swingewood points out in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:22&lt;/ref&gt; there is no question of domination here anymore. In this view, popular culture does not threaten [[high culture]], but is an authentic expression of the needs of the people.

==Contemporary popular culture studies==
Aside from precursors such as [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Roland Barthes]], popular culture studies as we know them today were developed in the late seventies and the eighties. The first influential works were generally politically left-wing and rejected the "aristocratic" view. However, they also criticized the pessimism of the Frankfurt School: contemporary studies on mass culture accept that, apparently, popular culture forms do respond to widespread needs of the public. They also emphasized the capacity of the consumers to resist indoctrination and passive reception. Finally, they avoided any monolithic concept of mass culture. Instead they tried to describe culture as a whole as a complex formation of [[discourse]]s which correspond to particular interests, and which can be dominated by specific groups, but which also always are dialectically related to their producers and consumers.

An example of this tendency is Andrew Ross's ''No Respect. Intellectuals and Popular Culture'' (1989). His chapter on the history of jazz, blues and rock does not present a linear narrative opposing the authentic [[popular music]] to the commercial record industry, but shows how popular music in the U.S., from the twenties until today, evolved out of complex interactions between [[Popular culture|popular]], [[avant-garde]] and [[commerce|commercial]] circuits, between lower- and middle-class youth, between [[African American|blacks]] and [[whites]].

===Traces of the theory of culture industry===
{{Cleanup|section|date=July 2010}}
Still the traditional views have a long life.&lt;ref&gt;overview based on Clem Robyns, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The theory which has been abandoned most massively is the monolithic, [[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic]] view on the culture industry of the [[Frankfurt School]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}{{Dubious|date=July 2010}} However, it is still hotly debated. The criticism raised can be summarized in three main arguments. First of all, the culture industry theory has completely abandoned the [[Marxist]] [[dialectic]] conception of society. Every impulse, according to this view, comes from above. Resistance and contradiction are impossible, and the audience is manipulated into passivity. Alan Swingewood and others emphasize that the Frankfurt theory has to be seen in the light of left-wing frustrations about the failure of proletarian revolutions early this century, and the easy submission of the European nations to [[fascism]].

A second reproach is that this view may be as elitist as its aristocratic counterpart. Both establish the lonely, autonomous, avant-garde intellectual as the only light in a zombie society. Thus the former Marxists arrive at an uncritical praise of the elitist and antirevolutionary upper-class culture. This brings us to a third argument, already made in the sixties by [[Umberto Eco]].&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In a state-dominated mass society, the lonely, lucid, intellectual [[Übermensch]] can only retreat in his ivory tower. The historicity of the contemporary situation is not taken into account, so its internal contradictions are ignored, and thus revolution can only be seen as purely utopian. The culture industry theory, therefore, would lead to passivity and thereby becomes an objective ally of the system it pretends to criticize.

It is of course mainly the influence exercised by the Frankfurt School which matters here: not all of their texts present the same rigid view. In ''Das Schema der Massenkultur'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno 1973-1986:331&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, Adorno discusses a "nucleus of individuality" that the culture industry cannot manipulate, and which forces him to continuously repeat his manipulation.

However questioned this view on popular culture may be, it still leaves some traces, for instance, in theories depicting [[narrative]] as necessarily ideologically conservative, like Charles Grivel's ''Production de l'intérêt romanesque''.&lt;ref&gt;Grivel 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories see dominant ideology as purely a matter of messages, propagated in this case through the forms of narrative fiction. Thus they easily arrive at an exaltation of experimental literature as necessarily revolutionary. However, they may neglect the fact that the ideology is never simply in the message, but in the position of the message in the general social discourse, and in the position of its producers in the social formation.

Other theories easily yielding to monolithic thought stem from the emancipation movements of oppressed groups. Early [[feminist theory]], for instance, often described society as universally and transhistorically dominated by patriarchy in every aspect of life, thereby presenting a pejorative view of the women they claim to defend. As Andrew Ross&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989&lt;/ref&gt; argues, the same remark goes for the widely accepted account of rock history as a continuous appropriation of [[Afro-American music|black music]] by a white [[music industry]]. Only studies analyzing the cultural oppression of homosexuality seem to take a less deterministic position.

===Contemporary liberal pluralism===
In liberal-pluralist accounts of popular culture, the theorizing on its supposedly liberating, democratizing function is nowadays most often pushed to the background. This type of criticism, often produced by people who are also active in popular literary writing themselves, often amounts to paraphrase and suffers from an uncritical identification with the study object. One of the main aims of this type of criticism is the establishment of ahistorical [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of and within popular genres in the image of legitimized culture. This approach, however, has been accused of [[elitism]] as well.

To put it simply: the [[intellectual]], in this view, can fully enjoy junk culture because of his or her high culture background, but the average reader can never raise to the learned intellectual discourse of which he or she is the object. An example of this form of appropriation is Thomas Roberts's ''An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction'' (1990). Though Roberts claims to take a distance from studies of canonical fiction, he justifies his (implicit) decision to impose canonical models on [[popular fiction]] as follows: "If people who read [[Goethe]] and [[Alessandro Manzoni]] and [[Pushkin]] with pleasure are also reading [[detective fiction]] with pleasure, there is more in the detective story than its critics have recognized, perhaps more than even its writers and readers have recognized",&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates a frequent strategy: the legitimation of popular fiction on the basis of its use of canonized [[literary fiction]], and of the legitimized public's response to it.

If we consider all the views depicted in the present article as instances of both the thesis and the antithesis of an argument, it is a less known scholar, [[Blanca de Lizaur]] who manages to finally produce the synthesis. In the sociological line of Mims and Lerner, she sees Literature as a ''necessary'' social institution -id est: fulfilling an essential social need: That of explaining, justifying and promoting its society's world-view, values, ideas and beliefs, through depicting them "in action" in lyrics and narratives from which we all learn. Not only this: The expression of the feelings that may be expected to accompany depicted actions and events, also constitutes a fundamental part of its social role, as we naturally expect Literature to constructively account for, inform, modulate and educate our feelings. Hence why Literature is present in every human culture, all along history.

Because of its fundamental role and our need for it, Literature will always find its way to, and adapt to the latest technologies and to the furthest reaching distribution channels available. It is also because of this reason that works that successfully represent their audiences' values, ideas and beliefs, and attain commercial success, will at the same time become the subject of unsurmountable pressures -...losing success once power actors manage to substitute their society's message for their own.

De Lizaur, emerging from the field of Literary Studies, also developed a full literary theory that accounts for popular works' aesthetics, strategies, resources, genres, and meaningful criticism, as opposed to ideologized or prejudiced criticism.

===Contemporary apocalyptic thought===
[[Image:MarshallMcLuhan.png|thumb|205px|right|[[Marshall McLuhan]] caused wide irritation with his statement that the traditional, book-oriented intellectuals had become irrelevant for the formulation of cultural rules in the [[electronic age]].]]
Equally alive is the aristocratic apocalyptic view on mass culture as the destruction of genuine art. As Andrew Ross&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt; writes, a history of popular culture is also a history of intellectuals, of cultural experts whose self-assigned task it is to define the borders between the popular and the legitimate. But in contemporary society the dispersed authority is ever more exercised by "technical" intellectuals working for specific purposes and not for mankind. And in the academic world, growing attention for popular and marginal cultures threatens the absolute values on which intellectuals have built their autonomy.

In the sixties, [[Marshall McLuhan]] caused wide irritation with his statement that the traditional, book-oriented intellectuals had become irrelevant for the formulation of cultural rules in the electronic age. This is not to say that they lost any real political power, which humanist intellectuals as such hardly ever had. It does mean, however, that they are losing control of their own field, the field of art, of restricted symbolical production ([[Pierre Bourdieu]]). While in the 19th century, intellectuals managed to construct art as a proper, closed domain in which only the in-crowd was allowed to judge, they have seen this autonomy become ever more threatened by 20th-century mass society. The main factor here was not the quantitative expansion of consumption culture, nor the intrusion of commerce into the field of art through the appearance of paperbacks and [[Book sales club|book clubs]]. After all, protecting art from simplicity and commerce was precisely the task intellectuals set for themselves.

More important is the disappearance of what has been called the [[Metanarrative|"grand narratives"]] during this century, the questioning of all-encompassing world views offering coherent interpretations of the world and unequivocal guides for action. As Jim Collins argues in Uncommon Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1989:2&lt;/ref&gt; there is no master's voice anymore, but only a decentralized assemblage of conflicting voices and institutions. The growing awareness of the historical and cultural variability of moral categories had to be a problem for an intellectual class which had based its position on the defense of secular but transhistorical values.

This brings us to a second problem humanist intellectuals face, that is, the fragmentation of the public. 19th-century intellectuals could still tell themselves that they were either writing for their colleagues, or teaching the undifferentiated masses. 20th-century intellectuals face a heterogeneous whole of groups and media producing their own discourses according to their own logic and interests. Thus they cannot control the reception of their own messages anymore, and thereby see their influence on the structuring of culture threatened. Many neo-apocalyptic intellectuals, such as [[Alain Finkielkraut]] and [[George Steiner]], emphasize their concern about the growing "illiteracy" of the masses. In practice they seem to be mainly concerned with high culture illiteracy, the inability to appreciate difficult art and literary classics.

The neo-aristocratic defense of so-called transhistorical and universal human values may also often be linked to a conservative political project. A return to universal values implies the delegitimation of any group which does not conform to those values. It is no coincidence, therefore, that attempts in the United States to define a common "American cultural legacy" tend to neglect the cultures of ethnic minority groups. Or that the fight against [[franglais]] (French "contaminated" by American English) in France was mainly fought by intellectuals seeing their traditional position in French society threatened by the import of American cultural products, as Clem Robyns&lt;ref&gt;Robyns 1995&lt;/ref&gt; describes.

==Recurring issues in popular culture studies==

===The interactions between popular and legitimized culture===
The blurring of the boundaries between [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]] is one of the main complaints made by traditional intellectuals about contemporary mass society.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, John Edgar. “Horror and the Gothic’s utility as a cultural resource and critical tool.” ''Palgrave Communications'' 4 (2018): 1-4. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-018-0092-x.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of sociological studies on literary institutions which are held responsible for this mix.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Among the first were commercial [[Book sales club|book clubs]], such as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book-of-the-Month-Club]], appearing from the twenties on. The aggressive reactions they provoked are described by [[Janice Radway]]&lt;ref&gt;Radway 1989&lt;/ref&gt; in "The Scandal of the Middlebrow". According to Radway, the book clubs were perceived as scandalous because they blurred some basic distinctions of cultural discourse. In a society haunted by the spectre of cultural standardization and leveling towards below, they dared to put "serious" fiction on the same level as detective stories, adventure stories, biographies and popular nonfiction. Book clubs were scandalous because they created a space where high and low could meet.

Soon, the term "[[middlebrow]]" was introduced to qualify this phenomenon and to dismiss it as a threat to the authenticity of both high and popular culture. After the book clubs came the mass-production of the [[paperback]] format, and its influence was even more wide-ranging. More about this can be found in Thomas Bonn's book.&lt;ref&gt;Bonn 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It shows through what elaborate strategies the respectable hardcover editors had to go in order to hide the fact that, from the sixties on, paperback publishers had taken over the control on the production of serious literature.

===The possibility of a "subversive" popular culture===
The question whether popular culture or mass culture is inherently conservative, or whether it can be used in a [[Subversion (political)|subversive]] strategy as well,&lt;ref&gt;Browning 2018: 3&lt;/ref&gt; is equally hotly debated. It seems widely accepted that popular culture forms can function at any moment as anti-cultures. [[taste (aesthetics)|"Bad taste"]] products such as [[pornography]] and [[horror fiction]], says for instance Andrew Ross,&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:231&lt;/ref&gt; draw their popular appeal precisely from their expressions of disrespect for the imposed lessons of educated taste. They are expressions of social resentment on the part of groups which have been subordinated and excluded by today's "civilized society".

The question whether popular culture can actually resist dominant ideology, or even contribute to social change, is much more difficult to answer. Many critics easily read popular fiction and film as "attacks against the system", neglecting both the exact ways in which the so-called revolutionary message is enacted, and the capacities of dominant doctrines to recuperate critical messages. Tania Modleski in "The Terror of Pleasure",&lt;ref&gt;Modleski 1986:159&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, presents [[Exploitation film|exploitation horror films]] as attacks on the basic aspects of bourgeois culture. Thus a loving father cannibalizes his child, and priests turn into servants of the devil. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Clem Robyns 1991&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, by presenting their [[perversion]] as supernatural, or at least pathological, [[horror film]]s precisely contribute to perpetuating those institutions.

Similarly, many critics exalt stories which feature a lone hero fighting for his ideals against an inert and amoral system. Thus Jim Collins in ''Uncommon Cultures''&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1989:30-31&lt;/ref&gt; sees [[crime fiction]] opposing a smart private detective and an inefficient police force as a critique of state justice. On the other hand, Thomas Roberts demonstrates in ''An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction'',&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1990:173-174&lt;/ref&gt; a study of the historical background of the private detective model, how the detective story came into existence in the middle of the 19th century, at the time the institution of state police was developed. This force consisted mainly of lower-class people, but nevertheless disposed of a certain authority over the upper class. The fears among the upper classes for this uncontrolled force were eased by domesticating the police in stories explicitly devoted to them. Their inability to pass on correct judgment was amply demonstrated, and forced them to bow for the individual intellect of the detective, who always belonged to the threatened upper class.

Finally, Umberto Eco's studies on [[Superman]] and [[James Bond]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1988:211-256, 315-362&lt;/ref&gt; as myths of a static good-and-evil world view should be mentioned as very early and lucid examples of a combination of [[semiotic]] and political analysis.

Still, there may be ways to wage revolt in an age of [[mass media]]. One way could be to introduce small gradual changes in products otherwise conforming to the requirements of a dominant ideology. The problem here, of course, is that isolated messages get drowned in the discourse as a whole, and that they can be used to avoid real changes. Some scholars, however, describe how opposition forces use the logic of the media to subvert them. In ''No Respect'',&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:123&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ross mentions the late sixties [[Yippie]] movement. Yippies would stage media events, such as the public burning of dollar bills in [[Wall Street]], thereby drawing heavy media coverage. This politics of the spectacle brought the [[counterculture]] right into the conservative media and filled their forms with subversive content.

Whether this strategy is effective or not, it points to an important fact: the mass media are not above, but dependent on the public. As Alan Swingewood states in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:84&lt;/ref&gt; the ideological messages the mass media receive are already mediated by a complex network of institutions and discourses. The media, themselves divided over innumerable specific discourses, transform them again. And finally the public meaningfully relates those messages to individual existences through the mediation of social groups, family networks, etc., which they belong to.

'''Prentiss''' (also known as "Wellington", "Indian Point Landing", and "Indian Town") is a [[ghost town]] in [[Bolivar County, Mississippi]].

Once a thriving river port and [[county seat]], Prentiss was destroyed during the [[American Civil War]], and then washed over by the [[Mississippi River]] during the 1870s.

==History==
Official records for Wellington began just after 1800, when a few families settled there on the banks of the Mississippi River.  Following the War of 1812, soldiers returning home by boat from New Orleans stopped at Wellington, and some remained as settlers.

Wellington was only accessible by boat, and settlers occupied land along the shore and inward no more than a mile.  There were no roads east into the dense vegetation and hardwood forest known as "bottomlands".

In 1838, Judge Joseph McGuire—one of the earliest settlers and owner of a plantation next to Wellington—was given a contract to cut a road, and a house was purchased for $500 which became the courthouse.  In 1840, a new courthouse and a jail were constructed.

Wellington was a lively riverport, and supported gambling houses and saloons.

In 1851, three acres of land were purchased from McGuire for $1000 with a right-of-way to the river of {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}.  In 1852, the county records were moved to Wellington, and it became the county seat.

The town was laid out in 1856, and renamed "Prentiss", after [[Seargent Smith Prentiss]], a Congressman from Mississippi and noted orator.

Just prior to the Civil War, Prentiss had several buildings, a racetrack, a good hotel, and a newspaper, the ''Bolivar Times''.  It also had the only ferry crossing of the Mississippi between [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Riley | first = Franklin L. | title = Forgotten Towns &amp; Villages of Bolivar County, Mississippi  | work = Publication of the Mississippi Historical Society | publisher = Genealogy Trails | year = 1902 | url = http://genealogytrails.com/miss/bolivar/extinct_towns.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Old Prentiss: "The Town that died three times" | work = Southern Living Magazine | publisher = Bolivar County Mississippi GenWeb | year = 1969 | url = http://msgw.org/bolivar/citiestownsvillages.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sillers | first = Florence W. | title = The History of the County Seat of Bolivar County | publisher = City of Rosedale, Mississippi | url = http://cityofrosedalems.com/page11.html | accessdate = Sep 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War and destruction===
North of Prentiss, the river followed a sharp curve east into Mississippi along what was then called the "Beulah Bend" (now [[Lake Beulah, Mississippi|Lake Beulah]]).  During the Civil War, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers would move east by foot from [[Napoleon, Arkansas]], hide in a wooded area near the bend, and then fire on passing [[Union Army|Union]] ships.  The bend was so tight that the same cannon could be used on ships as they entered, and then left Beulah Bend.

Following one such ambush in 1863, a Union gunship led by [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] landed at Prentiss and burned the town to the ground.  Just one small building on the outskirts was spared.  Efforts to rebuild began immediately.

Seeking to permanently avoid the ambush point at Beulah Bend, Union commander [[Thomas Oliver Selfridge]] ordered a channel dug across the peninsula around which Beulah Bend flowed.  The soft land and strong river current enabled the "Napoleon Channel" to be cut in just a day.  The Napoleon Channel improved the Mississippi River for shipping, as it removed {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the navigable route.  Unfortunately, the diverted river currents caused by the Napoleon Channel caused both Prentiss and Napoleon to be completely submerged within a few years.&lt;ref name="Lake Beulah"&gt;{{cite web | title = Lake Beulah | publisher = DeltaWildlife.org | url = http://deltawildlife.org/images/file_downloads/lake-beulah.pdf#page=1&amp;zoom=auto,462,612 | accessdate = Sep 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reappearance of ruins===
After decades under water, Prentiss briefly reappeared in 1954 when two hunters spotted chimneys and the side of a brick wall during a period of low water on the Mississippi River.  Other silt-covered buildings were soon discovered, prompting thousands of visitors come to see the new town.  Soon after, high waters on the Mississippi again submerged the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Crider | first = Bill | title = Mississippi River Uncovering Community it Buried Years Ago | publisher = St. Joseph News-Press | date = July 11, 1954 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HRpUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3DkNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=prentiss%20bolivar%20county&amp;pg=5208%2C2223589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sociology}}
'''Rational-legal authority''' (also known as '''rational authority''', '''legal authority''', '''rational domination''', '''legal domination''', or '''bureaucratic authority''') is a form of [[leadership]] in which the [[authority]] of an [[organization]] or a ruling [[regime]] is largely tied to legal [[rationality]], [[Legitimacy (political science)|legal legitimacy]] and [[bureaucracy]]. The majority of the modern [[State (polity)|states]] of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are rational-legal authorities, according to those who use this form of classification.

==Rational-legal authority==
In [[sociology]], the concept of rational-legal domination comes from [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]] (one of several classifications of government used by sociologists); the other two forms being [[traditional authority]] and [[charismatic authority]]. All of those three domination types represent an example of his [[ideal type]] concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition. Charismatic authority is legitimized by the personality and leadership qualities of the ruling individual. Finally, rational-legal authority derives its powers from the system of [[bureaucracy]] and [[legality]].

==Legal rationality and legitimate authority ==
Under rational-legal authority, legitimacy is seen as coming from a legal order and the laws that have been enacted in it (see also [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]]).

Weber defined legal order as a system where the rules are enacted and obeyed as legitimate because they are in line with other laws on how they can be enacted and how they should be obeyed. Further, they are enforced by a government that monopolizes their enactment and the [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|legitimate use of physical force]].

If society, as a whole, approves the exercise of the power in a certain way, then the power is considered "legitimate authority". 
* An example of this type of authority would be the viewing of a police car in our rear view mirrors.

== Max Weber's theory: type of authority ==
Max Weber broke down legitimate authority into three different types of societies: Traditional Authority, Rational-legal Authority, and Charismatic Authority. Each of these authorities have their own unique complex societies that have evolved from simple definitions.

=== 1.Traditional authority: traditional grounds ===

* Is the type of power that has been around longer, it is the type of power that is traditionally rooted in beliefs and the practices of society. This authority is liked by many individuals because of two main reasons: the inheritance of past generations and religiousness that the societies have.
* Traditional authority is based on a tradition or custom that is followed by the traditional leaders. In traditional authority, status is a key concept. There are no requirements to serving a traditional leader but there are no salaries. The consequences to traditional authority are discouragement of education and rational calculation.
* Traditional authority consists of a dominant profile, one who embodies tradition and rule. This type of leadership exemplifies the power to construct order.

=== 2. Rational-legal authority: rational grounds ===

* Acquire from law and is constructed from the reliance of society's rules and laws. This type of authority has the confidence to leave the right of leaders to undertake the decisions and set the policy. Rational-legal authority is the basis of modern democracies. Examples of this type of authority: officials elected by voters, rules that are in the constitution, or policies that are written in a formal document.
* Rational-legal authority is built on a structure of bureaucr
* Rational-legal authority requires a logical and systematic approach to leadership. Weber's rational leadership prevails in decision making.

=== 3. Charismatic authority: charismatic grounds ===

* Comes from individuals and their personal qualities that they have to offer. Certain individuals are influential to others with their unique qualities which help them gain followers. The "charismatic" individuals exercise power and authority over a whole society or even a specific group of within a bigger society. The exercise of their power of these individuals are either for good or bad. Examples of these charismatic leaders can range from: Joan of Arc to Adolf Hitler or Martin Luther king Jr to Jesus Christ.
* Charismatic authority has no clear structure. It is based one's individual influence.  One is chosen to be staff by their charismatic characteristics. Someone under a charismatic authority lives under gifts not salary. As long as someone has influence they will be a legitimate power.
* In charismatic authority, confidence is the driving force for leadership. With charismatic authority leadership has the ability to connect distinct groups and lead them to the finish line.

==Emergence of the modern state==
Weber wrote that the modern state based on rational-legal authority emerged from the patrimonial and feudal struggle for power (see [[traditional authority]]) uniquely in the [[Western culture|Occidental civilization]]. The prerequisites for the modern Western state are:
* Monopolization by central authority of the means of administration and control based on a centralized and stable system of taxation and use of physical force
* Monopolization of legislative
* Organisation of an officialdom, dependent upon the central authority

Weber argued that some of those attributes have existed in various time or places, but together they existed only in Occidental civilization. The conditions that favoured this were
* Emergence of rational-legal rationality (various [[status class|status groups]] in the [[Western world|Occident]] promoted that emergence)
* Emergence of modern officialdom (bureaucracy), which required
** Development of the money economy, where officials are compensated in money instead of kind (usually land grants)
** Quantitative and qualitative expansion of administrative tasks
** Centralization and increased efficiency of administration.

Weber's belief that rational-legal authority did not exist in [[History of China|Imperial China]] has been heavily criticized, and does not have many supporters in the early 21st century.

==Modern state==
According to Max Weber, a modern state exists where a political community has:
* An administrative and legal order that has been created and can be changed by legislation that also determines its role
* Binding authority over citizens and actions in its jurisdiction
* The right to legitimately use the physical force in its jurisdiction

An important attribute of Weber's definition of a modern state was that it is a [[bureaucracy]].

The vast majority of the modern states from the 20th century onward fall under the rational-legal authority category.

==Rational-legal leaders==
The majority of modern [[bureaucrat|bureaucratic officials]] and [[politician|political leaders]] represent this type of authority.

&lt;u&gt;Officials:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are personally free.
* Serve a higher authority.
* Are appointed on the basis of conduct and their technical qualifications.
* Are responsible for the impartial execution of assigned tasks.
* Their work is a full-time occupation.
* Their work is rewarded by a salary and prospects of career advancement.

&lt;u&gt;Politicians:&lt;/u&gt;
* Are solely responsible for independent action.
* Must recognize that public actions that conflict with their basic policy must be rejected.
* Should have [[charismatic authority|charismatic appeal]] to win [[election]]s under conditions of [[universal suffrage]].
&lt;u&gt;Additional, Weber provided ten necessities addressing: "how individual officials are appointed and work". The administrative staff are under the supreme authority for legal authority in a bureaucratic administrative style.&lt;/u&gt;

# They are personally free and subject to authority only with respect to their impersonal official obligation.
# They are organized in a clearly defined hierarchy of offices.
# Each office has a clearly defined sphere of competence in the legal sense.
# The office is filled by a free contractual relationship or free selection.
# Candidates are selected on the basis of technical qualification.
# They are remunerated by fixed salaries in money for the most part, with a right to pensions.
# The office is treated as the sole, or at least primary, occupation of incumbent.
# It constitutes a career. Promotions are dependent on the judgement of superiors.
# The official works entirely separated from ownership of the means of administration and without appropriation of his/her position.
# He is subject to strict and systematic discipline and control in the conduct of the office.

The '''Vyne Ring''' or the '''Ring of Silvianus''' is a gold ring, dating probably from the 4th century, discovered in a ploughed field near [[Silchester]], in Hampshire, England, in 1785.  Originally the property of a British Roman called Silvianus, it was apparently stolen by a person named Senicianus, upon whom Silvianus called down a [[curse]].  

After its discovery in the 18th century, the ring became the property of the Chute family, whose country house was [[The Vyne]], also in Hampshire, now a [[National Trust]] property.  The ring went on display there in April 2013.&lt;ref name=G&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hobbit ring that may have inspired Tolkien put on show|author=Maev Kennedy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/02/hobbit-tolkien-ring-exhibition|work=The Guardian|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, during excavations of the site of the Roman temple of [[Nodens]] at [[Lydney Park]], the archaeologist [[Sir Mortimer Wheeler]] discovered details of the curse. As Wheeler consulted with [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] on the name of the god invoked in the curse, the ring and curse may have inspired the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{cite news|title=Ring that 'inspired' JRR Tolkien to write The Hobbit goes on display|author=Dion Dassanayake|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/388891/Ring-that-inspired-JRR-Tolkien-to-write-The-Hobbit-goes-on-display|work=Express|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description== 
The Ring of Silvianus is larger than most rings, being {{convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and weighing {{convert|12|g|oz|1|abbr=on}}, and was perhaps intended to be worn over a glove.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|title=So bright, so beautiful... precious!

It is set with a square bezel engraved with an image of the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|title=JRR Tolkien ring goes on display at The Vyne exhibition|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-22008746|work=BBC News|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To one side are the letters "VE" and to the other side "NVS", in mirror writing.   When used as a [[signet ring]] to make a seal, the head and script would be raised, and the letters would appear the right way around.  

The band is inscribed with the words "SENICIANE VIVAS IIN DE".  This contains two errors as the "I" has been doubled, leaving no room for the last letter "O".   The inscription should have finished "VIVAS IN DEO" — a common inscription for Roman Christians, meaning "live in God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Charles|title=Christianity in Roman Britain to AD 500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BgkQIcRgNk0C&amp;pg=PA131|accessdate=15 April 2013|year=1981|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520043923|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ring of Silvianus was discovered in 1785 in the field of a farm near Silchester, a town of Roman origins, and the site of many archaeological discoveries.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; It is unknown how the ring came to be located at The Vyne, but it is presumed that the farmer who found the ring sold it to the family, who were known to have an interest in history and antiquities.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  In 1888, the owner of the property, [[Chaloner Chute]], wrote about the ring in a history of the house.&lt;ref name =Independent/&gt; 

In the early 19th century a lead plaque of a type known as a "[[curse tablet]]" or ''defixio'' was discovered at the site of a Roman temple dedicated to the god Nodens at Lydney, [[Gloucestershire]], {{convert|80|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from The Vyne.&lt;ref name=Nemeton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celtnet.org.uk/gods_n/nudd.html|title=Nudd: a Cymric, Brythonic and Irish God, also known as Lludd, Lludd Llaw Ereint, Nuadu, Nuadu Aratlám, Nodons, Nodens, Nudens, Noadatus (The Water Maker, The Spirit of Water)|last1=Evans|first1=Dyfed Lloyd|year=2012|work=Nemeton, The Sacred Grove, Home of the Celtic gods|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque was inscribed with a curse:

::DEVO NODENTI SILVIANVS ANILVM PERDEDIT DEMEDIAM PARTEM DONAVIT NODENTI INTER QVIBVS NOMEN SENICIANI NOLLIS PETMITTAS SANITATEM DONEC PERFERA VSQVE TEMPLVM DENTIS

This translates as

::''For the god Nodens. Silvianus has lost a ring and has donated one half [its worth] to Nodens. Among those named Senicianus permit no good health until it is returned to the temple of Nodens.''&lt;ref name=Nemeton/&gt;

In 1929, the archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler was excavating at the Lydney site and made a connection between the ring bearing the name of Senicianus, and the curse stone bearing the same name.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;  Wheeler called upon Tolkien, as Professor of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] at [[Oxford University]], to investigate the etymology of the name "Nodens" referred to in the curse.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;    

Until recently the Ring of Silvianus remained in the library at The Vyne and was little known, but was placed on display for the first time in April 2013, in its own exhibition, along with a copy of the inscription on the curse tablet.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Association with Tolkien== 
It is hypothesised that Wheeler, in his discussion with Tolkien on the name Nodens on the curse tablet, would also have discussed the ring at The Vyne, with which he was familiar. It is thought that other aspects of the archaeology of the Lydney area, including an [[Iron Age]] [[Lydney_Park#Roman_temple|Roman fort]], may have influenced Tolkien's writings.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; 

The ''One Ring'' plays a central part in ''The Hobbit'' (published 1937) and ''The Lord of the Rings'' (1954).&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  In [[Tolkien's legendarium]], the One Ring was forged by the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] in order to enslave the inhabitants of [[Middle-earth]].

The [[Tolkien Society]] have been associated with setting up the "Ring Room" at Vyne, which includes the Ring of Silvianus in a rotating display case, a first edition of ''The Hobbit'' and a copy of the curse.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;  There is also a Middle-earth adventure playground in the grounds.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; Lynn Forest-Hill of the Tolkien Society expressed pleasure at the discovery of a material source for the One Ring described in Tolkien's novels, stating that all sources previously cited have been literary or legendary, such as the [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring of the Nibelungs]].&lt;ref name=G/&gt;

[[Image:PlazaVázquez.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View of Vázquez de Molina Square, in [[Úbeda]], [[Andalusia]], one of the best examples of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Spain]]

'''Renaissance architecture''' was that style of [[architecture]] which evolved firstly in [[Florence]] and then [[Rome]] and other parts of [[Italy]] as the result of [[Humanism]] and a revived interest in [[Ancient Roman architecture|Classical architecture]]. It was part of the general movement known as the [[Renaissance]] which spread outwards from Italy and affected many aspects of scholarship and the arts.

In [[Spain]], the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] began to be grafted to [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] forms in the last decades of the 15th century.

The style started to spread mainly by local architects: that is the cause of the creation of a specifically Spanish Renaissance, that brought the influence of South Italian architecture, sometimes from illuminated books and paintings, mixed with Gothic tradition and local idiosyncrasy. The new style is called [[Plateresque]], because of the extremely decorated facades, that brought to the mind the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of [[silversmith]]s, the “Plateros”. Classical orders and candelabra motifs (''a candelieri'') combined freely into symmetrical wholes. Examples include the facades of the [[University of Salamanca]] and of the [[Convent of San Marcos, León|Convent of San Marcos]] in [[León, Spain|León]].

As decades passed, the Gothic influence disappeared and the research of an orthodox classicism reached high levels. Although Plateresco is a commonly used term to define most of the architectural production of the late XV and first half of XVI, some architects acquired a more sober personal style, like [[Diego Siloe]], and [[Andrés de Vandelvira]] in Andalusia, and [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] and [[Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón]] in Castile.This phase of Spanish Renaissance is called [[Purism (architecture)|Purism]]. 
 
From the mid 16th century, under such architects as [[Pedro Machuca]], [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] and [[Juan de Herrera]] there was a much closer adherence to the art of ancient Rome, sometimes anticipating [[Mannerism]]. An example of this is the [[palace of Charles V]] in [[Granada]] built by Pedro Machuca. A new style emerged with the work of Juan Bautista de Toledo, and Juan de Herrera in the [[Escorial]]: the [[Herrerian]] style, extremely sober and naked, reached high levels of perfection in the use of granite ashlar work, and influenced the Spanish architecture of both the peninsula and the colonies for over a century.

'''St James House''' is a [[grade II listed]] building in [[Monmouth]], [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]]. It is in the historic [[St James Square, Monmouth|St James Square]] neighbourhood, within the [[Monmouth Town Walls and Defences|Medieval town walls]]. While the house currently has an attractive, 18th-century facade, it originated as a [[burgage]] tenement. In addition, behind the house, evidence of a kiln has been unearthed, with both [[Medieval]] and [[Post-medieval archaeology|Post-medieval]] pottery. In 2010, archaeological excavation in the square revealed the first evidence of [[Monmouth in the Mesolithic period|Mesolithic human settlement in Monmouth]]. Recent residents of St James House have included boarding students from [[Monmouth School]].

"There are some lovely spots in the town centre, none prettier than St James's Square, with its old war memorial in the shadow of a romantic-looking tree." This is the description of St James Square ''(pictured)'' in Monmouth, Wales that appeared in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' of 25 February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City spotlight: Monmouth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/cities/3347952/City-spotlight-Monmouth.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=25 Feb 2006|author=Max Davidson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war memorial mentioned is the [[Monmouth War Memorial]] that was installed in the square in 1921 and was the work of sculptor W. Clarke of [[Llandaff]].&lt;ref name=newman&gt;{{cite book|title=Gwent/Monmouthshire|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn= 9780300096309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knRf4U60QjcC&amp;pg=PA408&amp;lpg=PA408&amp;dq=Old+Nag's+Head+tower+in+Monmouth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1zMDTKNOco&amp;sig=yTn_DWXgO7q-kM-HUdPTH0cLZOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TeOqT-yRGYag8QSqqMmyBg&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=John Newman|edition=illustrated|accessdate=26 May 2012|page=408|date=11 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "romantic-looking tree" is a reference to the [[Catalpa bignonioides|Catalpa]] or [[The Indian Bean Tree, St James' Square, Monmouth|Indian Bean Tree]] that was planted on the square in about 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council v Council in Catalpa Tree Clash|url=http://www.hackersons.co.uk/monmouth/Features/feature4.php|work=hackersons.co.uk|publisher=Monmouth Community|accessdate=26 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408224928/http://www.hackersons.co.uk/monmouth/Features/feature4.php|archivedate=8 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St James House ''(pictured)'' is located at the eastern end of [[Whitecross Street, Monmouth|Whitecross Street]], where it terminates at the [[roundabout]] encircling the triangular St James Square. The building is positioned on the north side of the square, across from [[33 Whitecross Street, Monmouth|33 Whitecross Street]] ''(pictured)'', the site of archaeological excavation in 2009.&lt;ref name=newman/&gt;&lt;ref name=county&gt;{{cite web|title=monmouthshire sir fynwy|url=http://idox.monmouthshire.gov.uk/WAM/findCaseFile.do?address=33+Whitecross+Street&amp;appType=Planning&amp;action3=Search|work=idox.monmouthshire.gov.uk|publisher=Monmouthshire County Council|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; St James House lies within the Medieval town walls which were built around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monnow Bridge|url=http://www.cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk/arch/query/page.php?watprn=GGAT01256g&amp;dbname=ggat&amp;tbname=core|work=cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk|publisher=The Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Environment Record|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Map of Monmouth|url=http://www.monmouth.org.uk/index.php/visitors/geography/virtual-monmouth-map.html|work=monmouth.org.uk|publisher=The Monmouth Website|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 1610 map of Monmouth ''(pictured below)'' by [[cartographer]] [[John Speed]], the area which served as the site for St James House is depicted adjacent to the label for the [[Monmouth Town Walls and Defences|East Gate (Dixton Gate)]]. However, as discussed by author William Meyler Warlow, the square, as well as the road south of it, including the future [[St James Street, Monmouth|St James Street]] and Almshouse Street, were all considered to be part of Whitecross Street during the early 17th century. A white cross, which gave its name to the street, stood in the square ''(see map)''.&lt;ref name=wmw&gt;{{cite book|title=A history of the charities of William Jones (founder of the "Golden lectureship" in London), at Monmouth &amp; Newland|year=1899|publisher=W.

==Design and burgage history==

St James House was grade II listed on 27 June 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. James's House, Monmouth|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-2324-st-james-s-house-monmouth|work=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[listed building]] has an 18th-century facade with a three-storey, five-bay elevation. The exterior is red brick, highlighted by light-colored, raised stone [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] which serve as the [[cornerstones]] of the walls, contrasting with the brick.&lt;ref name=coflein&gt;{{cite web|title=St. James Square, 10, Monmouth; St. James House|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/20782/details/ST.+JAMES+SQUARE%2C+10%2C+MONMOUTH%3BST.+JAMES+HOUSE/|work=coflein.gov.uk|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decorative [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]] of similar material are atop all of the windows except one, which is lugged and scrolled.&lt;ref name=newman/&gt; The bays on the ground and first floors are rectangular, while those on the uppermost floor are square. The exception is the tall, centre window on the first floor which is round-headed.&lt;ref name=newman/&gt; The centrally-positioned entrance features a wood [[portico]] supported by [[Doric order|Doric]] columns. A [[fanlight]] is present above the door.&lt;ref name=coflein/&gt;  The roof is flared and [[Hip roof|hipped]]. The interior has a small amount of 17th-century plasterwork.&lt;ref name=newman/&gt;

St James House is considered to be a good representation of the [[burgage]] tenements that were common during Medieval times ''(link to glossary below)''. Its origins as a burgage are most evident at the rear of the property. The current, 18th-century facade was a later addition.&lt;ref name=monmouth&gt;{{cite web|title=Walking in Monmouth, Monmouthshire and The Wye Valley|url=http://www.monmouth.org.uk/index.php/leisure/walking/63-walking-monmouth.html|work=monmouth.org.uk|publisher=The Monmouth Website|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burgage tenements were rental properties that were often long and narrow plots of land, particularly in towns where frontage property along a street was at a premium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wiltshire Community History|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=216|work=history.wiltshire.gov.uk|publisher=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gable]] (narrow) end of a house on a burgage plot usually faced the street. The classical style was in vogue during the 18th century, the consequence of which was that many burgage houses received new brick facades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic towns and built form|url=http://www.hertslink.org/buildingfutures/designs/16950385/16954312/|work=hertslink.org|publisher=Hertfordshire&amp;nbsp;– Building Futures|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case with St James House.&lt;ref name=monmouth/&gt;

==Archaeology==

Important archaeological finds have been excavated both at St James House and its neighbourhood. Behind St James House, evidence of a Post-medieval [[pottery]] kiln has been unearthed.&lt;ref name=monmouth/&gt; The kiln at St James House produced Welsh Borderland ceramics of the A7d type. Other Monmouthshire 17th-century kilns which produced this pottery included [[Abergavenny]] and Trefaldu at [[Cwmcarvan]]. A few sources of A7d pottery have been located outside of Monmouthshire as well, including [[Herefordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=17th century kilns (post-medieval Welsh Borderland wares)|url=http://www.woolhopeclub.org.uk/PotteryFabricA7d.html|work=woolhopeclub.org.uk|publisher=Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club, Herefordshire|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a base [[sherd]] of Spanish ware excavated by Socket in 1956 at St James House was found to be Medieval, of the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Medieval Ceramics|url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/planningdocument/cont621999.pdf|work=newport.gov.uk|publisher=Newport|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2010, the ''[[BBC News]]'' reported that during the course of gas main replacement work at St James Square and Wyebridge Street, [[Mesolithic]] era artefacts, including [[Stone tool|flints]], were excavated ''(link to photograph of flints below)''.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Items found in Monmouth shed light on Mesolithic man|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11710978|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Sion Morgan of the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' which also ran on 8 Nov 2010 in ''[[Wales Online]]'' suggested that similar artefacts were found in St James Street as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monmouth’s meeting the ancestors from more than 10,000 years ago|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/11/08/monmouth-s-meeting-the-ancestors-from-more-than-10-000-years-ago-91466-27617554/|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=Wales Online|date=8 Nov 2010|author=Sion Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represented the first discovery of Mesolithic human settlement in Monmouth.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Residents of St James House==

In 1891, Chippenham House, a grade II listed building at 102 [[Monnow Street]], was home to surgeon Thomas Gilbert Prosser (1856–1932), a native of Monmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prosser|first=Thomas G|title=1891 Wales Census|work=ancestry.com|publisher=Census Returns of England and Wales, 1891.

Later, St James House served as a junior boarding house for boys ages ten to thirteen at Monmouth School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Facts&amp;nbsp;– Boarding Houses|url=http://www.habs-monmouth.org/en/keyfacts|work=habs-monmouth.org|publisher=Haberdashers' Monmouth Schhools|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A J Jones was a housemaster at the St James House location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monmouth School St James House Boarders' Handbook|url=http://www.monmouthschool.org/assets/media/web/0/21509.pdf|work=monmouthschool.org|publisher=Monmouth School|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heart Project, a substantial renovation of Monmouth School, was undertaken in early 2011. As part of the first phase of that project, St James House was sold and its boarders were transferred to [[Chapel House, Monmouth|Chapel House]], on the northern segment of [[Monk Street, Monmouth|Monk Street]], in September 2011. The first phase also included redevelopment of [[The Grange, Monmouth|The Grange]] from a prep school to a [[sixth form]] boarding house, which also opened in September 2011.

=== Horki-2013 ===
An ethnographic expedition to [[Horki Raion|Horki district]] [[Mahiloŭ Voblast|Mahiloŭ region]] was organised from 5 to 23 August 2013. During the expedition, a vast collection of audio-visual materials (about 500 songs and its variants) was gathered and local textile and other crafts were analysed. The major part of [[Horki Raion|Horki district]] was covered by the expedition. In addition, a solid analysis of the border area of [[Krasninsky District, Smolensk Oblast|Kraśninski district]] [[Smolensk Oblast|Smalensk region]] (Russia) was carried out. In Russia the work was conducted in cooperation with the culture department of [[Krasninsky District, Smolensk Oblast|Kraśninski district]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smalensk.org/?p=1006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partners ==
Students' Ethnographic Association collaborates with various scientific, research and educational institutions of Belarus, including the Scientific and Educational Centre of the [[Maxim Tank Belarusian State Pedagogical University|Belarusian State Pedagogical University]], Institute of Art, Ethnography and Folklore of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Belarus]], Belarusian Institute of Problems of Culture, Belarusian State Museum of Folk Architecture and Rural Lifestyle, cultural institutions in Belarusian regions, as well as youth organisations and folk groups from [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Estonia]] and [[Sweden]].

[[File:TheSimpsons.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Simpsons'' title screen as of 2009]]
'''The opening sequence of the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''''' is among the popularized opening sequences in television and goes along with one of television's most recognizable theme songs. The first episode to use this intro was the series' second episode "[[Bart the Genius]]".

The standard opening has had two major revisions. The first was at the start of the second season when the entire sequence was reanimated to improve the quality and certain shots were changed generally to add characters who had been established in the first season. The second was a brand-new opening sequence produced in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] for the show's transition to that format beginning with "[[Take My Life, Please]]" in [[The Simpsons (season 20)|season 20]]. The new opening generally followed the sequence of the original opening with improved graphics, even more characters, and new jokes.

==The sequence==

===1990===
This sequence opens with the show's title in yellow approaching the camera through misty [[cumulus cloud]]s&lt;ref name="Lichter2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin Lichter|title=Trail Tested: A Thru-Hiker's Guide to Ultralight Hiking and Backpacking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QJpF-nmD2wC&amp;pg=RA1-PT111|date=21 May 2013|publisher=FalconGuides|isbn=978-0-7627-8783-8|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a dark blue sky. The shot cuts through the counter in the letter "P" to an establishing shot of the town of Springfield.

The camera zooms in through the town and then through a window of a [[lavender (color)|lavender]] Springfield Elementary, where [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is [[chalkboard gag|writing lines on the class chalkboard as a punishment]]. When the school bell rings, Bart leaves in a hurry and skateboards out of the school doors.

The shot cuts to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] working at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant wearing a safety mask while handling a glowing [[green]] rod of [[uranium]] with tongs. An unknown co-worker in the background eats a sandwich with a pair of tongs. The end-of-shift whistle blows, and Homer immediately takes off his mask and drops the tongs to leave work. As he does so, the uranium rod bounces into the air and falls down the back of his radiation suit.

The next shot shows [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] checking out at a supermarket. Maggie, who is sitting on the conveyor belt, is inadvertently scanned along with the groceries as Marge reads a magazine, "Mom Monthly". Maggie is rung up at a price of $847.63 (representing the monthly cost of raising a child at the time) and bagged. As Marge looks around panicked for her child, Maggie pops out of a shopping bag sucking her pacifier, and Marge breaths a sigh of relief, leaving the supermarket.

[[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] is shown next at band practice. The opening theme coordinates with this shot, and is orchestrated as if it were played by the school band. [[Mr. Largo]] stops the rest of the band to order Lisa out of the rehearsal for her unorthodox saxophone playing. She continues to improvise on her way out of the room to grab her [[bike]].

Shots of the family on their way home to [[742 Evergreen Terrace]] are then shown. Homer drives in his car (whose steering wheel's spokes were then shown until 2009 when they were removed), feeling something down the back of his shirt. He retrieves the uranium rod and throws it out the window. As it bounces off the curb near Moe's Tavern, Bart skateboards by, noticing a bank of televisions in a store window he passes showing [[Krusty the Clown]]; he then passes a bus stop and steals the "bus stop" sign. The five unknown unnamed characters waiting at the stop then chase after a bus that fails to stop for them.

As soon as Bart crosses the road, a car drives past and Maggie is seen inside at the steering wheel; but when the camera zooms out, her wheel is revealed to be a children's toy and Marge is actually the one driving with Maggie mimicking Marge's movements as Marge and Maggie both honk their horns. Lisa is shown biking down the street with her books tied in the front basket and her saxophone case at the back. As she hits a bump, the books fly upwards but are restrained by the strap.

She passes a tree and arrives at home. She hops off her bike on the driveway and grabs her books and saxophone, all while the bike continues to roll unaided into the garage. She runs towards the front door as Homer drives up the driveway, parking his car in front of the garage. Bart bounces his skateboard off the roof of the car and then touches down and skates to the front door. As Homer steps out of the car, he screams at the sight of Marge's car coming towards him. The shot cuts to Marge's point of view as Homer runs from the car into the house through a door in the garage. Upon entering their house, they speed from different directions towards the living room couch, segueing into the [[couch gag]]. After the gag, the television displays the executive producer credits.

Notably in "Bart the Genius", the famous high-pitched scream of Homer's when he runs from Marge's car into the house is cut. The scream is added in the third episode, "[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]".

The TV version of this opening has the caption "In Stereo Where Available".

===1990–2009===
For the second season, the original opening was reanimated. Most shots were very closely copied (with some shots, such as Homer's first shot) appearing to be traced. The coloring was changed on most shots, and the characters and animation cleaned up.

Some scenes were replaced or modified: In Bart's chalkboard gag, the school is now orange with purple accents instead of lavender. In Homer's first shot at the power plant, [[Mr. Burns]] and [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] study certain plans in the background in place of the unknown co-worker. When the end-of-shift whistle blows, Mr. Burns checks his wristwatch to see if it is working.

When Bart skateboards down the sidewalk, the scenery is different, the bank of televisions is changed and shorter, and Bart no longer notices them. Instead, he weaves in between a series of secondary characters who crowd the sidewalk. This segment is notably shorter than the original bus-stop segment.

Lisa's bike ride is cut, and instead, upon Marge and Maggie honking their horns, there is a "whip-pan" across the town, featuring a significant number of secondary characters, towards the Simpsons' house. Instead of Lisa arriving first, Homer arrives first. Bart then lands his skateboard on top of Homer's car and onto the tarmac towards the front door. Homer steps out and has to dodge Lisa on her bike (saying "[[D'oh!]]") after he gets out of his car as she cycles up the driveway, following Bart. Finally, the last shot of the family television features a totally different design for the television, which has a more retro look than Season 1's.

===2009–present===
[[File:SimpsonsOpenComp2.png|400px|thumb|A digital collage comparing the original and high-definition versions of the opening sequence.]]
A new permanent opening sequence was animated for the show's transition to the [[High-definition television|High Definition]] format, premiering with the Season 20 episode "[[Take My Life, Please]]." This sequence is similar to the previous one, but features many visual changes that take advantage of the wider format.

The sequence opens as usual with movement through cumulus clouds, while a [[Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish|3-eyed crow]] flies by. The crow is sometimes replaced by characters, like [[Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious|Shary Bobbins]] flying by using her umbrella, or also the [[Planet Express Ship]] from ''[[Futurama]]''. The camera then zooms past the nuclear power plant and into the town square where [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]] and [[Kearney Zxyzwicz|Kearney]] saw off the head of the statue of Jebediah Springfield (a callback to "[[The Telltale Head]]") which falls onto the head of [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] , who is holding an ice cream cone. As it falls on him, he inadvertently tosses the cone into the statue's eye. The camera then weaves through several buildings and structures, featuring a "billboard gag" towards Springfield Elementary and zooms through the familiar window where Bart writes lines as punishment on the chalkboard. The bell rings and Bart skateboards out of the school doors, plowing into a pile of leaves raked up by [[Groundskeeper Willie]] and exposing [[Barney Gumble|Barney]] underneath as he belches.

Homer is shown leaving the power plant and, as in the previous opening sequences, the green uranium bar falls into his clothing as he leaves. This time, in the background of this scene, [[Lenny and Carl#Lenny Leonard|Lenny Leonard]] is standing on a ladder trying to change the "days without an accident sign" from 2 to 3 days but then falls off the ladder onto [[Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson|Carl Carlson]] who is securing the bottom of the ladder. The scene changes to Marge at the supermarket check out. Among the products Marge is buying is [[E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)|Tomacco juice]] and [[In Marge We Trust|Mr. Sparkle detergent]]. Maggie is scanned, and the price doubles from $243.26 to $486.52, before she is put in the shopping cart. When Maggie pops her head out of the paper bag, Marge looks relatively calm and does not panic, unlike in the previous sequences. Maggie shakes her fist at [[Baby Gerald]], who is beside her in another shopping cart. In band practice, [[Mr. Largo]] dismisses Lisa, who plays a solo as she leaves and then pokes her head back in the door to finish it. One notable difference from the previous opening sequence is [[Sherri and Terri]], who are [[texting]] messages instead of playing their flutes.

Homer is then shown driving home and discards the stuck uranium bar out the window; it lands in [[Otto Mann]]'s lap and he eats it. Bart skateboards past Otto before weaving through several townspeople: a machete-swinging [[Sideshow Bob]], [[Helen Lovejoy]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] and his octuplets, [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]], [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Disco Stu]], the [[Crazy Cat Lady]], the [[Rich Texan]] and [[Chief Wiggum]], who shakes his [[Baton (law enforcement)#Blackjack|baton]] at Bart as Bart crosses the road. [[Hans Moleman]] pokes his head out from a [[manhole]], which slams down on him when Marge drives over it in her car. Marge is now driving an orange station wagon instead of a red sedan. Maggie is shown in a booster seat in the middle while [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] sleeps next to her. When Marge and Maggie honk their respective horns, Grampa is startled awake and his [[dentures]] fall out.

The camera then pans across Springfield and then cuts to the driveway scene. Unlike the other two opening sequences, Marge's car now hits Homer and carries him on the hood until it stops short, flinging him ahead to smash a Homer-shaped hole through the door. The Simpsons run into the living room and a [[couch gag]] is shown, before the credits are displayed on a new widescreen [[Flat panel display|flat panel television]].

Sometimes, the [[Flat panel display|flat panel television]] falls to the floor and breaks, but unlike "[[Bart Gets a Z]]", the episode will begin then anyway.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4682314/The-Simpsons-opening-sequence-changes.html
| title="The Simpsons" opening sequence changes|last=Leonard|first=Tom|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2009-02-17|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 500th episode, the opening sequence was a montage of all previous couch gags.

==Development and variations==
Creator [[Matt Groening]] developed a lengthy opening sequence for the first season of ''The Simpsons'', in order to cut down on the animation necessary for each episode, but devised the two gags as compensation for the repeated material each week.&lt;ref name="GroeningGenius"&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2001|title=Commentary for "Bart the Genius", in The Simpsons: The Complete First Season| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first of the original gags, the camera zooms in on Springfield Elementary School, where Bart can be seen writing a message on the chalkboard. This message, which changes from episode to episode, has become known as the "chalkboard gag".{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=71}} The other gag is known as a "couch gag", in which a twist of events occur when the family meets to sit on their couch and watch television.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=71}} Groening, who had not paid much attention to television since his own childhood, was unaware that title sequences of such length were uncommon by that time.&lt;ref name="GroeningGenius"/&gt; The episode "[[Bart the Genius]]" was the first to feature the series' full title sequence.&lt;ref name="GroeningGenius"/&gt; The [[The Simpsons Theme|theme]], which plays over the sequence, was composed by [[Danny Elfman]] in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro-style theme. The piece, which took two days to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.&lt;ref name="elfman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html|title=Danny Elfman in the L.A.

The [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[Bart Gets an "F"]]" featured a revised opening sequence, which was shortened by fifteen seconds from its original length of roughly 1&amp;nbsp;minute, 30&amp;nbsp;seconds. The opening sequence for the first season showed Bart stealing a "Bus Stop" sign; whilst the new sequence featured him skateboarding past several characters who had been introduced during the previous season. Starting with this season, there were three versions of the opening: a full roughly 1&amp;nbsp;minute 15&amp;nbsp;second long version, a 45&amp;nbsp;second version and a 25&amp;nbsp;second version. This gave the show's editors more leeway.&lt;ref name="Silverman"&gt;Silverman, David. (2002). Commentary for "Bart Gets an F", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Take My Life, Please]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 20)|season 20]]) was the first episode of ''The Simpsons'' to air in [[720p]] [[high-definition television]], though not the first time ''The Simpsons'' appeared in high-definition, as ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' was rendered in HD.&lt;ref name="FF"/&gt; This episode was the first to feature the new opening sequence.&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&amp;mo=2&amp;d=10|title=Primetime Listings (February 8 - February 14)|accessdate=2009-01-24|date=2009-01-23|publisher=FoxFlash|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201143538/http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&amp;mo=2&amp;d=10|archivedate=2009-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first major permanent change to the show's introduction since the opening added in season two; previous changes have included variations in the duration of the intro, and special one-shot introductions for the ''[[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' Halloween episodes, as well as a handful of others. This new intro also includes some [[3D computer graphics|3D]] animation when the camera pans over [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/02/sundays_simpsons_goes_hd_updat.php|title=Sunday's 'Simpsons' Goes HD, Updates Title Sequence|first=Josef|last=Adalian|work=TVWeek|date=February 12, 2009|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdtvtotal.com/module-pagesetter-viewpub-tid-1-pid-1297.html |title="The Simpsons" now in high-def and new adequate intro |publisher=HDTV Total |date= |accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] told the ''[[New York Post]]'': "The clouds at the very beginning of the main title were always unsatisfying to me. My original direction to the animators was to make the clouds as realistic as possible, and as we go through the clouds we enter this cartoon universe of ''The Simpsons''. Finally, after a couple of decades, they've gotten closer to what I had in my mind. Not perfect, but better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/02222009/entertainment/movies/q_a__matt_groening_156410.htm |title=Q&amp;A: MATT GROENING&amp;nbsp;— New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2009-02-22 |accessdate=2009-03-22 | first=Larry | last=Getlen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two original variations were further expanded to these variations:
* Something different goes across the screen at the clouds (since 2009).
* The billboard in front of the elementary school changes (since 2009).
* [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] writes something different on the chalkboard in every episode.
* [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] may play a different solo on her [[saxophone]] (or on a different instrument entirely), since 2009.
* Homer's scream changes as he dodges Marge (first two seasons only)
* The Simpson family [[Couch gag|attempt to sit on the couch]] as something goes awry in an often [[surrealism|surreal]] manner.
* In the 2009 intro, Ralph says a different word when the head of Jebediah Springfield falls on him. ( Season 20-22 )

===Billboard gag===

The billboard gag is a [[running gag|running visual joke]] added to the opening sequence with the updated 2009 high-definition opening. In the gag, a billboard is seen on the roof of the building across the street from the elementary school as the camera pans through the town. The billboard changes every episode. The first episode with a billboard gag was "[[Take My Life, Please]]" where the billboard says "Krusty: Now Doing Funerals". &lt;!--Please note that not every gag needs to be listed here. That's what The Simpsons Archive is for.--&gt;

===Chalkboard gag===
The chalkboard gag is a running visual joke that occurs during the opening credits of many episodes. In this gag, [[Bart Simpson]] is writing [[lines (punishment)|lines]] on the [[chalkboard]] as a punishment; when the school bell rings, he immediately stops writing and runs out of the classroom. The phrase he writes on the chalkboard changes from episode to episode.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=71}} Chalkboard messages may involve political humor such as "The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] does not cover burping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Lemon of Troy|episodelink=Lemon of Troy|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Brent Forrester|Forrester, Brent]]; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1995-05-14|season=06|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[popular culture|pop culture]] references such as "I can't see dead people" (''[[The Sixth Sense]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Take My Wife, Sleaze|episodelink=Take My Wife, Sleaze|series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; [[Neil Affleck|Affleck, Neil]]|network=Fox |airdate=1999-11-28|season=11|number=08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "I was not the sixth [[Beatle]]", the ''[[Invader Zim]]'' pilot with Dib, and [[meta-reference]]s such as "I am not a 32-year-old woman" (in reference to Bart's voice actress [[Nancy Cartwright]]) and "Nobody reads these anymore". When possible, Bart is shown deliberately disobeying the line that he is writing on the chalkboard (e.g. squeaking chalk when asked to write "I will not squeak chalk", putting in [[ditto mark]]s for "I will not cut corners", showing dis-coordination with "coffee is not for kids", or putting "I will finish what I sta" for a single line). {{sfn|Turner|2004|p=71}} In ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', the gag, "I will not illegally download this movie", is a reference to [[copyright infringement|piracy]]. The animators are able to produce the chalkboard gags quickly and in some cases have changed them to fit current events. For example, the chalkboard gag for "[[Homer the Heretic]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1992) read, "I will not defame [[New Orleans]]." The gag had been written as an apology to the city for a controversial song in [[A Streetcar Named Marge|the previous week's episode]], which called the city a "home of pirates, drunks and whores".&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, Jeff (2004). "The Cajun Controversy", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bart chalks up apology for New Orleans song|date=1992-10-08|page=A1|publisher=[[The Times-Picayune]]|author=Lorando, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such chalkboard line gave the creators stance on the threats made towards another popular animated sitcom, ''[[South Park]]'', by the group Revolution Muslim, following the controversies with the episodes [[200 (South Park)|200]] and [[201 (South Park)|201]] and the depictions of Muslim prophet [[Mohammed]] (South Park- We'd stand beside you if we weren't so scared). Many episodes do not feature a chalkboard gag because they are cut to make more room for story, plot development and advertisements. In "[[Four Regrettings and a Funeral]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 25)|season 25]], 2013), Bart writes "We'll really miss you Mrs. K" only once, in tribute to the recent death of [[Marcia Wallace]], the voice of [[Edna Krabappel]]. In the [[Havana Wild Weekend|first episode to air after]] [[Donald Trump]] won the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election]] in 2016, Bart writes "Being right sucks", a reference to the 2000 episode "[[Bart to the Future]]" where Lisa succeeds Trump as Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/barts-not-happy-simpsons-predicted-trumps-win.html|title=In ''Simpsons'' Opening Credits, Bart Is Feeling the Pain of Predicting Donald Trump’s Win|first=Tolly|last=Wright|date=November 14, 2016|work=Vulture|publisher=New York Media LLC|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lisa's solo===
During the opening sequence, Lisa is seen being ejected from band rehearsal due to her non-conformist saxophone playing. She exits the room playing a saxophone solo, which sometimes changes. Some of the solos have similarities with pieces by [[Donovan]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[James Brown]], and [[Charlie Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick  |last=Francis |coauthors= |title=20 things you dohn't know about Homer &amp; co&amp;nbsp;—Simpsons week, day 2 |page=26 |date=2007-07-24|work=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' composer [[Alf Clausen]] said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at the second grade level and instead "think of Lisa as a really good player".&lt;ref name="Sax and Single"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sax and the Single Simpson|author=Rhodes, Joe|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=1991-07-26|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,314958,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa plays the [[baritone saxophone]], but according to Matt Groening, "she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show."&lt;ref name="Saxophone"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Sax Craze, Inspired by 'The Simpsons'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/weekinreview/january-7-13-a-sax-craze-inspired-by-the-simpsons.html|work=The New York Times|date=1996-01-14|accessdate=2010-03-12|author=Barron, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the switch to HD production, Lisa has also occasionally performed her solo on an instrument other than the saxophone. As of Season 20 to 29, she has played a [[trumpet]], [[violin]] or [[fiddle]], [[tuba]], [[baritone horn]], [[clarinet]], [[theremin]], and [[harp]]. In this last instance, she drags the instrument with her and continues playing once Mr. Largo orders her out of the room. Whenever she plays a different instrument, she takes it with her while riding home on her bike.

===Couch gag===

{{See also|List of The Simpsons couch gags}}

The "couch gag" is a [[running gag|running visual joke]] near the end of the opening credits. The gag generally changes from episode to episode, and usually features the Simpson family's [[living room]] [[couch]]. A typical gag features the Simpson family running into the living room, only to find some abnormality with the couch, be it a bizarre and unexpected occupant, an odd placement of the couch, such as on the ceiling, or any number of other situations.

In the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version for the episodes from seasons 1 to 5, the couch gag for the episode is usually replaced with the one from season five's "[[Rosebud (The Simpsons)|Rosebud]]" where The Simpsons find an exact double of themselves on the couch (though the syndicated versions of the later episodes retain their original couch gags).

The couch gag is frequently used to make the show longer or shorter, depending on the length of the episode itself. For example, longer couch gags have been used to fill time in shorter episodes, such as in "[[Lisa's First Word]]" and "[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]"&lt;ref name="reiss"&gt;{{cite video|people= Reiss, Mike|date=2004|title=The Simpsons, The Complete Fourth Season audio commentary for the episode "The Front"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Cape Feare]]".&lt;ref name="jean"&gt;Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for "Cape Feare", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; An extended couch gag was also seen in the first episode to use the new opening sequence, "[[Take My Life, Please]]", where the family chases their couch on a tour across the world. Another long couch gag was in the show's 500th episode "[[At Long Last Leave]]," showing a montage of previous couch gags.

==Other versions==

===Live action===
In 2006, the British television channel [[Sky 1]] began advertising ''The Simpsons'' using a [[live-action]] recreation of the series' opening sequence directed by Chris Palmer. Except for the very first shot in which the logo appears out of the clouds, every piece of the opening is present in this version, with even multiple chalkboard and couch gags filmed. Attached to the end of this sequence is the message "Come home to ''The Simpsons'' on Sky One."&lt;ref name="real life"&gt;{{cite web|last=Macleod|first=Duncan|title=The Simpsons on Sky One|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2006/the-simpsons-on-sky-one|work=The Inspiration Room|accessdate=October 10, 2011|date=March 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recreation was used instead of the regular opening titles in the [[The Simpsons (season 17)|season 17]] episode "[[Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife]]", first broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on March 26, 2006.&lt;ref name=Willow&gt;{{cite news|last=Willow|first=Molly|title='Simpsons' gig fulfills dream for funny Brit|newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|date=2006-03-26|page=01D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The live-action opening had also become an Internet hit before it was aired in front of "Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife", and it was Groening's decision to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People for 'Simpsons'|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=2006-03-26|page=091}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jean]] commented in a press statement that he was "just amazed there are people who want to be known for looking like the Simpsons."&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{cite news|title='The Simpsons' to get the Brit treatment|date=2006-03-25|author=UPI NewsTrack Stories|publisher=United Press International (UPI) NewsTrack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christmas===

A Christmas-themed version was animated for "[[Kill Gil, Volumes I &amp; II]]" and later re-aired with "[[The Burns and the Bees]]". It begins with two lines of instrumental "O Christmas Tree" and then the normal theme music begins. This version is similar to the normal version, except for several key differences:

# Everything outside is covered with snow
# Bart's skateboard has been replaced with a snowboard
# Everyone is wearing winter attire
# Mr. Burns and Smithers have been replaced by a [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]]-esque Burns and Ghost of [[Jacob Marley|Marley]]-esque Smithers, and there are several Christmas banners in the plant
# Lisa's saxophone solo is a jazz version of "Deck the Halls"
# Bleeding Gums Murphy, who is now deceased, has been replaced with Jasper in a Santa costume. Maude Flanders, however, remains in the pan across Springfield, despite having also died.
# Marge and Maggie's supermarket and car sequence have been cut

In the end, the couch gag is that the family sits on the couch and the camera then pulls out to reveal that the family was reflected in a Christmas ornament, which rests on a Christmas tree.

====2nd Version====
Another Christmas version of the opening titles appeared in "[[White Christmas Blues]]".

===''The Simpsons Movie'' and callback===
[[File:The Simpsons Movie Opening Credits.ogg|thumbtime=5|thumb|300px|The scene from the opening credit sequence of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'']]

A completely different sequence was created for ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' and features an orchestrated version of "The Simpsons Theme" as adapted by Hans Zimmer. The cumulus clouds are displayed in 16:9 television aspect ratio, with black matte bars at either end of the screen. As "The Simpsons" logo appears out of the clouds, [[Professor Frink]] flies past in one of his inventions carrying a banner marked "MOVIE" and proclaims "Moo-vie! On the big screen!" (On the movie's DVD menu he says, "On the small screen!" when the menu appears, but then "On the big screen" during the actual opening sequence.) Frink bumps one of the matte bars out of view, and the other one recedes as the camera zooms in on the town, with several major landmarks popping up. The scene changes to [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]], who collapses under the extra weight of the toothpaste on his toothbrush, which is dispensed by [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]]. The camera then zooms past [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Moe's Tavern|Moe's Tavern]] into the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] where [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] is secretly changing the expiration date on a carton of milk from 2006 to 2008. The camera cuts to Springfield Elementary where Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney are hoisting [[Martin Prince]] up a flagpole by his underwear and saluting it as if it were a flag. The camera then zooms through a window of the school where [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is doing the chalkboard gag which is "I will not illegally download this movie", a reference to [[copyright infringement|piracy]] before quick-fading to [[Green Day]] who are hosting a concert at Lake Springfield, playing their rendition of "[[The Simpsons Theme]]".

"[[He Loves to Fly and He D'ohs]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]]) was the first new episode to air following the release of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', and the episode's opening sequence is a [[Callback (comedy)|callback]] to the film.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite news | author = Edward Douglas | title = The Future of The Simpsons? | publisher = Comingsoon.net | date = 2007-07-20 | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=22267 | accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bart writes "I will not wait 20 years to make another movie" on the chalkboard and skateboards through Springfield, which is still recovering from the dome incident. Several movie characters reappear, including president [[Schwarzenegger]], the Multi-Eyed Squirrel, Colin, Russ Cargill, and the Medicine Woman.&lt;ref name="Canning"&gt;{{cite news | author = Robert Canning | title = The Simpsons: "He Loves to Fly and He D'Ohs" Advance Review | publisher = IGN | date = 2007-09-21 | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/821/821930p1.html | accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; We also see that the Simpsons' house is still under construction and the silo is strapped to Homer's car. [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Plopper|Plopper]] the pig is also featured for the first time in the series, during the couch gag and Homer refers to him as "my summer love."&lt;ref name="Tallerico"&gt;{{cite news | author = Brian Tallerico | title = Fox Sunday Nights - 4 TV reviews | publisher = [[UGO]] | url = http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17859&amp;sectionId=2 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013061611/http://ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17859&amp;sectionId=2 | archivedate = 2007-10-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Tik Tok"===
A special opening sequence, featuring the cast [[lip dub]]bing to [[Kesha|Ke$ha]]'s single "[[Tik Tok]]", was animated for "[[To Surveil with Love]]" to promote "Fox Rocks" week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allieiswired.com/archives/2010/05/kehas-%E2%80%9Ctik-tok%E2%80%9D-gets-simpson-ized/|title=Ke$ha's "Tik Tok" Gets Simpson-ized&amp;nbsp;– Video &amp;#124; Allie is Wired|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107163210/http://allieiswired.com/archives/2010/05/kehas-%E2%80%9Ctik-tok%E2%80%9D-gets-simpson-ized/|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first canonical episode that does not feature "[[The Simpsons Theme]]" in any capacity, in the show's history. The sequence starts with Lisa waking up and then grabbing Milhouse's glasses. It then shows Groundskeeper Willie brushing his teeth with whiskey. He then gives it to Mrs Krabappel who drinks some while they walk into school before Mrs Krabappel grabs Willie and drags him into a classroom. In the hallway Sherri, Terri and Martin are having pedicures while Ralph is playing in the lost and found box. Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers walk past. The three bullies stick their heads out a classroom and blow up a phone causing coins to explode out of it. Then it shows the music room. Then the bus where Otto falls over. It then shows Nelson singing before showing inside Moe's bar where a group of people are fighting. Marge comes and drags Homer out of the bar and into her car where they drive home. It then pans over a few characters. Marge and Homer then come in where Lisa, Bart (dressed like a rapper) and Maggie are waiting. They all run into the living room and sit on the couch before a number of characters lift them up. The family then falls asleep.

===''Breaking Bad'' parody===
An homage to the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] drama ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' is used as an opening sequence for "[[What Animated Women Want]]", set to the tune of "[[Crystal Blue Persuasion]]" by [[Tommy James and the Shondells]].&lt;ref name=bbad&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57579267/watch-the-simpsons-takes-on-breaking-bad/|title=Watch: "The Simpsons" takes on "Breaking Bad"|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=2013-04-16|author=Derschowitz, Jessica|date=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is also used during a montage in the ''Breaking Bad'' episode "[[Gliding Over All]]", in reference to the blue-colored [[methamphetamine]] produced by the show's central character [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]].

The sequence opens with a parody of the ''Breaking Bad'' title card, with ''The Simpsons'' displayed across the screen with the symbols for [[Thorium]] (Th) and [[Silicon]] (Si) appearing at the beginning of each word. Marge, aping the downtrodden demeanor of Walter's wife [[Skyler White|Skyler]], sits on the couch drinking coffee. She goes into the kitchen to begin baking cupcakes, using food coloring to turn the batter blue and adding frosting and sprinkles in other shades of this color. She places one batch in a silver briefcase, which she gives to Bart before he leaves the house. Homer, dressed in the dark hat and sunglasses Walter dons for his "Heisenberg" persona, sneaks a taste of the batter while Marge is baking and is later woken from a nap by the smell. The scene cuts to a church bake sale, where Marge sells a cupcake to Milhouse as Homer watches from a distance. Back at the Simpson house, Marge runs her earnings through a [[currency-counting machine]], bundles the money, and adds it to a large pile on the dining table. The camera zooms out to reveal a live-action scene (taken from the episode "[[Hazard Pay]]") of Walter White and his partner [[Jesse Pinkman]] sitting on a couch drinking beer and watching the sequence on a TV.

===''Futurama'' parody===
The crossover episode "[[Simpsorama]]" (season 26, episode 6) begins with a parody of the ''[[Futurama]]'' title sequence, which includes the ''Futurama'' theme music and a text reading "A show out of ideas teams up with a show out of episodes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/07/26/simpsons-season-premiere-character-dies/|title=Sneak a peek at the 'Simpsons' season premiere, in which one character will die|work=EW.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ends with a couch gag with the Simpsons sitting on the couch, only to find out the couch is actually Hedonismbot.

==="Bart Gets the Remote"===
Used as an opening sequence for "[[Dad Behavior]]". The sequence opens as usual, until Bart skateboards out of the school and lands on the pile of leaves. He wakes up Barney in process, who then grabs his skateboard and breaks it in half, forcing him to walk home.
At work, when Homer drops the tongs, the glowing rod bounces into his mouth and he swallows it, before collapsing. At school, when Largo dismisses Lisa, she hits the door with her saxophone and collapses; the saxophone then falls on her. Next, when Maggie is seen at the steering wheel, when the camera zooms out, it reveals that she is actually driving the car while Marge is sleeping in the backseat. She then wakes up, just when the car drives off a cliff and through a barn. In the process, a chicken gets in the car, and is sitting next to Maggie, clucking, before she sticks her pacifier into its mouth, before driving them all into the lake, where the car sinks. Marge and the chicken then surface, but Maggie does not. Finally, the couch is shown, and Bart walks into the room, alone, carrying his broken skateboard. After calling around for his family, but getting no notice, he takes their pictures and puts them on the couch as he sits there, remarking that "Finally, I get the remote." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/19/bart-finally-gets-control-of-the-remote-in-the-latest-simpsons-couch-gag-6268604/|title=Bart FINALLY gets control of the remote in the latest Simpsons couch gag|first=Caroline|last=Westbrook|date=November 19, 2016|publisher=Metro|website=Metro.co.uk|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h365_F5BzDg|author=Animation on FOX|website=YouTube|title=Bart Finally Gets Control Of The Remote|date=November 17, 2016|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British people|British]] [[Street art|graffiti artist]] and [[political activist]] [[Banksy]] is credited with creating the opening titles and couch gag for the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|season 22]] episode "[[MoneyBart]]", in what amounted to the first time that an artist has been invited to [[storyboard]] the show.&lt;ref name="tvsquad"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=TV Squad.com|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/10/11/the-simpsons-banksy-title-sequence/ |title=Banksy Does 'The Simpsons': Street Artist Creates Title Sequence|author=Lawson, Catherine|date=October 11, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean first took note of Banksy after seeing his 2010 film ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/the-simpsons-explains-its-button-pushing-banksy-opening/ |title=‘The Simpsons’ Explains Its Button-Pushing Banksy Opening|author=Itzkoff, Dave|date=October 11, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jean, "The concept in my mind was, 'What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles?'"&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/10/11/banksy-simpsons-al-jean/|title=Banksy does 'The Simpsons': Exec producer Al Jean talks about pulling off the ultimate couch gag|author=Snierson, Dan|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 11, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simpsons'' [[casting director]] [[Bonnie Pietila]] was able to contact the artist through the film's producers, and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show. Jean said Banksy "sent back boards for pretty much what you saw."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Series creator [[Matt Groening]] gave the idea his blessing, and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy's original storyboards as possible.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

Approximately the first half minute of the opening sequence remains the same, with a few oddities: the word "BANKSY" is sprayed onto a number of walls and other public spaces. The chalkboard gag ("I must not write all over the walls") is written all over the classroom walls, clock, door, and floor.&lt;ref name="tvsquad" /&gt; After the Simpsons arrive at home, the camera cuts to a shot of them on the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional overseas [[Asia]]n [[animation]] and merchandise [[sweatshop]]. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la ''[[Schindler's List]]''.&lt;ref name="nydaily"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Daily News]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/10/11/2010-10-11_banksys_simpsons_couch_gag_targets_twentieth_century_fox_banking_on_its_most_fam.html?r=entertainment|title=Banksy's 'Simpsons' couch gag targets Twentieth Century Fox banking on its most famous cartoon|author=Soraya Roberts|date=October 11, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation [[cel]]s for ''The Simpsons'' among piles of human bones and [[toxic waste]], and a female artist hands a barefoot [[child labor|child employee]] an [[animation cel]], which he washes in a vat of [[biohazard]]ous fluid.&lt;ref name="nydaily" /&gt; Small [[kitten]]s are thrown into a [[woodchipper]]-type machine to provide the filling for [[Bart Simpson]] [[plush doll]]s.&lt;ref name="nydaily" /&gt; The toys are then placed into a cart pulled by a sad [[panda]] which is driven by a man with a [[whip]].&lt;ref name="nydaily" /&gt; A man shipping boxes with ''The Simpsons'' logo on the side uses the tongue from a [[decapitated]] [[dolphin]] head to fasten shut the packages.&lt;ref name="nydaily" /&gt; Another employee uses the horn of a sickly [[unicorn]] to smash the holes in the center of ''The Simpsons'' [[DVD]]s. It is then revealed that the sweatshop is contained within a grim version of the [[20th Century Fox]] logo, surrounded by [[barbed wire]], [[searchlights]], and a [[watchtower]].&lt;ref name="tvsquad" /&gt;

''The Simpsons'' is storyboarded at [[Film Roman]], a company based in California. The storyboards, voice tracks and coloring instructions are then sent to [[AKOM]], a company in [[Seoul]], South Korea. According to [[Nelson Shin]], the founder of AKOM, they received the storyboard for the sequence in August 2010. Believing the sequence to be "excessive and offending" he pushed for some of the darker jokes to be removed. He was successful, though "not nearly as much as he had pushed for." For example, in the storyboards, the workers were wearing [[conical Asian hat]]s, but these were removed.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2027768,00.html |title=South Korean Cartoonists Cry Foul Over ''The Simpsons''|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 30, 2010|author=Cain, Geoffrey|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox's [[standards and practices]] department also demanded a handful of changes, but, according to Jean, "95 percent of it is just the way [Banksy] wanted."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Banksy told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that his opening sequence was influenced by ''The Simpsons'' long-running use of animation studios in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The newspaper also reported that the creation of the sequence "is said to have been one of the most closely guarded secrets in US television&amp;nbsp;– comparable to the concealment of Banksy's own identity."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/11/banksy-the-simpsons-bart |title=Banksy takes Simpsons into sweatshop|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 11, 2010|author=Halliday, Josh|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although conceding to the fact that ''The Simpsons'' is largely animated in South Korea, Jean went on to state that the scenes shown in titles are "very fanciful, far-fetched. None of the things he depicts are true. That statement should be self-evident, but I will emphatically state it."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

===John Kricfalusi===
{{main|Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts}}

After the positive response to the opening sequence by Banksy, creator [[Matt Groening]] and Jean came to Canadian animator and creator of ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', [[John Kricfalusi]] and asked him if he could do something similar for the episode "[[Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts]]".&lt;ref name=amid&gt;{{cite web|last=Amidi|first=Amid|title=Exclusive: John K.

The interpolation however, is a straight A-to-B animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose.&lt;ref name="johnk" /&gt; Kricfalusi explains that "On ''the Simpsons'' I wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop",&lt;ref name="johnk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kricfalusi|first=John|title=Simpsons Interview pt 2: Models and Abandoning Inbetweens|url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2011/10/simpsons-interview-pt-2-models-and.html|work=John K Stuff|accessdate=October 28, 2011|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further elaborated "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work. You can’t write visual performance. You have to actually draw it."&lt;ref name=amid /&gt;

He showed Groening and [[showrunner]] [[Al Jean]] his [[Adult Swim]] shorts and Groening responded by giving him a free hand to do the 35-second-long segment.&lt;ref name=amid /&gt; Groening told him to break all ''The Simpsons'' rules, but Kricfalusi explains that he "tried not to break any rules in the characters’ personalities, just in the execution of the visuals. I didn’t follow any models—not even my own". The more rules he broke, the more pleased Groening and Jean were with the result.&lt;ref name=amid /&gt; Contrary to Banksy, who lives a life in secrecy, Kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] of the final soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ledesma|first=Chris|title=John K.

The couch gag for the episode was critically acclaimed by television critics. Amid Amidi of ''[[Cartoon Brew]]'' calls the opening revolutionary and explains that "in 35 short and sweet seconds, he liberates the animation of ''The Simpsons'' from years of graphic banality."&lt;ref name=amid/&gt; He continued: "The visual look of the show, which has been so carefully controlled by its producers, becomes a giddy and unrestrained playground for graphic play, and the balance of creative authority is shifted from the writers’ room to the animators in one fell swoop." When comparing the segment to Banksy's, Amidi concluded that it is "in fact, far more subversive because he focuses almost exclusively on making a pictorial statement, relegating the show's dominant literary elements to the back seat."&lt;ref name=amid/&gt; Similarly, Television Blend's Katey Rich wrote that she appreciates "''The Simpsons'' always being willing to push the envelope in different ways", but admitted that "it's gonna take [her] some time to get the gangly-legged Marge Simpson and the leering Homer Simpson out of [her] brain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rich|first=Katey|title=Watch The Simpsons Get Ren And Stimpy-ized In Disturbing New Couch Gag|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Watch-Simpsons-Get-Ren-Stimpy-ized-Disturbing-Couch-Gag-35658.html|work=Television Blend|accessdate=October 3, 2011|date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill Plympton===
Bill Plympton has written and animated six couch gags, one for "[[Beware My Cheating Bart]]" where Homer falls in love with the couch...until he meets Marge, one for "[[Black Eyed, Please]]" in which Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa are in a 1930s gangster story, armed with several weapons which are revealed to be gifts once Maggie turns the light on. The sixth comes from "[[3 Scenes Plus a Tag from a Marriage]]" which is a new version of his 1987 film "[[Your Face]]" with Homers face as a replacement.

===''Robot Chicken''===
The couch gag for the episode, "[[The Fabulous Faker Boy]]", which aired on May 12, 2013, was stop-motion animated by [[Seth Green]]'s Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, which also works on the television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Simpsons-Stop-Motion-Couch-Gag-1064924.aspx|title=''Simpsons'' Exclusive: Go Behind the Scenes of the ''Robot Chicken'' Team's Couch Gag|first1=Kate|last1=Stanhope|work=TV Guide|date=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guillermo del Toro===
[[Guillermo del Toro]] directed the 3-minute opening sequence for "[[Treehouse of Horror XXIV]]", which contained numerous references to horror and science fiction, including his own films.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Enk, "Ay Caramba! Decoding the Horror Movie References in Guillermo del Toro's 'Simpsons' Opening," ''Yahoo! Movies'', https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/aye-carumba-spotting-horror-references-guillermo-toro-simpsons-213318712.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Don Hertzfeldt===
The couch gag for the episode "[[Clown in the Dumps]]" which aired on September 28, 2014, was animated by the [[Academy Award]]-nominated surrealist animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]], who was recommended to the show by [[Mike B. Anderson]]. It depicts Homer using a time-traveling remote control to regress to [[The Simpsons shorts|his original 1987 character model]] from [[The Tracey Ullman Show]] then accidentally going into a distant future incarnation of the show called ''The Sampsans'' where he and his family have evolved into grotesque, mindless, catchphrase-spouting mutants, which also say to 'buy their merchandise'. Homer (now named 'Homar') sees a window, triggering memories of when the show was more pure and genuine, and where in one of the three flashbacks, Marge says 'Still love you Homar'. Homer feels sad when he returns to the bastardized world he lives in. Al Jean deemed it "crazier than we thought" and "the most insane one we've ever done".

===''Rick and Morty''===
The couch gag for the episode, "[[Mathlete's Feat]]", which aired on May 17, 2015, features Rick and Morty from the [[Cartoon Network]] [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Rick and Morty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Simpsons Couch Gag {{!}} Rick and Morty {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2015-05-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ecYoSvGO60&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steve Cutts ===
The couch gag for the episode "[[Teenage Mutant Milk-Caused Hurdles]]" which aired on January 10, 2016, features guest animator [[Steve Cutts]] LA-Z Rider with over 14 million views on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Animation on FOX|title=LA-Z Rider Couch Gag From Guest Animator Steve Cutts {{!}} Season 27 {{!}} THE SIMPSONS|date=2016-01-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZu5iDTtNg0|accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox had anticipated low viewing figures due to the NFL overrun pushing the start of primetime to 8:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. Despite this, the episode was the highest viewed of [[The Simpsons (season 27)|season 27]] with 8.3 Million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-jan-10-2016/|title=Sunday final ratings: ‘Simpsons’ still at a season high after downward adjustment|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=2016|website=TV By The Numbers|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies within the show==
The opening sequence has been parodied within six episodes of ''The Simpsons'':
* A short parody as ''The Thompsons'' in the episode "[[Cape Feare]]", when the Simpsons go into a [[witness protection]] program to evade [[Sideshow Bob]].
* As ''The Hurricane'' in the episode "[[Hurricane Neddy]]". Gray clouds appear, and the words "The Hurricane" in red letters come out in the same manner as the real opening. Similar vocals sing "The Hurricane", and then the letters are blown away to show parts of Springfield being destroyed.
* In "[[Simpsons Bible Stories]]", Bart is writing a chalkboard punishment in hieroglyphics when he hears Moses/[[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]]'s horn being blown and leaves the classroom.
* As ''Three weeks later'' in "[[The Heartbroke Kid]]". Instead of writing on a chalkboard, a now overweight Bart is seen buying and eating chocolate from a vending machine. He cracks the pavement when he leaves the school, bends a lamppost, runs over pedestrians, hits [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s car, sending it spinning off-screen, and crushes the roof of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s car, before stumbling into the living room having a heart attack.
* In "[[Little Big Girl]]", Bart is awarded a driver's license. Bart is seen at the chalkboard writing "So long suckers". He bursts through the school doors in Homer's car, instead of on his skateboard, and speeds away. Instead of dodging all the obstacles seen in the standard opening sequence, he runs them over. As Homer pulls into the driveway and steps out to enter the house, the other car lands on him, and Bart walks into the house.
* As ''The Outlands'' in "[[At Long Last Leave]]". In place of the chalkboard, Bart uses spray paint to vandalize a wall before leaving in a motorcycle. The family return home in a variety of ramshackle vehicles, before settling down on the couch to watch a sleeping fox.

==Reception==
The opening sequence has multiple times been picked as one of the best title sequences of all time on TV. In a 2010 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', ''The Simpsons'' opening title sequence ranked #1 on a list of TV's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.&lt;ref&gt;Tomashoff, Craig. "Credits Check" ''TV Guide'', October 18, 2010, Pages 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, James Charisma of ''[[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']]'' ranked the opening sequence #1 on a list of ''The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time''.&lt;ref name="Paste"&gt;{{cite web | title = The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time | publisher = [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'' (magazine)]] | url = https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/01/the-75-best-tv-title-sequences-of-all-time.html | date = January 4, 2017 | accessdate = January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Théâtre de l'Œuvre''' is a Paris theatre, located atop cité Monthiers, at 55 rue de Clichy in the 9° arrondissement in Paris, France. It is best known as the theatre where [[Alfred Jarry]]’s nihilistic farce ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' premiered in 1896.

Founded in Paris in 1893, the Théâtre de l'Œuvre was among the first theatrical venues in France to provide a home for the artists of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist Movement]] at the end of the nineteenth century. Modeled on the experimental structure of the [[Théâtre Libre]], the venue was directed by [[Lugné-Poe]],&lt;ref name="orsay"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/in-the-musee-dorsay/exhibitions-in-the-musee-dorsay-more/page/0/article/le-theatre-de-loeuvre-1893-1900-naissance-du-theatre-moderne-4224.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=649&amp;cHash=e75d812114 | title = The Théâtre de l'Œuvre | accessdate = September 6, 2013 | publisher = [[Musée d'Orsay]] Online | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090350/http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/in-the-musee-dorsay/exhibitions-in-the-musee-dorsay-more/page/0/article/le-theatre-de-loeuvre-1893-1900-naissance-du-theatre-moderne-4224.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=649&amp;cHash=e75d812114 | archivedate = March 4, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent Parisian actor and stage manager from its opening through 1929.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite book|last=Craig|first=Edward Gordon|title=On the Art of the Theatre |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0203889746 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UzTYCqHaXJMC&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=%22theatre+de+l%27oeuvre%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Franc Chamberlain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Lugné-Poe]] had embraced symbolism's "subjectivity, spirituality, and mysterious internal and external forces"&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett|first=Oscar Gross|title=The History of the Theatre|year=1968|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|pages=442–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a source of profound truth after working as an actor at the Théâtre d'Art. The first of the independent Symbolist theatre, the poet [[Paul Fort]], then just seventeen years old, formed the company to explore the performance potential of found texts such as ''[[The Iliad]]'', ''[[The Bible]]'', and his own lyric verse.  When Fort left the group in 1892, his work was carried on by what would become the Théâtre de l'Œuvre with [[Lugné-Poe]] at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasper|first=Rathbone|title=Adventure in the theatre: Lugné-Poe and the Théâtre de l'oeuvre to 1899|year=1947|publisher=Rutgers|location=Piscataway, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Fort's project which catered to the intellectual elite, Lugné-Poe sought to create a "theatre for the people," and customarily offered free tickets to most of the public, reserving only 100 seats for his subscription holders. Under his direction, the company first performed [[Maurice Maeterlinck| Maurice Maeterlinck's]] ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' on May 17, 1892. According to theatre historian Oscar Brockett:

{{cquote|The opening production, Maeterlink's ''Pelléas and Mélisande'', was typical.  Few properties and little furniture were used; the stage was lighted from overhead and most of the action passed in semidarkness; a gauze curtain, hung between the actors and the audience, gave the impression that mist enveloped the stage; backdrops, painted in gray tones, emphasized the air of mystery; costumes were vaguely medieval, although the intention was to create draperies of no particular period. The actors spoke in a staccato chant like priests and, according to some critics, behaved like sleepwalkers; their gestures were strongly stylized.  Given this radically new approach, it is not surprising that many spectators were mystified.&lt;ref name="Brockett"/&gt;}}

With the help of poet and critic [[Camille Mauclair]] and the painter [[Édouard Vuillard]] (with whom Lugné-Poe was sharing an apartment), the director dedicated the theatre to presenting the work of the young French Symbolist playwrights in addition to introducing new foreign dramas. The group established themselves that same year, renting a small room atop the cité Monthiers called the ''salle Berlioz'' and calling themselves ''Maison de l'Œuvre'', or literally, the "House of Works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogeval|first=Guy|title=Édouard Vuillard|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Paris Salle Berlioz 55 rue de Clichy 1907.jpg|thumb|250px|left|La salle Berlioz in 1907]]

In addition to those of Maeterlinck, the theatre also produced [[Sanskrit drama]]s in addition to works by foreign authors such as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[August Strindberg]], and [[Gabriele D’Annunzio]], alongside works by young French dramatists like [[Henry Bataille]], [[Henri de Régnier]] et [[Alfred Jarry]]. Lugné-Poe was also instrumental in introducing [[Henrik Ibsen]]’s plays to French audiences.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Théâtre de l'Oeuvre, a Paris Theatre|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/425539/Theatre-de-lOeuvre|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Britannica Online|accessdate=13 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as in the description of the theatre's initial performance, the majority Lugné-Poe's stage settings were simple, non-realistic representations of line and color on canvas backdrops.  He sought to create a theatre of poetry and dreams while staying true to his motto, "The word creates the decor."&lt;ref name="Brockett"/&gt; The staging was atmospheric and the acting stylized; costumes were usually simple and “timeless.”&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Some designers included [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Maurice Denis]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], and [[Édouard Vuillard|Vuillard]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simonson|first=Lee|title=The Stage Is Set|year=1963|publisher=Theatre Art Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 1896, Théâtre de l'Œuvre presented Alfred Jarry's legendary ''Ubu Roi'', with actor Firmin Gémier in the title role. Jarry had finished this epochal play about human greed, cowardice, and stupidity just six months before it would shock the audiences with its unapologetic opening line, "Merdre." Though Jarry affected an attitude of political indifference, his revolutionary ideas challenged assumptions about society, propriety, and existence. Brockett notes that "''Ubu Roi'' shows in all its grotesqueness a world without human decency."&lt;ref name="Brockett"/&gt;  In this lithograph announcement by Jarry for the performance of Ubu Roi, King Ubu appears as a shadow puppet with a segmented arm. He brandishes a scimitar in one hand and clutches a sack of gold in the other.

===Temporary Closures===
By 1899 the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre had presented 51 programs and toured England, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium. In spite of this success, Lugné-Poe had come to feel that the work of the Symbolists was juvenile and limiting to his artistic development.  He closed the theatre in 1899, marking an end to the first major phase of the anti-realism movement in the theatre.

[[Lugné-Poe]] revived the theatre December 22, 1912 with a production of [[Paul Claudel| Paul Claudel's]] ''L'Annonce faite à Marie.'' Following that were several works by the [[Dada]]ist and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] writers of the era. The group was off to a running start, but activity was interrupted again with the beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914.  They reopened again in 1919 with the help of financing from the actor [[Marcelle Frappa]] and ran the theatre continuously until his final retirement in 1929. Through their productions, tours, and critical reviews the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre, under the direction of Lugné-Poe, had managed to influence "almost every departure from realism between 1893 and 1915."&lt;ref name="Brockett"/&gt;

Lucien Beer and [[Paulette Pax]] succeeded Lugné-Poe in 1929 and served as the theatre's directors until the beginning of [[World War II]].  Shortly after the conflict began, Hitler conquered France and the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]] under Jacques Hébertot made most theatres illegal in the occupied zone.  After the [[Liberation of Paris]] in 1944, [[Raymond Rouleau]] rejoined Lucien Beer, and together they ran the theatre until 1951, when they were both replaced by Robert de Ribon.

In 1960 Pierre Franck and Georges Herbert took over direction. They ran the theatre until 1978, when they were replaced by Georges Wilson as Artistic Director and principal scenic designer.  He remained until 1995 when Gérard Maro, who had been Artistic Director of the Comédie de Paris since 1981 took over as chef of the Théâtre de l'Œuvre.  He is still in charge today.

{{United States House of Representatives}}
The '''Committee on Education and the Workforce''' is a [[Standing committee (United States Congress)|standing committee]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. From 1947 until 1994 and again from 2007 to 2011, during [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] control of the House, it was known as the '''Committee on Education and Labor'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|112|hres|5}}, 112th Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=Molly K.|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/134799-new-gop-rules-will-make-it-tougher-for-house-to-raise-debt-ceiling|title=New GOP rules will make it tougher for House to raise debt ceiling|work=The Hill|date=December 22, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Committee==
Attempts were made to create a congressional committee on education and labor starting with the early congresses but issues over Congress's constitutional ability to oversee such issues delayed the committee's formation. Finally, on March 21, 1867, the '''Committee on Education and Labor''' was founded following the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and during the rapid industrialization of America. On December 19, 1883, the committee was divided into two, the '''Committee on Education''' and the '''Committee on Labor'''.  The committees again merged on January 2, 1947, after the passage of the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946]], becoming the Committee on Education and Labor again.  On January 4, 1995, when the Republicans took over the House, the Committee was renamed the '''Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities'''.  It was renamed again as the '''Committee on Education and the Workforce''' two years later on January 7, 1997. On January 4, 2007, with the Democrats once again in the majority, the committee's name was changed back to Committee on Education and Labor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/guide/house/chapter-09.html Chapter 9. Records of the Committees on Education and Labor], ''Guide to the Records of the U.S. House of Representatives at the National Archives, 1789-1989'' (Record Group 233), [[National Archives and Records Administration]]&lt;/ref&gt; After Republicans recaptured the House majority in the 2010 elections, they returned to the name, Committee on Education and the Workforce, effective with the opening of the [[112th Congress]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/12/24/republicans-labor-to-avoid-labor/ Wall Street Journal: Republicans Labor to Avoid ‘Labor’]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction==

From the Official Committee Webpage:

''The Education and Labor Committee's purpose is to ensure that Americans' needs are addressed so that students and workers may move forward in a changing school system and a competitive global economy.'' 

''The committee and its five subcommittees oversee education and workforce programs that affect all Americans, from early learning through secondary education, from job training through retirement.''

''The Education and Labor Committee Democrats' goal is to keep America strong by increasing education opportunities for students, by making it easier to send young adults to college, and by helping workers find job training and retirement security for a better future. The following education issues are under the jurisdiction of the Education and Labor Committee:''

'''Education'''. The Committee on Education and Labor oversees federal programs and initiatives dealing with education at all levels—from preschool through high school to higher education and continuing education. These include:

* Elementary and secondary education initiatives, including the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], school choice for low-income families, special education (the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), teacher quality &amp; teacher training, scientifically based reading instruction, and vocational and technical education;

'''Labor'''. The Committee on Labor also holds jurisdiction over workforce initiatives aimed at strengthening health care, job training, and retirement security for workers. Workforce issues in the jurisdiction of the Education and the Labor Committee include:

* Pension and retirement security for U.S. workers;
* Access to quality health care for working families and other employee benefits;
* Job training, adult education, and workforce development initiatives, including those under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), to help local communities train and retrain workers;
* Continuing the successful welfare reforms of 1996;
* Protecting the democratic rights of individual union members;
* Worker health and safety, including occupational safety and health;
* Providing greater choices and flexibility (including "comp time" or family time options) to working women and men;
