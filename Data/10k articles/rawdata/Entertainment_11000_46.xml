'''''Alive! The Millennium Concert''''' is a [[Album#Live|live album]] by the [[United States|American]] [[hard rock]] [[Band (rock and pop)|band]] [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. It was released on November 21, 2006 as part of the ''[[Kiss Alive! 1975–2000]]'' [[box set]].

==Album information==
It was recorded on December 31, 1999 at [[BC Place|BC Place Stadium]] in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]]&lt;ref name="setlist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/kiss/1999/bc-place-stadium-vancouver-bc-canada-23d72ccf.html|title=KISS Concert Setlist at BC Place Stadium, Vancouver on December 31, 1999|website=setlist.fm|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included songs that had never before been performed by the original lineup ("[[Heaven's on Fire]]", "[[I Love It Loud]]" and "[[Lick It Up (song)|Lick It Up]]").

It was originally intended to be released as ''Alive IV'' in 2000 but was shelved when Kiss' parent label [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] was swallowed by the [[Universal Music|Universal]]/[[Vivendi]] merger. However, the album's version of "[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]" was included in ''[[The Box Set (Kiss)|The Box Set]]'' which was released on November 20, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003E7HS4C/?coliid=I1AVSWX99SJEHP&amp;colid=2I3KBXV5TNNB8&amp;psc=0|title=Kiss Box Set by Kiss on Amazon Music|website=[[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]]|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Universal later agreed to Kiss using Mercury to release what would become The Millennium Concert as ''Alive IV'', it was shelved indefinitely and the band would release the ''[[Kiss Symphony: Alive IV|Symphony: Alive IV]]'' album released on Kiss Records/[[Sanctuary Records]] in 2003. It was finally released on November 21, 2006 as part of the ''[[Kiss Alive! 1975–2000]]'' [[box set]].

An edition of the box set exclusive to [[Best Buy]] was advertised as including two exclusive bonus tracks (2,000 Man and God of Thunder) on ''The Millennium Concert'' disc&lt;ref name="bestbuy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Kiss-Alive-The-Millennium-Concert/release/6209194|title=Kiss - Alive: The Millennium Concert (CD, Album)|website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But due to an error, Best Buy only sold the standard box set that did not have the exclusive bonus tracks.&lt;ref name="bestbuy"/&gt; In an attempt to correct this, a replacement disc was produced and small quantities were shipped to Best Buy locations where the discs were given out to customers who came back to complain that their box did not include the promised extra tracks.&lt;ref name="bestbuy"/&gt;

Another bonus track, "[[Detroit Rock City]]", was released as an exclusive to the [[iTunes]] edition of the box set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/alive-1975-2000/205155994|title=Alive! (1975-2000) by Kiss on Apple Music|website=[[iTunes]]|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 14, 2014 ''The Millennium Concert'' was released on [[Phonograph record|vinyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Alive-Millennium-Concert-2-LP/dp/B00IVNSG6I/ref=tmm_vnl_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;coliid=IJCRYPJ1Z5K2F&amp;colid=2I3KBXV5TNNB8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=Kiss - Alive - The Millennium Concert [2 LP]|website=Amazon.com|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was the first release to include the entire concert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Kiss-Alive-The-Millennium-Concert/release/6270271|title=Kiss - Alive: The Millennium Concert (Vinyl, LP, Album)|website=Discogs|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (except for "[[Cold Gin]]" and "[[Shock Me]]" which remain unreleased).&lt;ref name="setlist"/&gt;

'''Art of the Title''' ('''AOTT''') is an [[online publication]] dedicated to [[title sequence]] design, spanning the film, television, conference, and video game industries. The publication is both an educational and historical resource and a contemporary publication, focusing on the creative process behind the design of title sequences. It combines interviews with filmmakers and directors, designers, and craftspeople with in-depth analyses and behind-the-scenes materials.

==Overview==
Art of the Title is the leading online resource of title design, with hundreds of title sequences available to view. The site features title design from countries around the world and aims to "honor the creators and innovators who contribute to the field, discussing and displaying their work with a desire to explicate, facilitate, and instigate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = About the site | publisher = Art of the Title | date = 2012 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/about/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Independent]] has said that Art of the Title may well be the "best place to visit in search of more of these neglected wonders of film art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Time to give a little credit to the credits | publisher = The Independent | date = February 25, 2011 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/time-to-give-a-little-credit-to-the-credits-2224666.html | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film Comment]] called the site "a praiseworthy and priceless compendium" in 2011, and said, "Art of the Title's greatest achievement has been to single out and champion the journeymen designers who painstakingly sculpt opening ephemera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finnegan | first = Jesse P. | title = Site Specifics: ArtoftheTitle.com | publisher = Film Comment | date = 2011 | url = http://www.filmcomment.com/article/site-specifics-artofthetitle.com | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art of the Title staff have been invited to speak at industry conferences and festivals such as [[SXSW]], [[AIGA]], [[Promax Awards|PromaxBDA]], MODE Summit, Gamercamp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Brief History of Video Game Title Design | publisher = Art of the Title | date = November 5, 2013 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/a-brief-history-of-video-game-title-design/ | accessdate = May 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toronto International Film Festival|TIFF]] Next Wave, [[Nordic Media Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE TITLE SEQUENCE THAT SOLD THE SHOW|url=http://www.nordiskemediedager.no/en/program/the-title-sequence-that-sold-the-show/session/|website=Nordic Media Festival|publisher=Nordic Media Festival|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] Classic Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talks &amp; Events — Art of the Title|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/about/talks-events/|website=Art of the Title|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also done several talks in partnership with the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]'s Reel Comfort series.

In June 2017, site editors Lola Landekic and Will Perkins hosted a screening and discussion of films by designers and filmmakers [[Saul Bass]] and [[Elaine Bass]] at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linthicum|first1=Ryan|title=Movies at SAAM: Summer 2017|url=https://americanart.si.edu/blog/eye-level/2017/20/55908/movies-saam-summer-2017|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Art of the Title was founded by motion designer Ian Albinson and launched in 2007 as a blog intending to highlight the design of title sequences.

In 2008, Alexander Ulloa joined the site as Head Writer. Over the next few years, the site expanded with the addition of writers and editors Lola Landekic and Will Perkins, now Managing Editor and Senior Editor, respectively.

In 2011, the Art of the Title team curated the title design section of the ''Graphic Design — Now in Production'' exhibition, co-organized by the [[Walker Art Center]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Graphic Design: Now In Production | publisher = Walker Art Center | date = 2011 | url = http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2011/graphic-design-now-in-production | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ran from October 22, 2011 – January 22, 2012 at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and then was taken on a tour including stints in New York, Los Angeles, Grand Rapids, Houston, Winston-Salem, and Providence. A comprehensive, illustrated catalogue produced by the [[Walker Art Center]] and featuring an 18-page section on title design curated and written by Art of the Title accompanies the exhibition.

In 2012, the site launched a redesign developed in partnership with New Zealand-based studio CactusLab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2012: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2011 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2012-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The redesign adopted a responsive structure, allowing the site to "seamlessly adapt from desktop to mobile" and to provide "better cross-referencing of data alongside new bio pages for title designers and studios."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Art of the Title • Web Projects • Work • CactusLab | publisher = CactusLab | date = 2012 | url = http://www.cactuslab.com/work/art-of-the-title/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the site went down temporarily when its [[Iron Man 3]] article was linked from [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]'s Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2013: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2013 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2013-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the site announced an exclusive look at the James Bond ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' title sequence, which turned out to be a [[rickroll]]. Readers' reactions ran the gamut from outrage to kudos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of the Title – NEW: An exclusive look... |url=https://twitter.com/ArtoftheTitle/status/583290327152250880|website=Twitter|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SXSW Title Design Awards===
From 2010-2014, Art of the Title facilitated and participated in the jury of the [[SXSW]] Excellence in Title Design Awards, part of the [[SXSW Film Festival]].

In 2013, Ian Albinson hosted a discussion at the title screening event, and then announced the winners at the Film Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2013: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2013 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2013-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Managing Editor Lola Landekic and Senior Editor Will Perkins gave a talk ahead of the Title Design Awards and hosted a discussion with filmmaker and designer Henry Hobson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolmar | first = Jim | title = Title Design Awards and Art of the Title Discussion Announced | publisher = SXSW | date = February 20, 2014 | url = http://sxsw.com/film/news/2014/title-design-awards-and-art-title-discussion-announced | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">The '''Baishou Dance''' or '''baishouwu''' (摆手舞, literally 'hand-waving dance') is a 500-year-old historic [[group dance]] of the [[Tujia people|Tujia]], one of 55 [[ethnic minorities in China]]. The dance uses 70 ritual [[gesture]]s to represent war, farming, hunting, courtship and other aspects of traditional life.

== Literature ==
The Tujia nationality Baishou dance in Xiangxi, Hunan province best reflects the ethnic flavor and ancient customs of the Tujia nationality. It is popular in Longshan county, Baojing county and Yongshun county, Xiangxi Tujia-Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hunan province. The dance is usually performed from the third to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. It originates from an ancestor worship ceremony and dates back nearly 1,000 years ago, according to the broken stele in the Temple of Eight Clan Leaders (Qing Dynasty) and the county annals.
The Tujia nationality baishou dance integrates singing, dancing, music and opera elements. It presents numerous topics concerning history and human existence, including the creation of the world, human reproduction, migration, hunting &amp; fishing, sericulture &amp; weaving, slash-and-burn cultivation, ancient stories, myths and legends, and daily life. The dance uses ritual gestures. Dancers' movements and postures are powerful and aesthetic. They wave one hand, wave two hands, wave hand(s) when circling around, or wave hand(s) with foot movements. The dance, usually performed on level ground, can be classified into grand baishou and small-scale baishou. The grand baishou is performed by over 1,000 dancers when offering sacrifices to Tujia ancestors and is watched by over 10,000 spectators; the small-scale baishou is performed on a small scale when offering sacrifices to ancestors with the same family name.
The music of the dance incorporates vocal accompaniment (starting song and baishou song) and musical accompaniment (drum and gong). The song changes flexibly according to the content and movements of the dance. Dancers' movements and postures indicate power and freedom and feature turning, bending knees, shaking, and lowering the body. The dance is valuable for studying the history, war, religion, migration, farming, life, courtship and folk customs of the Tujia nationality.

&lt;!-- combined entry for the characters and the sketch --&gt;
'''Bob and Doug McKenzie''' are a pair of fictional [[Canadians|Canadian]] brothers who hosted "Great White North", a [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] which was introduced on ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' for the show's third season when it moved to [[CBC Television]] in [[1980 in television|1980]].  Bob is played by [[Rick Moranis]] and Doug is played by [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]. Although created originally as filler to both satisfy and mock network [[Canadian content]] demands, the duo became a [[popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon in both Canada and the [[United States]].

The characters were later revived for an animated series, ''[[Bob &amp; Doug (TV series)|Bob &amp; Doug]]'', which premiered on [[Global Television Network|Global]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Von Riedemann, Dominic. "Global Television Show Reunites SCTV's Dave Thomas, Rick Moranis." Article at Suite101.com on July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[List of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie appearances on SCTV|"Great White North"]] (originally known as "Kanadian Korner") is a panel show that played upon [[Culture of Canada|Canadian stereotypes]].  Bob and Doug, two dim-witted [[beer]]-swilling brothers wearing heavy winter clothing and [[touque]]s, would comment on various elements of [[Culture of Canada|Canadian life and culture]], frequently employing the [[interjection]] "[[Eh]]?" and derisively calling each other "[[hoser]]."  Among the topics discussed were snow routes, the [[Canadarm|Canadian-built robot arm]] on the [[Space Shuttle]], the inappropriateness of bedtime stories about dog fights, flat tires, and "why there aren't enough parking spaces at [[Tim Hortons|take-out donut shops]]."&lt;ref name="PeopleSCTV"&gt;"With Beer, Back Bacon and Banter, 'SCTV's Bob &amp; Doug Mine Comedy Gold in the 'Great White North'." Article in ''People'' magazine, February 1, 1982. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081357,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sketch was conceived when ''SCTV'' moved to the CBC television network. Due to the difference in the amount of time allocated for commercials, each episode to be broadcast on that network was two minutes longer than those [[Television syndication|syndicated]] to the United States. The CBC network heads asked the show's producers to add specifically identifiably [[Canadian content]] for those two minutes. [[Rick Moranis]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] thought that this was a ridiculous request, given that the show had been taped in Canada, with a mostly Canadian cast and crew, for two years.&lt;ref name="PeopleSCTV" /&gt; The request inspired them to create a [[parody]] that would incorporate every aspect of the humorous stereotype of Canadians.&lt;ref name="AskMenSCTV"&gt;[http://ca.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment_300/308c_top_10_list.html "Great White North: Beer Nog." Top 10 SCTV Skits at ca.askmen.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The segments were videotaped at the end of a day's shooting, with just Thomas and Moranis and a single camera operator. The sketches were for the most part improvised on the set, after which they would select the best ones for use on the program.&lt;ref&gt;Second City Television (SCTV) at The Museum of Broadcast Communications website [http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=secondcityt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moranis recalled, "We went on the stage with no preparation, and did 15 [sketches]. Two of them were lousy, in three we cracked up and fell apart... maybe six were keepers."&lt;ref name="AskMenSCTV" /&gt;  Added Dave Thomas in a 2000 interview, "Rick and I used to sit in the studio, by ourselves – almost like happy hour – drink real beers, cook [[back bacon]], literally make hot snack food for ourselves while we improvised and just talked. It was all very low key and stupid, and we thought, 'Well, they get what they deserve. This is their Canadian content. I hope they like it.'"&lt;ref name="DTinterview"&gt;Plume, Kenneth. "Interview with [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] (Part 1 of 5)" at movies.img.com, February 10, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

To their shock, the comedians found that this filler material had become the most popular part of the show.  Though initially intended for Canadian TV only, some of the two-minute "Great White North" segments would find their way into U.S. versions of the 30-minute shows due to a shortage of content that week. When NBC ordered the 90-minute shows for the 1981 season, they specifically cited good affiliate feedback on the "two dumb Canadian characters" and requested that the characters be included in every program.&lt;ref name="DTinterview" /&gt;

They rode the crest of a fad, peaking in 1982-83, that produced one comedy album, ''[[The Great White North (album)|The Great White North]]'', and a movie, ''[[Strange Brew]]''. The album released by [[Anthem Records]] in Canada and [[Mercury Records]] in the US, went platinum in sales, won a [[Grammy]] nomination and broke the top ten on [[Billboard's]] Top LPs and Tapes list in March, 1982. It is noted for the song "Take Off" which featured fellow Canadian [[Geddy Lee]] of the rock group [[Rush (band)|Rush]] chorusing between the McKenzies' banter. On this album, they also sing their own improvised version of "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]", which is frequently played on the radio around the holidays in both Canada and the United States. While hugely popular in the U.S., the album was also #1 in Canada for six weeks, suggesting that Canadians appreciated the duo as an affectionate self-parody.

The ''Strange Brew'' movie was released by [[MGM]] in 1983. While receiving only minimal praise from critics, it performed fairly well at the box office, earning $8.5 million in the U.S. alone to easily cover its skinny $5 million budget. Subsequent to its initial theatrical release in 1983, ''Strange Brew'' was released by [[MGM]] in both Beta and VHS formats and subsequently re-packaged and re-released on VHS and Laser disc by [[Turner Home Entertainment|Turner]] which acquired the [[MGM]] library in 1986, then also several times on VHS and DVD by [[Warner Brothers]] which acquired the library when Time Warner merged with Turner in 1996. ''Strange Brew'' continued to perform for [[Warner Brothers]] as a DVD title most likely because of the strong college cult following for Bob and Doug.

A [[Strange Brew Soundtrack|second album]], a "soundtrack" to their movie ''Strange Brew'', was released in 1983.  The album featured dialogue and music from the film, as well as new skits made specifically for the album that centered around the movie. The lead off track was appropriately entitled "This Isn't Our Second Album". The album sold poorly and was out-of-print soon after.&lt;ref name="PeopleSCTV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&amp;file_num=nlc008388.0434&amp;issue_dt=December%2019%201981&amp;type=1 |publisher=''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' |date=19 December 1981 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |title=RPM 50 Albums }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&amp;file_num=nlc008388.0451&amp;issue_dt=January%2030%201982&amp;type=1 |publisher=''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' |date=30 January 1982 |accessdate=2008-10-27 |title=RPM 50 Albums }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sketch's signature "Coo roo coo coo, coo coo coo coo" theme, according to Dave Thomas in an interview on ''[[CBC News: The Hour]]'', is an exaggeration of the [[flute]] music used in 60-second Canadian television nature vignettes, such as ''[[Hinterland Who's Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hww.ca/index_e.asp Hinterland Who's Who website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504142122/http://www.hww.ca/index_e.asp |date=May 4, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances on ''SCTV''==
{{main|List of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie appearances on SCTV}}

The duo had a total of 41 original segments on SCTV. Presumably filmed several at a time, most "Great White North" segments featured one two-minute sketch per SCTV episode. 25 segments were aired in the third season (1980–81).

Most of Season 4, Cycle 1 (1981) was made up of "Great White North" repeat segments. The only new appearances were in episodes 4/1-2 and 4/1-9, the final episode of the cycle. The final episode included a wraparound storyline which heavily featured the characters.

Growing in popularity, the characters returned for nine new segments in the second cycle of season 4. Cycle 2 (1981–82) featured a new "Great White North" segment in each episode.

Season 4, Cycle 3 (1982) was the last season to feature the characters. The first episode's plot revolves around the growing popularity of Bob and Doug, and they are given their own variety show on ''SCTV'', which turns into a catastrophe. The characters returned in the next episode for a new segment in their traditional studio set, but it had been cut to one minute (the episode's storyline owing the reduced air time to their disastrous variety show). The two are then featured in three more new segments, each back to two minutes long, before Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas left ''SCTV'' to film ''Strange Brew''.

==Legacy==
The duo revived the act in two award-winning [[television commercial]]s for [[Pizza Hut]] in 1984 and 1986 and a two-year campaign for the [[Molson]] Brewing Company in 1999 and 2000 consisting of more than a dozen television and radio commercials which aired nationally in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110224071145/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbkOI6Q9dQ0&lt;/ref&gt; and also a series of commercials for [[Mr. Lube]] which aired in Canada in 2002. Featured as a sponsor of the "Two-Four Anniversary", a series of Red Cap Ale commercials featured the duo in 2007 along with collectible "stubbies" featuring the characters on the bottles.

[[McFarlane Toys]] produced [[McFarlane Toys#The McKenzie Brothers|Bob and Doug McKenzie action figures]] in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=7 |title=&gt;&gt; Toys &gt;&gt; Movies &gt;&gt; The Mckenzie Brothers |publisher=Spawn.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623033005/http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=7 |archivedate=2010-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 video game ''[[Spyro: Year of the Dragon]]'', two characters appear in the Icy Peak level whose names are Bob and Doug. The level is a land of ice and snow, and there are references in certain areas of the level to ice skating and ice hockey, as well as a use of the phrase "Take off, hoser!". The characters the player interacts with in the level seem to speak with Canadian accents.

In 2003, the fastest computer in Canada, which is used by the Department of [[Astronomy]] and [[Astrophysics]] at the [[University of Toronto]], was named after Bob and Doug. The $900,000 computer is being used to simulate supermassive black holes and collisions of galaxies. The machine, nicknamed McKenzie, has 268 gigabytes of memory and 40 terabytes of disk space, and consists of two master nodes (Bob and Doug), 256 compute nodes, and eight development nodes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.execulink.com/~bobnet/news/bobdoug.html&lt;/ref&gt;

They played a variant of the act for the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] [[animated]] [[feature film]] ''[[Brother Bear]]'' and its [[Brother Bear 2|sequel]], with their characters being the voices of a pair of goofy bull [[moose]] named Rutt and Tuke. They also recorded a commentary for the movie that is seen on the [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328880/ Accessed July 14, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465925/ Accessed July 14, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new special, ''[[Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie's Two-Four Anniversary]]'', aired on May 20, 2007, on [[CBC Television]]. It is a retrospective on the history of the characters and their popularity, featuring interviews with various celebrities, classic clips, and new material featuring the pair. It includes an introduction by former Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] and a cameo appearance by [[Rush (band)|Rush]] lead singer [[Geddy Lee]]. On November 20, 2007, the special was released on DVD. The DVD, re-edited by Thomas himself, was twice as long as the broadcast and featured several classic McKenzie sketches from SCTV in their entirety, new footage filmed on the Great White North set and an hour's worth of bonus features. A Bob and Doug McKenzie bottle opener was included in every DVD.&lt;ref name="SCTVmacleans"&gt;"Take off, eh?"

In 2007, on [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows]]'' tour, a short film of Bob and Doug McKenzie was shown as an intro to the song "[[The Larger Bowl (A Pantoum)|The Larger Bowl]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Rush out for latest Rush Concert DVD Snakes &amp; Arrows." Review at www.epinions.com on December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animax Entertainment]], whose interactive division is currently headed by Dave Thomas, began producing a new animated series for the [[Global Television Network]] based on the characters debuting on April 19, 2009, simply entitled ''[[Bob &amp; Doug (TV series)|Bob &amp; Doug]]''. Thomas reprised the character of Doug in the new series. Moranis chose not to voice the character of Bob. The part was instead voiced by [[Dave Coulier]]. Moranis was, however, involved in the series as an executive producer.&lt;ref name=star&gt;Rob Salem, [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Television/article/620381 "Bob &amp; Doug taking off again"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', April 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired 15 episodes.

In June 2017 it was announced that Moranis and Thomas would be performing a live reunion show at the Second City in Toronto to raise money for Thomas' nephew Jake who suffered a spinal cord injury earlier that year. The show featured other SCTV alumni including Dan Aykroyd, Eugene Levy, and Martin Short.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The [[SYFY]] network show [[List of Z Nation episodes#Season 4 (2017)|"Z-Nation" Season 4, Episode 8]] - 'Crisis of Faith', featured the main characters entering Canada, and running into RCMP officers, a Hockey team bearing the Canada logo and of course, zombies very reminiscent of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie.  The cast members who confront the look-alikes used the GWN catch phrases "eh", and "hoser" among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Z Nation proves that Canadian zombies can be much more polite|first=Alex|last=McLevy|date=November 17, 2017|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|url=https://www.avclub.com/z-nation-proves-that-canadian-zombies-can-be-much-more-1820525273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions of the creators==
In Dave Thomas's behind-the-scenes book on ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', he reports that he and Moranis disliked the characters because they felt the network forced the characters on them and that they, as actors, were overly identified with the dimwitted, beer-drinking duo.  However, in an interview accompanying the ''Two-Four Anniversary'' premiere, Thomas credited the McKenzie Brothers as a successful comedic creation of which he was quite proud.&lt;ref name="SCTVmacleans" /&gt;

'''''Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time''''' is a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' [[Platform video game|platform]] [[video game]] released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 1999. An indirect sequel, ''[[Bugs Bunny &amp; Taz: Time Busters]]'', was released for the same platforms in 2000.

==Plot==
The game stars cartoon character [[Bugs Bunny]] who finds and activates a time machine (mistaking it for a carrot juice dispenser) after taking a wrong turn at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], intending to go to [[Pismo Beach]]. He ends up in Nowhere, home of a sorcerer named [[Knight-mare Hare|Merlin Munroe]]. Merlin then informs Bugs that he is lost in time and that he must travel through five different eras of time in order to collect clock symbols and golden carrots that will allow him to return to the present.

==Gameplay==
The objective of this game is to collect time clocks to progress through different eras via the time machine. In Nowhere, which acts as a tutorial level, Bugs Bunny will learn the basic moves he needs to use to progress through the game. He can kick, jump, pick up objects, roll, jump into rabbit holes to move underground, tiptoe to avoid alerting other enemies, climb ropes, and use his rabbit ears like propellers to slowly descend to the ground from high places. Bugs can also move some objects to get to certain places. Enemies in the game are mostly simple to beat. Some can be defeated with a kick or a jump, while others may require Bugs to be chased by an enemy until they run out of breath, then they can be kicked in the back. There are also special abilities for Bugs to learn from Merlin much later as he progresses through the game.

While in the time machine, there are five different eras (spanning 21 levels in total) for Bugs Bunny to visit. They are the Stone Age, Pirate Years, The 1930s, Medieval Period, and Dimension X. Each level has clock symbols and golden carrots for Bugs to find in the game. There are also normal carrots for Bugs to pick up, which act as a form of defense similar to rings from [[Sonic the Hedgehog]]. Carrots can be collected by finding them scattered in a level or defeating an enemy. If Bugs gets hit, he will lose 3 carrots. He can hold up to 99 carrots. There are some levels that require a full amount of carrots in order to play them. After completing a level, Merlin will appear and the player can decide if they wish to save their progress up to that point. At the end of each era, Bugs must confront and defeat a boss character to unlock the next era.

==Development==
In late 2017, beta screenshots of the game surfaced on [[YouTube]], from "Playstation Zone Volume 3". The screenshots showcased a drastically different [[art movement|art style]] from the final game, for instance a completely redesigned different 1st level. Although, level assets are used in the final version of the game. &lt;ref&gt;https://youtube.com/watch/xjBc_J_EdoU&lt;/ref&gt; Beta footage from the same source surfaced a year later.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtube.com/watch/YQkAI4u5rZM&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Call of Duty: WWII''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sledgehammer Games]] and published by [[Activision]]. It was released worldwide on November 3, 2017 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. It is the fourteenth main installment in the ''Call of Duty'' series and the first title in the series to be set primarily during [[World War II]] since ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'' in 2008.

The game's campaign is set in the [[European theatre of World War II|European theatre]] and is centered around a squad in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] following their battles on the Western Front and set mainly in the historical events of [[Operation Overlord]]. The player controls Ronald "Red" Daniels, who has squadmates who can supply the player with extra ammunition, health, or grenades; none of these are automatically replenished in the campaign. The multiplayer mode features map locations not seen in the campaign. The mode also features the new Divisions system, replacing the create-a-class system that previous games in the series used. A social hub, Headquarters, was also implemented into the game, allowing for players to interact with each other.

Sledgehammer Games were interested in bringing the series back to World War II after developing their previous title, ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'' (2014), which featured advanced movements and futuristic warfare technology. Studio head Michael Condrey stated that he was unsure if a World War II game would feel right after creating a futuristic title like ''Advanced Warfare'', but the developers ultimately decided to create a game in this time period. They also chose to include "atrocities" and [[Nazi extermination camps]] apparent during this time period in the campaign mode in order to deliver an authentic war story.

Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews from critics, with many appreciating the return to the franchise's World War II roots. Praise was given towards its story, the combat support of squad members and return of the health bar in single-player, visuals, Zombies mode, and multiplayer. However, it was criticized for the single-player's lack of innovation and similarity to past games set in the same era. The game was a commercial success, creating $500 million of revenue within just three days of its release. It became the highest-grossing console game of 2017 in North America, generating over $1 billion of revenue by the end of the year.

== Gameplay ==
Similar to its predecessors, ''Call of Duty: WWII'' is a [[first-person shooter]] game. It removes the advanced system of movement present in the two previous ''Call of Duty'' titles, which included double jumping and wall running. Instead, it features a return of traditional movement to the series, taking it back to a "boots on the ground"{{clarify|date=March 2018}} gameplay style. The game features an unlimited sprint mechanic, seen in the previous two titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/unlimited-sprint-not-in-cod-wwii-14835|title=Unlimited sprint won’t be featured in Call of Duty: WWII|access-date=July 11, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a "slide" movement mechanic, which allowed players to slide quickly on the ground, ''WWII'' features a "hit-the-deck" mechanic that allows the player to leap forward and throw themselves on the ground in order to get to cover quickly, similarly to a previous mechanic known as "dolphin dive" in [[Treyarch]]'s ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MichaelCondrey/status/874796254554841088|title=You can "hit-the-deck" and scramble for cover, officially.|last=Condrey|first=Michael|date=June 13, 2017|website=@MichaelCondrey|access-date=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaign ===
''WWII'' is the first title since [[Call of Duty (video game)|the original game]] and ''[[Call of Duty 2: Big Red One]]'' not to feature health regeneration in the campaign. Instead, players must find health packs scattered throughout levels, or rely on their medic squadmate to provide health packs. Other members of the player's squad can provide ammunition, grenades, call in mortar strikes, or spot enemies and reveal their position in form of silhouettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ww2-ditching-health-regen-has-some-fo/1100-6449627/|title=Call Of Duty: WW2 Ditching Health Regen, Has Some Form Of Dedicated Classes|last=Dayus|first=Oscar|date=April 27, 2017|website=GameSpot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain sections of the game, enemy soldiers in the campaign can be captured, and wounded allies can be dragged to cover. In some parts of the campaign, players are able to control vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.acast.com/gamertagradio/e3-2017-call-of-duty-ww2-interview|title=E3 2017: Call Of Duty: WW2 Interview {{!}} Gamertag Radio on acast|last=acast|date=June 16, 2017|work=acast|access-date=July 12, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiplayer ===
The multiplayer mode for ''Call of Duty: WWII'' was revealed on E3 2017, which took place from June 13–15.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://community.activision.com/t5/Call-of-Duty/Announcing-Call-of-Duty-WWII/ba-p/10231255|title=Announcing Call of Duty: WWII|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|date=April 26, 2017|work=|access-date=April 27, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=[[Activision]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sledgehammer Games announced features such as the new headquarters social space, divisions, war mode and the return to "boots-on-the-ground" gameplay. Players who pre-order the game were invited to a closed beta, which was released initially for the PlayStation 4, and later released on other platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2017/04/26/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-call-of-duty-world-war-ii-reveal/#1a5134125118|title=Everything You Need To Know About The 'Call Of Duty: World War II' Reveal|last=Kain|first=Erik|date=April 26, 2017|work=Forbes|access-date=June 16, 2017|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In online multiplayer matches, players are randomly assigned either to [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] or [[Axis powers|Axis]] side. On Allies side, players can play as soldiers in [[United States Army|American]], [[British Army|British]], [[Red Army|Soviet]], or [[French Resistance]] armies. On the Axis side, players play exclusively as the [[Wehrmacht]] and not [[Waffen-SS]] in an effort to avoid "glorifying" Nazi extremists. When explaining this decision, Glen Schofield, co-founder and co-studio head at Sledgehammer, said "The big distinction that Germans still make today is that between the German military and the Nazis. We made sure we made that distinction in the game, that the Germans were doing their duty".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Instead of the usual create-a-class system, ''WWII'' features Divisions. Players can choose one out of five divisions, each with their own different basic combat training, division training and weapon skills. Players need to progress through ranks in divisions in order to use additional perks, in addition to a global perk system named Basic Training. The divisions featured in the game are:
* Infantry: The most versatile division in the game, it is equipped for mid to long range combat. The special skill of this division is the bayonet charge, which can lead to brutal melee combat.
* Airborne: This division makes players move fast while remaining quiet. Players in this division can attach suppressors to sub-machine guns at any time during combat which allows for more stealth based gameplay style.
* Armored: This division has the heaviest firepower, being able to mount light machine guns while taking less fire and explosive damage.
* Mountain: This division focuses on long range combat, making sniper rifles more precise with aim assist and improving the aim through scope by blocking out surroundings from player's view.
* Expeditionary: Shotguns used by players in this division have incendiary rounds that burn enemies to death. This division can also replenish their lethal and tactical grenades through killing enemies.
* Resistance: Added in January 2018 as part of an update, this division allows players to use tactical knife in combination with their pistol, focusing on stealthy close-quarter combat. This division also can sense nearby enemies as well as scramble their radar in close proximity.
* Cavalry: Added in June 2018 as part of an update, this division carries a specialized [[riot shield]], which provides increased defensive capabilities in firefights. The Cavalry division can also charge at enemies with the shield, and also has improved objective skills.
* Commando:  Added August 2018 as part of an update.  This division allows players to place a flare on the map which, after a death, respawns the player at the location of the flare via a parachute.  The flare takes the place of all tactical equipment.  Also allows other perks which focus mainly on health regeneration.

In April 6, Sledgehammer Games announced an overhaul to the Divisions system, which includes massive changes to the meta of the system: Division-specific weapon skills are selectable as attachments for the corresponding weapon classes rather than being tied to the Divisions (with LMG bipods and sniper sharpshooter abilities being available by default), and several Division trainings are switched out/adjusted to better promote their recommended playstyle, without imposing limitation of customization on the players. Other global changes include allowing suppressors on pistols, usage of rocket launchers without needing the Launched basic training, and infinite sprinting.

''WWII'' also features Headquarters mode, which acts as a social space in the game. The hub is set on the [[Omaha Beach]] in Normandy, three days after the invasion when Allies retake the beach and turn it into a base. 48 players can be in the Headquarters at a time, and take part in various activities. For example, players can watch other players open [[loot boxes]] while in the Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/08/10/call-of-duty-ww2-gives-you-prizes-for-watching-others-open-loot-boxes|title=Call of Duty: WW2 Gives You Prizes For Watching Others Open Loot Boxes|website=Kotaku UK|access-date=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a firing range in the hub, where all players can practice their shooting skills with all weapons, as well as a field where they can test scorestreaks. There are also areas where players can engage in "1v1" fights, as other players watch the duels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/28/call-of-duty-wwii-how-an-indie-classic-inspired-the-latest-game|title=Call of Duty: WWII – how an indie classic inspired the latest instalment|last=Stuart|first=Keith|date=June 28, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=July 12, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end-game "killcam" highlight shown at the end of multiplayer matches has been changed to "Bronze Star", which show kills "deemed most impressive" (counted by most points gained in a row).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/2017/08/call-of-duty-wwii-ditches-endgame-killcam-for-something-better/|title=Call of Duty: WWII Ditches Endgame Killcam for Something Better|website=twinfinite.net|language=en|access-date=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception to this is the Search &amp; Destroy game mode, which does not use Bronze Star killcam. Search &amp; Destroy uses a final killcam, showing the last kill in the round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MichaelCondrey/status/907364158265376768|title=I'm way overdue on this, sorry. Yes, S&amp;D will be final killcam, not Bronze Star camera.|website=Twitter|last=Condrey|first=Michael|accessdate=September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new game mode, War, is introduced as a "narrative-driven" multiplayer game mode, developed in partnership with [[Raven Software]]. In War, two teams of 6 players perform objectives as either the Allied or Axis faction, inspired by some of the iconic World War II battles, such as storming Normandy on D-Day as the Allied, or defending the Normandy bunker as the Axis in the map Operation Neptune. In addition to War, popular game modes such as Team Deathmatch, Domination and Hardpoint return, as well as Gridiron, a "boots on the ground" variation of Uplink, which was originally introduced by Sledgehammer Games in ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]''. Several fan-favorite modes, as well as new modes, are introduced in time-limited events throughout the season, such as Demolition or Infected.

=== Nazi Zombies ===
''WWII'' includes a zombies cooperative game mode, similar to previous entries by Treyarch and [[Infinity Ward]], with its own original storyline set in alternate history and separate from the campaign. The game mode, dubbed ''Nazi Zombies'' in reference to its first iteration in Treyarch's ''[[Call of Duty: World at War]]'', is also set in the events of World War II, as the [[Third Reich]] makes a desperate attempt to turn the tide of the war by creating an undead army in the final stages of the war. While the mode is based on science-fiction and is a fictional take on the war, Sledgehammer Games co-founder Michael Condrey said that the story of the mode is based on some "real events". He also revealed that the experience is similar to [[Dead Space (2008 video game)|''Dead Space'']], a third person shooter horror video game directed by both Condrey and Schofield during their work time at [[EA Redwood Shores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://charlieintel.com/2017/06/03/call-duty-wwii-zombies-back-story-thats-based-real-events-similar-experience-dead-space/|title=Call of Duty: WWII Zombies has a 'back story that’s based on real events,' similar experience to Dead Space|last=Keshav|date=June 3, 2017|website=Charlie INTEL|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to gameplay, ''Nazi Zombies'' retains the wave-based survival formula that have been used in all previous Zombies entries, with new additions. A class system is introduced, where players can opt for one of four combat roles: Offense, Control, Medic and Support, which provide different in-game abilities. Class loadouts are also included, with equippable Raven Mods, which are perks similar to the multiplayer mode. Sledgehammer Games also attempted to rationalize some of the popular mechanics, such as weapon wallbuys and currencies, with realistic explanation that fit within the lore of the game mode. ''Nazi Zombies'' includes a hint system, where portions of the main story quest are given directional hints for players to find and progress. In regards to the story quest, Sledgehammer's creative director Cameron Dayton reveals that there is a "casual path" for new and casual players where they can progress with the story, while a "hardcore" path, which is considered the official canon, exists with hidden objectives, and expands more on the story beyond what the casual path contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbG8nWfz7Pc|title=Call of Duty: WWII - Zombies Interview|date=October 31, 2017|website=YouTube|access-date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
=== Campaign ===
On June 6, 1944, U.S. Army Private First Class Ronald "Red" Daniels (Brett Zimmerman) of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] takes part in the [[Normandy landings]] with his platoon, consisting of Private First Class Robert Zussman ([[Jonathan Tucker]]), Private Drew Stiles (Kevin Coubal), Technician Fifth Grader Frank Aiello (Jeff Schine), Technical Sergeant William Pierson ([[Josh Duhamel]]) and First Lieutenant Joseph Turner ([[Jeffrey Pierce]]). Zussman is stabbed by a German soldier, resulting in his hospitalization for several weeks.

Zussman returns to duty in time for [[Operation Cobra]], where American forces successfully push to reclaim the town of [[Marigny, Manche|Marigny]]. The platoon is ordered by Colonel Davis (Matt Riedy) to conduct an operation with British [[Special Operations Executive]] officers Major Arthur Crowley ([[David Alpay]]) and Vivian Harris (Helen Sadler) to intercept a German [[armored train]] carrying [[V2-rocket]]s. Daniels and Zussman successfully derail the train before being escorted back to their squad by [[French Resistance]] leader Camille "Rousseau" Denis ([[Bella Dayne]]).

A week later, Rousseau and Crowley infiltrate a German garrison in [[Paris]] to retrieve explosives in preparation for the platoon's assault upon it. Midway through, Rousseau kills [[SS and police leader|SS-und Polizeiführer]] Heinrich ([[J. Paul Boehmer]]) in retaliation for his murder of her family. The platoon [[Liberation of Paris|liberates Paris]].

Two months later, the platoon enters [[Battle of Aachen|Aachen]], and is saved from a German attack by support from tank commander Staff Sergeant Augustine Pérez (Christian Lanz). They are ordered to take over a German-occupied hotel. They discover civilians inside the hotel, and Turner orders their evacuation, to Pierson's dismay. A young girl named Anna (Lilith Max) goes missing, and Daniels rescues her. German soldiers open fire on a truck carrying the civilians, killing Anna's older sister. Pierson sends the truck away without protection, creating a rift with Turner.

At the [[Battle of Hürtgen Forest]], the platoon is ordered to take Hill 493. Turner splits the platoon into two groups; Pierson and Zussman are tasked with advancing towards the hill, while Turner and Daniels cover them until they can meet at the bottom. Turner's squad soon receives a transmission revealing that Pierson ordered an attack on the hill against Turner's orders, forcing Turner to join in. The platoon destroys artillery positions, but the Germans counterattack with a [[Tiger II]] tank. Daniels is knocked out trying to disable the tank, which is destroyed by Pérez. Turner is fatally wounded rescuing Daniels, and orders Daniels to abandon him while he covers the platoon's escape. In the aftermath of Turner's death, Pierson becomes head of the platoon and makes Daniels his second-in-command, promoting him to Corporal.

At the height of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the platoon is surrounded by Germans. Daniels meets an African-American technician, Howard (Russell Richardson), who helps the platoon contact air support. The platoon captures several German soldiers, and discovers that the Germans plan to destroy [[Ludendorff Bridge|a bridge]] at [[Remagen]], the last bridge over the [[Rhine]]. After destroying the explosives in transit, Pierson orders the platoon to attack a nearby air base to destroy the remaining explosives. The attack fails, resulting in Daniels and Zussman being surrounded by enemy troops. Daniels is saved by Howard, while Zussman is captured and taken to a German prisoner of war camp, [[Stalag IX-B]]. Daniels disobeys Pierson and attempts to pursue the German truck carrying Zussman, but ends up injuring himself in the process and letting the truck escape. He is hospitalized, with Pierson denying him from the platoon. In Stalag IX-B, Zussman is interrogated on his Jewish heritage by SS officer Metz (George Regout), is beaten and sent to a concentration camp.

After recovering for eight weeks, Daniels learns from Davis about the events that changed Pierson in the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]]: instead of recklessly leading his men to their deaths, like everyone thought, he risked his and his men's lives in vain to save part of his platoon that was trapped. Daniels later confronts Pierson in his tent and tears up his [[Military discharge|honorable discharge]] papers in order to rejoin the platoon. They successfully [[Battle of Remagen|capture the last bridge over the Rhine]]. The platoon heads into Germany, liberating concentration camps in search of Zussman, eventually reaching the [[Berga concentration camp]], which they find abandoned; the camp's survivors were sent on a [[death march]]. Daniels finds and saves Zussman by killing Metz before he can execute him.

At the end of the war, Daniels parts ways with his platoon and returns to [[Texas]], reuniting with his wife and newborn son. He visits the grave of his older brother, Paul ([[Chris Browning]]), who died while fighting a wolf when Red failed to shoot it in time. He places his [[Bronze Star]] medal on the grave, saying that his brother deserves it for teaching him how to fight for himself and for his brothers.

=== Nazi Zombies ===
Austrian engineer Marie Fischer ([[Katheryn Winnick]]) is sent on a mission to her hometown village of Mittelburg, [[Bavaria]] by her commanding officer, Major Hank Rideau (Darin De Paul), to retrieve lost artifacts stolen by the Nazis for experimentation, as well as rescue her brother, Klaus, who provided the information. Klaus has been unwillingly working with their lead scientist Peter Straub ([[Udo Kier]]) and weapons expert Colonel Heinz Richter (Tomm Voss) on a project to exploit a new energy dubbed "Geistkraft" (literal translation: ‘Spiritforce’) to assist the Nazi party's war efforts. Marie is accompanied by Scottish history professor turned art thief Drostan Hynd ([[David Tennant]]), Art Historian turned French Resistance fighter Olivia Durant ([[Élodie Yung]]) and United States Army captain Jefferson Potts ([[Ving Rhames]]), all of whom have significant knowledge on the stolen arts and relics. However, on their train ride to Mittelburg, the group is attacked by an unidentified colossal being. Marie is stranded from the others, and finds herself taking temporary refuge at a small house nearby, where she holds out against hordes of dead German soldiers reanimated by Geistkraft, until she is able to make her way to the village.

After reuniting with the other three, Marie and the crew proceed further down into the village's hidden bunker, where Straub has set up his laboratory. There, they fend off against Straub's undead horde, as well as Richter, whose obsession on weaponization of Geistkraft puts him at odds with Straub. Eventually, the group recovers the artifact, the Hilt of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick Barbarossa]]'s Sword. They then encounter the creature from earlier, a humanoid-shaped amalgam of numerous body parts sewn and stitched together, dubbed the Panzermörder (literal translation: 'Armor Killer'), with Klaus fused into the creature's chest. Using special magnetized batteries, the group manages to stun the Panzermörder and attach the batteries onto it. Richter's zeppelin, flying above the village, attempts to pull the batteries back, which pulls the creature along as well. The Panzermörder struggles to escape, and destroys the zeppelin and itself, freeing Klaus from its body. The Hilt's power somehow revives Klaus, but in a seemingly possessed state, he staggers into the village while ignoring Marie's pleas. He tells the crew to prevent "the Emperor"'s return, before activating a fire trap, disappearing in the engulfing flame.

Days later, the crew receives intel of Straub's sighting at the islands of [[Heligoland]], where he has been storing his undead army. They travel to the island in pursuit of Straub, as well as the next piece of Barbarossa's Sword. The crew comes into struggle with the Nazi [[Kriegsmarine]] forces protecting the island as well as Straub's latest undead creations, as he prepares for [[Operation Sea Lion|an assault on Britain]]. Upon solving several ancient riddles, they find a ritual chamber dedicated to the goddess [[Nerthus]], where they acquire the Pommel of Barbarossa's Sword. The crew then calls the British [[Royal Air Force]] in for an airstrike to destroy the facility on the island; in an effort to escape, they go up against the Meistermeuchlers (literal translation: Master Assassins), zombies that are engineered to adapt to their enemies' combat style and skills. After defeating the monstrous creatures, they manage to stow away on one of Straub's zeppelins, as he and his forces return to [[Berlin]] in response to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s call for rescue.

The zeppelins arrive at Berlin as the [[Red Army]] begins [[Battle of Berlin|their invasion into the city]]. Realizing that the Russians will be outmatched by the undead army, the crew grabs onto one of the zombie drop pods and lands onto the ground. After assisting the Red Army by drawing Straub's attention away from them, the four recover three Geistkraft-powered melee weapons hidden around the city by the Nazis. Using the weapons as keys, they uncover a hidden courtyard, where they find the final piece of Barbarossa's Sword, the Blade. With all parts of the Sword collected, the crew infiltrates Straub's zeppelin for a final showdown, where he ends up being overwhelmed and brutally killed by his own zombies. They battle against Straub's last creation, the Stadtjäger (literal translation: 'City Hunter'), then make it back to the city where they hold out against the endless zombie horde until Rideau arrives and extracts them.

In the wake of Straub's demise, the undead army is unleashed all across Europe. United States President [[Harry S. Truman]] authorizes Rideau, now General, to form the Bureau of Archaic Technologies, a special task force consisting of global elite Allied agents, in order to combat the new threat. Unable to reassemble the Sword of Barbarossa on their own, Marie and Drostan deduce that their only option is to find the legendary forge of [[Thule]]. Jefferson, now promoted to Major, leads the team to [[New Swabia]], [[Antarctica]], in search of the forge upon discovery of increased Nazi activity in the region. Rideau leads a team of new Bureau recruits to transport the pieces of the Sword by different routes to New Swabia. The B.A.T. operatives head to a port at [[Málaga]], [[Spain]], and board a ship across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Along the way, they encounter resistance from the undead army, but manage to prevail. At New Swabia, the crew find the forge, and upon successful deciphering of ancient Thulian runes, they finally reassemble the Sword after Rideau delivers the remaining pieces. Afterwards, the crew battles against the Guardian of the forge, and emerges victorious. The four manage to escape the forge as it collapses, but unbeknownst to them, Geistkraft energy begins to flow intensively beneath the area.

On their flight back from New Swabia, the crew's plane is shot by a bolt of Geistkraft lightning, and crash-lands near the site. They then find themselves within the Lost City of Thule, the source of the Geistkraft energy. The team uncovers ancient weapons once wielded by the Raven Lords, elite warriors who are meant to bring balance to a cycle of life and death, and uses them against the undead horde. B.A.T. agent Vivian Harris, who is sent by Rideau to recover Barbarossa's Sword from the crash, is driven insane by its power, and uses it to awaken the God King, a gigantic Thulian entity who claims to be the influence behind Straub as well as Barbarossa. The God King seemingly overpowers the four, but Klaus, who has been reborn as the Rook, arrives and charges them with Geistkraft, bestowing them the title of Raven Lords, allowing them to defeat the God King. Rideau then contacts the four, revealing his true status as a member of the Order of the Ravens, an ancient cult dedicated to serving the Raven Lords; he insists that they must now embrace their newfound titles and destiny, and lead the Order in the ongoing battle against the remaining undead forces.

== Development ==
''Call of Duty: World War II'' is the second game in the ''Call of Duty'' franchise developed by [[Sledgehammer Games]], and the third to benefit under publisher [[Activision]]'s three-year development cycle (the first being Sledgehammer's ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'') in order for a longer development time for each game. A new ''Call of Duty'' title set in World War II was alluded to in a 2014 ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'' launch interview with [[Michael Condrey]], co-founder of Sledgehammer Games. In the interview by ''Metro'', the interviewer asked him what the possibilities of where the next ''Call of Duty'' could go in terms of setting. Condrey responded, "Some of my favorite pieces of entertainment are set in World War II." ''[[Band of Brothers (miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'', I'm a massive fan of ''Band of Brothers''." Condrey dived further into the subject, "And that's a great hero's war, kind of the last that was recognized as a noble cause in a war. So yeah, I think a next generation game with the latest production values and robustness in a World War II setting like ''Band of Brothers'' would be amazing. Now, how would it play and how would the multiplayer work after the new movement set in ''Advanced Warfare''? That's a tougher question than I've had to tackle yet…".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/11/03/cod-advanced-warfare-michael-condrey-interview-fans-were-demanding-something-new-4932358/|title=COD: Advanced Warfare Michael Condrey interview|last=Metro.co.uk|first=David Jenkins for|date=November 3, 2014|website=Metro|access-date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sledgehammer Games was hesitant to reveal all the authentic settings from World War II that developers have put into the game's storyline. Activision initially refused to deny claims that [[Extermination camp|Nazi extermination camps]] would be featured in the game.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Adam Rosenberg of [[Mashable]] wrote that video games set during World War II tended to be "[[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]]" in the sense that they avoided broaching the subject for business reasons, but that this could be the very first ''Call of Duty'' World War II based game where [[the Holocaust]] would be depicted. Senior creative director Bret Robbins said in an interview "Some very, very dark things happened during this conflict and it felt wrong for us to ignore that." He further stated "We absolutely show atrocities. It's an unfortunate part of the history, but you can't tell an authentic, truthful story without going there. So we went there." Robbins argued that audiences can now handle games with more maturity and nuance, "People are ready for it. They want it", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/04/26/call-of-duty-wwii-holocaust-interview/|title='Call of Duty: WWII' won't ignore the Holocaust anymore|last=Rosenberg|first=Adam|date=April 26, 2017|website=Mashable|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/fast-forward/370790/new-world-war-ii-call-of-duty-video-game-will-depict-the-holocaust/|title=New ‘Call Of Duty’ Video Game Will Depict The Holocaust|last=Pink|first=Aiden|date=May 3, 2017|work=The Forward|access-date=June 16, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked directly over [[Twitter]] as to whether or not the story campaign would allow gamers the opportunity to play as soldiers from the Axis powers such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Fascist Italy]], Sledgehammer Games confirmed that the campaign gameplay would be limited to Allied forces. More specifically, Sledgehammer co-founder Michael Condrey confirmed that the game will focus exclusively on the Allied powers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/617792/Call-of-Duty-WW2-gameplay-campaign-story-release-date-beta|title=Call of Duty WW2: Bosses reveal the one gameplay feature they WON'T include|last=Wright|first=James|date=May 28, 2017|work=Daily Star|access-date=June 16, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Windows version of the game was developed in a collaboration with [[Raven Software]]. In regards to it, Raven's CTO Dwight Luetscher stated that they were trying to focus on the Windows platform, as well as the community, by responding to their needs for it to excel. The Windows version features several notable changes, including removal of controller aim assist and addition of sensitivity slider for aim-down-sights mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-duty-wwii-devs-this-is-the-year-that-were-going-to-give-it-our-best-shot-to-win-the-hearts-and-minds-of-the-pc-community/|title=Call of Duty: WWII devs want to 'win the hearts and minds of the PC community'|last=Fenlon|first=Wes|date=September 28, 2017|work=PC Gamer|access-date=September 28, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Call of Duty: WWII'' received "generally favorable" reviews from critics for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while the PC version received "mixed or average" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCXONE"/&gt;

Miguel Concepcion of ''[[GameSpot]]'' awarded the game a 9/10, writing that the campaign was "moving" and "salutes the brotherhood that grows and strengthens on the battlefield", while praising the game's "excellent visuals and sound design".&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Daniel Tack from ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game a 8.75/10, stating that he felt the campaign was the only drawback overall; despite capturing a "signature explosive feel through various adrenaline-fueled moments", he thought progression felt tedious as a result of "standard gunplay and endless killing fields". He praised the multiplayer as the "shining star of the three modes", especially enjoying the game's new War mode in terms of its variety, and highlighted the return to the traditional gameplay and range of customization options.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

In his 8.5/10 review for ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGMNow]]'', Nick Plasses wrote that the campaign's protagonists were "well characterized and [...] the cause for the game's most impactful conflicts". He praised the lack of regenerating health which gave the game "new levels of strategy and exploration, ultimately adding more entertainment than frustration", and that the reliance on fellow soldiers "necessitates more strategic positioning and resource management".&lt;ref name="EGM"/&gt; ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Miranda Sanchez awarded the game 8/10, saying the campaign was a "more human perspective than we've seen in recent years", with interesting and diverse characters. However, she criticized its conflicting tone, as well as several repetitive and frustrating missions. She wrote that the Zombies was the standout mode in the game, which helped strike "a rewarding balance for the diehard zombies fans [...] and those that just want to jump in and have a good time", although criticized that the experience suffered when playing with other people.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Chris Moyse praised the game as a "satisfying experience" and the campaign as "one of the series' best in some time", but felt that "it also makes little effort to overhaul the brand as a whole, playing it incredibly safe when the opportunity for reinvention was right there for the taking."&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'}}s Russ Frushtick generally praised the multiplayer, calling it "strong and enjoyable", but criticized the campaign, writing that "just about every mission feels like déjà vu, as if I'd played it before in another game" and that "Changing the time period so dramatically only helps to highlight how little has changed since the franchise's total re-imagining with ''Call of Duty 4''."&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; Jeff Gerstmann of ''[[Giant Bomb]]'' was more critical of the game as a whole, stating that "despite all of Activision's big talk about "boots on the ground" action and how this was going to be some big deal, the setting change didn't bring any new and exciting inspiration with it. This feels like the most wheel-spinning, by-the-numbers ''Call of Duty'' they've made thus far."&lt;ref name="GB"/&gt;

''[[Eurogamer]]'' ranked the game 38th on their list of the "Top 50 Games of 2017",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eurogamer staff |date=December 27, 2017 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-27-eurogamers-top-50-games-of-2017-40-31 |title=Eurogamer's Top 50 Games of 2017: 40-31 |publisher=''[[Eurogamer]]'' |accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''EGMNow'' ranked it 20th in their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=EGM staff |date=December 28, 2017 |url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/features/egms-best-of-2017-part-two-20-16/ |title=EGM's Best of 2017: Part Two: #20 ~ #16 |publisher=EGMNow |accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was nominated for "Best Shooter", "Best Graphics", "Best Multiplayer" and "Best Spectator Game" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_Shooter |title=Best of 2017 Awards: Best Shooter |publisher=IGN |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_Graphics |title=Best of 2017 Awards: Best Graphics |publisher=IGN |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_Multiplayer |title=Best of 2017 Awards: Best Multiplayer |publisher=IGN |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/best-of-2017-awards/Best_Spectator_Game |title=Best of 2017 Awards: Best Spectator Game |publisher=IGN |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swatting incident===
{{Main|2017 Wichita swatting}}
Not long after ''WWII'' was released, a fatal incident occurred in which an online player, Casey Viner, angered over friendly fire that ruined an online match in a tournament that cost $1.50 in betting, called up Tyler Barriss to [[Swatting|swat]] his partner Shane Gaskill.  Fearing harm, Gaskill attempted to deflect Viner's swatting by providing a previous address, only to later discover in horror that the police forces Barriss summoned ended up killing an uninvolved individual there, Andrew Finch.&lt;ref name="Queally"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-kansas-swatting-records-20180126-story.html|title=Fictitious shooting in video game sparked real-life shooting in Kansas swatting case, records show

The '''Canadian International Air Show''' (CIAS) is an annual [[air show]] that has been held at the conclusion of the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE) in [[Toronto]] since 1949. Aircraft from Canada and the United States, as well as other countries, perform over [[Lake Ontario]] for three days in September.

==History==
Toronto was the site of numerous air shows as the city developed into a centre of air transportation and aircraft manufacturing in the early twentieth century. The Canadian International Air Show began in 1946 when the National Aeronautical Association of Canada attracted overflow crowds to a show at [[de Havilland Canada]] manufacturing plant at [[Toronto/Downsview Airport|Downsview Airport]]. Staged annually thereafter, the air show moved to [[Exhibition Place]] in 1949, and became a regular feature of the CNE in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontohistory.org/Pages_ABC/Canadian_International_Air_Show.html Toronto's Historical Plaques – Canadian International Air Show] Retrieved April 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==

[[File:Michael Wiskus in the Lucas Oil Pitts Special. (6118299773) (3).jpg|thumb|[[Pitts Special]] at the 2011 show]]
The official CIAS takes place over the [[Public holidays in Canada|Canadian Labour Day Weekend]], which coincides with the closing weekend of the CNE. The start time for the show is scheduled for 12:00&amp;nbsp;pm with the show ending at approximately 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm each afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cias.org/faq/|title=Canadian International Air Show - Toronto Air Show - Frequently Asked Questions|work=cias.org|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIAS practice session is usually held on the day before the official CIAS, taking place between 10:00&amp;nbsp;am and 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm&lt;ref name="hp" &gt;[http://www.cias.org/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/ CIAS Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is performed over Lake Ontario directly south of Exhibition Place. It can be best viewed from Exhibition Place or [[Ontario Place]], although the show is visible from any other lakefront site, especially [[Marilyn Bell Park]] or [[Coronation Park (Toronto)|Coronation Park]]. Performers fly in from [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson]], as well as the [[Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport|island airport]] on nearby [[Toronto Islands]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Admission to the air show is free; however, viewing from Exhibition Place requires paid admission to these sites.&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;[http://www.cias.org/content/view/35/45/ CIAS FAQs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329001138/http://www.cias.org/content/view/35/45/ |date=March 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no static display of aircraft.&lt;ref name="faqs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cias.org/content/blogcategory/16/32/ CIAS Show Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408092356/http://www.cias.org/content/blogcategory/16/32 |date=April 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A photo tour at Pearson had been introduced in 1993 and a full static display in 1996. Although a success, the display was cancelled by the time of the 1998 air show.&lt;ref name="50years"&gt;[http://www.canadianinternationalairshow.com/PressReleases/2000-CIASHistory.asp 1949–1999 CIAS at the CNE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214130321/http://www.canadianinternationalairshow.com/PressReleases/2000-CIASHistory.asp |date=February 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local opposition===
Toronto media have noted that the airshow is not popular with local residents and that there is widespread opposition to it, due to the noise and pollution it creates. The [[Toronto Star]] noted, "that in a city with a large population of refugee newcomers and people who have experienced the trauma of war it is insulting, invasive, and violent".&lt;ref name="BlogTO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2016/09/someone_keeps_trolling_the_air_shows_wikipedia_page/|title=Someone keeps trolling the Air Show's Wikipedia page|work=blogto.com|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2016/08/25/air-show-too-traumatic-for-newcomers-who-escaped-war.html|title=Air show too traumatic for newcomers who escaped war - Toronto Star|work=thestar.com|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Now"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/think-free-blog/10-people-who-hate-the-goddamn-toronto-air-show/|title=10 People Who Hate The Goddamn Toronto Air Show|work=Now Magazine|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wikipedia article vandalism in protest===
Since 2012, during the airshow weekend, the Wikipedia article about the show has been repeatedly vandalized as a form of protest against the airshow, a phenomenon noted by the local Toronto media.&lt;ref name="BlogTO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Now"/&gt;

==Accidents and incidents during air display==

*1946: United States P-80 Shooting Star overstressed during aerial display with wrinkles actually appearing in the fuselage.  Aircraft was returned to Dayton on flatbed truck.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Daniel V. ''A Tradition of Excellence: Canada's Airshow Team Heritage''. Victoria, BC: High Flight Enterprises, 2002. p. 45. {{ISBN|0-9687817-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 20, 1952: [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] [[Avro Canada CF-100]] Mk.3T  piloted by S/L R.D. Schultz made a 500-knot high speed pass with vertical pull up, which overstressed the aircraft. The aircraft recovered to [[CFB North Bay|North Bay]] successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Daniel V. ''A Tradition of Excellence: Canada's Airshow Team Heritage''. Victoria, BC: High Flight Enterprises, 2002. p. 89. {{ISBN|0-9687817-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*September 19, 1953: Royal Canadian Air Force [[Canadair Sabre]] 4, piloted by S/L W.R. Greene crashed into Lake Ontario, killing the pilot.  The accident aircraft attempted loop recovery without sufficient altitude and hit Lake Ontario. A T-33 formation team also performing in the show shortened their performance due to low cloud and rain, and had entered clouds during looping maneuvers.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Daniel V.

Toronto Harbour Police (THP) Leading Hand (L/H) Richard Riekstins dove into the water three times before extracting Benedik from the wreck.  Benedik was unconscious and without a pulse when loaded into a rescue boat.  Rescuers successfully revived Benedik with external heart massage and mouth to nose artificial resuscitation (due to facial injuries).  L/H Riekstins was later presented the Toronto Harbour Police Commissioners' Award of Merit medal for "heroism and dedication to duty".&lt;ref&gt;[The Toronto Star Monday, September 6, 1976 "Air crash horrifies thousands at CNE"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circus Flora'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circusflora.org/ |title=Circus Flora |publisher=Circus Flora |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a One-Ring [[circus]] based in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], United States. It is a non-profit organization. Circus Flora has become a touring show yet it performs annually in St. Louis, usually at the beginning of the month of June. It combines the venue of a one-ring circus with the performance trappings of [[theater]].  Performances include [[aerialist]]s, [[Equestrianism|equestrian artists]], [[acrobatics|acrobats]], and trained animals.  Each performance is accompanied by a live band.  Live musicians allow the mood to be tailored to the live events happening in the ring — down to every crash of the cymbal or beat of the snare drum.

Circus Flora is styled after old [[Eastern-European]] circuses. For many years, Circus Flora has featured many and various members of the renowned [[Flying Wallendas]] family.
The ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' described the 2007 performance as, "an entertaining mixture of thoroughly professional performances and 'Let's put on a show in the old barn.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/reviews.nsf/stage/story/D88CCFEB0C3DCA6E862572F6005ED1F9?OpenDocument ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circus Flora's 2007 show was also reviewed by the student newspaper of the [[University of Missouri-St. Louis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thecurrentonline.com/media/storage/paper304/news/2007/06/11/ArtsAndEntertainment/Circus.Flora.Suspensful.Unforgetable-2913888.shtml |accessdate=June 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231831/http://media.www.thecurrentonline.com/media/storage/paper304/news/2007/06/11/ArtsAndEntertainment/Circus.Flora.Suspensful.Unforgetable-2913888.shtml |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days==
Circus Flora was first performed as a commissioned work for the 1986 [[Spoleto Festival USA]], an annual celebration of the performing and visual arts in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  Based upon its favorable reception, it was then founded as a permanent organization by Ivor David Balding, Sheila and Sam Jewell and Alexandre Sacha Pavlata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cirquepassion.com/Alexandre%20Sacha%20Pavlata%20Bio.htm |title=Alexandre Sacha Pavlata Master Trapeze Artist &amp; Aerialist Bio Cirque Passion Boston-based |publisher=Cirquepassion.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its intended mission is to both entertain and to educate.

Circus Flora made [[St. Louis, Missouri]] its home in 1987 with assistance from Vince Schoemehl, the mayor of St. Louis at that time, and Richard Gaddes, then president of Grand Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandcenter.org/ |title=The Intersection of Art and Life &amp;#124; Saint Louis Missouri |publisher=Grand Center |date=2014-08-18 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  St. Louis's creative and cultural district. Since then, the Circus Arts Foundation of Missouri (CAFM) has been the parent non-profit organization under which Circus Flora operates.

==Namesake==
Flora, the Elephant, is the namesake of Circus Flora.  The circus was named after Flora, the orphaned baby African elephant Balding had rescued two years earlier when ivory poachers in Africa killed her mother.
For 15 years, Flora the elephant was a star of the circus. In 2000, she retired from stage life, and is now a resident of the Elephant Sanctuary in [[Hohenwald, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elephants.com/tange_zula/african_press_release.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614100858/http://www.elephants.com/tange_zula/african_press_release.htm |date=June 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic extent of performances==
Circus Flora has performed in the following cities:
[[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]; The [[Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; The [[Spoleto Festival USA]]; [[Houston, Texas]]; [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]; [[Cooperstown, New York]]; [[Norfolk, Virginia]]; [[Nantucket Island]]; and several other locations.

==Education==
Circus Flora has cultivated education in the Circus Arts since its inception. One significant collaboration of Circus Flora's is its working relationship with The St. Louis Arches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circusday.org/arches/index.html |accessdate=June 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211082818/http://circusday.org/arches/index.html |archivedate=February 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an acrobatic troupe sponsored by Circus Day Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://circusday.org/cgi-bin/cdf.cgi ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713211605/http://circusday.org/cgi-bin/cdf.cgi |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comedy rock''' is rock music mixed with [[Comedy music|comedy]], often satire and parody.&lt;ref name=AllmusicComedyRock&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul'' (Backbeat Books, 3rd Edition., 2002), pp. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early bands and songs===
Early American examples include [[Stan Freberg]], who lampooned artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Harry Belafonte]] and [[The Platters]], and [[Sheb Wooley]]. The latter's "[[Purple People Eater]]" reached No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop chart in 1958 and stayed there 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Bronson  | first = Fred  | title = The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits: The Inside Story Behind Every Number  | publisher = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]  | year = 2003  | isbn = 0-8230-7677-6  | page = 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain during the 1950s and early 1960s comedians such as [[Charlie Drake]] and [[The Goons]] frequently appeared in the top ten with humorous rock 'n' roll records—the latter, along with [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Edward Lear]], were to influence the word-play of [[John Lennon]]'s lyrics. Later British groups specialised in comedy: these included [[The Scaffold]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] and [[Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias]]. Later in Britain, in the 2000s, [[Mitch Benn]] released several studio albums that satirised current affairs using various musical genres, but mainly rock. His 2012 ''Breaking Strings'' album was critically acclaimed for its rock sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John-Paul |last=Stephenson |title=CD Review: Mitch Benn &amp; The Distractions – Breaking Strings.|url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2012/02/cd-review-mitch-benn-the-distractions-breaking-strings/ |work=Giggle Beats |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allmusic]] described [[Frank Zappa]] as the "godfather" of comedy rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pop rock]] and [[folk rock]] band [[The Turtles]] released a comedy rock album, ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'', in 1968, though the band had previously incorporated humor into their songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic |class=album |id=r20668 |tab=review |label="''The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands'' &gt; Review" |Michael |last=Ofjord |accessdate={{date|2011-09-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its members, [[Howard Kaylan]] and [[Mark Volman]] later performed more explicitly comedic songs as [[Flo &amp; Eddie]] with their own band and with Frank Zappa.

===Contemporary bands===
Several modern comedy rock bands have experienced mainstream commercial success. Duos [[Tenacious D]] and [[Flight of the Conchords]] both released platinum-selling albums and starred in their own respective comedic television series. [[Dan Finnerty]] with his [[The Dan Band]] has made comedy rock appearances in the [[Todd Phillips]] films ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'' and ''[[The Hangover]]'' spoofing "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]" and "[[Candy Shop]]", as well as his live show, which parodies female cover songs and was filmed as a one-hour TV special directed by [[McG]] and executive produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]. [[Stephen Lynch (musician)|Stephen Lynch]] from New York developed a following with several Opie and Anthony appearances which led to two specials on Comedy Central. He performed on Broadway with the production of Grease.

With over 12 million albums sold, song parodist [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] remains the highest-selling comedy act in history, with his 2014 album ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' having debuted at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the first comedy album to do so since [[Allan Sherman]]{{'}}s ''[[My Son, the Nut]]'' in 1963.&lt;ref name="billboardnews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6176745/weird-al-yankovic-billboard-200-mandatory-fun-number-one | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Gets First No. 1 Album On Billboard 200 with 'Mandatory Fun' | first = Keith | last = Caulfield | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 23, 2014 |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has been the target of many [[Parody|spoof]]s and several spoof bands have gone on to have hit records, for example [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] in the U.S., and [[The Hee Bee Gee Bees]] and [[Bad News (band)|Bad News]] in the UK. The band [[Steel Panther]] has become a fixture on the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Sunset Strip]] with their parody of 80s [[glam metal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feeling The Steel Panther: Interview with Michael Starr |publisher=The Aquarian Weekly |date=4 October 2009 |work=Nightlife |url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2009/10/04/interview-steel-panther-michael-starr-feeling-the-steel/ | accessdate=10 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success has opened the doors for other spoof bands such as [[The Jimi Homeless Experience]]. Other spoof bands such as [[Dread Zeppelin]], [[Beatallica]] and [[Those Darn Accordions]] rely on unusual or intentionally contrasting genre-mixing for comic effect. Comedy rock duo [[Ninja Sex Party]], who have collaborated with Steel Panther on occasion, blend rock and [[synthpop]] and have produced songs that parody the [[dubstep]] and heavy metal genres. They have enjoyed success from their online popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/ |last=Milne |first=Gregory |title=Ninja Sex Party: Tales of Strawberries and Cream |date=11 July 2013 |newspaper=Living Myth Magazine |publisher=Living Myth Magazine |accessdate=29 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525175156/http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/ |archivedate=25 May 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another band, [[Primus (band)|Primus]], is known for their wacky lyrics and comedic music videos.

Many bands within the [[alternative rock]] and [[college rock]] spectrum are known for their incorporation of humorous and satirical songs, with bands such as [[They Might Be Giants]], [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], [[Bloodhound Gang]], [[System of a Down]], [[Ween]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]] finding both mainstream and independent success in the United States, as well as successful foreign bands such as [[Parokya ni Edgar]] and [[Knorkator]].

[[Punk rock]] and [[pop punk]] has made its contribution to the comedy rock ranks, with such bands as [[The Aquabats]], [[Blink-182]], [[Bowling for Soup]], [[Patent Pending (band)|Patent Pending]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[The Dead Milkmen]], [[The Meatmen]] and [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads]]. [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] has also produced many humor-oriented and satirical bands, including [[Green Jellÿ]], [[Lawnmower Deth]], [[Massacration]], [[M.O.D.]], [[Big Dumb Face]], [[Psychostick]], Crotchduster, [[Ludichrist]] and [[Scatterbrain (band)|Scatterbrain]], while other bands like [[Gwar]] and [[Rosemary's Billygoat]] utilize outrageous costumes and over-the-top stage shows. The [[virtual band]] [[Dethklok]] is [[death metal]] spoof featured in the [[Adult Swim]] animated TV Show ''[[Metalocalypse]]''&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p882076|pure_url=yes}} allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and their album entitled ''[[The Dethalbum]]'' debuted at No. 21 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 list.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=642&amp;Itemid=2 Dethalbum Debuts At #21 On Billboard Top 200] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705003124/http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=642&amp;Itemid=2 |date=5 July 2009 }}" 9 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dino Island''''' (also known as '''''Dino Tycoon''''') is a 2002 PC [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Monte Cristo (company)|Monte Cristo]].

==Story==
In a more or less near future,  
scientists have managed to recreate dinosaurs. In order to fund research, government has set up [[dinosaur]]-themed [[amusement parks]] that the player will manage.

==Gameplay==
''Dino Island'' is a theme park simulator not unlike [[Theme Park (computer game)|''Theme Park'']], ''[[Roller Coaster Tycoon]]'', or even ''[[Zoo Tycoon]]''. However, it is rendered in full 3D - players can rotate, pan and zoom at will. Dinosaurs, staff and visitors are fully animated. The game uses a typical point and click and menu interface.

===Breeding dinosaurs===
In ''Dino Island'', there are 20 pure, historical dinosaur species, including ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', ''[[Troodon]]'', ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'', ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'', ''[[Iguanodon]]'', ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', and ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]''. The dinosaurs are classified in 6 families: large carnivorous, armored quadrupeds, light bipeds, etc.

The player can mix any two dinosaurs to create a new one. The resulting creature will be a [[genetics|genetic]] mix of its parents: it will inherit features from both of them, based on [[Dominance relationship|genetic dominance]]. Each dinosaur is made of many parts: legs, arms, head, etc. Each part of the resulting dinosaur will also be a mix between that of its parents. For instance, the mix of a ''[[Diplodocus]]'' and a ''[[Triceratops]]'' will have a head in between that of its parents. [[Mutation]]s can also occur, either accidentally or, when the player masters the technology, voluntarily. Mutations include feathers, extra horns, weird scales, and the like.

===Visitors===
Visitors also come in several categories, which all have likes and dislikes. For instance, kids like cute dinosaurs but do not like big ones, hooligans like to see dinosaur fights from up close but do not like peaceful dinosaurs, pensioners like diverse dinosaurs but not too much action, etc.

Every item in the game, dinosaurs, attraction or park installation, radiates several attributes like comfort, fear or cuteness, which will attract or repel different visitor types. Visitors will move in the park according to their needs. For instance, if the player's park has many other older visitors, it is not a good idea to put a path to the feeding dish and the shops next to the most violent dinosaurs, as they will hesitate to go that way.

===Park management===
The game also has a light park management aspect. The player can build facilities that sell stuff, enclosures to put the dinosaurs in and has to manage staff that will feed the dinosaurs, among other things. As this was not the focus of the game, there are very few options in that department, compared to other games in that category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="908">'''Dobl Transmitter''' was a facility for medium wave broadcasting at [[Dobl]], [[Styria]], [[Austria]], built in 1939–1941. It used as antenna a 156-metre (511&amp;nbsp;ft) high guyed mast of lattice steel, which was guyed in two levels at 113 and 73&amp;nbsp;metres (371 and 240&amp;nbsp;ft). Dobl Transmitter was shut down in 1984 and is now a technical museum.

'''European Rover Challenge"", "ERC"''' – the biggest space – robotics event in Europe, dedicated to the scientific and business world, the new technology industry and the wide audience. Since 2014 ERC is organized each year in Poland at the initiative of the Polish branch of [[Mars Society|The Mars Society]].

The main core of ERC is international Mars rovers competition, destinated for students and recent graduates of higher education from all around the world. European Rover Challenge as well as [[University Rover Challenge]] (the American equivalent of this competition) is a part of Rover Challenge Series – the most prestigious robotics challenge league, powered by The Mars Society.

The aim of the European Rover Challenge is to encourage students of technical universities to develop their potential through participation in the prestigious competition. The ERC also performs a kind of mission: the promotion of talented engineers. Taking up the challenge of building the rover destined for [[Mars]] exploration which meets certain conditions specified in the rules of the competition and presenting the model in front of jury of experts in robotics, planetary geology, communication and cosmonautics is for young scientists a unique opportunity to develop their career.
[[File:ERC 2015 Mars Rover Design Team Maintenance Task - Reactor Part I 9.JPG|thumb]]
According to the ERC rules&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Competition Rules|url = http://roverchallenge.eu/en/rules-2/|website = European Rover Challenge|access-date = 2016-02-14|language = en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are a few tasks to complete by rover teams during the competition:
# A science task involving obtaining and analyzing samples
# A “blind” navigation task, in which the team will have to guide the rover to a certain destination using just GPS coordinates and no camera input
# Two engineering tasks that will require using and repairing equipment
# Presentation of the project in front of jury

During all of the tasks, the teams will have to control their rovers without seeing them directly.

== The ERC target audience ==
European Rover Challenge is an event aimed not only for the Mars rovers builders participating in the competition. Adding to the program some extra points, such as the science – technology conference, science presentations, expert’s lectures and meetings with special guests resulted in the interest of a very large and diverse target group. In 2014 in ERC took part 25 000 people, in the next edition - ERC 2015 - 30 000.

== The ERC history ==
European Rover Challenge is organized since 2014. Both organized editions (2014 and 2015) of the event have been held in Świętokrzyskie voivodeship, in the Regional Science–Technology Centre. In order to properly adapt the landscape to the character of the competition, each time to the place were transported over 750 tons of the red soil imitating the Red Planet cover. Since 2016 ERC is held in Congress and Exhibition Center in Podkarpackie voivodeship, Poland
[[File:Harrison Shmitt on ERC.jpg|thumb]]
Each year in the event take part special guests. In previous editions of ERC they were among others: dr [[Harrison Schmitt]] – Apollo 17 crew, prof. Scott Hubbard, ex. Head of NASA Ames, dr [[Robert Zubrin]], The Mars Society Founder and dr Gianfranco Visentin, Head of Automation and Robotics Section, [[European Space Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Success of European Rover Challenge|url = http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2015/1016-the-success-of-european-rover-challenge.html|website = www.planetary.org|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During ERC 2015 has been organized also a unique videomeeting with [[Andy Weir]], an American novelist, author of [[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11604">[[File:Fake Shemp comic.jpg|thumb|350px|right]]
'''Fake Shemp''', or simply '''Shemp''', is someone who appears in a film as a replacement for another actor or person. Their appearance is disguised using methods such as heavy make-up (or a computer-generated equivalent), filming from the back, dubbing in audio and splicing in past footage from the original actor's previous work, using a [[sound-alike]] [[voice actor]], or using partial shots of the actor. The concept is named after [[Shemp Howard]], whose sudden death in 1955 necessitated the use of these techniques to finish the films to which he was already committed. Once somewhat commonplace throughout the 20th century, the use of Fake Shemps to emulate living people is now forbidden under [[Screen Actors Guild]] contracts, largely because of a lawsuit filed by [[Crispin Glover]] that determined that the method violates the original actor's [[personality rights]]. The method continues to be used in cases, such as Shemp's, where the original actor is deceased and permission from the deceased actor's estate is granted.

A fake Shemp is distinguished from a [[stunt double]]. Stunt doubles usually only substitute for an actor in select scenes where the original actor is either unable to perform the stunt or is unwilling to take the risk of being injured in the stunt. The same techniques are often used for both.

==Origin==
The term references the comedy trio [[The Three Stooges]]. On November 22, 1955, Stooge [[Shemp Howard]] died suddenly of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at age 60. At the time, the Stooges still had four shorts left to deliver (''[[Rumpus in the Harem]]'', ''[[Hot Stuff (1956 film)|Hot Stuff]]'', ''[[Scheming Schemers]]'', and ''[[Commotion on the Ocean]]''), by the terms of their annual contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]. By this point in the trio's career, budget cuts at Columbia had forced them to make heavy use of [[stock footage]] from previously completed shorts, so they were able to complete the films without Shemp. New footage was filmed of the other two Stooges ([[Moe Howard]] and [[Larry Fine]]) and edited together with stock footage. When continuity required that Shemp appear in the new scenes, they used Columbia supporting player [[Joe Palma]] to be a [[body double]] for him, often appearing only from behind or with an object obscuring his face.&lt;ref&gt;Lenburg, Jeff; Howard Maurer, Joan; Lenburg, Greg; (1982). ''The Three Stooges Scrapbook'', Citadel Press. {{ISBN|0-8065-0946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Palma is often mistakenly cited as Shemp's stand-in, but these four shorts are the only documented times he performed in this capacity. Palma was a [[bit player|bit character actor]] and was not employed as a stand-in or double during Shemp's lifetime. Shemp's stand-in was usually Harold Breen, and there were others from time to time. But these four shorts required someone to double as Shemp in an actor's capacity, not a stand-in as such; hence, director [[Jules White]] utilized character actor Palma, who had appeared as a supporting character in numerous ''Three Stooges'' shorts before Shemp's death and would continue in that capacity for the trio's shorts with [[Joe Besser]] as the third stooge. Palma became the original "Fake Shemp", although the term was not officially in use at the time.&lt;ref name="stoogeology"&gt;{{cite book |last=Seely |first=Peter |last2=Pieper |first2=Gail W. |title=Stoogeology: Essays on the Three Stooges |year=2007 |publisher= McFarland |isbn=0-7864-2920-8 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Stooge films==
===''Rumpus in the Harem''===
For ''[[Rumpus in the Harem]]'', Palma is seen from the back several times. The first time occurs in the restaurant when Moe declares that the trio must do something to help their sweethearts. Larry then concludes the conversation by saying "I've got it, I've got it!" Moe inquires with "What?" Larry replies, "a terrific headache!" Later, Palma is seen from the back being chased in circles by the palace guard. A few lines of dialogue appear — "Whoa, Moe, Larry! Moe, help!" — by dubbing Shemp's voice from the soundtracks of ''[[Fuelin' Around]] ''and ''[[Blunder Boys]]''. Palma was later seen from the side when staring up at the Harem girls (they allowed half his face to be shown because he was farther from the camera than Moe or Larry).

Palma is seen one final time, making a mad dash for the open window, and supplying his own yell before making the final jump. This was one of the few times during his tenure as Shemp's double that Palma was required to speak without the aid of dubbing.

===''Hot Stuff''===
For ''[[Hot Stuff (1956 film)|Hot Stuff]]'', Palma is seen several times. The first time occurs when the Stooges, disguised in beards, are trolling through office hallways. Moe instructs Shemp to pursue a suspicious looking girl, to which Palma grunts "Right!" He then walks off-camera, allowing Moe and Larry to finish the scene by themselves. This is the only time Palma was shown from the front in a near shot, but since his secret agent character was wearing a fake beard at the time, his face was concealed.

Later, Palma is seen from the back while the boys are locked in the laboratory. Palma attempts to imitate Shemp's famed cry of "Heep, heep, heep!". Again, Moe directs Shemp, this time to guard the door. Palma obliges, mutters a few additional "Heep, heep, heeps!," and hides behind the door. This brief scene was the largest speaking part Palma performed in his own voice while acting as Shemp.

===''Scheming Schemers''===
For ''[[Scheming Schemers]]'', Palma appears for the shot of "Shemp" honking a truck horn. Palma gathers several pipes, obstructing his face, and one line of dialogue ("Hold yer horses, will ya?") is dubbed in Shemp's voice from [[The Ghost Talks (1949 film)|''The Ghost Talks'']]. Shemp is absent from several scenes. In one scene, Larry, upon hearing that a valuable piece of art has been stolen, whispers to Moe, "Where's Shemp? He loves pictures!" Moe mutters, "I think he's upstairs," explaining away Shemp's absence for the next few minutes.

===''Commotion on the Ocean''===
For ''[[Commotion on the Ocean]]'', Palma appears in only one new shot during the newspaper office scene. After Larry says, "Oh, I know Smitty: 'Under the spreading chestnut tree, the village smitty stands'," Moe slaps him. Palma gets involved in the slapstick exchange and shields himself in defense, obstructing his face. 

Other new footage throughout the film consists of Moe and Larry working as a duo, often discussing Shemp's absence aloud:

*'''Moe''': "I wonder what became of that Shemp?" 
*'''Larry''': "You know he went on deck to scout out some food." 
*'''Moe''': "Oh, yeah. That's right."

==First usage==
Aspiring filmmaker [[Sam Raimi]], a professed Stooges fan, coined the term in his first feature-length movie ''[[The Evil Dead]]''.&lt;ref name=torstar&gt;{{cite news | title = Should the Stooges get a little brighter?; New DVD lets viewers see colourized version Modern directors decry new-look numbskulls | author = David Germain | newspaper = Toronto Star | date = Aug 10, 2004 | page = D.08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his crew and cast abandoned the project after major delays (mostly due to budget issues) pushed production well beyond the scheduled six weeks.  He was forced to use himself, his die-hard friends [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Rob Tapert]], [[Josh Becker]], assistant David Goodman, and brother [[Ted Raimi]] as "fake Shemps".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Bruce; (2001).

Sam Raimi's later productions in film and TV have also often used the term to refer to stand-ins or nameless characters. For example, 15 fake Shemps were included in the credits for ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', Raimi's second sequel to ''The Evil Dead''.&lt;ref name=philenq&gt;{{cite news | title = A Trip Into the Macabre With 3 Stooges | author = staff | newspaper = Philadelphia Inquirer | date = February 19, 1993 | page = 03 (weekend features section)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description is sometimes modified in the final credits; in ''[[Darkman]]'', Bruce Campbell's quick [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in the final scene is credited as "Final Shemp", and Campbell was also credited as "Shemp Wooley" (a pun on singer [[Sheb Wooley]]) when doing the voice of "Jean-Claude the Carrier Parrot" in the short-lived TV series ''[[Jack of All Trades (TV series)|Jack of All Trades]]''.

==Examples==
There have been many Fake Shemps over the years. One of the earliest, in an example that predates its use to replace Shemp, was in the film ''[[Saratoga (film)|Saratoga]]'', in which the illness and death of star [[Jean Harlow]] necessitated the filming of scenes with a voice and body double. Director [[Ed Wood]] used his wife's chiropractor, Tom Mason, in the 1959 cult classic ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' as a stand-in for the deceased [[Bela Lugosi]]. 

In the 1981 film ''[[Superman II]]'', actor [[Gene Hackman]], who had finished the majority of his scenes playing [[Lex Luthor]], left the project following the departure of the film's original director, [[Richard Donner]]. After replacement director [[Richard Lester]] took over production, a Shemp was used for Hackman to finish his remaining scenes. This was accomplished by an uncredited actor standing in for Hackman, though not ever facing the camera, while also impersonating Hackman's voice.

The death of actor [[John Candy]] forced the use of a fake Shemp to complete filming of ''[[Wagons East|Wagons East!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19940819&amp;id=XAUxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P-AFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3171,4419349] {{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is from the 1989 film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]''. Actor [[Crispin Glover]] was asked to reprise the role of George McFly. Glover indicated interest, but could not come to an agreement with the producers regarding his salary. For the George McFly character to appear, director [[Robert Zemeckis]] used some previously filmed footage of Glover from the first film and inter-spliced [[Jeffrey Weissman]], who wore prosthetics including a false chin, nose, and cheekbones and used various obfuscating methods, such as background, sunglasses, rear shot, and even upside-down, to resemble Glover. Dissatisfied with these plans, Glover filed a lawsuit against the producers, including Steven Spielberg, on the grounds that they neither owned his likeness nor had permission to use it. Due to Glover's lawsuit, there are now clauses in the [[Screen Actors Guild]] collective bargaining agreements that state that producers and actors are not allowed to use such methods to reproduce the likeness of other actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Glover |first=Crispin |subjectlink=Crispin Glover |interviewer=[[Simon Mayo]], [[Mark Kermode]] |title=Crispin Glover on Back to the Future 2 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q7wGsVYydo |via=YouTube video |work=Kermode &amp; Mayo |publisher=[[BBC Radio 5 Live]] |location=London |date=February 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;!-- This clip was uploaded by the official account of the BBC Radio 5Live program.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Framed''''' (Usually styled as ''FRAMED'') is a multi-award winning [[:wikt:noir|noir]]-[[puzzle game]] where the player re-arranges panels of an animated [[comic book]] to change the outcome of the story. Developed by the Australian studio Loveshack, Framed is an experience that sees the player changing the order of the narrative-based puzzles to a dance-meets-jazz score.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

A sequel, ''Framed 2'', was released 2017. ''Framed Collection'' is a compilation of Framed and Framed 2, available on [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PC game|PC]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/framed-collection-review-worth-a-thousand-words/1900-6416912/&lt;/ref&gt;


== Gameplay ==
Players take control of [[moral ambiguity|morally ambiguous]] characters as they slink their way across dark alleys and buildings in an effort to avoid the authorities and other obstacles. The goal of the game is to reorganize a series of [[comic panel]]s so that the protagonist is not caught by the police. In order to accomplish this feat, players must move frames around so that the [[sequence]] allows the main character to sneak past, avoid, or knock out their would-be captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/framed-review/|title=FRAMED Review|work=148apps.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/11/26/framed-review/|title=FRAMED review: rewrite the plot to this espionage story|work=idownloadblog.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Taiwan-Puppet-Monkey-god2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sun Wukong]] puppet in pò·-tē-hì.]]
'''Glove puppetry''' ({{zh|poj=pò͘-tē-hì|t=布袋戲|p=bùdàixì}})&lt;ref&gt;Also known as '''budai mu'ouxi''', '''shoucao kuileixi''', '''shoudai kuileixi''', '''chang-chung hsi''' ([[pinyin]]: zhǎngzhōngxì), '''xiaolong''', or '''zhihuaxi'''&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of opera using cloth [[puppet]]s that originated during the 17th century in [[Quanzhou]] or [[Zhangzhou]] of [[China]]'s [[Fujian]] province, and historically practised in the [[Min Nan]]-speaking areas such as Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, the [[Chaoshan]] region of [[Guangdong]], and other parts of southern China. It had since established itself contemporarily as a popular art form in [[Taiwan]].

The puppet's head uses wood carved into the shape of a hollow human head, but aside from the head, palms, and feet, which are made of wood, the puppet's [[torso]] and limbs consist entirely of cloth costumes. At the time of the performance, a gloved hand enters the puppet's costume and makes it perform. In previous years the puppets used in this type of performance strongly resembled "cloth sacks," hence the name, which literally means "cloth bag opera."

==Glove puppetry performances==
[[File:Handrama doll BlueButterfly.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A modern style of puppet in Taiwan glove puppetry.]]
Glove puppetry (pò͘-tē-hì) performances, similar to some types of [[Chinese opera]], are divided into a first half and a second half show. During the first half, known as the "show platform" (戲台), the audience is shown a demonstration by a master puppeteer on the stage. The second half consists of the puppet master, the orchestra, and the spoken parts. Several key points of a show to be appreciated include: the dexterity of the master puppeteer's manipulation of the puppet, the accompaniment of the orchestra, and the poetic spoken parts of the [[voice actors]]. With few exceptions, from traditional pò͘-tē-hì to modern performances, human vocal music and operatic singing is rarely heard.

==Glove puppetry in Indonesia==
[[File:Sie Djien Koei Potehi.JPG|thumb|right|Wayang Potehi of Indonesia]]
In Indonesia, glove puppetry once popular throughout Chinese communities around Sumatra and Java. Especially in Java, the acculturation between Chinese and Javanese culture gave birth to new style of puppetry, called ''[[Peranakan]] Potehi''.&lt;ref name="wayangpotehi1"&gt;[http://thejakartapostimages.weebly.com/photostory/potehi Potehi puppets bring celebratory mood], ''thejakartapostimages''. 30-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wayangpotehi2"&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/07/14/in-praise-puppets.html In praise of puppets], ''thejakartapost''. 30-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt; Today, glove puppetry is called with the term "[[Wayang]] Potehi" (Wayang means "puppet" in Javanese). The Wayang Potehi tradition is mainly preserved in [[Central Java]] ([[Semarang]]) and [[East Java]]'s ({{ill|Gudo, Jombang|id}}) Chinese communities.&lt;ref name="gudo potehi"&gt;{{id}}[http://travel.kompas.com/read/2014/10/02/194100427Seni.Wayang.Potehi.Berpusat.di.Gudo Seni Wayang Potehi Berpusat di Gudo (Center of Wayang Potehi in Gudo)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''travel.kompas.com''. 30-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the dialog parts of Wayang Potehi have been narrated using Indonesian and [[Javanese language]].

'''Hakken''' (sometimes '''Hakkûh''') is a form of [[rave dance]] originating from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Hardcore techno|hardcore]] and [[gabber]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/filmenuitgaan/muziek/23411565/__10_jaar_Pandemonium___Hardcore_en_hakken___.html|title=10 jaar Pandemonium: 'Hardcore, hakken én gezelligheid'|work=[[De Telegraaf]]|publisher=[[Telegraaf Media Groep]]|date=5 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014|author=De Telegraaf|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark van Bergen|title=Dutch Dance|date=September 2013|publisher=Xander Uitgevers B.V.|isbn=978-9-4016-0115-3|pages=272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lVdjAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 December 2014|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is very similar to earlier European folk dance and is thought to be a sub form of [[zapateo]] with less airborne moves (unlike jumpstyle, for example, which features the "drunken sailor" style of jazz dance and high kicks). Music one is able to do the dance to is also called ''hakmuziek''. The name is derived from the Dutch verb ''hakken'' which generally means chopping, or hacking.

In [[Australia]], the dance is mainly referred to as gabber (noun) or gabbering (verb), named after the gabber subgenre of hardcore it is performed to. Despite the fact that it is called gabber, it is usually performed to music of the [[hardstyle]] genre by most people in Australia.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The dance consists of small steps that quickly follow to each other to the rhythm of the [[bass drum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dj.dancecult.net/index.php/dancecult/article/view/523/495|title=How to Cure a Gabba|publisher=Dancecult|date=2014|accessdate=1 August 2015|first=Riccardo|last=Balli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower body (down from the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]) is the most important part, though it is not unusual to move the arms and torso too. Because one is supposed to keep up to the beat of the song, the dance is usually done fairly quickly, since the [[Beats per minute|BPM]] of this music style can easily reach 190 BPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank van Gemert|author2=Dana Peterson|author3=Inger-Lise Lien|title=Street Gangs, Migration &amp; Ethnicity|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Willan Publishing|isbn=978-1-84392-397-8|pages=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ru2ZzupdVXIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ronald Hitzler|author2=Michaela Pfadenhauer|title=Techno-Soziologie: Erkundungen einer Jugendkultur|date=2001|publisher=Leske und Budrich|isbn=978-3-8100-2663-7|pages=400|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FofEGWFOedgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 December 2014|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - MS Thr 693 (68) - Circus images, l'eschelle preileuse - cropped.jpg|thumb|Thomas Hanlon performing, 1860]]
A group of pre-Vaudevillian [[acrobatics|acrobats]] founded in the early 1840s, '''the Hanlon-Lees''' were world-renowned practitioners of "entortillation" (an invented word based upon the French term  ''[[entortillage]]'', which translates to "twisting" or "coiling") – that is, tumbling, juggling, and an early form of "knockabout" comedy (later popularized by such groups as the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges). The troupe consisted of the six Hanlon brothers and their mentor, established acrobat Professor John Lees.

Originally billed as "The Hanlons," the group debuted in 1846 at London's [[Adelphi Theatre|Theatre Royal, Adelphi]]. At this time, the company consisted of George, William, and Alfred Hanlon, who were essentially wards of John Lees until his death in 1855. After his demise, the Hanlons returned to England and enlisted their younger brothers – Thomas, Edward, and Frederick – and rechristened themselves "The Hanlon-Lees" in honor of their fallen friend and instructor.

The newly expanded troupe made its American debut in 1858 at [[Niblo's Garden]] in New York City, and spent the next four decades touring the United States and Europe. As their skills improved, their performances became more elaborate. When Jules Léotard introduced the trapeze in 1859, for instance, the Hanlon-Lees quickly adapted to the new device; their next production, ''Le Voyage en Suisse'' (''A Trip to Switzerland'') contained an aerial juggling sequence that stunned [[Émile Zola]], who expressed utter astonishment at the vast number of airborne objects.  There is a spectacular poster by Jules Chéret, the great pioneer of the classic era of French poster design, advertising their appearance at the Folies Bergères in 1878. In addition, the company is referred to in J.K. Huysmans chapter: "The Folies-Bergere in 1879" in his book Parisian Sketches, first published in France in 1880: "these side-splitting, yet funereal, clowns, the Hanlon-Lees.".

The Hanlon-Lees also patented several inventions, including the aerial safety net and a wooden brace used in the construction of scenery (which is to this day referred to as a "[[hanlon]]").

Despite the death of Thomas in 1868, the group continued to perform regularly until the early 1900s, at which point George Hanlon's sons Will and Fred assumed control of the company's repertoire. They would carry the company successfully into the 20th Century, going so far as to appear on film for [[Thomas Edison]] in a production entitled ''Fantasma''. The Hanlons would endure for another four decades, adapting their acts for vaudeville and finally appearing in the 1945 season of the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]].

In 1979, six American performers sought out the final living descendant of the original Hanlon brothers and asked for her blessing upon their new company, dubbed the [[Hanlon-Lees Action Theater]]. This modern incarnation of the original troupe is best known for pioneering and refining a theatrical form of medieval jousting, an event which the company continues to perform at Renaissance festivals in the United States. The modern day Hanlon-Lees also perform Western-themed shows such as fantasy rodeos and cowboy exhibitions.

'''Ideokinesis''' is an approach to improving posture, alignment, and fluency of movement through structured [[guided imagery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Exercise-Induced Central Fatigue A Review of the Literature with Implications for Dance Science Research|last=Batson|first=Glenna|year=2013|journal=Journal of Dance Medicine &amp; Science|volume=17|issue=2|pages=53–62|pmid=23759479|doi=10.12678/1089-313X.17.2.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; that uses metaphors, such as visualizing an object moving in a specific direction along various muscle groups throughout the body, while lying completely still.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Eveline|last1=Golomer|first2=Arnaud|last2=Bouillette, et al.|date=July 2008|title=Effects of Mental Imagery Styles on Shoulder and Hip Rotations During Preparation of Pirouettes|journal=Journal of Motor Behavior|volume=40|issue=4|pages=281–290|pmid=18628105|doi=10.3200/JMBR.40.4.281-290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Brenda|last=Farnell|date=Spring 1986|title=Introduction to Martin's Article: 'Sweigard's Legacy: Further Explorations into Breathing'|journal=Journal for the Anthropological study of human movement|volume=4|issue=1|pages=14–15|url=http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/4.1/4-1Introduction_Farnell14-17.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that repeated practice of this particular formula of mental imagery translates to improved coordination in dance and in movement in general&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Somatics in Action: How 'I Feel Three-Dimensional and Real' Improves Dance Education and Training|last=Kearns|first=Lauren W.|year=2010|journal=Journal of Dance Education|volume=10|issue=2|pages=35–40|doi=10.1080/15290824.2010.10387158|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15290824.2010.10387158}}&lt;/ref&gt; "based on the idea that imagery can improve skeletal alignment and posture through the re-patterning of neuromuscular pathways in the absence of overt movement".&lt;ref name=Pavlik&gt;{{citation|title=Imagery in Dance A Literature Review|last1=Pavlik|first1=Katherine|last2=Nordin-Bates|first2=Sanna|year=2016|journal=Journal of Dance Medicine &amp; Science|volume=20|issue=2|pages=51–63|pmid=27245944|doi=10.12678/1089-313X.20.2.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is some evidence that rehearsal-style mental imagery may benefit performance in sports, there is currently insufficient data to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of metaphorical imagery as only personal and experimental research has been conducted on ideokinesis and there are reasons to believe it may be contraindicated as a relaxation technique.&lt;ref name=Pavlik/&gt;

Ideokinesis was originally developed as a form of mental practice for injured dancers,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Pamela|last=Matt|title=Pioneers: Lulu E. Sweigard|work=Ideokinesis.com|url=http://www.ideokinesis.com/pioneers/sweigard/sweigard.htm|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some dance schools have integrated it into a standard [[somatics]] protocol for all dancers because it is thought to optimize motor control and performance by using periods of rest constructively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Teaching at the Interface of Dance Science and Somatics|last1=Geber|first1=Pamela|last2=Wilson|first2=Margaret|year=2010|journal=Journal of Dance Medicine &amp; Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=52–53|pmid=20507721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known among followers as "the Work",&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;{{citation|title=Imaginary Movements: Transform your body and your yoga practice with these nine visualizations from the ideokinesis system - all without moving a muscle|last=Rosen|first=Richard|date=1 April 1998|journal=Yoga Journal|issue=139|pages=79–87|issn=0191-0965}}&lt;/ref&gt; "ideokinesis" is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms, such as "mental practice", "mental rehearsal", "visuomotor behavior rehearsal", "covert rehearsal", and "ideokinetic facilitation", among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Motor imagery for stroke rehabilitation: current research as a guide to clinical practice|last=Batson|first=G|year=2004|journal=Alternative &amp; Complementary Therapies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=84–89|doi=10.1089/107628004773933325|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/107628004773933325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mabel Elsworth Todd|Mabel Todd]] conceived the ideokinesis approach; Barbara Clark and Lulu Sweigard,&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin|first=Eric|title=Dynamic Alignment Through Imagery|origyear=1996|year=2012|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736067898|pages=4, 6–7, 277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBwV_g8DhEMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Dynamic%20alignment%20through%20imagery%22&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others contributed to its early evolution;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ideokinesis.com/pioneers/intro/pioneers_intro.htm |title=Pioneers |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, André Bernard, Irene Dowd, Erick Hawkins, Pamela Matt, [[Eric Franklin]] and others lent their influence.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

Sweigard borrowed the word ''ideokinesis'', composed by two Greek words: ideo (thought) and kinesis (movement), from Bonpensière, a piano teacher, who applied imagery to his methodology. Ideokinesis can be translated roughly as "the image or thought as facilitator of movement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/ideokinesis-creative-body-alignment-an-introduction-to-ideokinesis/oclc/37473981&amp;referer=brief_results/ Bernard.

'''Julius Adler''' (September 23, 1906 – December 28, 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=14314069&amp;PIpi=3163335|title=photo of Julius and Henrietta Adler tombstone, Mount Hebron Cemetery, Flushing, NY|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Jewish actor, writer, and director in [[Yiddish theater]].

==Career==
He was born in [[Biłgoraj]], [[Poland]] into an [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox Jewish]] family. When his father died six years later his mother emigrated to America leaving the children with grandparents. In 1920 the family was reunited in the United States and Julius began to work in theater.&lt;ref name=Forward/&gt; He played with Julius Natanson, Leon Blank, [[Boris Thomashevsky]], [[Aaron Lebedeff]], Samuel Goldenberg, [[Jennie Goldstein]], and others.&lt;ref name=zalmen&gt;Zalmen Zylbercweig, ''Leksikon fun Yidishn teater'', Book three, 2379&lt;/ref&gt; He originally trained as a hat maker; when his stepfather learned of his desire to become an actor, Adler was put out of the family home.  He got as far as the fire escape where he slept and where his mother gave him food. When Adler's stepfather learned about the amount of money his stepson was making in his acting career, he was invited to move back into the family apartment.&lt;ref name=Bruce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2005-04-10/entertainment/3611303_1_yiddish-theater-molly-picon-vaudeville|title=Yiddish theater star revels in the colorful continuity of his ethnic roots|date=10 April 2005|author=Outwater, Myra Yellin|publisher=Morning Call|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and career==
In 1935, he met Henrietta Jacobson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DA153EF931A25753C1A96E948260 |title=Henrietta Jacobson, A Yiddish Actress, 82 |date=12 October 1988 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xe5WvTTQ?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DA153EF931A25753C1A96E948260 |archivedate= 2 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while both were appearing with [[Herman Yablokoff]] (Hayim Yablonik) in McKinley Square Theater. She was a divorcee with a young son from a prior marriage.&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S_wLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MlcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2514,473146&amp;dq=julius+adler&amp;hl=en|title=On-Stage Talent Upstaged Only By Off-Stage Warmth|author=Caffery, Bertha|date=3 September 1969|publisher=The Evening Independent|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henrietta had deep roots in the Jewish theater community.  Her parents, Joseph and Bessie, were Yiddish theater stars at the beginning of the 20th century, and her brothers, [[Hymie Jacobson|Hymie]] and Irving, not only performed but owned several prominent [[Yiddish]] theaters in New York City.&lt;ref name=Bruce/&gt; When her father died, Henrietta was just seven weeks old; Bessie continued to perform and brought her four children up as performers also.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; Julius and Henrietta formed a team and performed together for three years. When they had an offer to perform in [[Belgium]], Julius proposed by remarking that they could save money on visas and other expenses as a married couple. Henrietta accepted and they were married in 1938.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt;

Adler was accepted into the [[Hebrew Actors Union]]&lt;!-- Older than Equity and didn't fold until 2002, when its president, Seymour Rexite, died.--&gt; in 1938 and with his wife toured [[France]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Belgium]]. They then played in Chicago, then at the Hopkonson Theater and made a revue film. They played with [[Molly Picon]] and [[Jacob Kalich]] at the [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue Theater]] in the [[Yiddish Theater District]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QAEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=julius+adler+yiddish+theater#v=onepage&amp;q=julius%20adler%20yiddish%20theater&amp;f=false|title=Off-Broadway Review: Sadie is a Lady|date=11 March 1950|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Lg4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=julius+adler+yiddish+theater#v=onepage&amp;q=julius%20adler%20yiddish%20theater&amp;f=false|title=Off-Broadway Review: Abi Gesunt|date=22 October 1949|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948 they played in London. In 1950 he became director of the [[National Theater (Yiddish)|National Theater]] and produced Yiddish [[vaudeville]]. The couple also wrote plays.&lt;ref name=Bruce/&gt; Their son, [[Bruce Adler]] (Borekh Yosl, born 1944) played Yiddish theater when he was young.&lt;ref name=zalmen /&gt; He also later worked on Broadway and was nominated for two [[Tony Award]]s.&lt;ref name=Forward&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13862/|title=Bruce Adler, 63, Star of Broadway and Second Avenue|date=29 July 2008|author=Gerstein, Lana|publisher=Jewish Daily Forward|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adler family played the [[London Palladium]] with [[Sophie Tucker]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Bruce/&gt;

Adler also did some work in films, beginning in 1926 with ''Broken Hearts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016684/fullcredits#cast|title=Broken Hearts|year=1926|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an uncredited role as the High Priest in the 1935 film, ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026983/fullcredits#cast|title=She|year=1935|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler was cast as Aleksei (the priest) for the film ''[[Tevya (film)|Tevya]]'' (1939). The musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' was based on this film, though this early version of the story was non-musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032012/|title=Tevya|year=1939|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last film role was as a comedian in the 1950 ''Catskill Honeymoon'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042320/|title=Catskill Honeymoon|year=1950|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adler and his wife were performing in non-Yiddish theater by the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; In 1973, they were the stars of a [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] production of ''[[Come Blow Your Horn]]''. Their son, Bruce, was also cast in the play as the younger brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5vYeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JY0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4968,198311&amp;dq=julius+adler&amp;hl=en|title='Blow Your Horn' at St. Peterburg|date=1 May 1973|publisher=Sarasota Journal|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I've never even streamed from that account."{{sfn|Brouwer|2014}} Additionally, Turney also provided her opinion that the rule was not unfair to women, but just unfair in general, stating, "If someone has a big push-up bra and a low-cut shirt while they play [''[[League of Legends]]''] or a guy streams shirtless, who cares?"{{sfn|Beres|2014}}

In June 2017, Turney began [[video game live streaming|streaming]] on Twitch.{{sfn|Turney|n.d.b}}

==Personal life==
Turney has openly spoken about her [[bisexual]]ity with her audience.{{sfn|Turney|2013a}} In a video interview with the YouTube channel ''[[VlogBrothers]]'', she further discussed being bisexual, and spoke about how she was teased for her sexual orientation.{{sfn|Green|2013}} She has been in a relationship with [[Gavin Free]] since 2013.

===Home Invasion===
On January 26, 2018, a fan armed with a handgun broke into Turney's and Free's home, breaking a window to enter and firing one round as he did.{{sfn|Chalk|2018}} Turney and Free hid in a closet and called police. When the man could not find the couple, he left but was confronted by police outside. The suspect fired one shot and police returned fire; when officers approached the suspect's vehicle, they found him dead.  Whether the suspect's death was from self-inflicted shots or shots fired by police is under investigation. Turney and Free were unharmed during the incident. It has been assessed the suspect had developed an obsession with Turney, and he was attempting to cause harm to Free, against whom he felt resentment.{{sfn|Kaplan|2018}} Turney ceased updating her YouTube channel for nearly half a year following the incident, citing concern for her safety in sharing her life with an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Turney |first1=Meg |title=Why I've Been Gone - Meg Turney |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLFrmC_Vs3c |website=YouTube |accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mctv barbados.jpg|thumb|Multi-Choice TV]]
'''Multi-Choice TV''' ('''MCTV''') is a [[television]] service provider in [[Barbados]]. It is a [[Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service]] (MMDS) or [[DVB-C]] [[wireless]] [[microwave]]-based broadcast subscription television provider. They offer a variety of packages which can be considered as comparatively priced to similar providers throughout the world. 

The service began operating on December 14, 1987, under the name Subscription Television (STV), which had very few channels offered. The main channels were [[CNN]], [[ESPN]], and [[Lifetime Television]], with an occasional option of [[pay per view]] (PPV) being offered for local special events and the occasional international PPV sports broadcast. In 1996 it was upgraded to include a new platform called Multi-Choice TV which was an [[Analog signal|analog]] wireless microwave broadcast offering many more channels (e.g., [[BBC]], [[CBC Television|Canada's CBC]], [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]]) eventually maxing the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] capacity and having to upgrade the service to a [[Digital data|digital]] broadcast system. Multi-Choice TV have not fully converted all of its subscribers yet. The system relies on [[line-of-sight propagation]] so total island wide coverage have proved to be a problem and the provider is looking into alternatives. A recent press release have indicated  their interest in a partnership with the local [[Telecommunications company|telco]] [[LIME (Cable &amp; Wireless)|LIME]]. From 1 September 2008 MCTV replaced the Travel Channel on 511 (part of the High Flyer package) by Setanta Sports.

The service uses a [[Yagi antenna]] to receive the encrypted broadcast, which in turn is then decrypted by the provider's set top box. The provider now has the problem of signal theft by pirates using modified DVB-C compatible receivers and PCI cards with the most popular being the "Dreambox" manufactured in [[Germany]] to decode their signal which is based on [[Nagravision]] which is a conditional access control system developed by the [[Kudelski Group]]. In order to prevent such activity in August, 2006 the [[Government of Barbados]] stiffened the local Barbadian copyright laws, in addition to a strengthening of the laws on cable TV piracy. The CBC provider is planning for further circumvention of the Dream boxes in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DREAM OVER |first=Barry |last=Alleyne |authorlink= |url=http://www.nationnews.com/story/dream-over-for-CBC-pirates-copy-for-web |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=28 November 2009 |page= |pages= |accessdate=2 December 2009 |trans-title=|quote="Our investigations also discovered that Dream Box users were able to get a free service since early 2008, because CBC's old encryption software only scrambled their MCTV signal every two minutes, which allowed the Dream Box to recover the signal.  But the new security will leave the Dream Boxes crippled. "This is a money business, and encryption is always changing, and not cheap. The new software will actually scramble the MCTV signal every ten to 15 seconds, so Dream Boxes will not be able to keep up, and eventually lose the entire signal," the source added." |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203215206/http://www.nationnews.com/story/dream-over-for-CBC-pirates-copy-for-web|archivedate=2009-12-03|dead-url=yes |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014 MCTV have gone through a massive upgrade of improving their services by including new channels such as MovieCity Action and Hollywood, AMC, KTLA, WGN, Disney, NBC Sports network, etc. Also MCTV have upgraded their systems to 20 HD channels such as ABC, NBC, CBS &amp; FOX and have also added new PVR boxes. MCTV new slogan is MCTV the Right Choice and are increasing their channel line ups and packaging for their loyal customers in Barbados. MCTV is still the number 1 provider in Barbados but they have competition from Lime Barbados and Flow, but the advantage MCTV has is, it does not depend on the internet to provide single for their customers and when there is rainy and cloudy condition MCTV still provides good service.

Multi-Choice TV also competes against the [[United States|US]]-based [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) service provider [[DirecTV]] in Barbados. The service uses the [[NTSC]] television format.

{{Nihongo|'''''Myself ; Yourself'''''|マイセルフ；ユアセルフ|Maiserufu ; Yuaserufu}}{{ref label|title|a|}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] developed by [[Yeti (Japanese company)|Yeti]] which was released on December 20, 2007 for the [[PlayStation 2]]. ''Myself ; Yourself'' is the second original game published by [[Regista]], the first being ''[[I/O (visual novel)|I/O]]''. [[Takumi Nakazawa]], the main scenario writer for the ''infinity'' series (''[[Ever17]]'', ''[[Remember11]]''), is the principal writer for ''Myself ; Yourself''. Character design for the game is provided by [[Mutsumi Sasaki]], who also produced the original character design for ''[[Memories Off]]'', ''[[Happy Lesson]]'', and ''[[Futakoi]]''. Before the game's release, a [[light novel]] based on the story, written by [[Takumi Nakazawa]], and illustrated by Wadapen, was serialized in the Japanese [[bishōjo]] magazine ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' between March and November 2007, published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]. An [[anime]] adaptation began airing in Japan on October 3, 2007 on the [[TV Kanagawa]] television network, and contained thirteen episodes. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sequel to the visual novel was developed by the previous staff entitled ''Myself ; Yourself: Sorezore no Finale'' and was released on May 28, 2009 for the PlayStation 2.

==Plot==
''Myself ; Yourself'' is set in 2007 in the fictional town {{Nihongo|Sakuranomori|桜乃杜}} in W Prefecture which is modeled after [[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The town is in a quiet, rural area on the southern tip of the prefecture and borders the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Sakuranomori is the birthplace of Sana Hidaka, a sixteen-year-old high school student, who grew up with his childhood friends Nanaka Yatsushiro &amp; Aoi Oribe, his best friend Shusuke Wakatsuki, and Shusuke's fraternal [[twin]] sister Shuri Wakatsuki. Sana left Sakuranomori when he was eleven years old, but returns five years later living on his own in the apartment building Aoi's family runs. Sana soon finds out that while some things have stayed the same, there are still just as many things that have changed.

==Characters==
&lt;!-- Anyone who has played the game, please make distinctions between what was in the game, and what was in the anime. --&gt;

===Protagonists===
;{{Nihongo|Sana Hidaka|日高 佐菜|Hidaka Sana|born October 13, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Shinnosuke Tachibana]]}} (regular), [[Madoka Kimura]] (childhood)
:Sana is the main protagonist of the series. He left Sakuranomori during his childhood, and during the beginning of the series he comes back to live by himself in the apartment building owned by Aoi's parents. He apparently had a crush on Nanaka before he left and still holds those feelings for her. He used to play the piano, but he forgot every song except the song Nanaka wrote for him which he says is very important to him. He has a [[Hemophobia|fear of blood]] because he tried to commit suicide during his middle-school years due to constantly being bullied. At the end of the anime series, Sana proposes to Nanaka and she accepts by wearing the proposal ring during her concert.

:In the game, his default romantic partner is Nanaka Yatsushiro, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale".

:{{anime voice|[[Takehito Koyasu]]}} (regular), [[Yūko Sanpei]] (childhood)
:Shūsuke is one of the four childhood friends Sana left behind when he moved, and they renew their friendship on his return. He is Sana's best friend and the only male besides Sana in their circle. He is the younger twin of Shuri Wakatsuki. Yuzuki-sensei refers him as the lucky one of the Wakatsuki twins. When he and Shuri are accused of being lovers, their father decides to send Shuri away to London. When Shuri tells Shūsuke that she cannot stand to be separated from him, they decide to run away together knowing people will think that they have eloped.
:In the game, his default romantic partner is Asami Hoshino, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". However, in the first game, if Sana takes Shuri's route, Shūsuke will admit that he has romantic feelings for his sister. Even though Shūsuke has these feelings, if playing the game as Shūsuke, there is no Shuri route.

===Heroines===
;{{Nihongo|Nanaka Yatsushiro|八代 菜々香|Yatsushiro Nanaka|born July 29, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Ami Koshimizu]]}}
:Nanaka is one of Sana's childhood friends and seemed to have feelings for Sana. When Sana returns to town after five years, her personality has changed from sweet and caring to a cold and moody demeanor. On meeting again she slaps him, apparently for not recognizing her. In the anime, it is also explained that they had agreed to send letters to one another and that Sana had neglected to do so, while Nanaka had stuffed their mailbox with countless letters begging for help. This may have also provided motivation for the slap. She still seems to have romantic feelings for him as she gets jealous whenever Sana is with another girl (especially Asami).

:Nanaka was a victim of a possible arson shortly after Sana left Sakuranomori, and lost both of her parents in the fire. She managed to escape with only her violin (which she stopped playing and kept only as a memento) and the sakura bracelet that Sana had given her. She claims [[Post-traumatic amnesia|not to remember]] anything of the events of that night. Her uncle and aunt took her in and made efforts to ensure that she didn't try to remember to spare her further pain. Events after Sana's return, however, start triggering buried memories and she comes to remember everything. Her father was unable to cope with the knowledge that her mother had been unfaithful to him with their very close friend a short time prior to their marriage. As a result, Nanaka's father immolated himself and his wife after knocking her senseless when she confirmed that Nanaka was in fact the result of the tryst and not his daughter after all, something that Nanaka's uncle had always suspected. (Nanaka's biological father was also her violin teacher.) Unable to cope with the burden of her returned memories, Nanaka attempts suicide but is discovered in time by Sana, who overcomes his fear of blood to save her. In the last episode of the anime, Sana proposes to her and she accepts.

:In the game, her default romantic partner is Sana, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". It is also revealed that she and Asami Hoshino are cousins, which surprises Hinako at first. She later comments that she knew there was some kind of a connection between them because they both had the same air to them. Nanaka dreams of becoming a professional violinist, which was inspired by Sana's suggestion as a child.
  
;{{Nihongo|Aoi Oribe|織部 麻緒衣|Oribe Aoi|born August 28, 1990}}
:{{anime voice|[[Tomoko Kaneda]]}}
:Despite the fact that Sana calls her mother his aunt, Aoi and Sana are not related (in Japan it is common to refer to a woman older than oneself as oba-san, which is also the term used for an aunt). Her parents own the apartment building that Sana lives in. Her vision has weakened ever since she entered high school, so she now wears glasses. She loves to read books and is very energetic but clumsy. She has a very high-pitched voice and child-like character, but has a busty physique. Despite being childish, Aoi has a very caring personality, and never fails to aid a friend in need. Her dream is to become a picture-book author. This dream was inspired by Sana.

;{{Nihongo|Shuri Wakatsuki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yetigame.jp/myselfyourself/chara/syuri/syuri.gif|title=Image of Syuri's official romanization|accessdate=2007-09-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928132919/http://www.yetigame.jp/myselfyourself/chara/syuri/syuri.gif|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|若月 朱里|Wakatsuki Shūri|born March 23, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Yukari Tamura]]}}
:Shuri is one of Sana's childhood friends and the older twin of Shūsuke. Yuzuki-sensei refers her as the unlucky Wakatsuki twin. She is the most athletic of all the girls, although she is somewhat lacking when it comes to her figure. Shuri is a very supportive friend and had no trouble reconnecting with Sana, even after his prolonged absence. She also volunteers at the local retirement home and later invites Asami to join her. In the anime, she and Shūsuke run away together, but come back in the final episode to see Nanaka's violin performance.

;{{Nihongo|Hinako Mochida|持田 雛子|Mochida Hinako|born August 5, 1997}}
:{{anime voice|[[Ayumi Murata]]}}, [[Ayano Niina]] (''Sorezore no Finale'')
:Hinako is a ten-year-old girl going on eleven. She has been infatuated with Shūsuke since he saved her from three bullies who had taken her school bag and would not give it back. She wants to know how to become a girl that he will like and asks Sana and Aoi for their help. Hinako's personality is similar  to Aoi's, however being only in the fifth grade, she is more childish. In the last anime episode, it is shown that she is the girlfriend of Asami's cousin, who is five years younger than she is.

;{{Nihongo|Yuzuki Fujimura|藤村 柚希|Fujimura Yuzuki|born December 26, 1982}}
:{{anime voice|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]]}}
:Yuzuki is the twenty-five-year-old homeroom teacher of Sana's class; Shūsuke, Nanaka, and Shuri are also in the same class. It is a well known secret that she rewards her students with caramel candy whenever they do a good job in school, whether it involves assigned duties or favors for her. This habit of rewarding her students with candy originated many years previously when she was still in high school and found a child attempting to perform a flip over a metal bar in the park (revealed to be Sana in the anime). She offered him a caramel as a reward if he succeeded, which, of course, he did.

;{{Nihongo|Asami Hoshino|星野 あさみ|Hoshino Asami|born October 28, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Mai Nakahara]]}}
:Asami is Sana's childhood friend and a second year student. Although she volunteers at the retirement home along with Shuri and seems to have a very gentle personality, she is in fact quite vindictive and  takes revenge on people who hurt her. In the anime, she had a crush on Shuri and when she confessed to her, Shuri said that they should remain friends. Angered, Asami wrote a letter to the school accusing Shuri and her twin of being lovers. She later invites Shuri and Sana to the hospital to visit a sick woman from the retirement home in an attempt to hurt Shuri mentally. To her surprise, Shuri doesn't react as she expected and seems unfazed. The old woman obtains a knife and tries to kill Shuri in a fit of madness (brought on by the death of her granddaughter) but Asami knocks Shuri out of harm's way and is stabbed in her stead. She comes to realize that her hatred of Shuri is unfounded and tries to make amends.
:In the game, her default romantic partner is Shūsuke Wakatsuki, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". She is also revealed to be Nanaka's cousin.

The game's original soundtrack was released with the limited edition release of the game on December 20, 2007; the soundtrack was also used for the anime version.

==Reception==
Stig Høgset from THEM Anime Reviews comments that the anime is similar to ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' due to both having "a guy who's not a complete loser, who returns to his old town and meets various people, most of them girls or teachers/parents of said girls. Unlike with ''Kanon'', however, these are people he already know{{sic}}." He criticizes the anime for Aoi's "unchanging voice" throughout the flashback, the present and the epilogue that flash forwards ten years into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1035|title=Myself; Yourself|first=Stig|last=Høgset|publisher=THEM Anime Reviews|accessdate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Odiyan''''' is an upcoming Indian [[Malayalam]]-language &lt;!--DO NOT add or change genre without providing a reliable source--&gt;[[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] film directed by [[V. A. Shrikumar Menon]] in his [[feature film]] debut. It was written by Harikrishnan and is based on the legend of the Odiyan clan, who in [[Kerala]] [[folklore]] are men possessing [[shapeshifting]] abilities, who could assume animal form. Odiyans are said to have inhabited the [[Malabar region]] of Kerala during the era before electricity. The film stars [[Mohanlal]] in the title role, alongside [[Prakash Raj]] and [[Manju Warrier]]. The film was produced by [[Antony Perumbavoor]] through [[Aashirvad Cinemas]].

[[Principal photography]] began in [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] in August 2017. Major parts of the film were shot in [[Palakkad district]], where the Thenkurissi village in the film was recreated. Some scenes were also filmed in [[Vagamon]], [[Athirappilly]], and [[Kochi]]. The film was completed after 145 days of shooting. [[Sam C. S.]] composed the film's score and it also features songs composed by [[M. Jayachandran]]. ''Odiyan'' is set to release worldwide on 14 December 2018.

==Production==
===Development===
On 4 February 2017, ''[[Kerala Kaumudi]]'' reported that a [[3D film]] titled ''Odiyan'' was in development, starring [[Mohanlal]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]], written by Harikrishnan and to be directed by [[commercial director]] [[V. A. Shrikumar Menon]] in what will be his [[feature film]] debut. Bachchan was reported to be playing the father role of Mohanlal's character, with Prakash Raj and Manju Warrier in substantial roles. It said the film is based on the legends of the "Odiyan" clan—mythical [[Black magic|black magicians]] with the ability to [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] by using a trick called ''odi vidya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=രാജേഷ്|first=വി. എസ്.|title=മോഹൻലാലിന്റെ ഒടിയൻ ത്രീഡിയിൽ ബച്ചനും|url=https://s31.postimg.cc/xq6cjw31n/Kerala_Kaumudi_epaper_page_no.14_-_04-02-2017.png|accessdate=14 May 2018|work=[[Kerala Kaumudi]]|date=4 February 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/Z7YyA|archivedate=14 May 2018|language=ml|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhabiting mostly the [[Malabar region]]s (North Kerala), the legend is that Odiyans used to terrorise people to death by appearing in animal forms at night, called ''odi veykkuka''. In Harikrishnan's account, this account was fact: this was their vocation, but in modern times the Odiyans were wiped out from history and faded into oblivion. This story was completely based on the tales of Odiyan and he did not make any additional research.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite news|last=K.|first=Padmakumar|title=Mohanlal's 'Odiyan', as perceived by its creator Harikrishnan|url=https://english.manoramaonline.com/entertainment/interview/2018/05/27/mohanlal-odiyan-as-perceived-by-its-creator-harikrishnan.html|accessdate=20 November 2018|work=[[Malayala Manorama]]|date=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 2017, the project was officially confirmed by Mohanlal via [[Social networking service|social media]]. He wrote that [[Antony Perumbavoor]] would produce the film through [[Aashirvad Cinemas]] and [[Sabu Cyril]] (replaced by Prashanth Madhav) and [[Shaji Kumar]] would serve as production designer and cinematographer, while Warrier would play the female lead role—though he did not mention Bachchan, Raj or the 3D format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Express Web Desk|title=Mohanlal says his next film Odiyan will be a visual treat|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/malayalam/mohanlal-says-his-next-film-odiyan-will-be-a-visual-treat-4586166/|accessdate=28 August 2017|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menon said ''Odiyan'' is a "rustic thriller" and the story is rooted on the tribes of Odiyans and their myth. Odiyans can be described as the first "quotation gangs" (hired criminals) in [[Kerala]], who went in disguise of animals during night hours to attack enemies.&lt;ref name="TNIE1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Suresh|first=Meera|title='Odiyan will be a landmark in Mohanlal's illustrious career'|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/malayalam/2017/mar/26/odiyan--will-be-a-landmark-in-mohanlals-illustrious-career-1586231.html|accessdate=29 July 2018|work=[[The New Indian Express]]|date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is a [[magical realism]] thriller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=U.

It was Harikrishsnan's long-time dream to write a story on Odiyans. The film is also set in rural Palakkad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sreekumar|first=Priya|title=Odiyan tales retold|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/mollywood/060417/odiyan-tales-retold.html|accessdate=24 November 2018|work=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ഒടിയന്റെ പിറവിക്കു പിന്നില്‍, ശ്രീകുമാര്‍ മേനോന്‍ പറയുന്നത്|url=https://southlive.in/movie/celebrity-talk/odiyan-movie-behind-story/|publisher=Southlive.in|accessdate=24 November 2018|language=ml|date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menon and Harikrishnan initially planned a children's film titled ''Randu Vaanavillukal''. The film was set in the backdrop of the [[drylands]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Before filming, however, the [[2015 South Indian floods|Tamil Nadu flood]] happened, turning the filming land green and lush after the flood. The terrain was unsuitable for the film and their plans to shift the location also went futile. The two met again for a follow-up discussion.&lt;ref name="NFW1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suresh|first=K.|title=ഒരിടത്തൊരിടത്തൊരു ഒടിയനുണ്ടായിരുന്നു......|url=https://www.magzter.com/IN/NANA-FILM-WEEKLY/Nana-Film/Entertainment/273169|website=[[Magzter]]|publisher=Nana Film Weekly|accessdate=15 November 2018|pages=8 – 11|language=ml|date=15 April 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Odiyan'' originated from the conversation between Menon and Harikrishnan. Menon liked a one-line story of it narrated by Harikrishnan. Afterwards, Harikrishnan wrote a single scene of ''Odiyan'', intended as the introduction of the title character. He showed it to Menon, who in turn sent it to Mohanlal and the project took off. The scene remains in the film's final cut too. Earlier, writer-director [[A. K. Lohithadas]] had also proceeded with a story based on an Odiyan with Mohanlal himself in the lead role, but it was not made into a film. Later, director [[Lal Jose]] also contemplated on making such a film, but later dropped the idea. Evaluating these unsuccessful attempts, Harikrishnan said that it could be because they might have directly followed the myth behind Odiyans, rather than making a novel adaptation. Harikrishnan wrote ''Odiyan'' devoid of myth.&lt;ref name="deepika"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.deepika.com/cinema/StarChat.aspx?Script-Writer-Harikrishnan-about-Odiyan-and-Mohanlal&amp;ID=605|title="ഒടിയൻ' മാസ് – ഫാന്റസി ത്രില്ലർ: തിരക്കഥാകൃത്ത് ഹരികൃഷ്ണൻ|last=ബൈജുനാഥ്|first=ടി. ജി.|date=9 July 2018|work=[[Deepika (newspaper)|Deepika]]|accessdate=19 November 2018|language=ml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antony Perumbavoor suggested a major change in the first draft of screenplay which introduced a villain in the film. The script was completely rehashed based on that, after which Menon described Antony as an ace [[script doctor]]. Mohanlal suggested two minor changes in the second draft and approved the screenplay in the second sitting.&lt;ref name="NFW1" /&gt;

Harikrishnan received the hinge of the story back when he was lecturing journalism classes when he asked the students to write a [[feature story]] to test their creativity. The subject was:  "if Hollywood director Steven Spielberg comes to [[Palakkad]] to meet the last Odiyan". The word "last" was registered in his mind and became the [[Plot device|plot point]] in his screenplay. His story is about the last surviving Odiyan and why the clan became extinct after him. The story spans 50 years through three generations of the last Odiyan lineage and is set in the [[Thenkurissi (gram panchayat)|Thenkurissi]] village in Palakkad, where Odiyans were most popular. It is a concoction of folktales prevalent in the [[Malabar region]], chiefly in Palakkad. The screenplay was registered in the [[Writers Guild of America]]. Producer Antony Perumbavoor gave them freedom to conceive the film as big as possible, giving the film an open budget.&lt;ref name="MM"/&gt;

===Pre-production===
The initial plan was to shoot the film in 3D but the plan was later dropped.&lt;ref name="deepika"/&gt; In March 2017, it was reported that [[A. Sreekar Prasad]] would be the film's editor (he was later replaced by [[Johnkutty]]), [[M. Jayachandran]] as music director, [[P. M. Satheesh]] as sound designer, [[Peter Hein]] as stunt coordinator and Gokuldas (replaced by Prashanth Madhav) as art director. Menon said ''Odiyan'' is likely to release in 2017 itself, but is uncertain as the film requires an extensive post-production with a large chunk of time need to be spend for [[visual effects]]. Filming was then scheduled to begin on 25 May 2017.&lt;ref name="TNIE1"/&gt; In June 2017, the film crew convened for a script discussion session at an outdoor location in Kava, [[Palakkad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shrikumar|first=V.

'''Os Trapalhões''' ({{IPA-pt|us tɾapaˈʎõjs}}) was a [[Brazil]]ian comedy group and also a television series created by Wilton Franco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memoriaglobo.globo.com/Memoriaglobo/0,27723,GYN0-5273-257341,00.html|title=A TURMA DO DIDI|work=globo.com|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members were [[Dedé Santana]], [[Zacarias (Os Trapalhões)|Zacarias]], [[Mussum]] and their leader Didi Mocó, that was played by [[Renato Aragão]]. The name ''Os Trapalhões'' (which can be translated as ''The Bumbling Ones'') is derived from the Portuguese verb ''atrapalhar'', which means the opposite of ''[[wikt:helping|helping]]'', ''to do something the wrong way'' or ''to Those that confuse''. The name is translated "Tramps" in English DVD subtitles. It was originally aired by [[Rede Globo]] from 1977 to 1993.

On March 18, 1990, Zacarias died due to respiratory failure, but the group and the series didn't come to an end until July 29, 1994, when Mussum died due to an unsuccessful [[heart transplant]].

==The show==
The series consisted of several different minutes scenes featuring comic adventures and situations of the four protagonists, sometimes with just one of them (mostly Didi), two, three and even with all of them, in which they opposed enemies and even each other (these internal fights between them almost every time consisted of Dedé, Mussum and Zacarias against Didi, but Didi, as well as anyone of them who stood by Didi's side, often triumphed over them, very similar to [[Looney Tunes]]' [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]] rivalry), played pranks on each other or worked together in order to achieve a common goal. There was also throughout the years of the series, several parodies of [[comics]]' superheroes, like [[Superman]] (mostly played by Didi because of his leader role), [[Batman]] (played mostly by Dedé because of Dedé's second banana role and also because of the [[Homosexuality in the Batman franchise|homosexual interpretations]] about Batman and him), [[Spider-Man]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[The Phantom]], etc.

==Celebrities==

At left, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s legs.]]

===Didi===
The leader of the group who however, in some scenes, was treated by his three friends as the most worthless member. A very clever man from [[Ceará]] with a peculiar manner of speaking. He rarely ended the scenes with bad luck or as the loser, in which he "fought" enemies or even his own friends.

===Dedé===
Interpreted as a "second in command" role. He was the most serious one and acted as the brain of the group. His masculinity was always mocked by Didi.

===Mussum===
An [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-Brazilian]] man who was ever proud to say that he came from Morro da Mangueira, a slum in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He also had a very peculiar vocabulary. His greatest passion being [[cachaça]] (the most common [[distilled beverage]] in Brazil), which he nicknamed "mé" (or "mel", Portuguese for [[honey]]). He was always the butt of jokes and nicknames because of his skin color, as to be sarcastically called ''Maizena'' ([[Corn Starch]]) by Didi or then the latter's insinuations and innuendos comparing his skin color to that of a vulture's, at which Mussum would become verbally (sometimes physically) aggressive and answer back with offensive jokes about Didi's own northern origins or even his own mother.

===Zacarias===
A stocky, little man with child's voice and mannerism&amp;nbsp;— frequently putting on childlike tantrums in face of trouble or even role playing as a kid when the sketch asked for it. He also wore a wig due to baldness. This was exploited in sketches where it would be taken off either by Didi or by any other adversity such as an arrow which, missing his head, stabbed the wig to the wall, for instance.

==Main cast of supporting actors==
[[File:Trapalhões2ndcast.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Didi (left), as a waiter, being bullied by Carlos Kurt in one scene.]]

*''[[Dino Santana]]''- Dedé real life's brother. He played several secondary roles throughout the series and in some Trapalhões' films. He died in 2010.
*''[[Carlos Kurt]]''- A tall blonde man with a very bad look and huge eyes. He often played [[villain]], [[bullying|bully]] and other enemy roles in the series and also in some Trapalhões' movies. He died in 2003.
*''Roberto Guilherme''- An obese and bald man with whom Didi always had fun by taking off his wig. Also played a large number of [[antagonist]] roles, sometimes along Carlos Kurt. Though he played numerous secondary characters, the most memorable of them was the ''Sargento Pincel'' (Sergeant [[Brush]]), who led an army in which the Trapalhões acted as privates.
*''[[Tião Macalé]]''- A very funny [[tooth]]less black man that usually ended the scenes saying the word ''Nojento!'' (Portuguese for ''[[Disgusting]]''). This quote make him very famous both in the series and in Brazil. He died in 1993.
*''[[Ted Boy Marino]]'' -  A [[real-life]] [[wrestler]] with a Spanish [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] (though being of [[Italians|Italian]] origin) and [[haircut]] similar to [[He-Man]]'s. He died in 2012.

==Comics==
[[Comic book]] series based on Trapalhões were published in the 80 and 90 respectively by
"Bloch Editores" and [[Editora Abril]], usually in [[digest size]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramone, Marcus,  (2009-07-09).[http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/2009/trapalhoes.cfm Os Trapalhões na Bloch Editores: a história de um clássico dos quadrinhos]{{dead link|date=November 2018}} (portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pinkillu''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Laime}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''pinkuyllu'''&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario Quechua - Español - Quechua, Academía Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, Gobierno Regional Cusco, Cusco 2005 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''pinqullu'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref Bertonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Quechua language|Quechua]] or [[Aymara language|Aymara]], hispanicized spellings ''pincollo, pincuyllo, pingullo, pinquillo'', also ''pinkillo, pinkiyo, pinkullo, pinkuyo'') is a flute found throughout the [[Andes]], used primarily in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru. It is usually played with one hand, leaving the other one free to accompany oneself on a drum&lt;ref name="Garland Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Romero | first = Raul | editor = Koskoff, Ellen | encyclopedia = Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean | title = Peru | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb2ibVAXO9sC&amp;pg=PA471 | accessdate = 25 Sep 2011 | year = 2001 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | volume =Vol. 3 | isbn = 978-0-8240-4947-8 | pages = 466–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; like the ''[[tinya]]''. It is used in a variety of public festivals and other kinds of communal ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Garland Encyclopedia" /&gt;

== Construction and materials ==
The ''pinkillu'' can measure in length up to 1 meter 20&amp;nbsp;cm, and has six finger holes.&lt;ref name="Latin America Music"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Baumann | first = Max | editor =Kuss, Marlena| encyclopedia = Music in Latin America and the Caribbean | title = Music and Worldview of Indian Societies in the Bolivian Andes | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SYuKB29_7qUC | accessdate = 25 Sep 2011 | year = 2004 | publisher = University Of Texas Press | volume =Volume One | isbn = 978-0-292-70298-1 | pages = 300–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is most commonly made out of cane, but can be made out of bamboo, bone, or tree branches as well. In Peru and Bolivia, sheep and llama nerves are used to tie the instrument together. Among the different kinds there are
''ch'aka pinkillu'' (bone flute), ''qina qina pinkillu'' (cane flute) and ''tupa pinkillu''  (made out of thicker ''tuquru'' cane).

== Cultural uses and significance ==
The ''pinkillu'' has great cultural significance. In the Andes the instrument is played during the early rainy season to celebrate cattle and farming. The ''pinkillu'' is often played in pairs or ensembles during the rainy season and at festivals. In Bolivia it is believed that the ''pinkillu'' made from cane attracts rainfall.&lt;ref name="Latin America Music" /&gt; The ''pinkillu'' is moistened with alcohol or water before playing, and are associated with fertility.&lt;ref name="Garland Encyclopedia" /&gt;

TRCB News August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ncube|1989}}

== History ==
In the 1890s the [[Second Boer War]] dispersed the sex trade there, and consequently created new problems in what was then [[Southern Rhodesia]]. Public pressure led to the passage of immorality legislation in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zurzausxnAIC Tsuneo Yoshikuni. African Urban Experiences in Colonial [[Zimbabwe]]: A Social History of Harare Before 1925. African Books Collective, 2007.] {{ISBN|9781779220547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to independence (1980) colonial vagrancy laws were used against sex workers. In 1983 there was a major effort to eliminate sex work in post-independence Zimbabwe by rounding up hundreds of women and detaining them until they could prove they were not involved in the trade, otherwise they were sent to resettlement camps. A number of women's groups supported this as strengthening marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3178033?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101939607837 Gay W. Seidman. Women in Zimbabwe: Postindependence Struggles. Feminist Studies Vol. 10, No. 3 (Autumn, 1984), pp. 419-440]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nwItHXkm25cC S Jacobs, T Howard. Women in Zimbabwe: Stated policy and State action, in Haleh Afshar 9ed. Women, State, and Ideology: Studies from Africa and Asia. SUNY Press, 1987] {{ISBN|9780791494332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many African countries, the onset of [[HIV/AIDS]] dramatically increased the interest in sex work.{{sfn|Magaisa|2001}}

== Law and politics ==
Prostitution is addressed in Part III of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act 2004.

The police can arrest any woman walking (in the streets) after 7pm.&lt;ref name=dn125&gt;[http://www.newsday.co.zw/2012/12/05/mp-fumes-over-sex-workers/ MP fumes over sex workers News Day Dec 5 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[Thabita Khumalo]], a [[MDC-T]] MP, proposed that prostitution in Zimbabwe be decriminalised. She stated that decriminalizing prostitution would address three important issues: corruption, HIV/Aids and women’s rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nzcn.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/mdc-pushing-to-legalize-prostitution/ MDC pushing to legalize prostitution. Zimbabwean Community Network Dec 11 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
Khumalo, who has suggested that the word ''prostitute'' be changed to ''pleasure engineer'', has continued her campaign despite being demoted in her party in 2012. She has claimed her position on the issue may have contributed to this. She is supported by the [[Zimbabwe Women’s Resource Centre and Network]] (ZWRCN),&lt;ref name=dn125/&gt;
in addition to sex workers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimeye.org/?p=58353 Prostitutes back Thabitha Khumalo. ZimEye July 21 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK based [[Open Society Foundation]] reported in 2012 that the police are the greatest abusers of sex workers in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-17933-article-Zimbabwe+police+worst+abusers+of+prostitutes.html Zimbabwe police worst abusers of prostitutes]. Bulawayo 24 July 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Zimbabwe}}
Zimbabwe is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Women and girls from Zimbabwean towns bordering [[South Africa]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Zambia]] are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels catering to long-distance truck drivers on both sides of the borders. Zimbabwean women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in cities and surrounding towns. Reports indicate that adults have recruited girls for child sex trafficking in [[Victoria Falls]]. The practice of ngozi, giving a family member to another family to avenge the spirits of a murdered relative, creates a vulnerability to trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zimbabwe 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271316.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwean women are lured into hospitality largely in neighbouring countries and some women become victims of [[forced prostitution]]. Women are exploited in sex trafficking in [[Kuwait]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. Many Zimbabwean adult and child migrants enter South Africa with the assistance of taxi drivers who transport them to the border at [[Beitbridge]] or nearby unofficial crossing locations and are subject to sex trafficking. Some of the migrants are transferred to criminal gangs that subject them to [[forced prostitution]] in [[Musina]], [[Pretoria]], [[Johannesburg]], or [[Durban]]. Refugees from [[Somalia]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] reportedly travel from Zimbabwe’s Tongogara Refugee Camp to [[Harare]], where they are forced into prostitution.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Zimbabwe as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2 Watch List]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''Psychedelic rock in Latin America''' is the [[psychedelic rock]] music scene in [[Latin America]].

==Overview==
=== Brazil and the Tropicalia movement ===
{{See also|Tropicalia}}
[[File:Os Mutantes.tif|thumb|[[Os Mutantes]] performing in 1969.]]
Latin America proved a particularly fertile ground for psychedelic rock. The Brazilian psychedelic rock group [[Os Mutantes]] formed in 1966, although little known outside Brazil at the time (due to the fact that they recorded in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), they have since accrued a substantial international cult following.&lt;ref&gt;John Bush, [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p312117/biography "Os Mutantes"], ''Allmusic''. Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Os Mutantes also played a central role in the short-lived but revolutionary Brazilian aesthetic movement [[Tropicália]], also known as 'Tropicalismo' (Tropicalism), an anti-authoritarian artistic reaction to the repressive military junta that seized power in Brazil in 1964. Encompassing visual art, theatre, poetry and music, Tropicália combined the popular and the avant-garde, and fused traditional Brazilian culture with foreign influences, including contemporary developments in British and American psychedelic music, and above all the music of [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilberto Gil, quoted in ''Brazil, Tropicalist Revolution'', Yves Billon &amp; Dominique Dreyfus (Cannes TV/Histoire/Les Films du Village/Mezzo/TV Cultura, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; As well as recording their own material, Os Mutantes collaborated with other key figures in the burgeoning Tropicalist movement, including singer-songwriter [[Gilberto Gil]], whom they backed on Gil's second LP.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Tropicalia - Revolution in Sound'', BBC World Service, 15 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical manifesto of the Tropicalist movement was the landmark 1968 collaborative LP ''[[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]]'' ("Tropicalia: or Bread and Circuses") which brought together the talents of Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gil, [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Tom Zé]] and [[Gal Costa]], with arrangements by avant-garde composer-arranger [[Rogerio Duprat]] (who had studied with [[Pierre Boulez]]) and lyrical contributions from poet [[Torquato Neto]]. The album's group cover photograph depicted the collective holding a variety of objects and images, in a deliberate reference to the cover of The Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. The collective also performed a number of concert "happenings" which were intended to both involve and provoke audiences, and these reportedly had a similar effect on Brazilian audiences to that experienced by folk purists who witnessed [[Bob Dylan]]'s early "electric" concerts - the performers sported long hair, wore outlandish psychedelic costumes, used electric guitars and amplification, and played at full volume. Brazil's military junta was becoming increasingly suspicious of the anarchic anti-establishment attitudes of the ''Tropicalistas'', who also found themselves at odds with the nationalistic student left-wing, who favoured traditional Brazilian musical forms, and rejected what they saw as the corrupting influence of Western pop music.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In September 1968 Caetano Veloso gave two tumultuous performances at the third annual International Popular Song Festival in Rio, where the audience included a large contingent of left-wing students who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalistas. When Veloso (backed by Os Mutantes) performed in the first round of the Festival's song competition  on 12 September, he was initially greeted with enthusiastic applause, but the situation soon turned ugly. Dressed in a shiny green plastic suit, festooned with wires and necklaces strung with teeth, Veloso provoked the students with his sensual movements and startling new psychedelic music. He was bombarded by insults, jeers and boos from the students, who became even more incensed when American pop singer [[John Dandurand]] made a surprise appearance during the song. The ideological conflict climaxed three days later when Veloso returned for the second round of the competition on 15 September, at which he performed a new song entitled "Prohibido a Prohibir" ("It is Forbidden to Forbid"), which was recorded live and later released as single.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The students began hissing and booing as soon as Veloso's name was announced, and when he began his performance, his overtly sexual stage moves and the experimental music of Os Mutantes provoked an outpouring of anger - the audience began booing so loudly stood that Veloso could barely be heard, and a large number then stood and turned their backs on the performers, prompting Os Mutantes to turn their backs on the audience. As the song continued, the students pelted the stage with fruit, vegetables, eggs, paper balls and anything else that came hand. Veloso stopped playing and launched into a furious monologue, in which he excoriated the students for their conservatism. After being joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support, Veloso finished his diatribe by telling the students "... if you are the same in politics as you are in aesthetics, we’re done for!" and declaring he was withdrawing from the competition. He then deliberately finished the song out of tune, angrily shouted "Enough!" and walked off arm-in-arm with Gil and Os Mutantes.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Langland (2006), "Il est Interdit d’Interdire: The Transnational Experience of 1968 in Brazil", ''Estudios Interdisciplinarios de América Latina y el Caribe'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropicália had a major effect on the Brazilian music scene during its brief heyday (1967–68), and the main performers made regular appearances on Brazilian stage, television and radio, but the movement was abruptly shut down in early 1969, following a provocative December 1968 TV performance which parodied the Brazilian national anthem. Gil and Veloso were both arrested in February 1969 on the orders of the military junta - they were held in prison for three months without charge or trial, and after a further four months under house arrest, they were released on condition that they leave the country, and they spent the next few years in exile in the UK.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Others in the Tropicalist movement were treated even more harshly - several were arrested and tortured, or forced to undergo psychiatric 'treatment'.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Mexico, Chile and Argentina ===
[[File:Pescado Rabioso Canal 11.jpg|thumb|[[Pescado Rabioso]] performing in a TV show in [[Buenos Aires]], 1972.]]
In the late 1960s, a wave of Mexican rock, heavily influenced by psychedelia and [[funk]] emerged, especially in northern border Mexican states, in particular, Tijuana, Baja California. Among the most recognized bands from this "[[Chicano rock|Chicano Wave]]" (Onda Chicana in Spanish) were Three Souls in my Mind, [[Love Army]], El Ritual&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Joseph and T. J. Henderson, ed., ''The Mexico Reader: History, Culture, Politics'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-8223-3042-3}}, p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Los Dug Dug's]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Ankeny, [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/los-dug-dugs-mn0001459070 "Dug Dug: Biography"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 6 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro]] was a historic [[Mexican rock music|Mexican rock]] festival held on September 11–12, 1971, on the shores of Lake Avándaro near the [[Avándaro Golf Club]], in the central [[State of Mexico]]. The festival, took place at the height of [[La Onda]] and celebrated life, youth, ecology, music, peace and [[free love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jimenez Izquierdo|first1=Juan|title=Avandaro, mas que drogas y desnudos|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/815718.html|accessdate=24 June 2014|publisher=El Universal|date=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monsivais|first=Carlos|editor1-first=Ana del |editor1-last=Sarto|editor2-first=Alicia|editor2-last=Ríos|editor3-first= Abril|editor3-last=Trigo|title=The Latin American Cultural Studies Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NW1CXsOKRc8C&amp;pg=PA219|year=2004|publisher=Duke UP|isbn=9780822333401|pages=203–32|chapter=Would So Many Millions of People Not End Up Speaking English?: The North American Culture and Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been compared to the American [[Woodstock]] festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramer|first=Michael J.|title=The Republic of Rock: Music and Citizenship in the Sixties Counterculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yahvEERWHXsC&amp;pg=PA220|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195384864|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[psychedelic music]], [[counterculture]] imagery and artwork, and open drug use. In Chile from 1967 to 1973, between the ending of the government of President [[Base Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva|Frei Montalva]] and the government of President [[Salvador Allende|Allende]], a cultural movement was born from a few Chilean bands that emerged playing a unique fusion of folkloric music with heavy psychedelic influences. The 1967 release of Los Mac's album ''Kaleidoscope Men'' (1967) inspired bands such as [[Los Jaivas]] and [[Los Blops]], the latter going on to collaborate with the iconic Chilean singer-songwriter [[Victor Jara]] on his 1971 album ''El derecho de vivir en paz''.&lt;ref&gt;B. Keen and K. Haynes, ''A History of Latin America'' (Andover: Cengage Learning, 8th ed., 2008), {{ISBN|0-618-78318-0}}, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;. Also [[Aguaturbia]] produced psychedelic rock within the chilean late 60s early 70s context with a female vocalist Denise Corales. [[Piedra Roja]] was a music festival in [[Chile]] noted as an expression of the [[Hippie|hippie counterculture]] in [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inedit-nescafe.cl/muestra-2011/competencia-nacional-2011/piedra-roja/ 2011 website on Piedra Roja]&lt;/ref&gt; I was held between 10 and 12 October 1970 in the eastern area of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Among others [[Aguaturbia]], [[Los Blops]], [[Lágrima Seca]] and [[Los Jaivas]] played in the festival. Meanwhile, in the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires, a burgeoning psychedelic scene gave birth to three of the most important bands in Argentine rock: [[Los Gatos (band)|Los Gatos]], [[Manal]] and [[Almendra (band)|Almendra]].&lt;ref&gt;S.

==Plot==
[[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] ([[Antonio Banderas]]) is a talking cat named for his signature pair of boots. Puss is a fugitive on the run from the law, looking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]) and Jill ([[Amy Sedaris]]) have the magic beans he has been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws ([[Salma Hayek]]) interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty ([[Zach Galifianakis]]), a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his [[origin story]] and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs.

The trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio ride the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror, a giant goose that guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a [[Goose|gosling]], and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious.

When Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to San Ricardo where he learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him home to be arrested, as revenge for abandoning him to the authorities when Humpty's youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and Kitty were involved in the con. After pleas from Imelda, his adoptive mother, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero.

While in prison, Puss meets the original Jack from "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]" who warns him that the Great Terror is in fact the Goose's mother, and it will stop at nothing to get its child back. Realizing Humpty intended to destroy the town all along, Puss lets a repentant Kitty help him break out of prison and she also tells him she loves him. Tracking him down just as the Great Terror arrives, Puss convinces Humpty to help him fight off the Great Terror, saying he knows Humpty is a good person at heart. Using the Goose as bait, Puss and Humpty lure the Great Terror out of the town. During the chase, Jack and Jill betray Humpty and try to take the Goose, but get crushed by the Great Terror. Humpty and the Goose are knocked off a bridge with Puss holding onto them. Humpty knows Puss cannot hold both of them, so he lets go, sacrificing himself to save the Goose and the town. Humpty's shell cracks open to reveal he was a golden egg on the inside. The Great Terror then takes the Goose and Humpty back to the giant's castle.

Puss' efforts to save San Ricardo make him a hero among the townspeople and Imelda. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries, Humpty is shown once again in his regular egg form, wearing a golden egg suit, as he rides the Great Terror into the clouds, and Puss and Kitty kiss.

==Production==
The film had been in development since 2004, when ''[[Shrek 2]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Australian Associated Press |author-link=Australian Associated Press |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/09/1086749781669.html |title=Banderas walks Shrek's green carpet |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=June 10, 2004 |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a ''Shrek 2'' spin-off, it was initially planned for release in 2008 as a [[direct-to-video]] film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Fritz |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100 |title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 14, 2005 |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; then titled ''Puss in Boots: The Story of an Ogre Killer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Larry|title=Movie File: Antonio Banderas, Rob Schneider, Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1527400/movie-file-antonio-banderas-rob-schneider.jhtml|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=MTV|date=March 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2006, the film was re-slated as a theatrical release due to market conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author1=DreamWorks Animation|title=DreamWorks Animation Reports Third Quarter 2006 Financial Results|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dreamworks-animation-reports-third-quarter-2006-financial-results-56643207.html|publisher=PRNewswire|accessdate=May 14, 2015|date=October 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and due to DreamWorks Animation's realization that the Puss character deserved more.&lt;ref name="DeadlineOscars" /&gt;

In September 2010, [[Guillermo del Toro]] signed on as executive producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Borys |last=Kit |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/guillermo-del-toro-dreamworks-ani-28354 |title=Guillermo del Toro, DreamWorks Ani strike deal |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: "We worked out a system for him to come in once every few months or whenever we had something new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone – our emergency phone – and ask him advice on what we should do with a certain character or scene. It was like having our own film school." Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. "Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty. He suggested we push that further, make him more like [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]."&lt;ref name="DeadlineOscars"&gt;{{cite web |first=Cari|last=Lynn |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/02/oscars-puss-in-boots-chris-miller/ |title=OSCARS: Puss In Boots -- Chris Miller |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=February 19, 2012 |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty "an ingenious freak of nature" who builds contraptions such as a flying machine.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204346104576639502674772230 |title=An Odd Couple and a Well-Shod Cat |last=Dodes |first=Rachel |work=online.wsj.com |date=October 21, 2011 |accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss – an unconventional conclusion for a children's film.&lt;ref name="Collider" /&gt; He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as "an amalgam of Spain and Mexico".&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

Except for Puss, the film features new characters. Citing the co-writer, [[David H. Steinberg]], "It doesn't overlap with ''[[Shrek]]'' at all. Partly that was done to tell an original Puss story, but partly because we didn't know what ''Shrek 4'' were going to do with the characters and we couldn't write conflicting storylines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author="Caffeinated" Clint |url=http://www.moviehole.net/200919424-exclusive-puss-in-boots-scribe-talks |title=Exclusive : Puss in Boots scribe talks |work=Moviehole.net |date=June 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was teased in ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', when Shrek finally shuts the book titled "Shrek", and puts it away next to a book titled "Puss in Boots".

''Puss in Boots'' is the first DreamWorks Animation feature film that was partly made in India. A Bangalore studio owned by Technicolor, which had mainly worked on TV specials and DVD bonus material, spent six months animating three major scenes in the film. The outsourcing had financial advantages, with 40% less labor costs than in the US, but the primary reason for outsourcing to India was lack of personnel, due to the studio producing as many as three films a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Verrier|first=Richard|title='Puss in Boots' showcases work by India animators for DreamWorks|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-dwa-india-20111029,0,1526743.story|accessdate=November 1, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release date was originally set for November 4, 2011, but was pushed a week earlier to October 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDate" /&gt; Anne Globe, head of worldwide marketing for DreamWorks Animation, said the decision to move the film's release date a week earlier was to attract parents and their children to see the film before other family-friendly movies were released in November 2011.&lt;ref name="strategy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Amy|title=Box Office: 'Puss in Boots' wins weekend by more than a whisker (Updated)|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/10/box-office-puss-in-boots-rum-diary.html|accessdate=October 30, 2011|newspaper=Los Angelese Times|date=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the name change was limited to the film's original theatrical run, as merchandise and later regional home media release retained the film's original title.

One, cats are funny. Two, vain Spanish cats in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain Spanish cats voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.chron.com/reviews/show/14080384-review-puss-in-boots |title=Review of Puss in Boots - 29-95.com |publisher=Events.chron.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasha Robinson of ''[[The A.V.

But while the settings are impressively multidimensional, the characters are flatter than old-school cel drawings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Tasha |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/puss-in-boots,64062/ |title=Puss In Boots &amp;#124; Film &amp;#124; Movie Review |publisher=The A.V.

'''''Rudo y Cursi''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]], literally, "Rough and Corny") is a 2008 [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican film]] starring [[Diego Luna]], [[Gael García Bernal]] and [[Guillermo Francella]]. It is directed by [[Carlos Cuarón]] and produced by [[Cha Cha Cha Films]]. It is Carlos Cuarón's first full-length movie.

== Plot summary ==
In the fictional farming village of Tachatlán, in the [[Cihuatlan|Cihuatlán Valley]] of [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]], young men dream of escaping the drudgery of the banana plantations. Two of them, a pair of half-brothers, play in local [[association football|football]] matches. Tato (Gael Garcia) is the star striker and Beto (Diego Luna) is the eccentric goalkeeper. During one match they are spotted by a talent scout (Guillermo Francella) and he offers one of them the opportunity to go to [[Mexico City]] with him and try out for one of the country's big teams. As the scout's roster is already full, he says he can only take one of the brothers and they decide to settle it on a penalty shot. Tato scores the penalty against his brother, therefore earning the right to head to the capital.

== Cast ==
* [[Gael García Bernal]] as Tato "Cursi" Verdusco
* [[Diego Luna]] as Beto "Rudo" Verdusco
* [[Guillermo Francella]] as Darío "Batuta" Vidali
* [[Dolores Heredia]] as Elvira
* [[Joaquín Cosio]] as Arnulfo
* [[Adriana Paz]] as Toña

==Production==
Carlos Cuarón first formed the idea for the film while on a promotional tour for ''[[Y tu mamá también]]''. He initially planned for only one character, but later decided to include a brother.&lt;ref name=pais/&gt;

Principal photography began in summer 2007 in [[Cihuatlán]], [[Mexico]]. The banana plantation where the brothers work in the film is actually owned by the Cuarón family. For his role Bernal wore blonde extensions to lengthen his hair while Luna dyed his hair black and grew a mustache to play the older brother. Additional filming took place in [[México City]] and [[Toluca]].&lt;ref name=pais&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cine/Mexico/platanero/elpepuculcin/20070629elpepicin_4/Tes|title=México en un platanero|author=Chiara Arroyo|date=29 June 2007|work=[[El País]]|accessdate=11 January 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

'''''Sarasaviya Awards''''' (Sinhala:'''සරසවිය සම්මාන''')  is an award bestowed to distinguished individuals involved with the [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala cinema]], each year by the Sarasaviya weekly newspaper in collaboration with the [[Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited]] (Lake House), [[Sri Lanka]] in recognition of the contributions made by them to the [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan film industry]]. The Sarasaviya  ceremony is one of the oldest film events in Sri Lanka. The awards were first introduced in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2007/03/25/mag09.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/09/05/new15.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarasaviya Awards have been often referred to as the Sinhala Cinema industry's equivalent to [[Academy Awards|The Oscars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feature|url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2005/11/05/fea10.htm|work=archives.dailynews.lk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Sarasaviya film awards ceremony began in 1964 at a time when the local cinema was trying to shed its [[South Indian]] orientation and establish an indigenous identity. There was no need to go to [[India]] to make films any more and the era of Indian artistes too had ended.

The first Sarasaviya film festival was held on May 9, 1964 at the Asoka Cinema Hall, [[Colombo]], 17 years after the first [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala film]] screened. By then a series of good Sinhala films like Podi Putha, Rekhawa, Sandeshaya, Ranmuthuduwa, Kurulubedda, Sikurutharuwa and Gamperaliya had appeared on screen. Yet the mainstream consisted of simulations of Indian productions.

The year 1960 is seen as the beginning of the golden era of Sinhala cinema. The first Sarasaviya Awards Festival had as entries not only the films screened in 1963 but also the films screened from 1960 to 1963. The best film, best director, best script-writer, best actor and best actress were honoured that day. [[Gamperaliya (film)|Gamperaliya]] was regarded as the best film and it was awarded to its producer Anton Wickremasinghe. Sir Lester James Peiris and [[Regi Siriwardena]] won the awards for best director and best script-writer, respectively and that too was for Gamperaliya. D.R. Nanayakkara was awarded the best actor title for his performance in Sikuru Tharuwa, another popular film in the 1964 film festival. The best actress award was received by [[Punya Heendeniya]] for her performance in Gamperaliya.

===Suspension and 2016 resumption===
The awards festival was suspended by the Rajapaksa administration and were resumed in 2016 after Minister [[Gayantha Karunathilaka]] announced that the festival will resume under the new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Sarasaviya Awards|url=http://www.sarasaviya.lk/2016/12/01/?fn=sa1612012|website=www.sarasaviya.lk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand-section|date=September 2017}}
===Issue one===

Starts with the trial of Khan Noonien Singn on stardate 2259.246 (September 3, 2259). Khan is brought forward, where he states that he rejects the court's authority. But Kirk note that the defendant calling himself Khan, looks nothing like the records of Khan Noonien Singn and ask him who him really is. Starting in New Delhi on November 1971. A group of children are gassed and taken by masked men. A year later, January 1972, Doctor Heisen is talking to a group of investors to invest in his Eugenics experiment to create super soldiers. Heisen then takes a look at his test subjects, 24 boys and 15 girls, where he notices one with one leg being picked and notices his fury when he beats them. A year later, Dr. Heisen is in his office with the crippled boy who is seen to have regrown his leg through the genetic experiments that have been performed on him. Heisen shows the boy his computer and explains how he wishes for the boy to use it to unlock all of the knowledge of the world, the boy named Noonien Singh. By 1979 all the children make progress in intellectual and physical prowess. Doctor Heisen observe a sparring session between Noonien and another boy using real knives. After scratching the other boy and seeing his wounds heal instantly, Noonien tests his own regenerative powers by impaling himself with both of his knives. While in a recovery room, Noonien hacks into the facility’s security system and disables in, then proceeds to escape by digging out through the solid rock floor. Dr. Heisen goes to retrieve Noonien from the Gobi desert by incapacitating him using a neural inhibitor that has been implanted into all of the subjects. On August, 1985 Noonien Singn presents Heisen with a box filled with all of the students removed neural inhibitors. He crushes Dr. Heisen’s skull with his bare hands before informing his companions that the world is waiting for them.

'''Sticheln''' is an easy-to-learn, [[trick-taking]], [[card game]] for 4 players that originated from [[Germany]]. It is an old game, being recorded as early in 1846.&lt;ref name=AKS&gt;Allgemeines Karten-Spielbuch (1846), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Sticheln has been described as "a very simple card game, which does not need exceptional mental agility to learn quickly - perhaps the reason why it counts so many friends."&lt;ref name=AKS/&gt; It is similar to [[Whist]], but played individually rather than in teams, using a [[shortened pack]] and a different scoring system. It is a 4-hander and is played either with a [[French playing cards|French-suited]] [[Piquet]] deck or [[German playing cards]]. Cards rank in their natural order: Ace/Sow, King, Queen/Ober, Jack/Unter, Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven.

After cutting the pack to decide on the seating order and dealer will be, the dealer pays eight tokens to the pot. He then shuffles the pack and the player to his left cuts it. The bottom card of the top packet is turned as trumps – it belongs to the dealer – then each player is dealt eight cards in two packets of four in anti-clockwise order. [[Forehand (card player)|Forehand]] leads to the first trick. Thereafter the trick winner leads to the next one. Players must follow suit, trump if unable, or play any card if they cannot follow or trump. Players must head the trick if possible.

For each trick won, players receive one token from the pot. Forehand becomes the new dealer and pays his eight tokens to the pot.

The game continues either for a pre-agreed number of rounds (each round being 4 deals) or when one player reaches an agreed number of tokens.

== Modern Sticheln ==
In 1993, a new game marketed as Sticheln was launched in Germany. It used proprietary cards and bore no resemblance to the original game of Sticheln.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islaythedragon.com/guides/tricked-out-a-guide-to-trick-taking/ ''Tricked-Out!''] at islaythedragon.com.

America has both an amateur and a professional sanctioning body.

==Pro/Amateur organizations==
American Strongman Corporation ("ASC") is the sole sanctioning body for all professional American strength athletes and organizes the annual America's Strongest Man contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanstrongman.com/|title=AMERICANSTRONGMAN.COM|website=americanstrongman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the NAS US Amateur National Championships, the winner of which receives their pro card to compete in professional contests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanstrongman.com/?p=4074|title=AMERICANSTRONGMAN.COM|website=americanstrongman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; North American Strongman ("NASM") organizes the majority of the amateur contests in the United States, and holds pro qualifier events and national championship events throughout the year with men's, woman's, teen's and master's divisions as well as lightweight and heavyweight classes similar to ASC.

United States Strongman &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedstatesstrongman.com/|title=United States Strongman|website=United States Strongman}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a relatively new organization.

'''''Tales of Two People''''' is a collection of short stories and novelettes by [[Anthony Hope]], the author better known as the writer of ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]''. It was published in book form in 1907.

The stories included are as follows:

=="Helena’s Path"==

Ambrose Calverley, who has travelled and adventured for many years, returns to England on the death of his father. Inheriting the title and estates of Lord Lynborough, he takes up residence at Scarsmore Castle on the coast of [[Yorkshire]], with his friends Leonard 'Cromlech' Stubb, an ancient history researcher, and Roger Wibraham, his private secretary. Fond of sea bathing, he finds that the path to the beach, the 'Beach Path', which passes through the grounds of Nab Grange (formerly part of the Calverley estate), has been blocked off by the new owner, the widowed Anglo-Italian lady Helena, Marchesa di San Servolo.  Although neither meet, a dispute begins between them concerning access to the path. Neither will give way, the lady is prepared to go to court and Lynborough calls her bluff. After a stalemate, Lynborough persuades his friends to pay court to the ladies staying with the Marchesa. Seeing her chance, she applies a similar strategy to Lynborough’s companions, creating a wedge in his resolve. Persuaded by her lawyer that her legal case is very weak, the lady accepts a compromise presented to her by an 'embassy' sent by Lynborough. He demands the right to use the path, if she will allow him to visit her to present his 'homage' once a year on the day of St John Baptist. She graciously accepts. It is implied that they will eventually marry. And the Beach Path is renamed 'Helena’s Path'.

=="Mrs Thistleton’s Princess"==

The story is narrated by Tregaskis, a country [[gentleman]], who is invited to the manor of Mr and Mrs Thistleton to meet the exiled Princess Vera of Boravia. Mr Thistleton, a lawyer, is negotiating for the return of the Princess’s private fortune, but is unsuccessful. To pay off his fee, the impoverished princess is forced to accept the position of [[governess]] in the household, known simply as Fräulein Friedenburg. When a neighbour, an up-and-coming stockbroker, becomes engaged to the eldest daughter of the house, instead of the princess (as she had hoped), she is forced to leave. A respectable situation is found for her, but as she leaves, a revolution breaks out in her country. She travels to Vienna, with expenses paid by Tregaskis, who is the only one who actually believed her story. It transpires later that she has indeed become Queen of Boravia.

=="The Necessary Resources"==

Prince Julian, pretender to the throne of a European country, is living in London with the mysterious Mrs Rivers. Byers, a financial speculator, is persuaded by her to provide support to the prince, but in fact contrives rumours that will cause the country’s stock to rise and fall in value. In the end, the prince does not return to his country, but he does marry Mrs. Rivers. Byers makes a fortune and later stands for Parliament.

=="Miss Gladwin’s Chance"==

Mr Foulkes, a solicitor, narrates the tale of Sir Thomas Gladwin of Worldstone Park, a rich country gentleman. A widower, he is engaged to Nettie Tyler, a girl many times younger than he is, and he has altered his Will in her favour. Four days before the wedding, he is killed in a horse riding accident. The Will has not been formalised and the estate goes to his daughter Beatrice, who had largely been cut out of her inheritance. She allows Nettie to remain on the estate with the uncertain status of 'companion'. A year later, Beatrice accedes to the unspoken feelings of the local 'county set' and makes over £100,000 in her favour. Shortly after, Nettie becomes engaged to neighbouring impoverished landowner Captain Spencer Fullard who had once paid court to Beatrice. She reveals to Foulkes that she did it to stop Fullard proposing marriage to herself.

=="The Prince Consort"==

The narrator tells of the Clinton family. Mrs Clinton is a well-known novelist and a centre of literary society, whilst her husband is content to live in her shadow. He has let it be known that he also 'writes', but nothing much is known of what he writes. Eventually, a large two-volume work emerges and is taken up by his wife’s publishers more as a favour than anything else. The work is an unexpected success and the gaze of the literary set turns from Mrs Clinton to her Husband.

=="What was expected of Miss Constantine"==

Katherine Constantine is rich, pretty and the object of interest to two men; Valentine Hare of the [[Colonial Office]], and Oliver Kirby, also in the government. She is proposed to by Hare, but she keeps him waiting for an answer. Family and friends all volunteer opinions and advice. She discusses the matter with a friend, Mr Wynne. When Hare is elevated to the Secretaryship for the Colonies, Miss Constantine decides to marry Kirby. They immediately leave for Canada, where Kirby hopes to enter politics.

=="Slim-Fingered Jim"==

Gentleman thief James Walsh, known as Slim-Fingered Jim, has been convicted for involvement in a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] robbery and sentenced to seven years in prison. In a country house garden one evening, Mrs Pryce confides to a friend that she met Walsh several years previously on a ship travelling from America. She was much taken with his suave and debonair manner, even after he confessed to her his involvement in a swindle. He was later arrested but found not guilty. She hopes that he can tolerate his prison sentence.

=="The Grey Frock"==

The Petheram family are landed gentry, but as a large family, their expenditure exceeds their income. One daughter has already married into the aristocracy, but Winifred chooses to become engaged to Harold Jackson, who has a small income only. Harold takes Winifred to London to see the house he proposes to rent for them. It’s the best they can afford, but Winifred is horrified at the small size and dirtiness of the proposed home. She is even more horrified that Harold has ignored the new grey costume she has specially worn for the occasion. She breaks the engagement, and it is implied that she may marry a wealthy former suitor instead.

=="Foreordained"==

One evening in a London club, The Colonel relates a story of a friend, George Langhorn, who inherited the ownership of Stretchleys, a high-class [[Savile Row]] tailor, but hates it. He is persuaded to take a break in [[Monte Carlo]], where he meets the pretty and rich Miss Minnie Welford. It transpires that she has inherited half-ownership of a mass-production clothing company Sky-High Tailoring, which she also hates. The couple quickly become engaged and marry. One of the Colonel’s listeners, a lawyer, then reveals that the week before, the companies amalgamated, with Langhorn as Chairman of the joint concern.

=="Prudence and the Bishop"==

Miss Prudence, eldest daughter of a vicar with a large family, is expected to marry money. She discusses with a friend the chances of her husband-to-be becoming a bishop.

=="The Opened Door"==

A passenger on a sinking ship debates with himself whether or not to surrender to his fate. A scoundrel of some sort who has escaped trial and prison, he eventually drowns.

=="Love’s Logic"==

In a short dramatic scene, a man who has just avoided proposing marriage, and a lady who has just refused a proposal, meet and discuss their various failures.

=="La Mort À La Mode"==

Monsieur Le Duc and Madame La Marquise are being taken to their execution during the [[French Revolution]]. They exchange words and comfort each other before they mount the scaffold.

=="The Riddle of Countess Runa"==

The walled city of Or is being besieged by King Stanislas, but the ruler of the city, Countess Runa, has held out and defied the King’s angry demands. She claims that the city cannot be defeated until a [[riddle]] she has presented to him is solved. A prisoner is brought to her, who claims to be a renegade from the King’s army. He is given sanctuary for seven days and nights and will be released if he has solved the riddle. On the final morning, he reveals himself to be the King, as Runa had known all along, and proposes a truce. And so peace reigns in the Kingdom.

=="The Lady and the Flagon"==

The rich young Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) visits his villa near [[Hampstead Heath]], but late at night, he feels lonely and bored. He bribes a passing policeman to change clothes with him and goes on patrol to check the doors and windows of his neighbours. Returning, he sees a young man outside his villa. He claims that he’s the Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) who has lost his key. Intrigued, the real Duke assists the imposter to enter. It's soon clear that he knows about, and plans to steal, the valuable 'Queen Bess Flagon'. A young lady, clearly an accomplice, arrives in a brougham. The real Duke changes clothes back with the policeman, snatches the flagon and runs across the heath, chased by the imposter. The chasers are confronted by a real policeman, an inspector who lives nearby; he recognises the fake Duke of Belleville (pronounced Bevvle) as a confidence trickster and arrests him. The real Duke, heartily enlivened by the night’s excitement, refuses to prefer charges and the would-be thief is allowed to go free. He graciously presents the flagon to the (still anonymous) lady and she also leaves.

=="The Duke’s Allotment"==

The Duke, again bored with life, decides to take a small [[cottage]] and [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]] in a country district and pass himself off as an out-of-work labourer. Unused to physical work, he is soon exhausted from his digging, and is visited by a formidable lady who believes him to be a drunkard. Affecting a [[Somersetshire]] accent, the Duke enjoys the deception. The lady sends her daughter to try to reform him. The house is later surrounded by other neighbours and police who have mistaken him for a thief believed to have burgled silver plate from a nearby manor house. The Duke takes to his heels, pursued by the local [[Chief Constable]] and others, but evades them. He returns home, accompanied by the lady, and resumes his true identity, much to her amusement.

Her stage name is inspired by her interest in comic books and by the way in which [[Stan Lee]] gave his characters first and last names with the same initial.&lt;ref name="INGInterview" /&gt; Tate is best known for her appearances in the [[MILF pornography|MILF]] genre; she has nine ''MILF of the Year'' wins to her credit.&lt;ref name="2014MILF"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Tanya Tate Wins MILF of the Year at 2014 Fanny Awards|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/Tanya-Tate-Wins-MILF-of-the-Year-at-2014-Fanny-Awards-556692.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After beginning her porn career in 2009, Tate began contributing to a regular column for British adult magazine ''Ravers DVD'' in 2010.&lt;ref name=AVN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/UK-XXX-Glamour-Model-TANYA-TATE-Pens-Column-For-RAVERS-DVD-Magazine-397089.html |title=Tanya Tate Pens Column for 'Ravers DVD' Magazine|work=avn.com|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is perhaps best known for her contributions to the [[MILF pornography|MILF]] genre of the adult industry with numerous award wins. Tate is also known for her appearances in [[Pornographic parody film|porn parodies]] such as ''Game of Bones'' (an adult parody of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''), ''[[Vivid Superhero|The Incredible Hulk XXX]]'', and ''[[Vivid Superhero|Iron Man XXX]]''.&lt;ref name=iafd/&gt;&lt;ref name=2014MILF/&gt;

Later that same year Tate made headlines in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], after it was discovered that one of the amateur men who participated in the filming of her [[Television X]] series ''Tanya Tate’s Sex Tour of Ireland'', was [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] player Greg Jacobs. Tate travelled the countryside in a camper van meeting genuine Irish men and filmed both softcore and [[hardcore pornography]].&lt;ref name=TelevisionX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionx.com/2010/04/tanya-tates-sex-tour-of-ireland-teaser/ |accessdate=24 March 2011| title=Tanya Tate’s Sex Tour Of Ireland Teaser |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425164307/http://www.televisionx.com/2010/04/tanya-tates-sex-tour-of-ireland-teaser/ |archivedate=25 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs denied that he appeared in the video,&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1284335/GAA-star-camper-van-porn-scandal-Hurler-s-guest-role-video-sex-tour-Ireland.html|title=GAA star in camper van porn scandal: Hurler¿s guest role in video 'sex tour of Ireland'|work=''Daily Mail'' Online|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then admitted, "I don't regret doing it", noting that he didn't want his parents to know. He appeared in the video following a dare from his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/hurler-in-porn-movie-row-14832450.html|title=Hurler Greg Jacob in porn movie row|date=7 June 2010|work=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tanya Tate's Casting Couch'' series ended in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sex.com/news/blog/tanya-tate-cosplay-queen/ |title=Tanya Tate, Cosplay Queen » The Sex.com Blog |publisher=Sex.com |date= |accessdate=29 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607103739/http://www.sex.com/news/blog/tanya-tate-cosplay-queen/ |archivedate=7 June 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tate directed her first film for [[Filly Films (studio)|Filly Films]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Tanya Tate Director profile|url=http://www.fillyfilms.com/video/tanya-tate/|publisher=Filly FIlms|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; called ''Tanya Tate's the MILF Masseuse'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Tanya-Tate-Makes-Directorial-Debut-Releases-Cover-Art-450710.html|title=Tanya Tate Makes Directorial Debut; Releases Cover Art|date=12 October 2011|work=|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work as director for Filly Films continued in 2012 with two titles ''Tanya Tate's Runaways'' and ''Tanya Tate's Tea &amp;amp; Muffin Party''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fillyfilms.com/video/tanya-tate/|title=Tanya Tate, Director|date=12 December 2012|work=|accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tate is outspoken about her industry and was quoted in a story about the [[30th AVN Awards|2013 AVN Awards]] for which she was nominated for an award. She stated, "If you are more popular with the fans, companies are more likely to book you for their production", and that "Being nominated for awards help build your recognition with your fan base. People that win male and female performer of the year are generally solid consistent talent that are open to many 'levels,' and some of these performers already have higher basic rates than others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moye|first=David|title=Asa Akira Proud To Be Nominated Porn Industry's 'Performer Of The Year'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/19/asa-akira_n_2471858.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 2013, Tate was the host of the 4th annual [[SHAFTA Awards (adult video)|SHAFTA Awards]] at the Rise [[Superclub]] in [[Leicester Square]]. She was also nominated for several awards that night and won ''MILF of the Year'' for the fourth year running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Nominations Announced for 4th Annual SHAFTA Awards|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/Nominations-Announced-for-4th-Annual-SHAFTA-Awards-535826.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in January 2014, Tate was France's [[Hot Vidéo]] magazine correspondent conducting red-carpet interviews at the [[AVN Award]]s.&lt;ref name=2014AVNRedCarpet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Hot Video Taps Tanya Tate for AVN Awards Red Carpet Interviews|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/Hot-Video-Taps-Tanya-Tate-for-AVN-Awards-Red-Carpet-Interviews-541392.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her 2010 San Diego [[ComicCon]] convention debut dressed as [[Emma Frost]], Tate has gained the attention of several media outlets, from [[Life.com]], [[Getty Images]], [[KTLA]].com and the [[Orange County Register]] to [[BleedingCool.com]], NerdReactor.com, Cosmic Book News and GirlsGoneComic.com, as a [[cosplayer]]. Earlier in the year, Tate was featured by [[IGN.com]] in an interview article called ''Tanya Tate: Cosplayer Extraordinaire''.&lt;ref name=INGInterview&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Stephen|title=Tanya Tate: Cosplayer Extraordinaire|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/06/tanya-tate-cosplayer-extraordinaire|publisher=ING|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that interview, she explains how the stage name she uses for her adult industry performances was inspired by how comic book writer Stan Lee named his characters using the same letter in their first and last names. Tate was also named the ''Cosplay Girl of the Month'' by ComicImpact.com in April and in June was selected as Critiques4Geeks.com’s first ever ''Geek Babe of the Month''.&lt;ref name=2011Comicon/&gt;

Tate's 2010 ComicCon appearance also resulted in the publishing of her first book, ''Tanya Tate: My Life in Costume''.&lt;ref name=20121stBook&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Product Review: Tanya Tate: My Life in Costume|url=http://sex-toys.avn.com/Tanya-Tate-My-Life-in-Costume-492423.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tate has become a contributing writer for the websites WorldOfSuperheroes.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Tanya Tate – New Columnist!|url=http://www.worldofsuperheroes.com/columnists/tanya-tate-new-columnist/|publisher=WorldofSuperHeroes.com|accessdate=11 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224021014/http://www.worldofsuperheroes.com/columnists/tanya-tate-new-columnist/|archivedate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Geekscape.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tate|first=Tanya|title=Disneyland’s Star Tours: The Adventure Continues Sneak Peek &amp; Review|url=http://www.geekscape.net/disneylands-star-tours-the-adventure-continues-sneak-peek-review|publisher=www.geekscape.net|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, as part of her interest in cosplay and in conjunction with that year's ComicCon convention, Tate launched a costume design contest. The winning entrant won a lunch date with Tanya during Comic-Con.&lt;ref name=2011Comicon&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Win a Lunch Date with Tanya Tate at Comic-Con|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Win-a-Lunch-Date-with-Tanya-Tate-at-Comic-Con-440124.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearances===
In 2013, Tate was the cover model for the Turkish version of [[FHM magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staff|title=crossover report|journal=Adult Video News|date=September 2013|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, she was featured in two documentaries. The first was [[Deborah Anderson]]'s feature documentary and accompanying [[art book]], ''[[Aroused (film)|Aroused]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://thearousedproject.com/home.html The Aroused Project]. The Aroused Project.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{ISBN|978-0-9893744-0-8}}), a theatre-released film profiled the lives of several adult industry performers during the production of Anderson’s photobook of the same name.&lt;ref name=AVNDoc2013&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=UK TV About To Get a Taste of Tanya Tate in 'Date My Porn Star'|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/UK-TV-About-To-Get-a-Taste-of-Tanya-Tate-in-Date-My-Porn-Star-533519.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in cinemas in the US summer 2013 and internationally in January 2014.&lt;ref name="spectator.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/spectator-life/spectator-life-culture/8936331/a-career-in-sex/ Alison Wolf on power, politics and porn].

Front Row Features (26 April 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The second was for the [[United Kingdom]]-broadcast [[Channel 4]] television show ''Date My Porn Star'', where a film crew accompanied one of Tate's fans from Britain to her home in Los Angeles to meet the performer.&lt;ref name=AVNDoc2013/&gt;

===Other ventures===
Since 2011 she has operated a cosplay-themed website and blog called justalottatanya.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Whois|url=http://whois.domaintools.com/justalottatanya.com|publisher=Domain Tools|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Tanya Tate Launches Free Cosplay Fansite, JustaLottaTanya.com|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Tanya-Tate-Launches-Free-Cosplay-Fansite-JustaLottaTanya-com-430131.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tate also operates a publicity company.&lt;ref name=Publicist&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvey-Jenner|first1=Catriona|title=14 weird questions about life as a porn star, answered by professionals You're about to find out exactly what these pornstars tell their granny they do for work|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/love-sex/sex/ask-cosmo/a28888/porn-questions-answered-professionals-tanya-tate-joybear/|website=Cosmopolitan UK|publisher=Hearst|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Tate began several partnerships and cooperative ventures. She announced a line of [[action figure]]s, unveiled a co-created comic book character, and syndicated blogs for HollywoodGoneGeek.com and FirstComicsNews.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Tanya Tate Nom'd For MILF of the Year and Mainstream Crossover|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/Tanya-Tate-Nom-d-For-MILF-of-the-Year-and-Mainstream-Crossover-538556.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, Tate's ''Lady Titan'' was introduced at that year's [[WonderCon]] pop-culture convention in [[Anaheim, California]].&lt;ref name=2014LadyTitan&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Tanya Tate to Promote 'Lady Titan' Comic Book at Wondercon|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/Tanya-Tate-to-Promote-Lady-Titan-Comic-Book-at-Wondercon-556204.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, a collaboration was announced between Tate and the newly launched ''cougars.xxx'' website owned by the [[Luxembourg]] based Lilly Devine SA company. CEO Moriam Hassan Balogun commented, "Tanya is not only an established professional with great ideas and a total understanding of what MILF fans want but also a major favourite within the industry".&lt;ref name=2014Cougarsite&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Tanya Tate Collaborates With New Cougars Website|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/Tanya-Tate-Collaborates-With-New-Cougars-Website-552700.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in April 2014, Tate began hosting a live weekly radio show on the [[Vivid radio]] channel of the [[Sirius XM Radio]] network called the ''Tanya Tate Show''.&lt;ref name=2014VividRadio&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title='Tanya Tate Show' Launches On Vivid Radio Today|url=http://business.avn.com/company-news/Tanya-Tate-Show-Launches-On-Vivid-Radio-Today-557514.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tate debuted her latest line of action figures, a customizable vinyl figure line called My Hero Toys, in October 2014. The new line of figures was announced at [[Stan Lee]]'s annual event, the [[Comikaze Expo]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=2014vinyl&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosplay Star TANYA TATE Debuts My Hero Toys Vinyl Figure Line At Stan Lee’s Comikaze!|url=http://www.prurgent.com/2014-10-30/pressrelease365019.htm|website=PRurgent.com|publisher=PR Urgent|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
In 2012, Tate appeared on behalf of the [[Free Speech Coalition]] at a [[press conference]] for the [[MindGeek#No on Government Waste Committee|"No on Government Waste" Committee]], which opposed [[Los Angeles County]]'s [[Measure B]]; the mandatory condom and health permit initiative.&lt;ref name=PressCon&gt;{{cite web|last=Kernes|first=Mark|title='No on Government Waste' Committee Holds 1st Press Conference Supporters include Valley Industry and Commerce Association and several Chambers of Commerce|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/No-on-Government-Waste-Committee-Holds-1st-Press-Conference-488400.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=November 2015|reason=Citation bears no relation to quote.}}

With regard to Measure B, Tate was quoted in a San Fernando Valley Business Journal article to the effect that she would want whomever she decided to have sex with "to get tested until I felt comfortable to sleep with them without a condom," adding that [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] president Michael Weinstein (whom the article was about), "should be spending money on treating [AIDS] and educating regular people about how to protect themselves instead of going after a small community that is aware of the risks".&lt;ref name=PressCon/&gt;

In response to [[Samuel Jackson]]'s comments about [[RedTube]], the free porn-sharing website, at a May press conference for his 2014 movie ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Tate said that piracy impacts her directly because she produces her own web content. She stated, "I would gladly send a catalog of adult movies I have directed to Mr. Jackson if he would be so kind as to recant the comment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel L. Jackson Stop Promoting Free Porn ...Say Angry XXX Actors  |url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/05/01/samuel-l-jackson-steal-porn-redtube-xxx-nick-fuy-boycott/|website=TMZ.com|publisher=TMZ|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Gail|title=Here’s how Samuel L.

In December 2014, Tate was outspoken regarding [[Internet censorship in the United Kingdom|new regulations]] imposed on online content in the United Kingdom. In an interview she stated, "[[Female ejaculation]] being banned is not only a slap in the face to women across the UK, but proof that men making these rules do not see women as equals. The lads can enjoy a good pop shot, but should a woman come, all hell breaks loose". Another item listed as banned content was "[[Role-playing]] as non-adults" which prompted Tate to state, "Can you say, 'Oh you're a naughty boy?' Or can you not say that because you cannot role-play as non-adults? Can you call someone a 'naughty boy' or do you have to say 'naughty man?' Who is going to monitor this?"&lt;ref name=2014UKcensor&gt;{{cite web|title=The UK’s War on Porn: ‘Proof That Men Making These Rules Do Not See Women as Equals’|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/06/the-uk-s-war-on-porn-proof-that-men-making-these-rules-do-not-see-women-as-equals.html|website=www.thedailybeast.com|publisher=IAC|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bible and humor''' is a topic of [[Biblical criticism]] concerned with the question of whether parts of the Bible were intended to convey [[humor]] in [[Humor styles|any style]]. Historically, this topic has not received much attention, but modern scholars generally agree that humor can be found in biblical texts.

==Scholarly assessment==
{{Bible sidebar |expanded=interpretation}}
Finding [[Humor|humor]] in the [[Bible]], for those who hold reverence toward the Bible, can be hindered by that seriousness, but it can be difficult for anyone because humor does not translate well from culture to culture or from language to language. It is also difficult to pick up on humor in written form. The age of the texts makes it difficult to be sure that what we are interpreting as humor was intended as humor by the author. Finding humor in the Bible requires a broad eclectic definition of humor and some awareness of literary types of humor such as satire, farce, parody, irony and so on. Therefore, the vast majority of Bible interpreters over the last 1,500 years have not only not detected humor in the Bible, they have often discounted or even disdained the possibility of humor in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Radday"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4OtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|title=On Humour and the Comic in the Hebrew Bible|first1=Yehuda Thomas|last1=Radday|first2=Yehuda T.|last2=Radday|first3=Athalya|last3=Brenner|date=7 February 1990|publisher=[[A&amp;C Black]]|accessdate=7 February 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781850757016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13-19}}
 
Professor Yehuda T. Radday notes that some scholars have flat out denied that humor in the Bible exists. He references a 1984 conference in Israel on the subject of [[Jewish humor]], where no attention was given to humor in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Radday"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Radday goes on to say "it is a widespread misconception that the Bible is lacking in humor."&lt;ref name="Radday"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

Scholars like Steven C. Walker, a professor of literature, and Howard R. Macy, a professor of religion, claim humor is prevalent in the Bible. Macy says that "if we think that humor in the Bible mostly looks like stand-up comedy or telling jokes, we won't see much of that."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macy|first1=Howard R.|title=Discovering Humor in the Bible: An Explorer's Guide|date=2016|publisher=[[Cascade Books]]|isbn=978-1-4982-9261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} Anthony J. Perotta, priest and professor at [[Fuller Seminary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ivpress.com/anthony-j-petrotta|title=Anthony J. Petrotta - InterVarsity Press|website=www.ivpress.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... humor as we know it today is probably not part of the Bible any more than love (and marriage, etc.) as we know it today is a feature of the Bible. But this is a minor point, maybe even trivial and pedantic. ... The ancient Hebrews loved and married—and joked—no doubt, in a different idiom than "we" do, but they still engaged in such activities and we can speak about those activities without being anachronistic or solipsistic&lt;ref name="Anthony J. Perrota"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Perotta|author1-first=Anthony J.|editor1-last=Ellens|editor1-first=J.Harold|editor2-last=Greene|editor2-first=John T.|title=Probing the Frontiers of Biblical Studies|date=2009|publisher=[[Pickwick Publications]]|location=Eugene, Oregon|isbn=978-1-60608-460-1|chapter=Chapter 16, A Test of Balaam: Locating Humor in the Biblical Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|280}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor of Jewish theology and Near Eastern studies Leonard Greenspoon says, "In sum, biblical humor is certainly not stand-up comedy nor is it especially cerebral either. Rather, it is participatory and fully in keeping with the overall themes and emphases of the Hebrew Bible."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenspoon|first1=Leonard|title=Focus On Humor in the Old Testament|url=https://global.oup.com/obso/focus/focus_on_humor_ot/|website=Oxford Biblical Studies Online|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author David A. Peters states that he finds over a thousand "humorous lines and stories" in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HOdw7t0-G5UC&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Many Faces of Biblical Humor: A Compendium of the Most Delightful, Romantic, Humorous, Ironic, Sarcastic, or Pathetically Funny Stories and Statements in Scripture|first=David A.|last=Peters|date=6 November 2007|publisher=[[Hamilton Books]]|page=7|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781461626978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is general agreement the kind of humor that ''can'' be found in the Bible becomes apparent when the Bible is viewed as literature. Rev. Marion Daniel Shutter asserts we would find genuine wit if, in literature other than the Bible, we came across sentences such as that found in Proverbs 26:17: ''Interfering in someone else's argument is as foolish as yanking a dog's ears''. He says, "When [[Isaiah]] characterizes certain ones as 'mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink,' does he not use essentially the same reproach [[Prince Hal]] fastened upon [[Falstaff]], 'Wherin is he good but to taste sack and drink it?"&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shutter|first=Marion Daniel|title=Wit and Humor of the Bible: A Literary Study|date=1893|publisher=[[Arena Publishing Co.]]|location=Boston, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}  Macy says the Bible authors use dark humor, satire, a great deal of wit, and are particularly fond of the dry humor that goes with exaggeration.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|18-24}} Walker adds, "The humor of the Bible is deadpan. It sneaks up on you."&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Steven C.|title=Illuminating Humor of the Bible|date=2013|publisher=[[Cascade Books]]|location=Eugene, Washington|isbn=978-1-62032-148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

When discussing biblical humor scholars generally agree humor is often in the situation itself. Macy gives the examples of Sarah having Isaac at the age of ninety, and  the Messiah turning up in a barn. Macy says "The Bible gives us tale after tale of comic reversals and narrow escapes."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  He says "mischievous exploits", names and name changes, literary plays on words, exaggeration, and the unexpected: a surprising word, an unexpected phrase, or an abrupt change of direction are what the Bible uses to convey wit and humor.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|5,9}}  According to Macy, the book of Proverbs includes funny images and word-play while "trickster themes also bring surprise and laughter."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|5,18}} Professor of Biblical Literature J. William Whedbee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortresspress.com/author/j-william-whedbee|title=J. William Whedbee|date=1 June 2015|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; says the biblical authors use "humorous juxtaposition" where things seem funny because they're together: for example, short and tall, fat and thin, irony and paradox.  Those scholars who do find humor in the Bible agree the odd, awkward, or absurd such as mismatches in character and actions, are examples of how the Bible uses humor. "[[Balaam]] the 'seer' who doesn't 'see' or 'know' what's going on, and his donkey who both sees and knows," is an example of this type of wit and humor in the Bible.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThA8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8|title=The Bible and the Comic Vision|first=J. William|last=Whedbee|date=28 May 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=7 February 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780521495073}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

==Hebrew Bible==


===Genesis===
Macy, Walker, M. D. Shutter, and other scholars contend Genesis has several stories that offer humor through absurdity, trickery, surprises and reversals. Macy says that in speaking of humor in the Bible he usually begins with asking how it might feel to personally get [[Abraham#Three_visitors|the message Abraham and Sarah received]], putting them into the absurd situation of a ninety year old having a baby.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|83}}  He argues that the Biblical author shows that the situation is replete with humor: "[[Abraham]] laughs, [[Sarah]] laughs, everybody else laughs, and they name the baby 'laughter' or He-laughs [Isaac Yitzack]."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|83}} 

Humor in Genesis, Macy says, includes "Both Abraham and [[Isaac]] trying to pass off their wives as their sisters, [however] translations of Genesis 26:8 range from [Isaac and his 'sister'] "laughing together" to "caressing" or "fondling" to "making love" giving evidence of Isaac's 'savvy' in pulling off the lie. [[Jacob]] and [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] make deals with each other that make a reader cringe. In Genesis 18, the topic is serious but bargaining with God looks a lot like buying a used car."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

Walker says Genesis contains several "odd couples" that contrast and complement each other like '[[Laurel and Hardy]]': [[Jacob and Esau]], Abraham and Sarah, Abraham and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]], Jacob and Laban, Moses and [[Aaron]], and others. He adds, "Bible characters learn a lot about their own 'dark sides' by those contrasts."&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|Preface:XII}}  The pattern of reversal of fundamental motifs such as primogeniture are evidence of humor according to Walker. He references 12 incidents in Genesis of younger sons getting the better of their elder brothers.&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|51}}

Greenspoon offers Genesis 4 as an example of Biblical humor using ironic wordplay with names.  After murdering his brother and attempting to shift the blame, [[Cain]] is condemned to wander ceaselessly, but after complaining God agrees to let him settle in the land of Nod. Greenspoon says, "The root of the Hebrew verb 'to wander' is ''n-w-d'' and "the proper name 'Nod' derives from the same root as the verb 'to wander'...  What sort of settling is Cain likely to experience in a land whose very name connotes (constant) wandering?"&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

===Exodus===
Greenspoon says [[Aaron]]'s response to getting caught after making the [[golden calf]] is humorous.  "Does Aaron come clean when confronted by his enraged brother...? Not exactly. He does attempt to shift blame—"You know this people is bent on evil". He also admits to asking the people for their gold, at the same time notably truncating the scope of his original request... 
Even though the biblical text had earlier narrated in some detail the active role he took ... [he says]: 'They gave it to me', Aaron concludes, 'and I hurled it into the fire and out came this calf'."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

===Numbers===
[[File:Balaam Rembrandt 01.JPG|thumb|''[[Balaam and the Ass]]'', [[Rembrandt]] 1626]]
Petrotta and others find plenty of humor in the story of Balaam and his talking donkey in the [[Book of Numbers]]. Balaam is repeatedly asked by king [[Balak]] to curse the Israelites, but Balaam can only bless them, making the king increasingly angry.&lt;ref name="Anthony J. Perrota"/&gt;{{rp|296}}&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|64}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HOdw7t0-G5UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Many Faces of Biblical Humor: A Compendium of the Most Delightful, Romantic, Humorous, Ironic, Sarcastic, or Pathetically Funny Stories and Statements in Scripture|first=David A.|last=Peters|date=6 November 2007|publisher=Hamilton Books|page=47|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781461626978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judges===
Shutter finds humor in the ''Fable of the Trees'' (Judges 9). [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] maneuvered to have himself proclaimed king in Shechem, but [[Jotham]] believed he was unfit to rule and the people foolish to accept him. Jotham contrives a satire. "The trees went forth to anoint a king over them. They said to the olive tree, 'reign over us.' But the olive tree answered, ‘Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honored, to hold sway over the trees?’ Next, the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be our king.’ But the fig tree replied, ‘Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?’ Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be our king.’ But the vine answered, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to hold sway over the trees?' Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, 'Come and be our king'. The thornbush said to the trees, 'If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'" Then Jotham left "for in that day, as in every subsequent age, there was no room for a satirist in the kingdom of an incompetent ruler".&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|29,30}} 

Shutter also asserts that [[Samson]] is a humorous character, very similar to [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] in [[Sophocles]]' play ''[[Ajax (play)|Ajax]]''. Quoting Rev. A. G. L'Estrange in his ''History of English humor...'', Shutter says: "He was an exaggeration of a not very uncommon type of man in which brute strength is joined to loose morals and whimsical fancy... We can only smile at his folly."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|32,33,37}}

Greenspoon finds humor in the word play of the names and characteristics of two protagonists found in the account of the murder of the King of Moab in the second half of Judges 3.  One of these characters is [[Ehud]], a "left-handed man" from the [[tribe of Benjamin]] (Judg 3:15).  "Such a description serves two functions here: first, as a play on words-—Ehud's tribe, Benjamin, literally means the son of the south, or right. (Ancient Israelites oriented themselves with the Mediterranean Sea behind them and East was straight ahead; so, the south was to their right.) Thus, it would not escape the notice of the reader that here was a "son of the south" or "the right hand" who was left-handed...   Second, because Ehud was left-handed, he strapped his sword to his right thigh... the Moabite king's bodyguards, who would certainly have checked out anyone seeking admittance to their monarch, performed only a perfunctory check on Ehud, never thinking that the weapon would be on his right, rather than the expected left, thigh.   It is especially the name of the Moabite king, [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]], that would have immediately attracted the attention of an ancient reader ... Eglon comes from the same Hebrew root as the word for a fatted calf, often one prepared for sacrifice. And, of course, sacrifice is exactly what Eglon becomes at the hand of Ehud... biblical writers seemed to draw upon just such incidents to display what might be termed the wicked side of their humor."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

===1 Samuel===
[[File:Scuola Grande dei Carmini - Sala dell'Archivio - Abigail calma e disarma David indignato contro suo marito Nabal di Giustino Menescardi.jpg|thumb|Scuola Grande dei Carmini - Sala dell'Archivio - Abigail calma e disarma David indignato contro suo marito Nabal di Giustino Menescardi|left|[[Abigail]] soothes [[David]], who is angry at her husband [[Nabal]]. [[Giustino Menescardi]], mid-18th century]]
According to Shutter, [[Nabal]], a rich man who insults [[David]], is a dark comic character similar to Squire Western in the classic comedy ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]].  "He is churlish and evil... blunt in speech, rude, and even boorish in manners... The servants of Nabal say, "He is such a son of Belial [a devil] that a man cannot speak to him!' He is fond of wine and sometimes falls asleep over his cups."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|37,38}} Fielding uses Squire Western's comic character to criticize the legal system that allowed men like this to judge others because of their social position.[https://www.shmoop.com/tom-jones-book/squire-western.html] The author of Samuel uses Nabal to make similar observations of the 'leaders' of Israel.

In this same story Greenspoon finds humor in names and wordplay.  The root of Nabal's name—"n-b-l"—(and the word "fool") appears as two nouns one of which appears in the expression for "wine skin"; Nabal is a drunk. "The second noun from 'n-b-l' is a feminine form ending with the Hebrew letter [[He (letter)|he]]. With the vocalization (that is, vowels) I am thinking of, the word means carcass or corpse. Surely, Nabal was a 'dead man' when he crossed David as he did. The same consonants also make up a noun meaning 'foolishness', the very noun that Abigail used to describe her husband in her plea to David. Reading back then, we can sense a double play on words, as it were, by the narrator of this account".&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

Walker says, "The Bible reads like a rogue's gallery of unlikely heroes...  Gideon the coward, Samson the bully, David the trickster".&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|Preface:XI}} He gives the example of the powerful and popular warrior David fleeing Saul's murderous jealousy by going to Achish king of Gath, then deciding he'd made a mistake, and coping with that by faking insanity. Macy says this entire scene with David is humorous, but King Achish's response is the epitome of Biblical sarcasm: "Am I so short on insane people in my own kingdom you bring me more from other places?"&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|4}} David fools Achish--then later goes to work for him. Walker says this demonstrates "David's trickster aspect is an equal-employment jester, 'laughable for how it succeeds in duping others and how it recoils to dupe the mischiefmaker".&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|129}}

===1 Kings===
Religion Professor and Presbyterian minister [[Conrad Hyers]] finds humor in Elijah's ridicule of "the priests of Baal who wailed and slashed themselves in the hope that Baal would send fire from Heaven.  "Shout louder!...Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling; or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened!" (1 Kings 18)&lt;ref name="M.Conrad Hyers"&gt;{{cite book| last =Hyers|first=M. Conrad| title=And God Created Laughter: The Bible as Divine Comedy|date=1987|publisher=[[John Knox Press]]|location= Atlanta, Georgia|isbn=978-0-8042-1653-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

===Proverbs===
All scholars who find humor in the Bible agree it can be found in the book of Proverbs. Shutter gives numerous example such as: "A man of great anger will bear the penalty, for if you rescue him, you will only have to do it again. In other words, a man of violent temper is always getting into difficulties; you have no sooner helped him out of one than he has plunged madly into another.  Like the irascible person in the old nursery rhyme, who "jumped into a bramble bush and scratched out both his eyes", he is no sooner extricated than "with all his might and main, he jumps into another bush and puts them out again."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|11}} 
 
Shutter also says humor is often used to communicate morality claiming "Can a man take fire in his bosom And his clothes not be burned?" is a sarcastic question about adultery. Shutter includes "Wealth makes many "friends"; poverty drives them all away" and "Many curry favor with a ruler, and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts" as social satire.&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|13}}  

"All the brothers of a poor man hate him; How much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues them with words, but they are gone."  Shutter references this Proverb as humor by citing a comparison with Thackeray: "Thackeray has drawn such a picture in his more elaborate description of Harry Warrington in the sponging house, making vain appeals for help to his rich relatives and friends.  His Aunt, a member of the great and always established Church of the Pharisees, sent him her blessing--and a tract!"&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

===Ecclesiastes===
Shutter says biting Biblical humor often gives insight into human nature: "All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

===Jeremiah===
Ridicule and political commentary have gone hand in hand for many centuries. According to Shutter, when Jeremiah describes the disaster that fell on Egypt's allies, the comments that follow to the King of Egypt drip with scorn: "Pharaoh, King of Egypt, is but a noise.  He hath let the appointed time pass by."  "In the same spirit, Queen Catherine says of the dead Wolsey, "His promise was as he then was, mighty;  but his performance is as he is now, nothing."&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

===Jonah=== 
Walker explains that "A crucial function of humor in the Bible is to persuade the self-righteous to laugh at themselves--a process that proves especially enlightening when the self-righteous turn out to be us.  Jonah sasses God.  Heathen Ninevites and scurrilous sailors prove more pious than the prophet [Jonah], who is subjected unceremoniously to his comeuppance." &lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|x}} Shutter points out that Jonah pouts when the Ninevites repent and are not destroyed; he yells at God, 'didn't I know this would happen?' without recognizing the irony in his own comments which is itself ironic. Shutter compares this to the character Mr. Mantalini in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]''.&lt;ref name="Marion Daniel Shutter"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

===Esther===
Leonard Greenspoon says "Like Jonah, the book of Esther is filled with a number of plots and subplots, the humor of which is not always immediately evident."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt; The proud Haman is unaware of his comic nature, but the reader knows the very real irony that "everything Haman plans against his enemies will ultimately be done to him".&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;   

Walker finds humor in the comic reversal in Esther. The king asks one night, "What should be done for a man whom the king desires to honor?" (6:6).  Haman assumes the king means Haman himself and answers in vivid detail. He is then required to give it all to his worst enemy.  Walker also points out the pivotal role in the book of Esther is built around a female, which is a situation filled with cultural commentary and irony. Walker says, "The wit of Esther, by turning our usual expectations upside down, reminds us to expect the unexpected."&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|Preface:XI}}  He says "I second Adele Berlin's ranking of Esther high among ''the most humorous books of the Bible, amusing throughout, and at certain points uproriously funny.''  People who have looked closely find the book so funny ''Esther emerges as perhaps the clearest embodiment of the comic vision among all the Biblical narratives."&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|53}}   

Walker and Macy both cite the careful attention to words and wordplays in this book, while Walker also includes Esther in what he calls "genial gender humor" where, he says,  women often prove to be "more dynamic characters" than their male counterparts and always seem to get the "last scriptural word".&lt;ref name="Steven C. Walker"/&gt;{{rp|Preface:XI}}

Greenspoon explains "the wisdom and/or bravery exhibited by women and other "outsiders" is often expressed or acted out at the expense of those who appear to wield the most power. This is in keeping with the frequently articulated theme of biblical humor that demonstrates and reflects God's infinite ability to disrupt the plans of finite humans, especially the seemingly powerful."&lt;ref name="Leonard Greenspoon"/&gt;

==New Testament==

Hyers says "[[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] had an unusual way of selling the gospel.  His techniques have not been widely followed...  Nor has he been hailed as a pioneer in the world of advertising.  [Paul's] term for the Christian faith is ''foolishness''.  The cross is foolishness.  Preaching is foolishness. Christians are called to be ''fools for Christ's sake''.  [[Apostles|The Apostles]] are ridiculed as fools, "a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men" (1 Cor.4:9)."&lt;ref name="M.Conrad Hyers"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Hyers says themes of divine foolishness overturning human wisdom form the plot lines of many Bible stories and such reversals are familiar in comedy as well.&lt;ref name="M.Conrad Hyers"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Macy says, "In his letters Paul reveals a robust sense of humor... He teases to teach,  uses grand exaggeration, enjoys parody and reversal, and even creates vivid comic [word] pictures."&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|77}}  For example in 2 Corinthians 11, Paul uses a biting sarcasm to give what has been termed his "anti-autobiography" while calling himself a fool.&lt;ref name="Howard R. Macy"/&gt;{{rp|79}}

Hyers says "[[Jesus]] freely used humor, irony and satire" and offers the examples of "the blind leading the blind; straining out a gnat, then swallowing a camel; meticulously cleaning the outside of a cup while leaving the inside filthy;  maintaining whitewashed tombs that are outwardly beautiful but inwardly full of dead men's bones; loudly honoring past prophets while plotting to kill present ones who preach the same message."&lt;ref name="M.Conrad Hyers"/&gt;{{rp|6}} These are examples of what Whedbee describes as "Jesus as the cynic sage."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{rp|12}} Comedian [[Eric Idle]] opines that Jesus is "not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WnApCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT60&amp;lpg=PT60&amp;dq=%22He's+not+particularly+funny,+what+he's+saying+isn't+mockable,+it's+very+decent+stuff%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He's+not+particularly+funny,+what+he's+saying+isn't+mockable,+it's+very+decent+stuff%22&amp;f=false|title=Jesus and Brian: Exploring the Historical Jesus and his Times via Monty Python's Life of Brian|first=Joan E.|last=Taylor|date=10 September 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|accessdate=20 September 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780567658296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical scholar [[F. F. Bruce]] finds the story of [[Rhoda (biblical figure)|Rhoda]] in [[Acts]] 12:12–15 "full of vivid humour". When Rhoda hears the voice of [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Liberation of Saint Peter|miraculously released from prison]], she becomes so happy that she forgets to open the door and let him in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kcCOAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=rhoda+%22full+of+vivid+humour%22&amp;q=%22full+of+vivid+humour%22|title=The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary|first=Frederick Fyvie|last=Bruce|date=25 April 2018|page=251|publisher=Eerdmans|accessdate=25 April 2018|quote=...now unfolds itself at the street-door of this house and inside the house is full of vivid humour.

'''The Pip''' is the nickname given by [[shortwave listening|radio listeners]] to a [[shortwave]] [[radio station]] that broadcasts on the frequency 5448&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]] by day, and 3756&amp;nbsp;kHz during the night.&lt;ref name=Pip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numbers-stations.com/the-pip|title=The Pip|work=www.numbers-stations.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pip dossier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://priyom.org/media/56944/the_pip_dossier.pdf |title=The Pip Dossier |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=25 April 2013 |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Priyom.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcasts short, repeated beeps at a rate of around 50 per minute, for 24 hours per day. The beep signal is occasionally interrupted for voice messages in Russian. The Pip has been active since around 1986, when its distinctive beeping sound was first recorded by listeners.

The station is commonly referred to as "The Pip" among English-speaking radio listeners. In Russia, it is known as {{lang|ru|Капля}} (Kaplya) "the drop". While its official name or callsign is not known, some of the voice transmissions begin with the code '''8S1Shch''' (Cyrillic: {{lang|ru|8С1Щ}}),&lt;ref name=Pip/&gt; which is generally considered to be the name of the station. However, this code may not be a callsign, but instead serve some other purpose.&lt;ref name="pip dossier"/&gt;
Radioscanner.ru identifies the owner of this station as a North-Caucasian military district communication center with callsign "Akacia" (ex-72nd communication center, Russian "72 узел связи штаба СКВО")

==Format==
[[File:The-pip-russia-12-07-2015-3756khz-2235.wav|thumb|A recording of the Pip during its normal operation, as heard in [[Russia]] on 12 July 2015.]]
The station's format resembles, in many ways, that of its presumed sister station, [[The Buzzer]]. Its signal consists of short beeping sounds that repeat at a rate of approximately 50 beeps per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priyom.org/media/53334/s30_sample.ogg|title=Example recording of The Pip|author=Priyom.org|accessdate=2013-04-05|format=[[Ogg|OGG]]; 104&amp;nbsp;kB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is transmitted on the frequency 5448&amp;nbsp;kHz during the day and 3756&amp;nbsp;kHz at night.&lt;ref name=Pip/&gt; The times at which the station switches from the day to the night frequency or vice versa are changed over the course of the year, presumably to match the changing lengths of day and night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/enigma2000/docs/ECL.pdf#page=12&amp;zoom=auto,0,668|title=Enigma 2000 Control List|author=Enigma 2000|accessdate=2013-04-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207073213/http://www.brogers.dsl.pipex.com/enigma2000/docs/ECL.pdf#page=12&amp;zoom=auto,0,668|archivedate=2012-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher frequencies have better [[Radio propagation|propagation]] characteristics during the day, while lower frequencies do better in darkness.

===Voice messages===

As with The Buzzer, the beeps are sometimes interrupted for the transmission of coded voice messages. There are two different message formats. Messages beginning with the Russian word {{lang|ru|для}} (dlya, "for") are thought to be test messages to gauge reception quality. The message itself consists of ten callsigns, each consisting of four numbers or letters. For example:
 Для ЙХЬЙ ЗЬ1Б НИ9В ДМЦ3 49ФТ Ц2ЗА ЛИ27 ИННЦ ЩГЙП 8ЦЩЙ (To JH'J Z'1B NI9V DMC3 49FT C2ZA LI27 INNC ShchGJP 8CShchJ)	
This is then followed with another "To" and then the callsigns are repeated again, concluding with {{lang|ru|Как слышно?}} (Kak slyshno?, "How do you hear?"). The callsigns are then repeated twice more, ending with {{lang|ru|Приём!}} (Priyom!, "Over!").&lt;ref name="pip dossier"/&gt;
Another type of message begins with {{lang|ru|8С1Щ}} (8S1Shch), thought to be the station's own callsign. This is then followed by two digits, then three, a codeword in Russian, then four pairs of digits:
 8С1Щ 73 373 ВДЕВАНИЕ 84 56 22 35 (8S1Shch 73 373 VDYeVANIE 84 56 22 35)
The message is then repeated four more times, also finishing with {{lang|ru|Приём!}} (Priyom!, "Over!").&lt;ref name="pip dossier"/&gt;

==Purpose==

The purpose of The Pip is not known, although there are many hypotheses. It is often suggested that The Pip is part of a larger radio relay or control system, which also includes [[UVB-76|The Buzzer]] and [[The Squeaky Wheel]], which both follow similar formats. In particular, activity on The Pip often used to be followed a few minutes later by a voice message on The Squeaky Wheel, suggesting that both are operated by the same organization and share the same purpose.&lt;ref name="pip dossier"/&gt; On one occasion, The Pip's characteristic beeping sound could be heard in the background while a message was being transmitted on the Squeaky Wheel's frequency, which may indicate that both stations are even operated from within the same building or room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priyom.org/media/56605/s32-3828usb-20120105-1410z-msg-byavare.mp3|title=Message from The Squeaky wheel with The Pip heard in the background|author=Priyom.org|accessdate=2013-04-17|format=MP3; 1,7&amp;nbsp;MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these activities have since ceased. Later tables of received messages no longer show such parallels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priyom.org/media/56944/the_pip_dossier.pdf#page=8&amp;zoom=auto,0,459|title=The Pip Dossier (page 8)|author=Priyom.org (user: Tucana)|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virtual Reality''' was the name of a series of six [[gamebooks]] released in 1993 and 1994. Four of the books were written by [[Dave Morris (writer)|Dave Morris]], and two by [[Mark Smith (author)|Mark Smith]].

==Game system==
The game system used in the series is unusual for gamebooks, in that there is no use of dice or other random elements. Instead, the player picks a number of skills from a list, and may be directed to different paragraphs based on whether or not they have a particular skill. The list of skills is similar, but not identical, from one book to the next.

In addition, players may pick up different items and 'keywords', and these may also be used to direct players to different paragraphs, as in other gamebook series.

An example of a character sheet from the series may be found [http://www.gamebooks.org/scans/VirtualReality/vr5sheet.jpg here].

==Reprints==
Dave Morris' 'Heart of Ice', which was highly regarded by many gamebook fans,{{who|date=July 2012}}{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} was reprinted in 2000 [http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=2882].
The series is to be published in electronic format by [Osprey Publishing].&lt;ref&gt;http://fabledlands.blogspot.se/2013/01/worlds-of-if.html&lt;/ref&gt;
