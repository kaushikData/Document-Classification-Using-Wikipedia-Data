'''Airfone''' was an [[air-ground radiotelephone service]] developed by [[MCI Communications|MCI]] founder [[John D. Goeken]], and operated under the names ''Airfone'', ''GTE Airfone'' and [[Verizon]]. Airfone allowed passengers to make telephone calls (later including data modem service) in-flight. Airfone handsets were often located in the middle airliner seatbacks, with two handsets per row for 6-wide coach seating configurations, and more or less depending on the aircraft layout and fare class. First class cabins typically had one handset per seat. Some planes had one or more bulkhead mounted phone stations with cordless handsets that the passengers could use, instead of the multiple wired handsets.  Airfone phone calls were usually quite expensive compared to ground-based telephone calls, costing $3.99 per call and $4.99 per minute in 2006.

The original Airfone main office and [[network operations center]]  are located at 2809 Butterfield Rd, Oak Brook, Illinois. The [[network operations center]] remains at this location.&lt;ref&gt;[https://local.google.com/maps?q=Airfone+IL&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=41.842791,-87.987614&amp;spn=0.011669,0.024054&amp;sll=27.698638,-83.804601&amp;sspn=14.175034,24.631348&amp;hq=Airfone&amp;hnear=Illinois&amp;t=m&amp;z=16 Airfone map location.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bell Mobility]] used the Airfone technology on [[Air Canada]] flights, but brands its service [[Skytel]] (no relation to the Verizon-owned paging firm of the same name).

== Use==

Calls were often discounted or free for customers of airplane-based catalogs like [[Sky Mall]], and [[Verizon Wireless]] subscribers could pay $10 per month and 10 cents a call or a flat 69 cents per call with no monthly fee. Airfone could be used for very slow modem calls, and attempts at data service were made in 2003 and 2004 using an on-board email proxy server.

Many of the in-flight calls made by victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 were made over Airfone and Air One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/ |title=Complete 9/11 Commission Report |date=2004 |author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airfone's primary competitor was Air One, operated by [[AT&amp;T Wireless]] division Claircom Communications Group, and was available onboard [[American Airlines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and select [[Delta Air Lines]] aircraft.  The Air One service was discontinued in 2002.

== History ==

===Development===
The Airfone was originated by [[John D. Goeken]] (who also founded [[MCI Communications]] and [[Florists' Transworld Delivery|FTD]]'s Mercury Network) in the 1970s. [[Western Union]] purchased a fifty percent share in Airfone in 1981 and sold to [[GTE]] in 1986 for [[United States dollar|US]]$39 million cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bechtel|first=Warren|title=Western Union Chronology of Events - 1851 -1995|url=http://www.westernunionalumni.com/history.htm|accessdate=2008-10-14|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65ZRvFw7G?url=http://www.westernunionalumni.com/history.htm|archive-date=2012-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Air Lines]] offered the United States's first public air-to-ground telephone system with Airfone.

The first iteration of Airfone service only permitted air-to-ground calls and frequently dropped calls. A new generation dubbed GenStar was developed jointly by GTE and [[Teknekron Corporation#Successes|IEX Corp.]] in 1992. IEX developed the software, which ran on hardware built by [[Stratus Technologies#History|Stratus Computers]]. GenStar introduced the capacity for airborne nodes to also receive calls, and for connections to be [[Handover|handed over]] between ground cells as the aircraft moved through them, reducing dropped calls. Handsets also gained screens and jacks for fax transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Belden | first = Tom | title = New Phone System Reaches Passengers During Their Flights | work = The Philadelphia Inquirer | location = Philadelphia | accessdate = 2012-10-04 | date = 1993-12-20

===Demise===
The head of the Airfone division told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2004 that only two to three people use the Airfone service per flight.  In May and June 2006, the frequencies ([[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) over which Airfone operated were sold at auction by the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to two new licenseholders, [[Aircell]] and [[LiveTV]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/jetblues-livetv-unit-to-snatch-up-verizons-airfone-network/ JetBlue's LiveTV unit to snatch up Verizon's Airfone network.  Darren Murph Jun 9th, 2008 8:12 AM]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the FCC order that authorized the auction, Verizon received a non-renewable license until 2010, but had two years from the end of the auction to redeploy Airfone to use less bandwidth and share spectrum with one of the license winners.

On June 23, 2006, [[Verizon]] Communications, Airfone's parent company, announced that they would be discontinuing their Airfone service on all commercial flights by the end of 2006. They cited the declining use of the service, as well as a desire to focus on their key businesses: broadband, wireless and wireline services. Airfone service is currently{{When|date=June 2009}} installed on 1000 aircraft belonging to [[United Airlines]] and [[Continental Airlines]]. [[US Airways]] and [[Delta Air Lines]] have removed all Airfone handsets from their planes.  Verizon will continue to provide service on 3,400 private and government aircraft.

On December 28, 2007, Airfone announced it would discontinue service effective December 31, 2008 unless it successfully concludes negotiations with [[LiveTV]], an affiliate of [[JetBlue]], to take over the business on that date. On June 9, 2008, JetBlue announced that it would buy Verizon's Airfone service.  The sale of Verizon Airfone to LiveTV (JetBlue) was separate from the sale of the bandwidth that Verizon Airfone used for its operations. In another transaction, LiveTV acquired about 1/3 of the original Airfone bandwidth from the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN0944090420080609?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews JetBlue LiveTV to buy Verizon's Airfone network]," ''[[Reuters]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LiveTV continues in-flight voice for general aviation ===
For a time [[LiveTV]] offered, nationwide, mobile telephone style voice service to general aviation aircraft. This service was identical to the original Verizon Airfone service. However, because of the change of [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] allocation, all of the existing Airfone tranceivers in the aircraft were required to be replaced.
&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.LiveTV.net LiveTV home page]," ''[[LiveTV]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sale to Aircell ===
In April 2013, [[Aircell]] acquired LiveTV's Airfone business unit, and announced that in order to support capacity-expansion for the Gogo Biz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gogoair.com/ Gogo Biz®]&lt;/ref&gt; in-flight Internet service, the Airfone service was permanently decommissioned on December 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aircell.com/press-room/aircell-completes-airfone-acquisition Aircell Completes Airfone Acquisition, Broomfield, CO – April 15, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory requested and approved a quotation for the integration of a receiving ground station, the Alaska SAR Facility, at UAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeronautics and Space Report of the President: 1985 Activities|page=19|url=https://history.nasa.gov/presrep1985.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alaska SAR Facility was marked at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on April 24, 1991.

The ASF DAAC is one of 12&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/daacs|title=EOSDIS Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) {{!}} Earthdata|website=earthdata.nasa.gov|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAACs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Review of NASA's Distributed Active Archive Centers (1999) Commission on Geosciences, Environment and Resources (CGER)|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6396&amp;page=13|publisher=National Academies Press|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by NASA to support earth observations from ground-based, in-situ, airborne, and space borne sensors.  The ASF DAAC processes, distributes, and archives data products as assigned by NASA. The ASF DAAC archive now offers more than a dozen synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets.&lt;ref name="asf.alaska.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asf.alaska.edu/get-data/get-started/how-to-get-sar-data/|title=Get Data / Get Started / How to Get SAR Data {{!}} Alaska Satellite Facility|website=www.asf.alaska.edu|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasking and missions have been added or deleted from the MOA when deemed appropriate by NASA program managers, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) personnel, and ASF management. 

NASA, on behalf of the [[Canadian Space Agency]], launched RADARSAT-1 in November 1995. At this point, ASF was handling data from the original three satellite missions that spurred the science community into envisioning this facility. The launch of ADEOS-1 resulted in ASF simultaneously supporting four active missions until the loss of the two Japanese missions (ADEOS-1 in 1996 and JERS-1 in 1998), and the deactivation of ERS-1 with the launch of ERS-2 in 1996. In November 2002, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([[NOAA]]) appointed UAF as agent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arko|first=S.A.|title=Development and Operation of the Americas ALOS Data Node|bibcode=2004AGUFMSF43A0770A|last2=Marlin|first2=R.

With the successful launch of ALOS in January 2006, ASF’s Americas ALOS Data Node (AADN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atwood|first=Don|title=ASF: Supporting the ALOS Mission|url=http://nsidc.org/noaa/iicwg/presentations/IICWG_2006/4_Thursday/Afternoon/Helsinki.pdf|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center, International Ice Chart Working Group|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; became operational in October that same year when the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ([[JAXA]]) declared the ALOS mission operational. The satellite functioned for five years.

==Data center==
The ASF DAAC provides production, archiving and distribution to the scientific community of [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) data products and tools from active and past missions. The facility is one of 12 theme-based [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) earth science data centers in the nation known as NASA [[Distributed Active Archive Centers]] (DAACs). The DAACs are major components of the Earth Observing System Data and Information System ([[EOSDIS]]), which in turn is part of NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth Science Data|url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/|publisher=NASA|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alaska Satellite Facility is the only DAAC that focuses on SAR. It is also the U.S. archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SAR Data Center|url=http://www.asf.alaska.edu/program/sdc|publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B (a European Space Agency mission),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthdata.nasa.gov/global-sentinel-1a-data-available-from-asf-daac-2015-12-09|title=Global Sentinel-1A Data Available from ASF DAAC {{!}} Earthdata|website=earthdata.nasa.gov|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  European Remote Sensing Satellite 1 and 2 ([[ERS 1]]/[[ERS 2]]), the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite 1 ([[JERS]] 1), [[RADARSAT]] 1 and the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite ([[ALOS]]) mission, which featured Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SDC Supported Sensors|url=http://www.asf.alaska.edu/program/sdc/sensors#palsar|publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Due to the agreements with many of the foreign agencies involved, at first much of the foreign-source DAAC data was restricted distribution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EOSDIS|url=http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/data-centers/asf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to NASA-approved scientists only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAR Data Center: SDC Data|url=http://www.asf.alaska.edu/program/sdc/data|publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 2015, the ALOS PALSAR data became unrestricted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthdata.nasa.gov/unrestricted-palsar-asf-daac|title=An Unrestricted View: PALSAR Data at NASA's Alaska Satellite Facility Distributed Active Archive Center Are Now Easier to Access {{!}} Earthdata|website=earthdata.nasa.gov|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sentinel-1 data is also unrestricted.&lt;ref name="asf.alaska.edu"/&gt;

In June 2013, the Alaska Satellite Facility released newly processed, 35-year-old data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasat Rediscovered: New Imagery from 35-Year-Old Data |url=https://www-prod.asf.alaska.edu/seasat/ |publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks |accessdate=28 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708151410/https://www-prod.asf.alaska.edu/seasat/ |archivedate=8 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  from the 1978 [[Seasat]] satellite mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rettig|first=Molly|title=Old satellite imagery offers new baseline data|url=http://www.adn.com/2013/06/22/2947411/molly-rettig-old-satellite-imagery.html|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=2013-06-22|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629093718/http://www.adn.com/2013/06/22/2947411/molly-rettig-old-satellite-imagery.html|archive-date=2013-06-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this release, only 20 percent of the Seasat SAR data had been processed digitally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trailblazer Sea Satellite Marks Its Coral Anniversary|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-208|publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellite-tracking ground station==
As a receiving station for satellite data, the facility now operates three antennas on behalf of NASA: two 11-meter S/X band antennas and one [https://www.asf.alaska.edu/ground-station/timeline/ 9-meter] S/X-band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA's Newest Near Earth Network Antenna Is Operational|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-s-newest-near-earth-network-antenna-is-operational/#.Va1KNRNVhBc|website=NASA.gov|publisher=NASA|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEN&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA's Near Earth Network (NEN) AS3 Antenna Deployment Project|url=http://esc.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/images/NEN%20AS3/NEN%20write-up.1.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=4 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928213027/http://esc.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/images/NEN%20AS3/NEN%20write-up.1.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second antenna was installed in 1994,  in anticipation of the launch of the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-1 ([[ADEOS I|ADEOS-1]]) by Japan. The second 11-meter antenna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esc.gsfc.nasa.gov/space-communications/NEN/nen.html|title=NEN|publisher=NASA|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was installed in 1995 on University-owned land within walking distance from the Geophysical Institute, and the 9-meter antenna replaced the original ground-station antenna in 2017. The ground station's prime polar location&lt;ref name="SpaceOps 2012"/&gt; in Fairbanks enables the facility to service high-inclination, polar-orbiting, Earth-imaging spacecraft. The systems operate 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.&lt;ref name="SpaceOps 2012"/&gt;
The facility has evolved over the past 20 years into a full-service station,&lt;ref name="SpaceOps 2012"/&gt; providing telemetry downlink, uplink, command and two-way coherent tracking services as one of 15 major members of the international [[Near Earth Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Near Earth Network|url=http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/services/networks/txt_nen.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is managed by NASA’s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. The facility processes, and distributes raw data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About STGS|url=http://www.asf.alaska.edu/program/stgs|publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from remote-sensing satellites, servicing NASA and foreign agency satellites in support of scientific and operational research and applications.

==GeoData center ==
The Alaska Satellite Facility managed the Geophysical Institute's GeoData Center for many years. In 2016, management of the center was transferred out of the Alaska Satellite Facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/administration/map-office|title=GeoData Center &amp; Map Office {{!}} Geophysical Institute|website=www.gi.alaska.edu|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its new website is [http://www.gi.alaska.edu/administration/map-office here].

'''Amyris Fuels''', LLC,  is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Amyris Biotech|Amyris]], a [[business unit]] formed to develop a network for supplying and distributing [[renewable fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amyris.com/en/about-amyris |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430103225/http://www.amyris.com/en/about-amyris |archivedate=2012-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company sources current [[biofuel]]s, such as [[ethanol]], from international producers and brings them to market.&lt;ref&gt;W. Horn and F. Krupp. Earth: The Sequel: The Race to Reinvent Energy and Stop Global Warming. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit has been focused on the southeastern United States, where Amyris Fuels is establishing relationships with customers and trading partners. When Amyris renewable fuels become more widely available, Amyris Fuels intends to integrate them into a ready-made marketing and distribution system that would offer access to key markets and customers.

In 2016, Amyris Fuels partnered with [[Cathay Pacific]] to have [[A350]] flights from Toulouse to Hong Kong fueled using Amyris' renewable jet fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.amyris.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amyris-fuels-first-delivery-new-airbus-a350-900-airplane-cathay|publisher=Amyris|access-date=18 June 2018|title=Amyris Fuels First Delivery of New Airbus A350-900 Airplane for Cathay Pacific as Part of Two-Year Biojet Agreement|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) vessels''' are mainly built to handle anchors for [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s, tow them to location, and use them to secure the rigs in place. AHTS vessels sometimes also serve as Emergency Response and Rescue Vessels (ERRVs) and as supply transports.

Many of these vessels are designed to meet the harsh conditions of the North Sea, and can undertake supply duties there between land bases and drilling sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ottomarine.com/ahts.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emas.com/index.php/our-expertise/emas-marine/our-fleet-2/anchor-handling-tug-supply-vessels Anchor Handling Tug Supply Vessel]&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide towing assistance during tanker loading, deepwater anchor handling, and towing of threatening objects.

AHTS vessels differ from [[Platform supply vessel]]s (PSVs) in being fitted with winches for towing and anchor handling, having an open stern to allow the decking of anchors, and having more power to increase the [[bollard pull]]. The machinery is specifically designed for anchor handling operations. They also have arrangements for quick anchor release, which is operable from the bridge or other normally manned location in direct communication with the bridge. The reference load used in the design and testing of the towing winch is twice the static bollard pull.

Even if AHTS-vessels are customized for anchor-handling and towing, they can also undertake, for example, ROV ([[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]) services, safety/rescue services, and supply duties between mainland and offshore installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolls-royce.com/marine/ship_design_systems/ship_designs_offshore_vessels/anchor_handling_tug_supply_vessels.jsp Anchor-handling/tug/supply vessels]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''announcement''' ('''ANN''') is a [[Usenet]], [[mailing list]] or [[e-mail]] message sent to notify subscribers that a [[software]] project has made a new [[software release|release]] version. [[Newsgroup]] announcement recipients often have a name like "comp.''somegroup''.announce". [[Mailing list]] announcement recipients often have a name like "''toolname''-announce". In an announcement, the [[subject line]] commonly contains the abbreviated prefix '''ANN:''' or '''[ANN]'''.

The contents of an announcement usually contain a title line which contains the tool name, version, release name, and date. Additional contents often fall into the following message sections:

* '''About:''' a short paragraph summary of the tool's purpose
* '''Changes:''' a list of the highest impact changes since the last release (should be brief since the [[changelog]] comprises the definitive list)
* '''Resources:''' links to project pages of interest, such as [[homepage]], where to download, [[bug tracking system]], etc.

Some additional, optional fields might include "Highlights", "Author(s)", "License", "Requirements", and "Release History".

Announcement messages are usually sent in [[plain text]] form.

== Example ==

Example announcement message [[subject line]]:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2101">'''The Atlantic Foundry Company''' was an [[Akron, Ohio]]-based [[iron]] [[casting]] manufacturer that operated from 1905 to 1989.  The company was founded by Charles Reymann Sr., a immigrant from [[Alsace-Lorraine]], along with 4 fellow foundryman, Ewald Erickson, Emil Krill, Fred Spalding, and Phillip Willenbacker, who had crossed the Atlantic Ocean when they migrated to America and named their new business The Atlantic Foundry.  To meet the growing demand for iron, in 1910 they built a modern iron foundry at 182 Beaver Street and in 1919 they added a huge steel foundry at the same site and began a steel casting business.  By this time Erickson and Krill had sold their interest to Reymann and he eventually became the President of the company, and the company was privately owned and operated by the Reymann family until its closing. 

At its peak, the company employed 450 people, including its most decorated foreman, William Knotts.  It operated its own [[credit union]].  The company also created a division called Akron Mattress Co., which was later sold in the late 1960s to a private concern that became Schubert Industries Inc. 

Atlantic Foundry closed on January 13, 1989. Thomas Reymann, the company’s final president, said the manufacturing plant had not been profitable during its final six years.  The [[Ohio Employee Ownership Center]] (OEOC), a non-profit program affiliated with [[Kent State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dept.kent.edu/oeoc/AbouttheOEOC/AboutTheOEOC.htm "About the OEOC," Kent State University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802161650/http://dept.kent.edu/oeoc/AbouttheOEOC/AboutTheOEOC.htm |date=August 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to work with the foundry’s employees to purchase the company from the Reymann family under the terms of an [[employee stock ownership plan]] (ESOP). However, a lawsuit brought by 125 foundry retirees seeking the resumption of health and life insurance benefits derailed the ESOP negotiations.

An '''automotive [[head-up display]]''' or '''automotive heads-up display''' —also known as a '''auto-HUD'''— is any transparent display that presents data in the [[automobile]] without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints. The origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned "up" and looking forward, instead of angled down looking at lower instruments. At this time, there are two different approaches to OEM HUDs in automobiles. The first is to treat the back of the [[windshield]] in such a way that an image projected onto it will reflect to the driver. The second is to have a small combiner that is separate from the windshield. Combiners can be retracted.

== Timeline ==

*1988: [[General Motors]] began using head-up displays. Their first HUD units were installed on [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] Indy Pace Cars and replicas. Optional HUD units were subsequently offered on the Cutlass Supreme and [[Pontiac Grand Prix]] before being more widely available. 
*1989–1994: Nissan offered a head-up display in the [[Nissan 240SX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/nissan/240sx/ |title=Nissan 240 Review |publisher=Edmunds.com |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1991: [[Toyota]], for the Japanese market only, released a HUD system for the [[Toyota Crown Majesta]]. 
*1998: The first color display appeared on the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C5)]].
*2003 : [[Cadillac]] introduced a HUD system for the [[Cadillac XLR]].
*2012: [[Pioneer Corporation]] introduced a navigation system that projects a HUD in place of the driver's visor that presents animations of conditions ahead, a form of [[augmented reality|augmented reality (AR)]].&lt;ref&gt;Pioneer launches car navigation with augmented reality, heads-up displays. System also uses dash cams to share images of street conditions across Japan. Alabaster, Jay | Computerworld | [http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9240445/Pioneer_launches_car_navigation_with_augmented_reality_heads_up_displays/ Pioneer launches car navigation with augmented reality, heads-up displays] June 28, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulanoff, Lance | Mashable | [http://mashable.com/2012/01/11/pioneer-ar-heads-up-display/ Pioneer AR Heads Up Display Augments Your Driving Reality] January 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

These displays are becoming increasingly available in production cars, and usually offer [[speedometer]], [[tachometer]], and [[Global Positioning System#Navigation|navigation system]] displays.

[[Automotive night vision|Night vision]] information is also displayed via HUD on certain [[General Motors]], [[Honda]], [[Toyota]] and [[Lexus]] vehicles. Other manufactures such as [[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Citroën]], [[Nissan]], [[Mazda]], [[Kia Motors|Kia]], [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W205)|Mercedes]] and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] currently offer some form of HUD system.

[[Motorcycle helmet]] HUDs are also commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.motorbiker.org/blogs.nsf/dx/SportVue.htm |title=Mike, Werner.

Add-on HUD systems also exist, projecting the display onto a glass combiner mounted on the windshield. These systems have been marketed to police agencies for use with in-vehicle computers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

'''Babtie, Shaw and Morton''' was a firm of [[civil engineering|civil engineer]]s based in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, and noted for its work on [[bridge]]s, [[dam]]s and [[reservoir]]s. It took its name following the 1906 merger of Babtie &amp; Bonn (a partnership founded by John Babtie and Carl Bonn in 1897) and Shaw &amp; Morton (founded by William Shaw and Hugh Morton).&lt;ref&gt;''Babtie, Shaw &amp; Morton'', Dictionary of Scottish Architects, 2008, http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''John Taylor Babtie'', Dictionary of Scottish Architects, 2008, http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100564&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable design projects include the [[Backwater Reservoir]], [[Kielder Water]],&lt;ref&gt;North Tyne, Kielder Reservoir http://www.bridgesonthetyne.co.uk/kdr.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipbuilding dock in [[Belfast]].

[[James Arthur Banks]] and [[William George Nicholson Geddes]] both became President of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] while partners in the firm.

The Babtie Group acquired consulting engineers Harris &amp; Sutherland in 1997, then also Allott &amp; Lomax in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nce.co.uk/allott-and-lomax-deal-fills-gap-in-babtie-portfolio/818923.article&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3,500-strong Babtie Group was acquired by [[Jacobs Engineering Group]] in August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobs buys Babtie consultancy for £90m'', Financial Times, 16 August 2004 - http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2d0cbf2e-f112-11d8-95b8-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1jTSLEMxI&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon Masterton, a director of Babtie from 1993 became the firm's third President of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in 2005 whilst a Vice President of Jacobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Masterton  | first = Gordon | author-link =  |  title = ICE Presidential Address  | date =  | year = 2005  | url = http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/cien.2006.159.2.55  | accessdate = 29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]'s '''Bureau of International Information Programs''' ('''IIP''') supports the department's public diplomacy efforts by providing and supporting the places, content, and infrastructure needed for sustained conversations with foreign audiences.  IIP is one of three bureaus that report to the Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.  The [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] and the [[Bureau of Public Affairs]] are the sister bureaus.

== History ==

When the Foreign Affairs and Restructuring Act abolished the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA) on October 1, 1999, USIA's broadcasting functions were moved to the newly created [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), and its non-broadcasting information functions were given to the newly created Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.  The Bureau of International Information Programs was created out of this restructuring.

== Mission and purpose ==

According to the bureau's page on the Department of State website, IIP "provides and supports the places, content, and infrastructure needed for sustained conversations with foreign audiences to build America's reputation abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bureau of International Information Programs|url=https://www.state.gov/r/iip/index.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical and virtual places include over 700 American Spaces around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Spaces|url=https://www.state.gov/r/iip/amerspaces/|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a large social media community that numbers over 12 million followers.  Content includes publications, video, and U.S. expert speakers, who engage foreign audiences both in person and through virtual programs.  IIP manages the infrastructure for all embassy and consulate websites, translations of public remarks by the President and Secretary, and maintains internal websites with resources for use by public diplomacy officers for overseas programs.

==Role and responsibility==

The Bureau of International Information Programs provides public diplomacy materials and support in three primary areas:

; Digital
IIP operates the department's embassy and consulate websites, which attract more than 150 million unique visitors per year (http://usembassy.gov) in over 60 languages.  IIP also supports embassy social media efforts with theme-based Facebook pages and Twitter sites in six languages, reaching more than 12 million fans and followers.

'''Business Intelligence Markup Language''' (Biml) is a domain-specific [[XML]] dialect for defining [[business intelligence]] (BI) assets.  Biml authored BI assets can currently be used by the [[BIDS Helper]] add-on for [[Microsoft SQL Server]] [[Business Intelligence Development Studio]] (BIDS) and the [[Varigence]] Mist (now called BimlStudio) [[integrated development environment]]; both tools translate Biml metadata into [[SQL Server Integration Services]] (SSIS) and [[Microsoft Analysis Services|SQL Server Analysis Services]] (SSAS) assets for the [[Microsoft SQL Server]] platform. However, emitters can be created to compile Biml for any desired BI platform.

While Biml’s declarative design is sufficient to author BI assets, BimlScript extends the language by enabling authors to embed [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[VB.NET]] code within Biml, similar to how [[ASP.NET]] includes .NET code within static [[HTML]] markup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chenn|first=Ronen|title=BIDS helper new features ( April 2011 )|url=http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/bilive/archive/2011/05/16/bids-helper-new-features-april-2011.aspx|accessdate=October 1, 2012|newspaper=Business Intelligence,Technology, Thoughts, Thinking|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BimlScript is used to merge changes into existing Biml assets, automatically generate Biml code, and apply changes across multiple Biml files during compilation.

==History==

===Biml===

Biml is an XML dialect that specifies all aspects of a BI solution, including relational models, data transformation packages, multi-dimensional models, and tabular models.

Unlike other BI solutions, Biml has a "write once, target any platform" philosophy. This enables Biml users to switch their target platform without needing to change their code. Currently, Biml targets SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012 and 2014, emitting SSIS packages and SSAS cubes.

Because Biml is XML, it can leverage the vast ecosystem of tools for XML based languages. This also makes it human readable/writeable, so it is easier to edit by hand than the SSIS/SSAS files it generates.

In late 2009, Biml was extended with BimlScript. BimlScript allows C# or VB.NET code nuggets to be embedded directly within Biml. BimlScript's goal is to automate repetitive work in reusable scripts. Additionally, it's been used to automate package generation and build reusable patterns for BI tasks. BimlScript is also used to take metadata from various sources (relational database structure, relational data, flat files, annotations, etc...) and automatically generate Biml code from it.

===Mist===
[[Mist (IDE)|Mist]] is an IDE for authoring Biml code and building BI assets. Mist leverages visual design capabilities and [[debugging]] features to simultaneously edit entire business intelligence models, including relational tables, SSIS packages, and [[OLAP cube|cubes]].&lt;ref name="Leonard2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Andy|title=SQL Server 2012 Integration Services Design Patterns|year=2012|publisher=APress|isbn=978-1430237716|pages=456|author2=Masson, Matt |author3=Mitchell, Tim |author4=Moss, Jessica |author5= Ufford, Michelle |chapter=Chapter 17: Business Intelligence Markup Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Mist also incorporates modern programming IDE features, including text editors with syntax highlighting, Intelliprompt and quick-info displays, source control integration, and multi-monitor support.

===BIDS Helper===
As Biml’s popularity has grown, key portions of the Biml engine, including dynamic package generation, have been contributed to the [http://bidshelper.codeplex.com BIDS Helper] open source project hosted on CodePlex.&lt;ref name="Tok2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tok|first=Wee-Hyong|title=Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Integration Services|year=2012|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn= 978-0735665859|author2=Parida, Rakesh |author3=Masson, Matt |author4=Ding, Xiaoning |author5= Sivashanmugam, Kaarthik  |page=511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welch|first=John|title=Biml Package Generator|url=http://bidshelper.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Biml%20Package%20Generator|work=BIDS Helper|accessdate=September 30, 2011|date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BimlScript community===
[http://www.bimlscript.com BimlScript.com] is a community website for developing and sharing Biml solutions to BI problems, and contributing Biml content to share with others. Along with tutorials, walkthroughs, and videos, the site provides an online Biml editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to BimlScript.com|url=http://bimlscript.com/Blog|work=BimlScript.com|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code generation==
Biml files are compiled to produce BI assets for a chosen platform. Currently, it’s possible to generate assets for Microsoft’s SSIS, SSAS, and SQL Server platforms, for the 2005, 2008 (R2), 2012 and 2014 releases. Other platforms may be targeted in the future.

==Syntax==
{{See also|XML#Key_terminology|l1=XML Terminology}}
Biml has a syntax that’s common to all XML languages. Tags begin and end with &lt; and &gt;, respectively. Furthermore, tags can have attributes and nested elements.

===Biml===

====Declaration====
Biml documents begin with a common declaration
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Root types====
Biml has a well-defined set of root types, indicating the various kinds of BI assets that can be created

* Connections
* Databases
* Schemas
* Tables
* Dimensions
* Facts
* Packages
* File Formats
* Script Projects
* Cubes
* Principals

====Example====
This is an example of the AdventureWorks DimCurrency table, authored in Biml

&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
  &lt;Dimensions&gt;
    &lt;Dimension Name="DimCurrency" SchemaName="Target.dbo" AttributeAllMemberName="All Source Currencies" DimensionType="Currency" FriendlyName="Currency"&gt;
      &lt;Columns&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyKey" /&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyAlternateKey" DataType="StringFixedLength" Length="3" /&gt;
        &lt;Column Name="CurrencyName" DataType="String" Length="50" /&gt;
      &lt;/Columns&gt;
      &lt;Keys&gt;
        &lt;Identity Name="IK_DimCurrency"&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
            &lt;Column ColumnName="CurrencyKey" /&gt;
          &lt;/Columns&gt;
        &lt;/Identity&gt;
        &lt;UniqueKey Name="AK_DimCurrency_CurrencyAlternateKey"&gt;
          &lt;Columns&gt;
            &lt;Column ColumnName="CurrencyAlternateKey" /&gt;
          &lt;/Columns&gt;
        &lt;/UniqueKey&gt;
      &lt;/Keys&gt;
      &lt;Indexes&gt;&lt;/Indexes&gt;
      &lt;Attributes&gt;
        &lt;Attribute Name="Source Currency" EstimatedCount="101" OrderBy="Name" AttributeType="CurrencySource" GroupingBehavior="DiscourageGrouping"&gt;
          &lt;InstanceSelection&gt;DropDown&lt;/InstanceSelection&gt;
          &lt;KeyColumns&gt;
            &lt;KeyColumn ColumnName="CurrencyName" NullProcessing="Error" /&gt;
          &lt;/KeyColumns&gt;
        &lt;/Attribute&gt;
        &lt;Attribute Name="Source Currency Code" EstimatedCount="105" OrderBy="Name" AttributeType="CurrencyIsoCode" Usage="Key" GroupingBehavior="DiscourageGrouping"&gt;
          &lt;InstanceSelection&gt;DropDown&lt;/InstanceSelection&gt;
          &lt;KeyColumns&gt;
            &lt;KeyColumn ColumnName="CurrencyKey" NullProcessing="Error" /&gt;
          &lt;/KeyColumns&gt;
          &lt;NameColumn ColumnName="CurrencyAlternateKey" /&gt;
        &lt;/Attribute&gt;
      &lt;/Attributes&gt;
      &lt;Relationships&gt;
        &lt;Relationship Name="Source Currency" ParentAttributeName="Source Currency Code" ChildAttributeName="Source Currency" Type="Rigid" /&gt;
      &lt;/Relationships&gt;
    &lt;/Dimension&gt;
  &lt;/Dimensions&gt;
&lt;/Biml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===BimlScript===
All BimlScript tags begin and end with &lt;# and #&gt; delimiters, respectively. Special types of BimlScript tags use augmented versions of these delimiters, to indicate specific usages.

====Directives====
A Biml file, with BimlScript, begins with at least one directive. Directives provide instructions to the Biml engine, regarding how to process the BimlScript and generate its Biml. Directives are single tags that begin with &lt;#@. Each directive begins with a single term, followed by attributes that supply required values.

The two most common directives are template and import.

=====Template=====
This directive indicates that the file's BimlScript uses the C# programming language.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;#@ template language="C#" #&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=====Import=====
This directive specifies .NET namespaces that should be imported for the file. It is functionally equivalent to the C# using statement or VB.NET Imports statement.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Languages.Biml.Connection" #&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

====Delimiters====
When authoring BimlScript, additional delimiters may be used. These delimiters match the behavior of T4 template delimiters.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Delimiter !! Description
|-
| &lt;# || Defines statements, in .NET code, that provide control flow in a Biml file.
|-
| &lt;#= || Evaluates .NET code, converts it to a string, and then embeds it in the Biml file.
|-
| &lt;#+ || Defines properties, methods, and files that are excluded from the Biml file but may be accessed by other BimlScript code nuggets.
|}

====Example====
This BimlScript example imports a database's assets via a connection, declared in a separate file, named "AdventureWorksLT". Each schema and table from the imported database is then embedded directly within the Schemas and Tables collections, respectively.
&lt;source lang = "xml" &gt; 
&lt;#@ template language="C#" hostspecific="True" tier="2" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Languages.Biml.Connection" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.Extensions" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.Extensions.SchemaManagement" #&gt;
&lt;#@ import namespace="Varigence.Hadron.CoreLowerer.SchemaManagement" #&gt;

&lt;#+ public ImportResults Results
{ 
    get 
    { 
        return ((AstOleDbConnectionNode)RootNode.Connections["AdventureWorksLT"]).ImportDB();
    }
}
#&gt; 

&lt;Biml xmlns="http://schemas.varigence.com/biml.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;Databases&gt;
        &lt;Database Name="MyDatabase" ConnectionName="AdventureWorksLT" /&gt;
    &lt;/Databases&gt;
    &lt;Schemas&gt;
        &lt;#=Results.SchemaNodes.GetBiml()#&gt;
    &lt;/Schemas&gt;
    &lt;Tables&gt; 
        &lt;#=Results.TableNodes.GetBiml()#&gt;
    &lt;/Tables&gt;
&lt;/Biml&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This example shows how developers can use Biml and BimlScript to:
# Import schemas and tables directly from a database, and use them without needing to manually copy their structure.
# Have any changes to the assets be automatically reflected the next time this code is run.
# Import the assets and convert them to Biml using only two simple lines of code.

'''C2Net''' was an [[Internet]] [[cryptography]] company founded by [[Sameer Parekh]], which was sold to [[Red Hat]] in 2000. It was best known for its [[Stronghold (software)|Stronghold]] secure webserver software.

==Community ConneXion==
C2Net started out as Community ConneXion in 1994,

==Products: Stronghold and Safe Passage==
After seeing a demand for an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]-based SSL-capable web server, Sameer Parekh developed the first version of Stronghold by plugging together [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] with [[SSLeay]], [[Apache-SSL]], and a commercially licensed [[RSAref]]. The product was wildly successful but the company was unwilling to compromise security to get an export license for its products. Thus, C2Net purchased UKWeb, an Apache consultancy in [[Leeds]], which independently re-engineered the Stronghold product (without RSAref) for the international market. This made C2Net the first American company to be capable of providing strong encryption solutions to a worldwide market.

Eventually C2Net hired the [[SSLeay]] developers Eric Young and Tim Hudson&lt;ref name="c2.net"/&gt; in Brisbane, Australia to develop more encryption products. C2Net's relationship with [[RSA Data Security, Inc.]] was rocky because C2Net was using the leaked version of their trade-secret encryption Algorithm [[RC4]], rather than a version licensed from them directly. It was in fact this leaked version of RC4 that made it possible to develop a full-strength version of Stronghold outside of the United States. Eventually, C2Net and RSA Data Security, Inc. resolved their differences, and C2Net purchased a patent license for RSA and a license to use the trade-secret RC4 within the United States. During merger negotiations between RSA and C2Net, RSA hired C2Net's Australian team and set up their own overseas development effort in Australia in order to produce the BSAFE-SSL product for worldwide sales. Other companies began to emulate this development strategy and the United States government subsequently [[Export of cryptography from the United States#PC era|relaxed restrictions on export of cryptographic technology]].

C2Net also offered SafePassage client-side products, including a web proxy and also a [[Virtual_private_network|Virtual Private Network (VPN)]].&lt;ref name="c2 product"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/19971210135858/http://www.c2.net:80/products/ |title=C2Net Products |publisher=[[c2.net via Internet Archive]] |accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosting the first ApacheCon==
In October, 1998, C2Net and the Apache Project hosted the first [[ApacheCon]] conference.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drbacchus.com/apachecon-eu/|title=ApacheCon EU |last= Bowen|first=Rich |date= November 4, 2012|website=drbacchus.com |publisher= |access-date=August 31, 2017 |quote="In 1998, there was an event called ApacheCon, in San Francisco, hosted by CNet, but that was before the Apache Software Foundation was formed." -- Rich Bowen, Vice President of Conferences,  Apache Software Foundation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New CEO and Sale to Red Hat==
After losing the Australian office, C2Net focused primarily on selling and supporting Stronghold and hired a new CEO, Bill Rowzee. He brought the company back to profitability, and as the RSA patent was due to expire in 2000, they shifted the company's strategy to focus primarily on support. Finally, they sold the company to Red Hat in 2000.

[[Image:Washing Utensils And Vegetables.png|Women at a village pond in [[Matlab, Bangladesh]] washing utensils and vegetables. The woman on the right is putting a sari filter onto a water-collecting pot (or [[Kalasha|kalash]]) to filter water for drinking.|thumb|240px]]

Developed for use in [[Bangladesh]], the '''cloth filter''' is a simple and cost-effective [[appropriate technology]] method for reducing the contamination of drinking water. Water collected in this way has a greatly reduced [[pathogen]] count - though it will not necessarily be perfectly safe, it is an improvement for poor people with limited options. Filtering water to free it from microorganism has been an age old practice among [[Jains]] who carefully remove the microorganism in the cloth through filtered water in order to follow doctrine of [[Ahimsa]] or non violence, preventing pain to any living creature.

==Method==
The method used in Bangladesh is as follows: cloth is folded to make four or eight layers and the folded cloth is placed over a wide-mouthed container used to collect surface water. 
It is usually sufficient to rinse the cloth and dry it in the sun for a couple of hours. In the [[monsoon]] seasons, it may be advisable to use a cheap [[disinfectant]] to decontaminate the material.

The preferred cloth is used cotton [[sari]] cloth. Other types of clean, used cloth can be used with some effect, though the effectiveness will vary significantly. Used cloth is more effective than new cloth, as the repeated washing reduces the space between the fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Moss J |title=Cloth Filters Fight Cholera |work=Development Report |publisher=Voice of America |date=January 27, 2003 |url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/03/030127dr_t.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804132758/http://www.manythings.org/voa/03/030127dr_t.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
The cloth is effective because most pathogens are attached to particles and plankton, particularly a type of zooplankton called [[copepod]]s, within the water. By passing the water through an effective filter, most cholera bacteria and other pathogens are removed. It has been demonstrated to greatly reduce [[cholera]] infections in poor villages where disinfectants and fuel for boiling are difficult to get.

In [[sub-Saharan Africa]] where [[guinea worm]] infections ([[dracunculiasis]]) are endemic, infection is prevented by use of a nylon mesh with pore size of approximately 150 [[μm]] to filter out the copepods that host the parasite.&lt;ref name="original"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Colwell RR, Huq A, Islam MS |title=Reduction of cholera in Bangladeshi villages by simple filtration |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=1051–5 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12529505 |pmc=298724 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0237386100 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fighting the 'fiery serpent' in Sudan |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/06/2267262.htm |agency=Reuters |work=ABC News |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 6, 2008 |quote=The [[Carter Center]] distributes cloth filters and plastic drinking pipes with gauze at one end to block the larvae.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hopkins DR, Ruiz-Tiben E, Diallo N, Withers PC, Maguire JH |title=Dracunculiasis eradication: and now, Sudan |journal=Am.

In 2001, however, in addition to distributing nearly 850,000 filters for household use, more than 7.8 million pipe filters were also distributed throughout endemic areas ....
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An old cotton sari, folded, creates a smaller effective mesh size (approximately 20-μm). This should be small enough to remove all zooplankton, most phytoplankton, and thus a large proportion of the cholera in the water (99%, according to laboratory studies). However, the nylon net with the larger mesh size was found to be "almost equally effective."&lt;ref name="original"/&gt;

The cloth filter provides less than ideal purification on its own - usually filtering is an initial step, to be followed by further disinfection. However, where there are no other options, water professionals may consider that it is "of course, better than nothing" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hogan J |title=Old clothes filter out cholera |journal=[[New Scientist]] |date=13 January 2003 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn3258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The cloth filter has been studied and reported on by [[Rita R. Colwell|Rita Colwell]] and [[Anwar Huq]] from the [[University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute]], together with other researchers from the United States and [[Bangladesh]]. They report that: "It is common practice in villages in Bangladesh to use cloth, frequently a flat, unfolded piece of an old sari, to filter home-prepared drinks".&lt;ref name="original"/&gt;

The researchers studied the application of this technique to drinking water, with folded cloth. They studied the pore size of the cloth, the effect of folding the cloth on the effective pore size, the ability of the cloth to remove particles and plankton, as well as the effect on rates of cholera when used in a Bangladesh village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Anwar |last= Huq |author2=Mohammed Yunus |author3=Syed Salahuddin Sohel |author4=Abbas Bhuiya |author5=Michael Emch |author6=Stephen P.

'''doctest''' is a module included in the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language's standard library that allows the easy generation of tests based on output from the standard Python interpreter shell, cut and pasted into [[docstring]]s.

==Implementation specifics==

Doctest makes innovative{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} use of the following Python capabilities:&lt;ref name="TimPeters"&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/msg/1c57cfb7b3772763 docstring-driven testing]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[docstring]]s
* The Python interactive shell, (both command line and the included idle application).
* Python introspection

When using the Python shell, the primary prompt: &gt;&gt;&gt; , is followed by new commands. The secondary prompt: ... , is used when continuing commands on multiple lines; and the result of executing the command is expected on following lines.
A blank line, or another line starting with the primary prompt is seen as the end of the output from the command.

The doctest module looks for such sequences of prompts in a docstring, re-executes the extracted command and checks the output against the output of the command given in the docstrings test example.

The default action when running doctests is for no output to be shown when tests pass. This can be modified by options to the doctest runner. In addition, doctest has been integrated with the Python unit test module allowing doctests to be run as standard unittest testcases. Unittest testcase runners allow more options when running tests such as the reporting of test statistics such as tests passed, and failed.

==[[Literate programming]] and doctests==

Although doctest does not allow a Python program to be embedded in narrative text, it does allow for verifiable examples to be embedded in docstrings, where the docstrings can contain other text. Docstrings can in turn be extracted from program files to generate documentation in other formats such as HTML or PDF. 
A program file can be made to contain the documentation, tests, as well as the code and the tests easily verified against the code. This allows code, tests, and documentation to evolve together.

==Documenting libraries by example==

Doctests are well suited to provide an introduction to a library by demonstrating how the API is used.

On the basis of the output of Python's interactive interpreter, text can be mixed with tests that exercise the library, showing expected results.

==Examples==

Example one shows how narrative text can be interspersed with testable examples in a docstring. 
In the second example, more features of doctest are shown, together with their explanation. 
Example three is set up to run all doctests in a file when the file is run, but when imported as a module, the tests will not be run.

=== Example 1: A doctest embedded in the docstring of a function ===
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def list_to_0_index(lst):
    """A solution to the problem given in:
    http://rgrig.blogspot.com/2005/11/writing-readable-code.html
    
    'Given a list, lst, say for each element the 0-index where it appears for
    the first time. So the list x = [0, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2] is
    transformed into y = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]. Notice that for all
    i we have x[y[i]] = x[i]. Use any programming language and any data
    representation you want.'
    
    &gt;&gt;&gt; x = [0, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; list_to_0_index(x)
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
    """
    
    return [lst.index(i) for i in lst]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example 2: doctests embedded in a README.txt file ===

&lt;source lang="pycon"&gt;
======================
Demonstration doctests
======================

This is just an example of what a README text looks like that can be used with
the doctest.DocFileSuite() function from Python's doctest module.

Normally, the README file would explain the API of the module, like this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a + b
3

Notice, that we just demonstrated how to add two numbers in Python, and 
what the result will look like.

A special option allows you to be somewhat fuzzy about your examples:

&gt;&gt;&gt; o = object()
&gt;&gt;&gt; o                 # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
&lt;object object at 0x...&gt;

Exceptions can be tested very nicely too:

&gt;&gt;&gt; x
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
NameError: name 'x' is not defined

&lt;/source&gt;

=== Example 3: unique_words.py ===
This example also simulates input to the function from a file by using the Python StringIO module
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def unique_words(page):
  ''' Returns set of the unique words in list of lines of text

    Example:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; from StringIO import StringIO
    &gt;&gt;&gt; fileText = """the cat sat on the mat
    ... the mat was ondur the cat
    ... one fish two fish red fish
    ... blue fish
    ... This fish has a yellow car
    ... This fish has a yellow star"""
    &gt;&gt;&gt; file = StringIO(fileText)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; page = file.readlines()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; words = unique_words(page)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print sorted(list(words))
    ["This", "a", "blue", "car", "cat", "fish", "has", "mat", 
     "on", "ondur", "one", "red", "sat", "star", "the", "two", 
     "was", "yellow"]
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
  '''

  return set(word  for line in page  for word in line.split())

def _test():
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    _test()

&lt;/source&gt;

== Doctest and documentation generators ==

Both the EpyText format of [[Epydoc]] and Docutils' [[reStructuredText]] format support the markup of doctest sections within docstrings.

== Implementation in other programming languages ==

In C++, the doctest framework is the closest possible implementation of the concept - tests can be written directly in the production code with minimal overhead and the option to strip them from the binary.&lt;ref name="C++ github.com/onqtam/doctest"&gt;
[https://github.com/onqtam/doctest C++ github.com/onqtam/doctest]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ExUnit.DocTest [[Elixir (programming language)|Elixir]] library implements functionality similar to Doctest.&lt;ref name="Elixir ExUnit.DocTest"&gt;[https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.DocTest.html Elixir ExUnit.DocTest]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''elevator test tower''' is a structure usually 100 to over 200 metres tall that is designed to evaluate the stress and fatigue limits of specific [[elevator]] cars in a controlled environment.  Tests are also carried out in the test tower to ensure reliability and safety in current elevator designs and address any failures that may arise.  Examples of an elevator test tower are the [[National Lift Tower]] in [[Northampton]], [[England]], the [[Solae (tower)| Solae Tower]] in [[Inazawa, Aichi|Inazawa]], [[Japan]], and the [[Rottweil Test Tower]] in Germany (owned by [[ThyssenKrupp]]).

In 1888, [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis]] completed an elevator test tower at their factory in [[Yonkers, New York]]; this was possibly the first elevator test tower in the United States.&lt;ref name="Gray2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Edward Gray|title=From Ascending Rooms to Express Elevators: A History of the Passenger Elevator in the 19th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qq4gVSkfnPcC&amp;pg=PA171|year=2002|publisher=Elevator World Inc|isbn=978-1-886536-46-3|page=171|quote=An important aspect of this effort was the use of what was perhaps the first elevator test tower built in the U.S. The tower, completed in 1888, was built as part of a major expansion of the factory in Yonkers and was used as the final test arena for the first Otis electric elevators manufactured for a specific customer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fishing basket''' is a [[basket]] used for [[fishing]].

==History==
The ancient [[Egyptians]] used [[Fishing weir|weir basket]]s made from willow branches to fish the [[Nile]] river. 

The use of fishing weirs was specifically outlawed throughout [[England]], except at the seacoast, by order of the [[Magna Carta]], but little heed was given to the restrictions.

The Spaniards named the [[Nazas River]] after the fishing baskets they saw the local peoples using in the river.

==Fishing==
[[Image:Wagenya_Rapids.JPG|thumb|Wagenya fishing baskets]]
[[File:Local fishers in Kenya using the traditional basket trap.jpg|thumb|Local fishers in [[Kenya]] using the traditional basket trap]]
The [[Wagenya]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] build a huge system of wooden tripods across the river. These tripods are anchored on the holes naturally carved in the rock by the water current. To these tripods are anchored large baskets, which are lowered in the rapids to “sieve” the waters for fish. It is a very selective fishing method, as these baskets are quite big and only large fish are entrapped. Twice a day the adult Wagenya people pull out these baskets to check if there is any fish caught; in which case somebody will dive into the river to fetch it. At the end of each day the product of this ancient way of fishing is divided among all the members of the same family; including also those who did not take direct action into it. The locations where each individual can set his baskets are inherited.

[[Elver]] fishing using basket traps, including [[eel buck]]s, has been of significant economic value in many river estuaries on the western seaboard of Europe.

The [[Kuki people]] of [[India]], [[Burma]], and [[Bangladesh]] use many kinds of traps and snares, including the Bawm (basket trap). Ngoituh is a method of using [[dam]]s and baskets in a flowing river to catch fish.

==Basketmaking==
The [[Gogodala people|Gogodala]] women of [[Papua New Guinea]] earn income from their making of fishing baskets.

The [[tribes of Jharkhand]] in [[India]] use a unique local [[bamboo]] to fashion sturdy fishing baskets.

==Cultural significance==
The [[Dance of Cambodia]] can involve the carrying of fishing baskets. 

The basket stitch on an [[Aran sweater]] on the [[Aran Islands]] off [[Ireland]] signifies the fisherman's basket and the knitter's wish for the recipient's plentiful catch.

In [[computer architecture]], '''frequency scaling''' (also known as '''frequency ramping''') is the technique of increasing a processor's [[frequency]] so as to enhance the performance of the system containing the processor in question. Frequency ramping was the dominant force in commodity processor performance increases from the mid-1980s until roughly the end of 2004. 

The effect of processor [[frequency]] on computer speed can be seen by looking at the equation for computer program runtime: 
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Run time} = \frac{\mathrm{Instructions}}{\mathrm{Program}} \times \frac{\mathrm{Cycles}}{\mathrm{Instruction}} \times \frac {\mathrm{Time}}{\mathrm{Cycle}},&lt;/math&gt;
where instructions per program is the total instructions being executed in a given program, cycles per instruction is a program-dependent, architecture-dependent average value, and time per cycle is by definition the inverse of processor frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[[John L. Hennessy]] and [[David A. Patterson (scientist)|David A. Patterson]]. Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach. 3rd edition, 2002. Morgan Kaufmann, {{ISBN|1-55860-724-2}}. Page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime. 

However, [[power consumption]] in a chip is given by the equation 
: &lt;math&gt;P = C \times V^2 \times F,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is power consumption, ''C'' is the [[capacitance]] being switched per clock cycle, ''V'' is [[voltage]], and ''F'' is the processor frequency (cycles per second).&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Rabaey. Digital Integrated Circuits. Prentice Hall, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in frequency thus increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor [[power consumption]] led ultimately to [[Intel]]'s May 2004 cancellation of its [[Tejas and Jayhawk]] processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie J. Flynn. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/08/business/08chip.html?ex=1399348800&amp;en=98cc44ca97b1a562&amp;ei=5007 Intel Halts Development of 2 New Microprocessors]. ''New York Times'', May 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Moore's Law]] was&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/moores-law-really-is-dead-this-time/&lt;/ref&gt; still in effect when frequency scaling ended. Despite power issues, transistor densities were still doubling every 18 to 24 months. With the end of frequency scaling, new transistors (which are no longer needed to facilitate frequency scaling) are used to add extra hardware, such as additional cores, to facilitate parallel computing - a technique that is being referred to as [[parallel scaling]].

The end of frequency scaling as the dominant cause of processor performance gains has caused an industry-wide shift to [[parallel computing]] in the form of [[Multi-core (computing)|multicore processors]].

''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol 367, pp. 489-491&lt;/ref&gt; The RLDB distributed [[Molecular biology#Arrays|macroarrays]] generated at the ICRF to research groups worldwide. The macroarrays consisted of [[Cloning|clones]] of [[genomic library|genomic]] and [[cDNA library|cDNA]] libraries transferred to 22 × 22&amp;nbsp;cm nylon filters with the help of robots which have been developed by Zehetner at the ICRF. Experimental results done with the standardized materials were reported back by researches and collected in the ''Primary Database''.&lt;ref&gt;Preparation and screening of high-density cDNA arrays with Genomic Clones (Methods in Molecular Biology, vol 175:. Genomics Protocols, edited by: MP Starkey and R. Elaswarapu, Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ), Günther Zehetner, Maria Pack, and Katja Schäfer (2001), pp. 169-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1995 the RLDB was moved to Berlin to the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics]], where it continued its work.&lt;ref&gt;''Max-Planck-Institut will Gen-Bank einrichten'', [[Die Welt]], 31 May 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1995, the Resource Centre was established as part of the German [[Human Genome Project]] (DHGP) by Hans Lehrach (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics (MPIMG), [[Berlin-Dahlem]]), Günther Zehetner (MPIMG, until July 2000 Scientific Director of the Berlin Resource Center) and Annemarie Poustka ([[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ), Heidelberg). As ''Resource Center/Primary Database'' (RZPD) it took over the work of the RLDB. It was funded by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF) in order to provide the materials free of charge to the members of the DHGP, while they were available to other researchers at cost prize. The RZPD became the largest [[database]] for genetic clones worldwide and was associated with many of the major national and international gene and genome research projects.
[[File:Microtiter plates, Wash U Human YAC Library, 1993.JPG|thumb|110px|left|Frozen microtiter plates with library clones]]
The RZPD was one of only two distributors in Europe for [[IMAGE cDNA clones]] and also constructed its own [[plasmid]], [[cosmid]], [[Yeast artificial chromosome|YAC]] and cDNA [[Library (biology)|libraries]]. Each clone was stored in a well of a 96 or 384 well [[microtiter plate]], which were kept, while not used for spotting, in deep freezers at -80&amp;nbsp;°C.

On 1 July 2000 the RZPD was converted into a [[non-profit organization|Non-Profit]]-[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]] (gGmbH). This [[Limited liability company|company with limited liability]] was supported by three of the most important research companies in Germany: the [[Max Planck Society]], the [[German Cancer Research Center]] and the [[Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine]] (MDC [[Berlin-Buch]]). As scientific company members served Hans Lehrach (MPIMG), Annemarie Poustka (DKFZ), [[Jens Reich]] (MDC) Matthias Uhlen ([[Karolinska Institute]], [[Stockholm]]) and [[Harald zur Hausen]] (DKFZ).

On 31 July 2007 the non-profit company was disbanded. A large part of the existing services was taken over by two new companies. ''ImaGenes'' (a start-up company by the former managing directors of the RZPD) and ''ATLAS Biolabs GmbH'', which was co-founded by Lehrach with the former department heads of the RZPD, Uwe Radelof und Bernd Drescher.&lt;ref&gt;''RZPD wird ImaGenes – Wirtschaftlicher Erfolg ermöglicht Änderung der Rechtsform'' GenomXPress 3/07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
[[Image:Heubnerweg(7).JPG|thumb | 250px | right | Neo-baroque institute building in Berlin]]
The scope of services was constantly expanded and included the provision of genomic cell clones and cDNA databases, [[cell culture]]s, [[microarray]]s, [[gene expression|expression]] profiles, [[Affymetrix]] services and [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] offers. Data collected in the ''Primary Database'' were made available to compare experimental results by researches using the globally standardized material provided by the center.&lt;ref&gt;''Development and perspectives of scientific services offered by genomic biological resource centers'', Oxford Journals, briefings in Functional Genomics and Proteomics 2007, Volume 6, Number 3, pp. 163-170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
[[File:Royal College of Surgeons and Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Lincoln's Inn Fields (120853269).jpg|left|thumb|200px|Royal College of Surgeons (centre) and Imperial Cancer Research Fund (right), London]]
The RLDB office in London was located in the main ICRF building at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], [[Holborn]] and later moved to bigger premises in the adjacent [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] building.

In Berlin the RZPD was first located at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin-Dahlem and then moved to a nearby site at the Harnack road (which today is the site of the [[Max Planck Institute for the History of Science]]) before the center relocated to its final location at the former building of the ''[[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Empress Auguste Viktoria]] Infant Home'' in Heubnerweg in Berlin-Charlottenburg. The [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-baroque]] building was constructed in the years 1907–1909 under the leadership of [[architect]] and Berlin City Commissioner for City Planning [[Ludwig Hoffmann (architect)|Ludwig Hoffmann]] established, while the planning was significantly influenced by the architect [[Alfred Messel]]. The small Heidelberg component of the center was located within the DKFZ.

'''''Hackaday''''' is a [[blog]] which publishes several articles each day about hardware and software hacks. A hack refers to modifications of a product or software as well as the creation of something entirely new for convenience, novelty, functional or creative reasons.
Hackaday also has a [[YouTube]] channel where it posts projects and how-to videos.

==History==
Hackaday was founded in 2004 as a web magazine for [[Engadget]] devoted to publishing and archiving "the best hacks, mods and DIY (do it yourself) projects from around web".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Phillip Torrone|title=Introducing Hack A Day, the gadget hack archive|url=https://www.engadget.com/2004/10/07/introducing-hack-a-day-the-gadget-hack-archive/|work=Engadget|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jolly Wrencher, Hackaday's logo, was designed by Phillip Torrone, the spouse of [[Adafruit Industries|Adafruit]] founder [[Limor Fried]]. Torrone also wrote the first article for the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Phillip Torrone answers your questions|url=http://hackaday.com/2010/11/29/phillip-torrone-answers-your-questions/|website=Hackaday|accessdate=7 December 2015|author=Caleb Kraft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hackaday has since split from Engadget and is currently powered by [[Wordpress.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hack a Day|url=http://wordpress.org/showcase/hack-a-day/|publisher=[[Wordpress.com]]|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hackaday.io==
[http://hackaday.io Hackaday.io] started as a project hosting site in early 2014 under the name of Hackaday Projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2014/02/18/hackaday-launches-our-own-hosting-site/|title=Introducing: Hackaday Projects| work=Hackaday|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a hosting space for documenting hardware and software projects. It has now grown into a social network of over 350,000 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2015/10/29/hackaday-io-just-passed-100000-members/|title=Hackaday.io Just Passed 350,000 Members|work=Hackaday|accessdate=3 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating projects which cover a wide range of topics that appeal to the DIY mindset.

==Accolades==
In 2007 ''[[Computerworld]]'' magazine ranked Hackaday #10 on their list of the top 15 geek blog sites.&lt;ref name=CW&gt;{{cite web|last=Computerworld staff|title=Top 15 geek blog sites|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2545070/data-center/top-15-geek-blog-sites.html|work=Computerworld|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hackaday Prize==
In 2014 Hackaday announced the launch of its annual Hackaday Prize providing a trip to space to the first-place winner of a contest of open design.
The first place finalist, [[SatNOGS]], opted for the prize money instead of the trip to space.

The 2015 Hackaday Prize winner announced at the Hackaday Super Conference in San Francisco, CA, on 20 November 2015. The first place project, [https://hackaday.io/project/5426-eye-controlled-wheelchair an eye controlled wheelchair], was developed by Patrick Joyce, Steve Evans, and David Hopkinson. 2015 also saw a new Best Product category, won by Reinier van der Lee who developed [https://hackaday.io/project/6444-vinduino-a-wine-growers-water-saving-project Vinduino], a soil moisture monitoring system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">A '''hand bailer''' is a device used for removing water which has entered a [[boat]]. In the simplest case, it is merely a container which can be filled manually and then emptied. This kind of device is in use since early times. It is still in use on small boats and rafts. Some regulations require them as mandatory equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 9650 Small craft, inflatable liferafts [http://www.4ocean.si/novice/Rules/ISO_9650-1_2005_PDF_version_(en).pdf 2005(E) (pdf-file 244 KB)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ISAF (International Sailing Federation), liferafts&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hipot tester.jpg|thumb|Hipot tester]]
'''Hipot''' is an abbreviation for '''high potential'''. Traditionally, hipot is a term given to a class of electrical safety testing instruments used to verify [[electrical insulation]] in finished appliances, cables or other wired assemblies, [[printed circuit boards]], [[electric motors]], and [[transformer]]s.

Under normal conditions, any electrical device will produce a minimal amount of leakage current due to the voltages and internal capacitance present within the product. Yet due to design flaws or other factors, the insulation in a product can break down, resulting in excessive leakage current flow. This failure condition can cause a shock to anyone that comes into contact with the faulty product.

A hipot test (also called Dielectric Withstanding Voltage (DWV) test) verifies that the insulation of a product or component is sufficient to protect the operator from electrical shock. In a typical hipot test, high voltage is applied between a product's current-carrying conductors and its metallic shielding. The resulting current that flows through the insulation, known as leakage current, is monitored by the [[#Hipot tester|hipot tester]]. The theory behind the test is that if a deliberate over-application of test voltage does not cause the insulation to break down, the product will be safe to use under normal operating conditions—hence the name, Dielectric Withstanding Voltage test.

In addition to over-stressing the insulation, the test can also be performed to detect material and workmanship defects, most importantly small gap spacings between current-carrying conductors and earth ground. When a product is operated under normal conditions, environmental factors such as humidity, dirt, vibration, shock and contaminants can close these small gaps and allow current to flow. This condition can create a shock hazard if the defects are not corrected at the factory. No other test can uncover this type of defect as well as the Dielectric Withstand test.

Three types of hipot tests are commonly used. These three tests differ in the amount of voltage applied and the amount (or nature) of acceptable current flow:

'''[[Dielectric breakdown|Dielectric Breakdown Test]].''' The test voltage is increased until the dielectric fails, or breaks down, allowing too much current to flow. The dielectric is often destroyed by this test so this test is used on a random sample basis. This test allows designers to estimate the breakdown voltage of a product's design and to see where the breakdown occurred.

'''[[Dielectric withstand test|Dielectric Withstand Test]].''' A standard test voltage is applied (below the established Breakdown Voltage) and the resulting leakage current is monitored. The leakage current must be below a preset limit or the test is considered to have failed. This test is non-destructive providing that it does not fail and is usually required by safety agencies to be performed as a 100% production line test on all products before they leave the factory.

'''Insulation Resistance Test.''' This test is used to provide a quantifiable resistance value for all of a product's insulation. The test voltage is applied in the same fashion as a standard hipot test, but is specified to be Direct Current (DC). The voltage and measured current value are used to calculate the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the insulation.

== Hipot tester ==
[[File:Hipot tester in action.jpg|thumb|Testing electrical equipment with Hipot tester]]
A '''hipot tester''' is an electronic device used to verify the [[electrical insulation]] in a device or other wired assembly that could subject someone to a shock if it failed. It generally consists of:

# A source of high voltage,
# A current meter,
# A switching matrix used to connect the high voltage source and the current meter to all of the contact points in a cable.

Hipot testers may also have a microcontroller and a display to automate the testing process and display the testing results.

A hipot tester can be very similar to a [[cable tester]] and often the two are combined into a single device.

In a typical wired assembly a hipot test should connect all circuits in common to ground. Then, one by one the tester will disconnect a given circuit from ground and connect that circuit to high voltage . The current that flows is monitored to verify that it is low enough.

The '''Hotchkiss Ordnance Company''' was an [[English people|English]] [[armaments]] manufacturer founded by [[American people|American]] ordnance [[engineer]] [[Benjamin B. Hotchkiss]]. 

==History==
In the 1850s, Hotchkiss was employed as a [[gunsmith]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], working on [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] revolvers and [[Winchester rifle]]s.  He went to France in 1867 and organized '''Hotchkiss &amp; Co.''' in 1875, setting up offices in [[Paris]] and manufacturing facilities in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]]. This company enjoyed success and the confidence of [[French people|French]] authorities, receiving large governmental orders and was allowed to export arms to other countries. In 1884, Hotchkiss and [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong &amp; Co.]] of [[England]] agreed to manufacture Hotchkiss guns at the [[Elswick Ordnance Company|Elswick]] works. Hotchkiss died in 1885 and in 1887, the affairs of both companies were placed under the French corporation and renamed respectively, the [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Société Anonyme des Anciens Etablissements Hotchkiss et Cie]] of France and the '''Hotchkiss Ordnance Company, Ltd.''' in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Chinn | first = George M. | title = The Machine Gun, History, Evolution, and Development of Manual, Automatic, and Airborne Repeating Weapons | url= http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/MG/I/MG-2.html#8 | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Deltathree]] was founded in 1996 and on March 14, 1997 first demonstrated a direct telephone conversation over the [[Internet]]. By June 1999, deltathree's PC-to-Phone and Phone-to-Phone services became commercially available. In September 2001 the '''iConnectHere''' brand and service was launched with even lower rates that initially offered.&lt;ref name=VoipServiceCarriers&gt;{{Citation

 | url = http://www.voipservicecarriers.com/iconnecthere.html
 | journal = VoipServiceCarriers.com
 | accessdate = 2010-04-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 19, 2001, [[Deltathree]] announced that iConnectHere would offer its PC-to-phone service to MSN Messenger and Windows Messenger users in 17 countries.&lt;ref name=VoipServiceCarriers /&gt; 

In 2007 [[Deltathree]] launched a communications solution called '''joip''' jointly with [[Panasonic]]. joip is a service enabling regular phone owners of Panasonic's Globrange to make cheap international calls.&lt;ref name="snapvoip.blogspot.com"&gt;{{Citation

 | date = July 23, 2007
 | journal = VOIP IP Telephony
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 [[Deltathree]] launched a communications solution called the joip Mobile (mobile.joip.com).  This voip mobile dialer can be downloaded to the mobile (practically any smartphone) of the user:  BlackBerry OS, Symbian OS, Android OS and  iPhone.  Windows OS and Blackberry will soon be launched as well .&lt;ref name="snapvoip.blogspot.com"/&gt;

On August 1, 2017, Deltathree, LLC, provider of iConnecthere discontinued service.

==Client applications and devices==
iConnectHere provides a free client applications such as the PC to Phone Dialer and Mobile Dialers as part of its service; to date the application had 8 major releases (current version is 8).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{Politics of Bahrain}}
The '''Information Affairs Authority''' refers to [[Bahrain]]'s ministry of information.

==History and profile==
It was formed in July 2010 by a decree of [[King Hamad]] separating the information portfolio from what was then known as the "Ministry of Culture and Information".&lt;ref name=GDN&gt;{{cite news|title=His Majesty issues decrees|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=281924|newspaper=[[Gulf Daily News]]|date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=decree1&gt;{{cite news|title=Decree No 31 of the Year 2010 on the Renaming of the Ministry of Culture and Information and the Establishment of the Information Affairs Authority|url=http://www.legalaffairs.gov.bh/viewhtm.aspx?ID=D3110|work=Official Gazette of the Kingdom of Bahrain|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Information Affairs Authority is appointed directly by the [[King of Bahrain]] and has the rank of a [[minister (government)|minister]] in the Bahrain government.&lt;ref name=GDN/&gt;&lt;ref name=decree2&gt;{{cite news|title=Decree No 33 of the Year 2010 on the Appointment of the President of the Information Affairs Authority|url=http://www.legalaffairs.gov.bh/viewhtm.aspx?ID=D3310|work=Official Gazette of the Kingdom of Bahrain|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first president of the Information Affairs Authority was [[Fawaz bin Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa]],&lt;ref name=GDN/&gt;&lt;ref name=decree2/&gt; who is a member of the [[Al Khalifa]] ruling family and a cousin of [[King Hamad]] and the current [[Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa|prime minister of Bahrain]]. Fawaz's father, Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, served as [[Ministry of Interior (Bahrain)|Bahrain's interior minister]] from 1973 until 2004.&lt;ref name="royalark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Buyers|first=Christopher|title=Genealogy of Bahrain's Al Khalifa dynasty|url=http://www.royalark.net/Bahrain/bahrain9.htm|work=Royal Ark|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fawaz's grandfather, Khalifa bin Hamad al Khalifa, served as the director general of Bahrain's Police and Public Security Department from 1937 until 1961.&lt;ref name="royalark"/&gt; Fawaz's great-grandfather [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa (1872–1942)|Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] was the [[ruler of Bahrain]] from 1932 until 1942.&lt;ref name="royalark"/&gt; Prior to being appointed as president of the IAA, Fawaz served as the president of General Organisation for Youth and Sports.

Prior to the creation of the IAA in 2010, the information ministry was handled by Shaikha Mai bint Mohammed Al Khalifa under the Ministry of Culture and Information.

In April 2012, the King appointed Sameera Rajab, an outspoken supporter of [[Saddam Hussein]], and cousin of Human Rights Defender [[Nabeel Rajab]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mekhennet|first1=Souad|title=Lifting the Veil With Souad Mekhennet: Bahrain’s Iron Lady|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/08/19/bahrain-s-sameera-rajab-talks-protests-and-arab-spring-fatigue.html|accessdate=12 June 2014|agency=thedailybeast.|date=Aug 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the country's [[Minister of State]] for Information Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Dan|title=After Formula One scrutiny, Bahrain hires a fan of Saddam Hussein to improve its image|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Backchannels/2012/0425/After-Formula-One-scrutiny-Bahrain-hires-a-fan-of-Saddam-Hussein-to-improve-its-image|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Frederic Wehrey|Wehrey]]|first=Frederic|title=The March of Bahrain’s Hardliners|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/05/31/march-of-bahrain-s-hardliners/b0zr|work=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]]|date=31 May 2012|quote=In late April, it appointed Samira Rajab, a polarizing figure who has praised Saddam Hussein and whose anti-Shia statements have aroused the ire of the opposition, as information minister.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responsibilities of the Authority include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain establishes new information authority|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/237470.html|work=[[AMEinfo.com]]|date=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* controlling the [[Bahrain News Agency]] and the [[Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation]]
* regulating press and publications in the country
* acting as the official spokesperson for the government of Bahrain

==2011 Uprising==
In 2011, the Information Affairs Authority came under criticism for its handling of the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahraini uprising]]. According to the report issued in November 2011 by the [[Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]]:
{{quote|text=Having reviewed a selection of material from national television, radio and print media relating to the events of February/March 2011, the Commission notes that much of this material contained derogatory language and inflammatory coverage of events, and some may have been defamatory. However, the Commission did not find evidence of media coverage that constituted hate speech. The Commission also identified numerous examples of defamation, harassment and, in some cases, incitement through social media websites. Both pro- and anti-government journalists were targeted through social media. The Commission notes that six of the seven daily newspapers are pro-government and the broadcasting service is state- controlled. There is also sufficient evidence to suggest that the [Government of Bahrain] exercised censorship over local media outlets. The lack of adequate access to mainstream media creates frustration within opposition groups and results in these groups resorting to other media outlets such as social media. This can have a destabilising effect because social media outlets are both untraceable and unaccountable, even in extreme cases where they promulgate hate speech and incitement to violence.&lt;ref name="bici"&gt;{{cite report|title=Report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry|publisher=Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry|url=http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf |date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=410}}}}

The IAA was also criticized by [[Index on Censorship]] for its attempts to justify media censorship in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain’s Information Affairs Authority responds to Index|url=https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2012/01/bahrains-information-affairs-authority-censorshi/|work=[[Index on Censorship]]|date=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Maysoon Sabkar
* Luma Bashmi
* Fahad AlBinAli

==Materials susceptible to ion track recording==
The class of ion track recording materials is characterized by the following properties:&lt;ref name="Fleischer1975"/&gt;

*'''High [[homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneity]]''': Local density variations of the pristine material must be small in comparison to the density deficit of the ion track core. Optically [[transparency and translucency|translucent materials]], such as [[polycarbonate]] and [[polyvinylidene fluoride]], have this property. Grained polymers such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] do not have this property.
*'''High [[electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]]''': Non-conducting [[dielectric]] minerals, glasses, and polymers have this property, while highly conducting metals and alloys do not have this property. In metals, the [[thermal diffusivity]] is coupled with the [[electrical resistance and conductance|electrical conductivity]], suppressing the formation of a thermal spike.
*'''High [[radiation sensitivity]]''': Polymers have high radiation sensitivity as compared to glasses and ionic crystals. The radiation effect in polymers is caused by the secondary electron cascade, inducing both chain scission (dominating in the track core) and cross-linking (dominating in the track halo).
*'''Low [[atomic diffusion|atomic mobility]]''': For selective ion track etching, the density contrast between the latent ion track and the pristine material must be high. The contrast fades due to [[diffusion]], depending on the [[atomic diffusion|atomic mobility]]. Ion tracks can be annealed. Erasing is faster in [[glass]]es compared to [[ionic crystals]].

==Irradiation apparatus and methods==
Several types of [[swift heavy ion]] generators and irradiation schemes are currently used:&lt;br /&gt;

==Formation of ion tracks==
When a [[swift heavy ion]] penetrates through a solid, it leaves behind a trace of irregular and modified material confined to a cylinder of few nanometers in diameter. The energy transfer between the heavy ''projectile'' ion and the light target electrons occurs in [[binary collision approximation|binary collisions]]. The knocked-off ''primary'' electrons leave a charged region behind, inducing a ''secondary'' electron collision cascade involving an increasing number of electrons of decreasing energy. This electron collision cascade stops when ionization is no longer possible. The remaining energy leads to atomic excitation and vibration, producing ([[heat]]). Due to the large [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]], the energy of the ''projectile'' decreases gradually and the ''projectile path'' is straight.&lt;ref&gt;For iron, the mass ratio M&lt;sub&gt;Fe&lt;/sub&gt;/m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;~ 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A small fraction of the transferred energy remains as an ion track in the solid. The diameter of the ion track increases with increasing [[radiation sensitivity]] of the material. Several models are used to describe ion track formation.

==Etching methods==

===Selective ion etching===

''Selective ion track etching''&lt;ref name="Fleischer1975" /&gt; is closely related to the selective etching of [[grain boundaries]] and crystal [[dislocation]]s. The etch process must be sufficiently slow to discriminate between the irradiated and the pristine material. The resulting shape depends on the type of material, the concentration of the etchant, and the temperature of the etch bath. In crystals and glasses, selective etching is due to the reduced density of the ion track. In polymers, selective etching is due to polymer fragmentation in the ion track core. The core zone is surrounded by a track halo in which cross-linking can impede track etching. After removal of the cross-linked track halo, the track radius grows linear in time. The result of selective etching is a trough, pore, or channel.

===Surfactant enhanced etching===
''Surfactant enhanced etching'' is used to modify ion track shapes.&lt;ref&gt;

'''[[Metal]] [[replica (disambiguation)|replica]]s''' can be obtained either by [[electroplating|electroless deposition]] or by [[plating|electro-deposition]]. For replication of through-pores, a cathode film is deposited on one side of the membrane, and the membrane is immersed in a metal salt solution. The cathode film is negatively charged with respect to the anode, which is placed on the opposite side of the membrane. The positive metal ions are pulled toward the cathode, where they catch electrons and precipitate as a compact metal film. During electro-deposition, the channels fill gradually with metal, and the lengths of the nano-wires are controlled by the deposition time. Rapid deposition leads to polycrystalline wires, while slow deposition leads to single crystalline wires. A free-standing replica is obtained by removing the template after deposition of a bearing film on the anode side of the membrane.

'''Interpenetrating wire networks''' are fabricated by electro-deposition in multi-angle, track-etched membranes. Free-standing three-dimensional networks with tunable complexity and interwire connectivity are obtained.&lt;ref&gt;

==Applications==

'''[[microtechnology]]''': the common mechanical [[tool]]s of the macroworld are being supplemented and complemented, and in some applications replaced by, [[particle beam]]s. Here, beams of [[photon]]s and [[electrons]] modify the [[solubility]] of [[radiation sensitivity|radiation-sensitive]] [[polymer]]s, so-called "[[resist]]s", while masking protects a selected area from exposure to [[irradiation|radiation]], [[etching|chemical attack]], and [[sputtering|erosion by atomic impact]]. Typical products produced in this way are [[integrated circuit]]s and [[microelectromechanical systems|microsystems]]. At present, the field of [[microtechnology]] is expanding toward [[nanotechnology]]. A recent branch of [[microfabrication]] is based on manipulation of individual [[ion]]s.

'''Geology:''' ion tracks are useful as they can remain unaltered for millions of years In minerals. Their density yields information about the time when the mineral solidified from its melt, and are used as geological clocks in [[fission track dating]]

'''Filters''': Homoporous [[filtration|filters]] were among the first applications&lt;ref name="Fleischer1963" /&gt; of ion track technology, and are now fabricated by several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsconsult.de/07_Links/_Links.php |title=Ion track companies |publisher=Physicsconsult.de |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Classifying micro- and nanoparticles''': The resistance of a channel filled by an [[electrolyte]] depends on the volume of the particle passing through it.&lt;ref name="DeBlois1970" /&gt; This technique is applied to the counting and sizing of individual red blood cells, bacteria, and virus particles.

'''[[pH]] Sensor''': Charged channels filled with an [[electrolyte]] have a [[surface conductivity]], in addition to the regular [[conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]], of the electrolyte. Ions attached to a charged surface attract a cloud of mobile [[counterion]]s. Fixed and mobile ions form a [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. For small channels, [[surface conductivity]] is responsible for most of the charge transport. For small channels, surface conductivity exceeds [[conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]]. Negative surface charges can be occupied by firmly bound protons. At low [[pH]] (high proton concentration), the wall charge is completely neutralized. Surface conductivity vanishes. Due to the dependence of surface conductivity on pH, the channel becomes a pH sensor.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Current rectifying pores''': Asymmetric pores are obtained by one-sided etching. The geometric asymmetry translates into a conduction asymmetry. The phenomenon is similar to an electrical valve.

'''Bio-sensor''': Chemical modification of the channel wall changes its interaction with passing particles. Different wall claddings bind to specific molecules and delay their passage. In this sense, the wall ''recognizes'' the passing particle. As an example, DNA fragments are selectively bound by their complementary fragments. The attached molecules reduce the channel volume. The induced resistance change reflects the molecule's concentration.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Magnetic multilayers''': Nano-wires consisting of alternating magnetic/nonmagnetic layers act as magnetic sensors. As an example, cobalt/copper nanowires are obtained from an [[electrolyte]] containing both metals. At low voltage, pure copper is deposited while cobalt resists electro-deposition. At high voltage, both metals are deposited as an alloy. If the [[electrolyte]] contains predominantly cobalt, a magnetic cobalt-copper alloy is deposited with a high fraction of cobalt. The electrical conductivity of the multilayer wire depends on the applied external magnetic field. The magnetic order of the cobalt layers increases with the applied field. Without magnetic field, neighboring magnetic layers prefer the anti-parallel order. With magnetic field, the magnetic layers prefer the orientation parallel with the magnetic field. The parallel orientation corresponds to a reduced electrical resistance. The effect is used in reading heads of magnetic storage media (the "GMR effect").&lt;ref&gt;

'''Spintronics''': Spin valve structure consists of two magnetic layers of different thicknesses. The thick layer has a higher magnetic stability and is used as polarizer. The thin layer acts as analyzer. Depending on its magnetization direction with respect to the polarizer (parallel or antiparallel), its conductivity is low or high, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

'''James Bryant Conant''' (March 26, 1893&amp;nbsp;– February 11, 1978) was an American [[chemist]], a transformative [[President of Harvard University|President]] of [[Harvard University]], and the first [[United States Ambassador to West Germany|U.S. Ambassador to West Germany]]. Conant obtained a PhD in Chemistry from Harvard in 1916. During World War I he served in the  U.S. Army, working on the development of [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gases]]. He became an assistant professor of chemistry at Harvard in 1919, and the Sheldon Emery Professor of Organic Chemistry in 1929. He researched the physical structures of [[natural product]]s, particularly [[chlorophyll]], and he was one of the first to explore the sometimes complex relationship between [[chemical equilibrium]] and the [[reaction rate]] of chemical processes. He studied the [[biochemistry]] of [[oxyhemoglobin]] providing insight into the disease [[methemoglobinemia]], helped to explain the structure of [[chlorophyll]], and contributed important insights that underlie modern theories of [[acid-base chemistry]].

In 1933, Conant became the President of Harvard University with a reformist agenda that involved dispensing with a number of customs, including class rankings and the requirement for Latin classes. He abolished [[athletic scholarships]], and instituted an "[[up or out]]" policy, under which scholars who were not promoted were terminated. His egalitarian vision of education required a diversified student body, and he promoted the adoption of the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test|Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)]] and co-educational classes. During his presidency, women were admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Harvard Law School]] for the first time.

Conant was appointed to the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) in 1940, becoming its chairman in 1941. In this capacity, he oversaw vital wartime research projects, including the development of synthetic rubber, and the [[Manhattan Project]], which developed the first [[atomic bomb]]s.  On July 16, 1945, he was among the dignitaries present at the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] for the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]], the first detonation of an atomic bomb, and was part of the [[Interim Committee]] that advised President [[Harry S. Truman]] to use atomic bombs on Japan. After the war, he served on the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) that was established to coordinate burgeoning defense research, and on the influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC); in the latter capacity he advised the president against starting a development program for the "[[hydrogen bomb]]".

In his later years at Harvard, Conant taught undergraduate courses on the  [[history and philosophy of science]], and wrote books explaining the [[scientific method]] to laymen. In 1953 he retired as President of Harvard and became the [[Allied High Commission|United States High Commissioner]] for Germany, overseeing the restoration of German sovereignty after World War II, and then was Ambassador to West Germany until 1957. On returning to the United States, he criticized the education system in works such as ''The American High School Today'' (1959), ''Slums and Suburbs'' (1961) and ''The Education of American Teachers'' (1963). Between 1965 and 1969, Conant, suffering from a heart condition, worked on his autobiography, ''My Several Lives'' (1970). He became increasingly infirm, suffered a series of [[stroke]]s in 1977, and died in a nursing home the following year.

== Early life ==
James Bryant Conant was born in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]], on March 26, 1893, the third child and only son of James Scott Conant, a [[photoengraver]], and his wife Jennett Orr née Bryant.{{sfn|Bartlett|1983|pp=91–92}} Conant was one of 35 boys who passed the competitive admission exam for the [[Roxbury Latin School]] in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]] in 1904. He graduated near the top of his class in 1910.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=17–18}} Encouraged by his science teacher, Newton H. Black, in September of that year he entered [[Harvard College]],{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=20}} where he studied [[physical chemistry]] under [[Theodore W. Richards]] and  [[organic chemistry]] under [[Elmer P. Kohler]]. He was also an editor of ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''. He joined the [[Signet Society]] and [[Delta Upsilon]],{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=27–31}} and was initiated as a brother of the Omicron Chapter of [[Alpha Chi Sigma]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="alpha chi sigma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alphachisigma.org/page.aspx?pid=268 |title=Fraternity – Awards – Hall of Fame – Alpha Chi Sigma |publisher= Alpha Chi Sigma Fraternity |accessdate=April 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in June 1913.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=27–31}} He then went to work on his doctorate, which was an unusual double dissertation. The first part, supervised by Richards, concerned "The Electrochemical Behavior of Liquid Sodium Amalgams"; the second, supervised by Kohler, was "A Study of Certain [[Cyclopropane]] Derivatives".{{sfn|Saltzman|2003|p=86}} Harvard awarded Conant his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halberstam |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J. Halberstam  |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=483890 |title=James Bryant Conant: The Right Man |newspaper= [[The Harvard Crimson]] |date=June 19, 1952 |accessdate=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Conant entered into a business partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, [[Stanley Pennock]] and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in [[Queens, New York]], where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like [[benzoic acid]] that were selling at high prices on account of the interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist [[Roger Adams]] created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, an explosion killed Pennock and two others and completely destroyed the plant. A contributing cause was Conant's faulty test procedures.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=38–39}}{{sfn|Conant|1970|pp=44–45}}

Following the [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|United States declaration of war on Germany]], Conant was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the  U.S. Army Sanitary Corps on September 22, 1917. He went to the [[Camp American University]], where he worked on the development of [[poison gas]]es. Initially, his work concentrated on [[mustard gas]], but in May 1918 Conant took charge of a unit concerned with the development of [[lewisite]]. He was promoted to [[major]] on July 20, 1918. A pilot plant was built, and then a full-scale production plant in [[Cleveland]], but the war ended before lewisite could be used in battle.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=44–48}}

Conant was appointed an assistant professor of chemistry at Harvard in 1919. The following year he became engaged to Richards's daughter, Grace (Patty) Thayer Richards. They were married in the [[Appleton Chapel]] at Harvard on April 17, 1920, and had two sons, James Richards Conant, born in May 1923, and Theodore Richards Conant, born in July 1928.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=50–53}}

== Chemistry professor ==
Conant became an associate professor in 1924.&lt;ref name="aip"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?conantj |title=Array of Contemporary American Physicists&amp;nbsp;– James Conant |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074634/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?conantj |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=55}} In 1925, he visited Germany, then the heart of chemical research,{{sfn|Conant|1970|p=30}} for eight months. He toured the major universities and laboratories there and met many of the leading chemists, including [[Theodor Curtius]], [[Kazimierz Fajans]], [[Hans Fischer]], [[Arthur Hantzsch]], [[Hans Meerwein]], [[Jakob Meisenheimer]], [[Hermann Staudinger]], [[Adolf Windaus]] and [[Karl Ziegler]]. After Conant returned to the United States, [[Arthur Amos Noyes]] made him an attractive offer to move to [[Caltech]]. The President of Harvard, [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], made a counter offer: immediate promotion to professor, effective September 1, 1927, with a salary of $7,000 (roughly equivalent to {{currency|{{Inflation|US|7000|1927}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}) and a grant of $9,000 per annum for research. Conant accepted and stayed at Harvard.{{sfn|Saltzman|2003|pp=89–90}} In 1929, he became the Sheldon Emery Professor of Organic Chemistry, and then, in 1931, the Chairman of the Chemistry Department.&lt;ref name="aip" /&gt;

Between 1928 and 1933, Conant published 55 papers.{{sfn|Saltzman|2003|pp=89–90}} Much of his research, like his double thesis, combined [[natural product]] chemistry with [[physical organic chemistry]]. Based on his exploration of [[reaction rate]]s in [[chemical equilibrium|chemical equilibria]], Conant was one of the first to recognise that the [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of these systems is sometimes straightforward and simple, yet quite complex in other cases.{{sfn|Bartlett|1983|pp=94–97}} Conant studied the effect of [[haloalkane]] structure on the rate of [[substitution reaction|substitution]] with inorganic [[iodide]] [[salt (chemistry)|salts]]&lt;ref&gt;Conant published a series of three papers on the reaction of inorganic iodide with organic halides:

Conant's investigations helped in the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of acids and bases.{{sfn|Kistiakowsky|Westheimer|1979|p=212}} He investigated the properties of certain [[acid]]s which were many times [[acid strength|stronger]] than [[mineral acid]] solutions in water. Conant christened them "[[superacid]]s"{{sfn|Hall|Conant|1927|p=3047}} and laid the foundation for the development of the [[Hammett acidity function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ja01346a015|year = 1932|last1 = Hammett|first1 = L.

Conant wrote a chemistry textbook with his former science teacher Black, entitled ''Practical Chemistry'', which was published in 1920, with a revised edition in 1929. This was superseded in 1937 by their ''New Practical Chemistry'', which in turn had a revised edition in 1946.{{sfn|Bartlett|1983|pp=121–124}} The text proved a popular one; it was adopted by 75 universities, and Conant received thousands of dollars in [[royalties]].{{sfn|Saltzman|2003|p=93}} For his accomplishments in chemistry, he was awarded the [[American Chemical Society]]'s Nichols Medal in 1932,{{sfn|Saltzman|2003|p=93}}  [[Columbia University]]'s Chandler Medal in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1932/1/22/nichols-chemistry-medal-given-conant-for/ |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |title=Nichols Chemistry Medal Given Conant for Research |date=January 22, 1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Chemical Society's highest honor, the [[Priestley Medal]], in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1944/9/12/president-conant-wins-priestley-medal-of/ |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |title=President Conant Wins Priestley Medal of ACS |date=September 12, 1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the society's [[Charles Lathrop Parsons Award]] in 1955, for public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles Lathrop Parsons Award|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/awards/national/bytopic/charles-lathrop-parsons-award.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1924,&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="aip" /&gt; Notable students of Conant's included [[Paul Doughty Bartlett]], George Wheland, and [[Frank Westheimer]].{{sfn|Saltzman|2003|pp=89–90}} In 1932 he was also honored by membership of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leopoldina.org/de/mitglieder/mitgliederverzeichnis/member/3157/ |title=Mitgliederverzeichnis |language=German |publisher= [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina]] |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some months of lobbying and discussion, Harvard's ruling body, the [[Harvard Corporation]], announced on May 8, 1933, that it had elected Conant as the next President of Harvard.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=70–75}} [[Alfred North Whitehead]], Harvard's eminent professor of philosophy disagreed with the decision, declaring, "The Corporation should not have elected a chemist to the Presidency." "But", Corporation member [[Grenville Clark]] reminded him, "[[Charles William Eliot|Eliot]] was a chemist, and our best president too." "I know", replied Whitehead "but Eliot was a ''bad'' chemist."{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=75}} }} Clark was very much responsible for Conant's election.{{sfn|Hill|2014|pp=85-86}}

== President of Harvard ==
On October 9, 1933, Conant became the [[President of Harvard University]] with a low-key installation ceremony in the Faculty Room of [[University Hall (Harvard University)|University Hall]].&lt;ref name="prez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvard.edu/history/presidents/conant |title=James Bryant Conant |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=April 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415033205/http://www.harvard.edu/history/presidents/conant |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the tone for Conant's presidency as one of informality and reform. At his inauguration he accepted the charter and seal presented to [[John Leverett the Younger]] in 1707, but dropped a number of other customs, including the singing of ''[[Gloria Patri]]'' and the Latin Oration. This was a sign of things to come.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=77}} While, unlike some other universities, Harvard did not require Greek or Latin for entrance, they were worth double credits towards admission, and students like Conant who had studied Latin were awarded an [[Artium Baccalaureus|A.B.]] degree while those who had not, received an [[Scientiæ Baccalaureus|S.B]]. One of his first efforts at reform was to attempt to abolish this distinction, which took over a decade to accomplish.{{sfn|Conant|1970|pp=419–420}} But in 1937 he wrote:{{quote|I do not see how one can make very much headway as a student&amp;nbsp;... of history and literature without a reading knowledge of Latin. I do not see how a person can go very far in any branch of science without a thorough understanding of mathematics, and if the underpinning was bad in school, probably the necessary [[calculus]] and so forth would not have been taken during the college years. I know that a man cannot be a research chemist without a reading knowledge of German. It is hard to acquire it as the first language in college.{{sfn|Conant|1970|p=189}}}}

Other reforms included the abolition of class rankings and [[athletic scholarships]],{{sfn|Bartlett|1983|p=98}} but his first, longest and most bitter battle was over [[tenure (academic)|tenure]] reform, shifting to an "[[up or out]]" policy, under which scholars who were not promoted were terminated. A small number of extra-departmental positions was set aside for outstanding scholars.{{sfn|Bartlett|1983|p=98}} This policy led junior faculty to revolt, and nearly resulted in Conant's dismissal in 1938.{{sfn|Bartlett|1983|pp=107–109}} Conant was fond of saying: "Behold the turtle. It makes progress only when it sticks its neck out."{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=89}}

Conant added new graduate degrees in education, history of science and public policy,{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=79}} and he introduced the [[Nieman Fellowship]] for journalists to study at Harvard,{{sfn|Conant|1970|pp=399–402}} the first of which was awarded in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/NiemanFoundation/NiemanFellowships/MeetTheFellows/AlumniFellows.aspx |title=Nieman Fellowships&amp;nbsp;– Alumni Fellows |publisher=Nieman Foundation |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the "meatballs", as [[Working class|lower class]] students were called.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=80}} He instituted the Harvard national scholarships for underprivileged students.&lt;ref name="prez" /&gt;  [[Dudley House (Harvard College)|Dudley House]] was opened as a place where non-resident students could stay.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=80}} Conant asked  two of his assistant deans, [[Henry Chauncey]] and William Bender, to determine whether the [[Scholastic Aptitude Test|Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)]] was a good measure of academic potential. When they reported that it was, Conant adopted it.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=81}} He waged a ten-year campaign for the consolidation of testing services, which resulted in the creation of the [[Educational Testing Service]] in 1946, with Chauncey as its director.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=707}}  [[Theodore H. White]], a Boston Jewish meatball who received a personal letter of introduction from Conant so that he could report on the [[Chinese Civil War]], noted that "Conant was the first president to recognize that meatballs were Harvard men too."{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=80}}

Instead of conducting separate but identical undergraduate courses for Harvard students and students from [[Radcliffe College]], Conant instituted co-educational classes.{{sfn|Bartlett|1983|p=98}} It was during his presidency that the first class of women were admitted to [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1945, and [[Harvard Law School]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwhp.org/titleix.pdf |title=Women's History Month 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012 |publisher=[[Department of Defense Education Activity]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowell, Conant's predecessor, had imposed a 15 percent quota on Jewish students in 1922, something Conant had voted to support.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=58–59}} This quota was later substituted with geographic distribution preferences, having the same effect of limiting Jewish admission.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=81–83}} In the words of historians Morton and Phyllis Keller, "Conant's pro-quota position in the early 1920s, his preference for more students from small towns and cities and the South and West, and his cool response to the plight of the Jewish academic refugees from Hitler suggest that he shared the mild antisemitism common to his social group and time. But his commitment to [[meritocracy]] made him more ready to accept able Jews as students and faculty."{{sfn|Keller|Keller|2001|p=49}}

In 1934, Harvard-educated German businessman [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]] attended the 25th anniversary reunion of his class of 1909, and gave a number of speeches, including the 1934 [[commencement address]].{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=80}} Hanfstaengl wrote out a check for 2,500 [[Reichsmark]]s (roughly equivalent to {{currency|{{Inflation|US|10500|1934}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) to Conant for a scholarship to enable an outstanding Harvard student to study for a year in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1934/6/8/corporation-will-decide-upon-fate-of/ |accessdate=April 30, 2012 |title=Corporation Will Decide Upon Fate of Hanfstaengl Donation |date=June 8, 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Conant|1970|p=142}}  The [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]] rejected the offer due to Hanfstaengl's Nazi associations.{{sfn|Conant|1970|p=144}} When the issue of Hanfstaengl's scholarship came up again in 1936, Conant turned the money down a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1936/2/13/hanfstaengl-pnaturally-harvard-should-support-president/ |accessdate=April 30, 2012 |title=Hanfstaengl  |date=February 13, 1936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanfstaengl's presence on campus prompted a series of anti-Nazi demonstrations, in which a number of Harvard and [[MIT]] students were arrested. Conant made a personal plea for clemency that resulted in two girls being acquitted, but six boys and a girl were sentenced to six months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1934/10/24/sentences-given-to-seven-in-the/ |accessdate=April 30, 2012 |title=Sentences Given to Seven in The Anti-Hanfstaengl Case |date=October 24, 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[University of Berlin]] awarded an [[honorary degree]] in 1934 to American legal scholar and Dean of Harvard Law School [[Roscoe Pound]], who had toured Germany earlier that year and made no secret of his admiration for the Nazi regime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1934/10/19/beard-fears-that-german-propagandists-seek/ |accessdate=December 24, 2012 |title=Beard Fears That German Propagandists Seek Support of Harvard And Other Universities  |date=October 19, 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conant refused to order Pound not to accept it, and attended the informal award ceremony at Harvard where Pound was presented with the degree by [[Hans Luther]], the German ambassador to the United States.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=87}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1934/9/20/dean-pound-gets-degree-pthe-honorary/ |accessdate=December 24, 2012 |title=Dean Pound Gets Degree  |date=September 20, 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Conant declined to participate in the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars,{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=84}} Harvard awarded honorary degrees to two notable displaced scholars, [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Albert Einstein]], in 1935.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=88}} What Conant feared most was disruption to Harvard's tercentennial celebrations in 1936, but there was no trouble, despite the presence of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[President of the United States]], and a Harvard graduate of the class of 1904, whom many Harvard graduates regarded as a [[socialist]] and a [[class traitor]].{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=90–91}} It was only with difficulty that Lowell was persuaded to be presiding officer at an event at which Roosevelt spoke.{{sfn|Conant|1970|p=153}}

An incident took place during the [[1941 Harvard–Navy lacrosse game]], when the [[Harvard Crimson men's lacrosse]] team attempted to field a player of [[African-Americans|African-American descent]]. The [[Navy Midshipmen men's lacrosse]] team's coach then refused to field his team. Harvard's athletic director, William J. Bingham, overruled his lacrosse coach, and had the player, Lucien Victor Alexis, Jr., sent back to Cambridge on a train. Conant subsequently apologized to the [[Commandant of Midshipmen]].  After serving in World War II, Alexis was refused admittance to Harvard Medical School on the grounds that, as the only black student, he would have no one to room with. Alexis graduated from Harvard Business School instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2008/11/17/081117ta_talk_angell |title=Bittersweet Victory |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |date=November 17, 2008 |first=Roger |last=Angell |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Defense Research Committee ==
In June 1940, with World War II already raging in Europe, [[Vannevar Bush]], the director of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], recruited Conant to the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC),{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=126}} although he remained president of Harvard.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=26}} Bush envisaged the NDRC as bringing scientists together to ""conduct research for the creation and improvement of instrumentalities, methods and materials of warfare."{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=8}} Although the United States had not yet entered the war, Conant was not alone in his conviction that [[Nazi Germany]] had to be stopped, and that the United States would inevitably become embroiled in the conflict. The immediate task, as Conant saw it, was therefore to organize American science for war.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=126}} He became head of the NDRC's Division B, the division responsible for bombs, fuels, gases and chemicals.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=10}} On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16137 |title=Executive Order 8807 Establishing the Office of Scientific Research and Development |date=June 28, 1941 |last=Roosevelt |first=Franklin |authorlink=Franklin D.

Conant succeeded Bush as Chairman of the NDRC, which was subsumed into the OSRD. [[Roger Adams]], a contemporary of Conant's at Harvard in the 1910s, succeeded him as head of Division B.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|pp=36–38}} Conant became the driving force of the NDRC on personnel and policy matters.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=68}} The NDRC would work hand in hand with the Army and Navy's research efforts, supplementing rather than supplanting them.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=8}} It was specifically charged with investigating [[nuclear fission]].{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=9}}

In February 1941, Roosevelt sent Conant to Britain as head of a mission that also included [[Frederick L. Hovde]] from [[Purdue University]] and [[Carroll L. Wilson]] from MIT, to evaluate the research being carried out there and the prospects for cooperation.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|pp=168–169}} The 1940 [[Tizard Mission]] had revealed that American technology was some years behind that of Britain in many fields, most notably [[radar]], and cooperation was eagerly sought. Conant had lunch with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Frederick Lindemann]], his leading scientific adviser, and an audience with [[King George VI]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. At a subsequent meeting, Lindemann told Conant about British progress towards developing an [[atomic bomb]]. What most impressed Conant was the British conviction that it was feasible.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=144–146}} That the British program was ahead of the American one raised the possibility in Conant's mind that the [[German nuclear energy project]] might be even further ahead, as Germany was generally acknowledged to be a world leader in nuclear physics.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=160–162}} Later that year, Churchill, as Chancellor of the [[University of Bristol]], conferred an honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree on Conant ''in absentia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/118-the-price-of-greatness |title=The Price of Greatness |accessdate=May 3, 2012 |publisher=[[The Churchill Centre]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510003323/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/118-the-price-of-greatness |archivedate=May 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52412370 |title=In Battle-Scarred Bristol |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]] |location=Launceston, Tasmania  |date=April 14, 1941 |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conant subsequently moved to restrict cooperation with Britain on nuclear energy, particularly its post-war aspects, and became involved in heated negotiations with [[Wallace Akers]], the representative of [[Tube Alloys]], the British atomic project.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=173–174}} Conant's tough stance, under which the British were excluded except where their assistance was vital, resulted in British retaliation, and a complete breakdown of cooperation.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=181–187}} His objections were swept aside by Roosevelt, who brokered the 1943 [[Quebec Agreement]] with Churchill, that restored full cooperation.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=190–191}} After the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]], Churchill visited Conant at Harvard, where Conant returned the 1941 gesture and presented Churchill with an  honorary Doctor of Laws degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Winston Churchill Stresses Importance of Post-War Anglo-American Cooperation |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1943/9/6/winston-churchill-stresses-importance-of-post-war/ |date=September 6, 1943 |accessdate=May 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the United States entered the war in December 1941, the OSRD handed the atomic bomb project, better known as the [[Manhattan Project]],&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/science/30manh.html |title=Why They Called It the Manhattan Project |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; over to the Army, with Brigadier General [[Leslie R.

A meeting that included Conant decided Groves should be answerable to a small committee called the Military Policy Committee, chaired by Bush, with Conant as his alternate. Thus, Conant remained involved in the administration of the Manhattan Project at its highest levels.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=78–83}}

In August 1942, Roosevelt appointed Conant to the Rubber Survey Committee. Chaired by [[Bernard M. Baruch]],  a trusted adviser and confidant of Roosevelt, the committee was tasked with reviewing the synthetic rubber program.&lt;ref name="acs-rubber"&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S. Synthetic Rubber Program | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/syntheticrubber.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations used [[patent law]]s to  restrict competition and stifle innovation.{{sfn|Kevles|1977|p=6}} When the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak]], followed by the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], cut off 90 percent of the supply of natural rubber,&lt;ref name="acs-rubber" /&gt;  the rubber shortage became a national scandal,{{sfn|Kevles|1977|p=8}} and the development of synthetic substitutes, an urgent priority.&lt;ref name="acs-rubber" /&gt; Baruch dealt with the difficult political issues;{{sfn|Conant|1970|pp=311–317}} Conant concerned himself with the technical ones. There were a number of different synthetic rubber products to choose from. In addition to [[DuPont]]'s [[neoprene]], [[Standard Oil of New Jersey|Standard Oil]] had licensed German patents for a [[copolymer]] called [[Buna-N]] and a related product, [[Buna-S]]. None had been manufactured on the scale now required, and there was pressure from agricultural interests to choose a process which involved making raw materials from farm products.{{sfn|Conant|1970|pp=319–320}} The Rubber Survey Committee made a series of recommendations, including the appointment of a rubber director, and the construction and operation of 51 factories to supply the materials needed for synthetic rubber production.&lt;ref name="acs-rubber" /&gt; Technical problems dogged the program through 1943, but by late 1944 plants were in operation with an annual capacity of over a million tons, most of which was Buna-S.{{sfn|Conant|1970|p=327}}

In May 1945, Conant became part of the [[Interim Committee]] that was formed to advise the new president, [[Harry S. Truman]] on nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=344–345}} The Interim Committee decided that the atomic bomb should be used against an industrial target in Japan as soon as possible and without warning.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=360–361}} On July 16, 1945, Conant was among the dignitaries present at the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] for the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]], the first detonation of an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=378}} After the war, Conant became concerned about growing criticism in the United States of the [[bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]  by figures like [[Norman Cousins]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]. He played an important behind-the-scenes role in shaping public opinion by instigating and then editing an influential February 1947 ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' article entitled "The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb". Written by former Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] with the help of [[McGeorge Bundy]],{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=294–299}} the article stressed that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were used to avoid the possibility of "over a million casualties",{{sfn|Stimson|1947|p=102}} from a figure found in the estimates given to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] by its Joint Planning Staff in 1945.{{sfn|Giangreco|1997|pp=536–537}}

== Cold War ==
The [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] replaced the wartime Manhattan Project with the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) on January 1, 1947. The Act also established the General Advisory Committee (GAC) within the AEC to provide it with scientific and technical advice. It was widely expected that Conant would chair the GAC, but the position went to [[Robert Oppenheimer]], the wartime director of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] that had designed and developed the first atomic bombs. At the same time, the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) was established to coordinate defense research, and Bush asked Conant to head its atomic energy subcommittee, on which Oppenheimer also served.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=305–309}} When the new AEC chairman [[David E. Lilienthal]] raised security concerns about Oppenheimer's relationships with [[communist]]s, including Oppenheimer's brother [[Frank Oppenheimer]], his wife Kitty and his former girlfriend [[Jean Tatlock]], Bush and Conant reassured Lilienthal that they had known about it when they had placed Oppenheimer in charge at Los Alamos in 1942. With such expressions of support, AEC issued Oppenheimer a [[Q clearance]], granting him access to atomic secrets.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=316–319}}

By September 1948, the [[Red Scare]] began to take hold, and Conant called for a ban on hiring teachers who were communists, although not for the dismissal of those who had already been hired. A debate ensued over whether communist educators could teach apolitical subjects.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=424}} Conant was a member of the Educational Policies Commission (EPC), a body to which he had been appointed in 1941.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=430}} When it next met in March 1949, Conant's push for a ban was supported by the president of Columbia University, [[General of the Army]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. The two found common ground in their belief in ideology-based education,{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=443}} which Conant called "democratic education". He did not see public education as a side effect of American democracy, but as one of its principal driving forces,{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=401–403}} and he disapproved of the public funding of [[denominational school]]s that he observed in Australia during his visit there in 1951.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=586, 592}} He called for increased federal spending on education, and higher taxes to redistribute wealth.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=401–403}} His thinking was outlined in his books ''Education in a Divided World'' in 1948,{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=366–367}} and ''Education and Liberty'' in 1951.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=587}} In 1952, he went further and endorsed the dismissal of academics who invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] under questioning by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=625}}

A sign of Conant's declining influence occurred in 1950, when he was passed over for the post of President of the National Academy of Sciences in favor of [[Detlev Bronk]], the President of [[Johns Hopkins University]], after a "revolt" by scientists unhappy with Conant.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=484–486}} The GAC was enormously influential throughout the late 1940s, but the opposition of Oppenheimer and Conant to the development of the [[hydrogen bomb]], only to be overridden by Truman in 1950, diminished its stature.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=482}} It was reduced further when Oppenheimer and Conant were not reappointed when their terms expired in 1952,  depriving the GAC of its two best-known members.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=518–519}} Conant was appointed to the National Science Board, which administered the new [[National Science Foundation]], and was elected its chairman, but this body had little financial or political clout.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=560}} In April 1951, Truman appointed Conant to the [[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology|Science Advisory Committee]], but it would not develop into an influential body until the Eisenhower administration.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=566–567}}

Conant's experience with the Manhattan Project convinced him that the public needed a better understanding of science, and he moved to revitalize the [[history and philosophy of science]] program at Harvard. He took the lead personally by teaching a new undergraduate course, Natural Science 4, "On Understanding Science". His course notes became the basis for a book of the same name, published in 1948.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=409–411}} In 1952, he began teaching another undergraduate course, Philosophy 150, "A Philosophy of Science".{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=587}} In his teachings and writing on the philosophy of science, he drew heavily on those of his Harvard colleague [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].{{sfn|Biddle|2011|p=552}} Conant contributed four chapters to the 1957 ''Harvard Case Histories in Experimental Science'', including an account of the overthrow of the [[phlogiston theory]].{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=409–411}} In 1951, he published ''Science and Common Sense'', in which he attempted to explain the ways of scientists to laymen.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=556–557}} Conant's ideas about scientific progress would come under attack by his own protégés, notably [[Thomas Kuhn]] in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. Conant commented on Kuhn's manuscript in draft form.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=409–411}}

== High Commissioner ==
[[File:Dr. James B Conant 1953 Berlin.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|Conant as  [[Allied High Commission|United States High Commissioner]] for Germany, 1953.|alt=A man poses at a desk. There is an American flag behind him. ]]
In April 1951 Conant had been approached by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Dean Acheson]], about replacing [[John J. McCloy]] as  [[Allied High Commission|United States High Commissioner]] for Germany, but had declined.  However, after Eisenhower was elected president in 1952, Conant was again offered the job by the new Secretary of State, [[John Foster Dulles]], and this time he accepted. At the [[Harvard Board of Overseers]] meeting on January 12, 1952, Conant announced that he would retire in September 1953 after twenty years at Harvard, having reached the pension age of sixty.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=638–646}}{{sfn|Conant|1970|pp=533–537}}

In Germany, there were major issues to be decided. Germany was still occupied by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, made up of the zones occupied by the three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=654–657}}

The first crisis to occur on Conant's watch was the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]. This brought the reunification issue to the fore. [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s deft handling of the issue enabled him to handily win re-election as  [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of West Germany]] in September, but this also strengthened his hand in negotiations with Conant. Adenauer did not want his country to become a bargaining chip between the United States and the Soviet Union, nor did he want it to become a nuclear battlefield, a prospect raised by the arrival of American tactical nuclear weapons in 1953 as part of the Eisenhower administration's [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]].{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=659–666}} Conant lobbied for the [[European Defense Community]], which would have established a [[pan-European military]]. This seemed to be the only way that German rearmament would be accepted, but opposition from France killed the plan. In what Conant considered a minor miracle, France's actions cleared the way for West Germany to become part of [[NATO]] with its own army.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=685}}

At noon on May 6, 1955, Conant, along with the high commissioners from Britain and France, signed the documents ending Allied control of West Germany, admitting it to NATO, and allowing it to rearm. The office of the United States High Commissioner was abolished and Conant became instead the first [[United States Ambassador to West Germany]].{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=687}} His role was now to encourage West Germany to build up its forces, while reassuring the Germans that doing so would not result in a United States withdrawal.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=693–694}} Being fluent in German, Conant was able to give speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.{{sfn|Kistiakowsky|Westheimer|1979|p=224}}

== Later life ==
Conant returned to the United States in February 1957, and moved to an apartment on the [[Upper East Side]] of New York.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=706–709}} Between 1957 and 1965, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] gave him over a million dollars to write studies of education.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=740}}  In 1959 he published ''The American High School Today''. This became a best seller, resulting in Conant's appearance on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] on September 14, 1959.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=714}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19590914,00.html |accessdate=December 22, 2014 |title=Time Magazine Cover: James Bryant Conant&amp;nbsp;– September 14, 1959 |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Conant called for a number of reforms, including the consolidation of high schools into larger bodies that could offer a broader range of curriculum choices. Although it was slammed by critics of the American system, who hoped for a system of education based on the European model, it did lead to a wave of reforms across the country.{{sfn|Kistiakowsky|Westheimer|1979|p=225}} His subsequent ''Slums and Suburbs'' in 1961 was far more controversial in its treatment of racial issues. Regarding [[Desegregation busing in the United States|busing]] as impractical, Conant urged Americans "to accept ''de facto'' segregated schools".{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=726}} This did not go over well with civil rights groups, and by 1964 Conant was forced to admit that he had been wrong.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=726}} In ''The Education of American Teachers'' in 1963, Conant found much to criticize about the training of teachers. Most controversial was his defense of the arrangement by which teachers were certified by independent bodies rather than the teacher training colleges.{{sfn|Kistiakowsky|Westheimer|1979|p=225}}

President [[Lyndon Johnson]] presented Conant with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], with special distinction, on December 6, 1963. He had been selected for the award by President [[John F. Kennedy]], but the ceremony had been delayed, and went ahead after Kennedy's assassination in November 1963.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=735–736}} In February 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]]  presented Conant with the Atomic Pioneers Award from the Atomic Energy Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nixon |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Nixon |title=Remarks on Presenting the Atomic Pioneers Award |date=February 27, 1970 |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |publisher=The American Presidency Project, [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2892 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201012426/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2892# |archive-date=February 1, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards that Conant received during his long career included being made a Commander of [[Légion d'honneur]] by France in 1936 and an Honorary [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by Britain in 1948, and he was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1957. He was also awarded over 50 honorary degrees,{{sfn|Bartlett|1983|pp=110–112}} and was posthumously inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame in 2000.&lt;ref name="alpha chi sigma" /&gt;

Between 1965 and 1969, Conant, suffering from a heart condition, worked on his biography, ''My Several Lives''.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|pp=741–742}} He became increasingly infirm, and suffered a series of [[stroke]]s in 1977.{{sfn|Hershberg|1993|p=754}} He died in a nursing home in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], on February 11, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=James B. Conant Is Dead at 84; Harvard President for 20 Years|work=[[The New York Times]] |date = February 12, 1978 | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was cremated and his ashes interred in the Thayer-Richards family plot at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]. He was survived by his wife and sons. His papers are in the Harvard University Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua08998 |accessdate=April 29, 2012 |title=Papers of James Bryant Conant, 1862–1987 : an inventory |publisher=Harvard University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128015339/http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua08998 |archive-date=January 28, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was a sealed brown Manila envelope that Conant had given the archives in 1951, with instructions that it was to be opened by the President of Harvard in the 21st century. Opened by Harvard's 28th president, [[Drew Faust]], in 2007, it contained a letter in which Conant expressed his hopes and fears for the future. "You will{{nbsp}}... be in charge of a more prosperous and significant institution than the one over which I have the honor to preside", he wrote. "That [Harvard] will maintain the traditions of academic freedom, of tolerance for heresy, I feel sure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Harvard University Library Letters |date=Fall 2007 – Winter 2008 |volume= 2 |issue= 5 |title=My Dear Sir: A Sealed Letter from the University Archives Reaches Drew Faust on the Occasion of Her Inauguration |url=http://hul.harvard.edu/publications/letters_fall07winter08.pdf |accessdate=May 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born '''Jessica Stanley Clarke''', she was brought up in [[Chew Magna]], [[Somerset]], and learned about the use of herbs from her grandmother, the writer Ruth Lowinsky,&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/a/OL2305792A/Ruth-Lowinsky  Books by Ruth Lowinsky]&lt;/ref&gt; and her mother.&lt;ref name=mostlyfood&gt;[http://www.mostlyfood.co.uk/Jekka%20McVicar.htm  Interview with Jekka McVicar at MostlyFood.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220083211/http://www.mostlyfood.co.uk/Jekka%20McVicar.htm |date=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 17, after leaving [[Cranborne Chase School]] in [[Wiltshire]], she joined the progressive rock band [[Marsupilami (band)|Marsupilami]] as a singer and [[flautist]]. The band released two albums, appeared at the [[Isle of Wight Festival]] and the first [[Glastonbury Festival]], and toured in Europe.&lt;ref name=jekkasherbfarm&gt;[http://www.jekkasherbfarm.com/about.asp Jekka's Herb Farm]&lt;/ref&gt;  

After working for a time at the drama department of the [[BBC]], she began working at a herb nursery in Somerset.  She married Ian "Mac" McVicar in 1976, and in 1987 they established a herb farm - now known as Jekka's Herb Farm - at [[Alveston]] near [[Bristol]].  They have the largest collection of culinary herbs in the UK, with more than 500 different varieties.&lt;ref name=jekkasherbfarm/&gt; She has been awarded 62 [[Royal Horticultural Society]] Gold Medals for her organic herb displays, including 14 at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]], and Best Floral Exhibit at [[Hampton Court]] in 2007 and 2008.  She was awarded the RHS Lawrence Medal (2009), for the best exhibit shown at any RHS show during that year.

She also regularly contributes to a number of national publications including ''BBC Gardener’s World Magazine'', ''BBC Good Food'', ''Gardens Illustrated'' and the ''Guardian'' newspaper, and has appeared on many television programmes, including ''Great British Garden Revival'' (December 2013) and ''Mary Berry Cooks'' (spring 2014).   Her first major cookbook, ''Jekka's Herb Cookbook'', was published by Ebury Press in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jekkasherbfarm.com/documents/JekkasHerbCookbook.pdf Jekka's Herb Cookbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

McVicar is a Vice President of the RHS Council, the governing body of the RHS responsible for its strategic direction, and sits on a number of RHS committees. She is also President of the Herb Society (2013-2014); President of the West of England Herb Group (2006-) and was a Member of RHS Council (2005-2016); the RHS Nominations, Appointments and Governance Committee (2009-2016); the RHS Fruit, Vegetable and Herb Committee (1998-), the RHS Horticultural Board (2010-); the joint Chairman of the RHS Three Counties Agricultural Society Joint Committee (2011-); and is a founder member of the RHS Herb advisory group (2011-); RHS Judge (1999-) and chaired the judging of the Great Pavilion at the Chelsea Flower Show (2012,2013,2018).  

McVicar was awarded the Garden Media Guild, Lifetime Achievement Award; ‘for services to horticulture, design, education and communication and excellence in the field of organic herb growing’ in December 2012.
She was awarded the VMH ([[Victoria Medal of Honour]]) for her services to [[horticulture]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/about-the-rhs/who-we-are/rhs-council/rhs-awards|title=RHS People Awards|publisher= RHS|accessdate= 17 July 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuali community consists of universities and colleges cooperating to build open-source, scalable, and service driven tools. Kuali and its community have worked together to build many different tools including Kuali Open Library Environment (OLE), the Kuali Financial System, Kuali Rice, Kuali Research, and Kuali Coeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=hcqUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Kuali&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF-tyT6JDaAhXFPY8KHbFaBkMQ6AEISzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Kuali&amp;f=false|title=Library Automation: Core Concepts and Practical Systems Analysis, 3rd Edition: Core Concepts and Practical Systems Analysis|last=Bilal|first=Dania|date=2014-03-26|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781591589235|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kc.mit.edu/about-kuali-coeus|title=About Kuali Coeus {{!}} MIT Kuali Coeus|website=kc.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.siue.edu/funding/external-funding/kuali-research.shtml|title=Kuali Research|website=www.siue.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Kuali community began in 2004.The organization was established to take on the “Kuali Project,” a project aimed at developing a community sourced financial system. The group was founded by the [[University of Hawaii]], [[Indiana University]], rSmart and The National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) with an initial grant of $ 2.5 million from [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] and funding by the founding members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=52hZKv6olzEC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=Kuali&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv5PrG5pDaAhUFuY8KHexOBdAQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Kuali&amp;f=false|title=International Comparisons of Information Communication Technologies: Advancing Applications: Advancing Applications|last=B|first=Tan, Felix|date=2011-12-31|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=9781613504819|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Kuali community organized a more formal non-profit organization, the Kuali Foundation. The new organization was created “for higher education, by higher education,” and its member dues-paying institutions rose to 74 by 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Open-Source-Software-for/146205|title=Open-Source Software for College Administrators Reaches ‘Tipping Point’ After 10 Years|date=2014-04-28|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the Kuali Foundation announced the launch of its for-profit commercial entity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academica.ca/top-ten/kuali-foundation-drops-non-profit-status|title=Kuali Foundation drops non-profit status {{!}} Academica Group - Research and Consulting for Higher Education|website=www.academica.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company’s existing software remained free and open-source and the Kuali Foundation would still exist, but the company would launch new services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mfeldstein.com/kuali-profit-change-indicator-bigger-issues/|title=Kuali For-Profit: Change is an indicator of bigger issues|date=2014-08-25|work=e-Literate|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Kuali raised $ 10 million from Owl Ventures. The funds secured will be used to hire more employees, build more features in the Kuali Student Curriculum Management System (KSCM), and create more modules in Kuali Research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/02/14/kuali-raises-10-million|title=Kuali Raises $10 Million {{!}} Inside Higher Ed|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mfeldstein.com/kuali-student-sunsetting-40-million-project-moving-kualico/|title=Kuali Student Sunsetting $40 million project, moving to KualiCo|date=2014-10-09|work=e-Literate|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and product developments ==

The company released the beta version of the service as an expense tracking and management service in July 2011.&lt;ref name="The Next Web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mashable 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LifeHacker"/&gt; It soft-launched at the [[TechCrunch]] Disrupt conference's startup alley in September 2011, and officially launched in October 2011.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Venture Beat"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/09/13/lemon-com-receipt-tracking/ | title=Tired of keeping track of receipts? Lemon.com can help | publisher=''[[VentureBeat]]'' | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=August 21, 2013 | author=Hardawar, Devindra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, the company announced it had reached one million users.&lt;ref name="GigaOM"/&gt;

Lemon received $8 million in a funding round led by Maveron in May 2012.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall Street 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2012/06/12/lemon-to-squeeze-more-juice-from-e-wallets/ | title=Lemon Aims to Squeeze More Juice from E-Wallets | publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' | date=June 12, 2012 | accessdate=August 21, 2013 | author=Kolodny, Lora}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other investors in the Series A round included [[Lightspeed Venture Partners]], [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]], CampVentures, and [[Social+Capital Partnership]].&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch 3"/&gt; The round followed Lemon's release of the Lemon Wallet app, a service designed to store credit, debit, health insurance, and ID card information using the same photo system the company utilized for expense management.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall Street 1"/&gt; The extended capabilities allowed users to backup everything in their wallet using Lemon's cloud-based, [[Personal identification number|PIN protected]] database.&lt;ref name="PC Mag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch 3"/&gt; The app's security features include a 256-bit encryption as well as the ability for the user to remote-wipe sensitive information if the mobile device is lost or stolen.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PC Mag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iMore"/&gt;

Beginning in September 2012, Lemon customers could access cards stored in their Lemon account through [[Apple, Inc.|Apple's]] Passbook service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paymentssource.com/news/square-lemon-add-support-for-apples-passbook-wallet-3012591-1.html | title=Square, Lemon Add Support for Apple's Passbook Wallet | publisher=''PaymentsSource'' | date=December 10, 2012 | accessdate=August 21, 2013 | author=Wolfe, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Lemon announced an upgraded expense reporting tool. The enhancement to the Lemon Wallet granted users the ability to have their receipts and e-receipts processed through lemon.com and saved as a [[Portable Document Format|PDF copy]] and a [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] or [[Microsoft Excel file format#File formats|XLS]] format copy to be compatible with other expense software. Lemon CEO Wences Casares has reported that as of May 2013, the digital wallet service is capturing and storing approximately 1,000 new cards every hour.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch 2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/30/lemons-mobile-wallet-gets-more-useful-with-new-expense-reporting-service-support-for-transactions-is-next/ | title=Lemon's Mobile Wallet Gets More Useful With New Expense Reporting Service; Support For Transactions Is Next | publisher=''[[TechCrunch]]'' | date=May 30, 2013 | accessdate=August 21, 2013 | author=Perez, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2013, it was announced that [[LifeLock, Inc.]], a provider of identity theft protection services, acquired Lemon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifelock.com/pr/2013/12/12/lifelock-acquires-mobile-wallet-innovator-lemon/ LifeLock | Press Room | Leading Identity Theft Protection Company LifeLock Acquires Mobile Wallet Innovator Lemon, Inc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2014, LifeLock, Inc. announced that it had temporarily disabled the mobile application due to a security flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lifelockunlocked.com/lifelock-news/an-important-update-about-lifelock-wallet/|title = An Important Update About LifeLock Wallet|date = May 16, 2014|accessdate = May 24, 2014|website = LifeLockUnlocked|publisher = LifeLock, Inc.|last = Davis|first = Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of all of the [[free-to-air]] channels that are currently available via [[satellite]] from [[SES S.A.|SES]] [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites ([[Astra 2E]]/[[Astra 2F|2F]]/[[Astra 2G|2G]]) located at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2]] [[Celestial coordinate system|°E]]. These are the same group of satellites used for the [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] [[Pay television|pay-TV]] platform and the [[Freesat]] free-to-air platform, therefore existing installations for these platforms would not require a realignment of the satellite dish or the purchase of any additional equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1035">The '''Lower Riser Package''' is a mechanical device to protect an oil well located underwater (subsea) and used during an oil well intervention. The LRP is essentially a mini [[Blow-out preventer|blow out preventer]] (BOP). The lower riser package consists of a connector to the subsea oil well, a series of safety valves and a connection point at the top for connection to the riser pipe. The riser pipe is essentially a mini [[Marine riser]] and has a maximum inside diameter of 7 inches. A marine riser has a maximum inside diameter of 19 inches.

The LRP is used within what is called a workover system. A workover system is basically a series of valves and high strength pipe connecting a floating [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] to the subsea [[Christmas tree (oil well)|Christmas tree]].

'''Mary Cunningham Boyce''' is the Dean of the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science]] at [[Columbia University]]. She is the Morris A. and Alma Schapiro Professor. She is the fifteenth dean of the school and the first female to hold the position. Her term began on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://engineering.columbia.edu/dean-mary-c-boyce Mary Boyce], MIT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.mit.edu/2013/boyce-appointed-columbia-engineering-dean-0326 Mary Boyce to lead Columbia University’s engineering school]," MIT News, March 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2013/03/27/welcoming-dean-boyce Welcoming Dean Boyce]," Columbia Spectator, March 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert McCaughey , "A Lever Long Enough: A History of Columbia's School of Engineering and Applied Science Since 1864," Columbia University Press, June 10, 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gsnbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA275&amp;lpg=PA275&amp;dq=%22Mary+Cunningham+Boyce%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Aq8CHmfzSu&amp;sig=OPa2b0xthekiPWB3lUAmuVB1krA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGlN-xnM7MAhXCbR4KHWRmDEg4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mary%20Cunningham%20Boyce%22&amp;f=false p. 275]&lt;/ref&gt;

As dean, Boyce leads the education and research mission of Columbia Engineering, which has more than 220 faculty, 1600 undergraduate students and 2600 graduate students. 

A strong advocate of interdisciplinary research and translation of innovation to impact, she has increased faculty in cross-cutting fields, and recently launched a new vision for the school, Columbia Engineering for Humanity. This vision reflects the over 150 year history of Columbia Engineering while also articulating the impact of engineering on the lives of people around the world - our impact on a sustainable, a healthy, a secure, a connected, and a creative humanity. 

Her own research focuses on materials and mechanics, particularly in the areas of multi-scale mechanics of polymers and soft composites, both those that are man-made and those formed naturally.  

==Background==

Boyce earned her B.S. degree in Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Tech and her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering at MIT. Prior to joining Columbia University, Boyce spent twenty-five years as a faculty member at [[MIT]]. During her last years at MIT, she was the Head of Department for Mechanical Engineering and the Ford Professor of Engineering.

Boyce's research interests include the multi-scale mechanics of polymers, soft composites and soft tissues. Her research has been in theory, computation and experimental elements of the nonlinear, finite deformation, elastic and inelastic, time-dependent behavior of polymeric-based materials. Her leadership in the field of the mechanics of materials has expanded the understanding of interplay between micro-geometry and the inherent physical behavior of a material, which has led to innovative hybrid material designs, as well as materials structures that transform or morph into a different structure. Models and results from Professor Boyce's group have the potential to influence a range of industrial and academic fields from polymer processing to composite material design, tire mechanics, biological cells and tissues. The author of more than 170 publications with her group, she is also the holder of five US patents. Boyce has mentored over 25 PhD students and numerous postdoctoral researchers. Her PhD students and postdoctoral researchers have bone onto faculty positions across the country and the world, as well as to national laboratories, industries and consulting careers. 

Boyce has been widely recognized for her scholarly achievements, including election as a fellow of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], the American Academy of Mechanics, the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nae.edu/56119.aspx Mary Boyce's Webpage at the National Academy of Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt; She also has been honored for her teaching at MIT, where she was named a MacVicar Faculty Fellow and received the Joseph Henry Keenan Innovation in Undergraduate Education Award.

Boyce earned her [[B.S.]] degree in Engineering Science and Mechanics from Virginia Tech and her [[Master of Science|S.M.]] and [[Ph.D.]] degrees in [[Mechanical Engineering]] from [[MIT]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">A '''nanoruler''' is a ruler of tiny proportions, made of a [[silicon]] [[crystal structure|crystal lattice structure]].  Since it can accurately measure fractions of [[nanometers]], it could help standardize the future [[nanotechnology]] industry.  Since the characteristics of silicon are well understood, the distance between one crystal lattice line to another is well known.  Therefore, counting these lines can reveal a fairly accurate measurement.

The ruler was developed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], and unveiled in 2005.

'''Nanoruler''' also is the name of a machine to produce large (greater than 300&amp;nbsp;mm x 300&amp;nbsp;mm) grating patterns with nanometer precision, based on the principle of Scanning Beam Interference Lithography.  Instead of the traditional technique to produce gratings through mechanical ruling, this approach rules gratings through the interference of light beams.  The Nanoruler was developed in the [[Space Nanotechnology Laboratory]] of the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

{{Missing information | non-PSA oxygen generators|date=October 2013}}

An '''oxygen concentrator''' is a [[machine|device]] that concentrates the [[oxygen]] from a gas supply (typically ambient air) by selectively removing nitrogen to supply an oxygen-enriched product gas stream.

Two methods in common use are [[pressure swing adsorption]] and [[membrane gas separation]].

== History == 
Home medical oxygen concentrators were invented in the early 1970s. Manufacturing output of these devices increased in the late 1970s. [[Union Carbide]] Corporation (UCC) and [[Bendix Corporation]] were both early manufacturers. Prior to that era, home medical oxygen therapy required the use of heavy high pressure oxygen cylinders or small cryogenic liquid oxygen systems. Both of these delivery systems required frequent home visits by suppliers to replenish oxygen supplies. In the United States Medicare switched from fee-for-service payment to a flat monthly rate for home oxygen therapy in the mid-1980s, causing the durable medical equipment (DME) industry to rapidly embrace concentrators as a way to control costs. This reimbursement change dramatically decreased the number of primary high pressure and liquid oxygen delivery systems in use in homes in the United States at that time. Oxygen concentrators became the preferred and most common means of delivering home oxygen. The number of manufacturers entering the oxygen concentrator market increased exponentially as a result of this change. [[Union Carbide]] Corporation (UCC) invented [[molecular sieve]] in the 1950s which made these devices possible. UCC also invented the first cryogenic liquid home medical oxygen systems in the 1960s.

== How oxygen concentrators work ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
{{further|Pressure swing adsorption}}
Oxygen concentrators typically use [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) technology and are used very widely for oxygen provision in healthcare applications, especially where liquid or pressurized oxygen is too dangerous or inconvenient, such as in homes or in portable clinics. For other purposes there are also concentrators based on [[Nitrogen separation membrane|membrane technology]].

An oxygen concentrator takes in air and removes nitrogen from it, leaving an oxygen enriched gas for use by people requiring medical oxygen due to low oxygen levels in their blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medequip.co.in/what-oxygen-concentrator-how-work-oxygen-concentrator/ What is an Oxygen Concentrator? How does it Work?]. medequip.co.in Retrieved on  5 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen concentrators are also used to provide an economical source of oxygen in industrial processes, where they are also known as oxygen gas generators or [[Oxygen plant|oxygen generation plants]].
Oxygen concentrators utilize a [[molecular sieve]] to adsorb gases and operate on the principle of [[Pressure swing adsorption#Rapid PSA|rapid pressure swing adsorption]] of atmospheric [[nitrogen]] onto [[zeolite]] minerals and then venting the nitrogen.  This type of adsorption system is therefore functionally a nitrogen scrubber leaving the other atmospheric gases to pass through.  This leaves oxygen as the primary gas remaining. PSA technology is a reliable and economical technique for small to mid-scale oxygen generation, with cryogenic separation more suitable at higher volumes and external delivery generally more suitable for small volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-471-18818-6 | title = Pressure Swing Adsorption | last1 = Ruthven | first1 = Douglas M. |author2=Shamsuzzman Farooq, Kent S. Knaebel | year = 1993 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | page = 6,304  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At high pressure, the porous zeolite [[adsorption|adsorbs]] large quantities of nitrogen, due to its large surface area and chemical character.  After the oxygen and other free components are collected the pressure drops which allows nitrogen to desorb.

An oxygen concentrator has an air compressor, two cylinders filled with zeolite pellets, a pressure equalizing reservoir, and some valves and tubes.  In the first half-cycle the first cylinder receives air from the compressor, which lasts about 3 seconds. During that time the pressure in the first cylinder rises from atmospheric to about 2.5 times normal atmospheric pressure (typically 20 psi/138 kPa gauge, or 2.36 atmospheres absolute) and the zeolite becomes saturated with nitrogen. As the first cylinder reaches near pure oxygen (there are small amounts of argon, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, water vapour, [[radon]] and other minor atmospheric components) in the first half-cycle, a valve opens and the oxygen-enriched gas flows to the pressure equalizing reservoir, which connects to the patient's oxygen hose. At the end of the first half of the cycle, there is another valve position change so that the air from the compressor is directed to the 2nd cylinder. The pressure in the first cylinder drops as the enriched oxygen moves into the reservoir, allowing the nitrogen to be desorbed back into gas. Partway through the second half of the cycle, there is another valve position change to vent the gas in the first cylinder back into the ambient atmosphere, keeping the concentration of oxygen in the pressure equalizing reservoir from falling below about 90%. The pressure in the hose delivering oxygen from the equalizing reservoir is kept steady by a pressure reducing valve.

Older units cycled with a period of about 20 seconds, and supplied up to 5 [[litre]]s per minute of 90+% oxygen. Since about 1999, units capable of supplying up to 10 lpm have been available.

They can be used in various industries including medical, pharmaceutical production, water treatment and glass manufacture.

PSA generators are particularly useful in remote or inaccessible parts of the world or mobile [[medical facilities]] ([[military hospital]]s, disaster facilities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co2crc.com.au/RESEARCH/research_c_2_4.html |title=CO2CRC Research – Storing CO2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928060025/http://www.co2crc.com.au/RESEARCH/research_c_2_4.html |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shrestha | first1 = B.

=== Portable oxygen concentrators ===
[[File:Home oxygen concentrator.jpg|thumb|right|A home oxygen concentrator in an [[emphysema]] patient's house. The model shown is the DeVILBISS LT 4000.]]
{{Main|Portable oxygen concentrator}}
Since the early 2000s, a number of companies have produced portable oxygen concentrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxygenconcentratorratings.com/the-rise-of-portable-concentrator-manufactures/ |title=The Rise of Portable Concentrator Manufacturers |publisher=Oxygen Concentrator Ratings|accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these devices produce the equivalent of one to five liters per minute of continuous oxygen flow and they use some version of pulse flow or "demand flow" to deliver oxygen only when the patient is inhaling. They can also provide pulses of oxygen either to provide higher intermittent flows or to reduce the power consumption.

Research into oxygen concentration is ongoing and modern techniques suggest that the amount of adsorbent required by a medical oxygen concentrators can be potentially "reduced by a factor of three while offering ∼10–20% higher oxygen recovery compared to a typical commercial unit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/aic.14518| title = Novel design and performance of a medical oxygen concentrator using a rapid pressure swing adsorption concept| journal = AIChE Journal| pages = 3330–3335| year = 2014| last1 = Rama Rao | first1 = V. | last2 = Kothare | first2 = M. V. | last3 = Sircar | first3 = S. | volume=60| issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These portable concentrators typically plug into an [[electrical outlet]] and may have an internal battery or external battery pack for operation away from home. Portable oxygen concentrators usually can be plugged into the [[direct current|DC]] outlet of a vehicle, and most of these devices are suitable for ambulatory use.

The [[(FAA) has approved the use of portable oxygen concentrators on commercial airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/cabin_safety/portable_oxygen/ |title=FAA Approved Portable Oxygen Concentrators |publisher=FAA |date= |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, users of these devices should check in advance as to whether a particular brand or model is permitted on a particular airline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inogenoxygen.com.au/the-list-of-portable-oxygen-loving-airlines/ |title=List of Airlines that allow portable oxygen machines |publisher=Inogen Oxygen |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in commercial airlines, users of aircraft without [[cabin pressurization]] need oxygen concentrators which are able to deliver enough flowrate even at high altitudes, such as OXYFLY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxyfly.com/oxyfly-286.html |title=Continuous Oxygen Supply for non-pressurized Aircraft |publisher=OXYFLY |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610013906/http://www.oxyfly.com/oxyfly-286.html |archivedate=2012-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, "demand" or pulse-flow oxygen concentrators are not used by patients while they sleep. There have been problems with the oxygen concentrators not being able to detect when the sleeping patient is inhaling.  Some larger portable oxygen concentrators are designed to operate in continuous-flow mode in addition to pulse-flow mode. Continuous-flow mode is considered safe for night use when coupled with a [[Continuous Positive Airway Pressure|CPAP]] machine.

Common models retail at around $600.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Leasing arrangements may be available through various medical-supply companies and/or insurance agencies.

=== Alternate applications ===
Repurposed medical oxygen concentrators or specialized industrial oxygen concentrators can be made to operate ''small'' [[oxyacetylene]] or other fuel gas cutting, welding and [[lampworking]] torches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pyronamix.com/page6.html | title = Testimonials | accessdate = 2013-09-18 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707113925/http://www.pyronamix.com/page6.html | archivedate = July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
In both clinical and emergency-care situations, oxygen concentrators have the advantage of not being as dangerous as [[gas cylinder|oxygen cylinders]], which can, if ruptured or leaking, greatly increase the combustion rate of a fire. As such, oxygen concentrators are particularly advantageous in [[military]] or [[disaster]] situations, where oxygen tanks may be dangerous or unfeasible.

Oxygen concentrators are considered sufficiently foolproof to be supplied to individual patients as a prescription item for use in their homes. Typically they are used as an adjunct to [[positive airway pressure|CPAP]] treatment of severe [[sleep apnea]]. There also are other medical uses for oxygen concentrators, including [[COPD]] and other respiratory diseases.

Used and refurbished units should be purchased through a reputable dealer. Temperamental units are worthless to the medical community since an individual's health frequently relies on the constant extended operation of the unit. However, such units are valuable to metal and glasswork hobbyists. Because oxygen is a "permanent gas" (cannot be liquefied at any pressure at room temperature), it is expensive to obtain in bottled form.

== Industrial oxygen concentrators ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
[[File:PSA OXYGEN GENERATOR R-OXY RIFAIR.JPG|thumb|Pressure swing adsorption medical oxygen generator "R-OXY" by RIFAIR Technical Systems]]
Industrial processes may use much higher pressures and flows than medical units. To meet that need, another process, called [[vacuum swing adsorption]] (VSA), has been developed by [[Air Products &amp; Chemicals|Air Products]]. This process uses a single low pressure blower and a valve that reverses the flow through the blower so that the regeneration phase occurs under a vacuum. Generators using this process are being marketed to the [[aquaculture]] industry. Industrial oxygen concentrators are often available in a much wider range of capacities than medical concentrators.

Industrial oxygen concentrators are sometimes referred to as oxygen ''generators'' within the oxygen and ozone industries to distinguish them from medical oxygen ''concentrators''. The distinction is used in an attempt to clarify that industrial oxygen concentrators are not [[medical device]]s approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and they are not suitable for use as bedside medical concentrators. However, applying the oxygen generator nomenclature can lead to confusion. The term, oxygen ''generator,'' is a misnomer in that the oxygen is not ''generated'' as it is with a [[chemical oxygen generator]], but rather it is concentrated from the air.

Non-medical oxygen concentrators can be used as a feed gas to a medical oxygen system, such as the oxygen system in a [[hospital]], though governmental approval is required, such as by the FDA, and additional filtering is generally required.

'''Physical plant''', '''mechanical plant''' or '''industrial plant''' (and where context is given, often just '''plant''') refers to the necessary [[infrastructure]] used in operation and maintenance of a given facility. The operation of these facilities, or the [[departmentalization|department]] of an organization which does so, is called "plant operations" or [[facility management]]. Industrial plant should not be confused with "manufacturing plant" in the [[word sense|sense]] of "a [[factory]]".

==HVAC==
[[HVAC]] plant usually includes [[air conditioning]] (both [[heating]] and [[refrigeration|cooling]] systems and [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]) and other mechanical systems. It often also includes the maintenance of other systems, such as [[plumbing]] and [[lighting]]. The facility itself may be an [[office building]], a [[school]] [[campus]], [[military base]], [[apartment complex]], or the like.

==Broadcast engineering==
In [[broadcast engineering]], the term '''transmitter plant''' is the part of the physical plant associated with the [[transmitter]] and its controls and inputs, the [[studio/transmitter link]] (if the [[radio studio]] is off-site),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/wmaq/early_wmaq/elmhurst_antenna_1928.html&lt;/ref&gt; the [[radio antenna]] and [[radome]]s, [[feedline]] and [[desiccation]]/[[nitrogen]] system, [[broadcast tower]] and [[quonset hut|building]], tower lighting, [[Electrical generator|generator]], and air conditioning.  These are often monitored by an [[automatic transmission system]], which reports conditions via [[telemetry]] ([[transmitter/studio link]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

'''Section Beams''' are made of [[steel]] and they have a specific lengths and shapes like [[i-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]], L, channel and I flanged beam.  These types of section are usually used in steel structures and it is common to connect them with plates of steel.

== Joints ==
There are three connection types:

* [[Rivet]]s
* [[Bolts (fastener)|Bolts]]
* [[Welding]]

Rivets are the strongest and most common type.&lt;ref name="AGS_wiley" &gt;AGS by Wiley structural systems : steel&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

The '''United States Army Signal Corps''' ('''USASC''') is a division of the [[Department of the Army]] that creates and manages [[communications]] and [[information systems]] for the [[command and control]] of [[combined arms]] forces. It was established in 1860, the brainchild{{vague|date=November 2018}} of [[Major (United States)#American Civil War|Major]] [[Albert J. Myer]], and had an important role{{what|date=November 2018}} in the [[American Civil War]]. Over its history, it had the initial responsibility for portfolios and new technologies that were eventually transferred to other U.S. government entities. Such responsibilities included [[Defense Intelligence Agency|military intelligence]], [[National Weather Service#History|weather forecasting]], and [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps|aviation]].{{Contradict-inline|date=November 2018}}

==Mission statement==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Support for the command and control of combined arms forces. Signal support includes network operations (information assurance, information dissemination management, and network management) and management of the electromagnetic spectrum. Signal support encompasses all aspects of designing, installing, data communications networks that employ single and multi-channel satellite, tropospheric scatter, terrestrial microwave, switching, messaging, video-teleconferencing, visual information, and other related systems. They integrate tactical, strategic and sustaining base communications, information processing and management systems into a seamless global information network that supports knowledge dominance for Army, joint and coalition operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signal.army.mil/index.php/signal-units/325-home-signal-units|title=Signal Units|publisher=US Army Signal School|accessdate=19 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604040141/http://signal.army.mil/index.php/signal-units/325-home-signal-units|archivedate=4 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
{{details|Signal Corps in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Civil War Signal Corps Kit.jpg|left|thumb|Standard Issue Civil War Signal Corps Kit, complete with flags and torches.]]
While serving as a medical officer in Texas in 1856, [[Albert James Myer]] proposed that the Army use his visual communications system, called [[Flag signals#Wig-wag flags|aerial telegraphy]] (or "wig-wag"). When the Army adopted his system on 21 June 1860, the Signal Corps was born with Myer as the first and only Signal Officer.&lt;ref name=birthday&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/branches.html |title=Army Birthdays |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174152/http://www.history.army.mil/books/cos/3-9.htm |archivedate=29 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wigwag.gif|right|thumb|Click photo to enlarge for history of the [[Flag signal|wigwag]].]]
Major Myer first used his visual signaling system on active service in [[New Mexico]] during the [[Navajo Wars|early 1860s Navajo expedition]]. Using flags for daytime signaling and a torch at night, wigwag was tested in [[American Civil War|Civil War]] combat in June 1861 to direct the fire of a harbor battery at [[Fort Wool]] against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] positions opposite [[Fort Monroe]]. For nearly three years, Myer was forced to rely on detailed personnel, although he envisioned a separate, trained professional military signal service.

Myer's vision came true on 3 March 1863, when Congress authorized a regular Signal Corps for the duration of the war. Some 2,900 officers and enlisted men served, although not at any single time, in the Civil War Signal Corps.

Myer's Civil War innovations included an unsuccessful balloon experiment at [[First Bull Run]], and, in response to McClellan's desire for a Signal Corps field telegraph train, an [[electric telegraph]] in the form of the Beardslee magnetoelectric telegraph machine. Even in the Civil War, the wigwag system, restricted to line-of-sight communications, was waning in the face of the electric telegraph.

Initially, Myer used his office downtown in Washington, D.C. to house the Signal Corps School. When it was found to need additional space, he sought out other locations. First came [[Fort Greble]], one of the [[Civil War Defenses of Washington|Defenses of Washington]] during the Civil War, and when that proved inadequate, Myer chose [[Fort Whipple, Virginia|Fort Whipple]], on Arlington Heights overlooking the national capital. The size and location were outstanding. The school remained there for over 20 years and ultimately was renamed [[Fort Myer]].
[[File:Signal Corps Automobile 1904.jpg|thumb|left|US Army Signal Corps automobile at the Manassas maneuvers in 1904]]
Signal Corps detachments participated in campaigns fighting Native Americans in the west, such as the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)|Powder River Expedition]] of 1865.

The electric telegraph, in addition to visual signaling, became a Signal Corps responsibility in 1867. Within 12 years, the corps had constructed, and was maintaining and operating, some 4,000 miles of telegraph lines along the country's western frontier.

In 1870, the Signal Corps established a congressionally mandated [[national weather service]]. Within a decade, with the assistance of Lieutenant [[Adolphus Greely]], Myer commanded a weather service of international acclaim. Myer died in 1880, having attained the rank of brigadier general and the title of Chief Signal Officer. The weather bureau became part of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in 1891, while the corps retained responsibility for military meteorology.

The Signal Corps' role in the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898 and the subsequent [[Philippine–American War|Philippine Insurrection]] was on a grander scale than it had been in the Civil War. In addition to visual signaling, including [[heliograph]], the corps supplied telephone and telegraph wire lines and cable communications, fostered the use of telephones in combat, employed [[War photography|combat photography]], and renewed the use of balloons. Shortly after the war, the Signal Corps constructed the [[Alaska Communications System (ACS)|Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS)]] also known as the Alaska Communications System (ACS), introducing the first wireless telegraph in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

==World War I==
''For more details on this topic, see [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]] and [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps]]''
[[File:Cpl-Ward-and-Pvt-Barrett.png|thumb|First military assigned to the Army Signal Corps' [[balloon (aircraft)|ballooning]] program]]
On 1 August 1907, an Aeronautical Division was established within the Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO). In 1908, on [[Fort Myer]], Virginia, the [[Wright brothers]] made test flights of the Army's first airplane built to Signal Corps' specifications. Reflecting the need for an official pilot rating, War Department Bulletin No. 2, released on 24 February 1911, established a "Military Aviator" rating. Army aviation remained within the Signal Corps until 1918, when it became the [[Army Air Service]].

During World War I. Chief Signal Officer [[George Owen Squier]] worked closely with private industry to perfect radio tubes while creating a major signal laboratory at Camp Alfred Vail ([[Fort Monmouth]]). Early radiotelephones developed by the Signal Corps were introduced into the European theater in 1918. While the new American voice radios were superior to the radiotelegraph sets, telephone and telegraph remained the major technology of World War I.

A pioneer in [[radar]], Colonel [[William R. Blair|William Blair]], director of the Signal Corps laboratories at Fort Monmouth, patented the first Army radar demonstrated in May 1937. Even before the United States entered World War II, mass production of two radar sets, the [[SCR-268]] and the [[SCR-270]], had begun. Along with the Signal Corps' tactical [[FM radio]], also developed in the 1930s, radar was the most important communications development of World War II.

During World War I, women switchboard operators, known as the "[[Hello Girls]]", were sworn into the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Despite the fact that they wore U.S. Army uniforms and were subject to Army regulations (Chief Operator Grace Banker received the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]]), they were not given [[Military discharge|honorable discharges]] but were considered "civilians" employed by the military, because Army regulations specified the male gender. Not until 1978—the 60th anniversary of the end of World War I—did [[United States Congress|Congress]] approve veteran status/honorable discharges for the remaining "Hello Girls".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gordon.army.mil/ocos/Museum/hlogrl.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625192921/http://www.gordon.army.mil/ocos/Museum/hlogrl.asp |date=25 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:SingalCorpsRoscheiderHof.webm|left|thumb|thumbtime=78|World War II signal corps [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]]]]

When the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] was reorganized on 9 March 1942, the Signal Corps became one of the technical services in the Services of
Supply (later [[Army Service Forces]]). Its organized components served both the [[Army Ground Forces]] and the [[Army Air Forces]].

The Army Chief Signal Officer (CSO) was responsible for establishing and maintaining communications service schools for officers and enlisted soldiers, ranging in qualifications from those holding doctorates to functional illiterates. The single pre-war Signal training site was [[Fort Monmouth]], New Jersey. To keep up with the demand for more signalleers, the CSO opened more training facilities: [[Camp Crowder]], Missouri; [[Camp Kohler]], California; and [[Camp Murphy Southern Signal Corps School|Camp Murphy]], Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, et al. U.S. Army in World War II: ''The Technical Services'', The Signal Corps: The Test (Office of the Chief of Military History Department of the Army, Washington, D.C. 1957) pp.186–217&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Signal Corps Training Center at Fort Monmouth consisted of an officers' school, an [[Officer Candidate School|officer candidate school]], an enlisted school and a [[Recruit training|basic training]] center at subpost Camp Wood. The officer candidate school operated from 1941 to 1946 and graduated 21,033 Signal Corps second lieutenants.

The term "[[Radar|RADAR]]" was coined by the Navy in 1940 and agreed to by the Army in 1941. The first Signal Corps Field Manual on Aircraft Warning Service defined RADAR as "a term used to designate radio sets SCR ([[Signal Corps Radio]])-268 and [[SCR-270]] and similar equipment". The [[SCR-268]] and 270 were not radios at all, but were designated as such to keep their actual function [[Classified information|secret]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Although important offensive applications have since been developed, radar emerged historically from the defensive need to counter the possibility of massive [[strategic bombing|aerial bombardment]].

In 1941, the laboratories at Fort Monmouth developed the [[SCR-300]], the first FM backpack radio. Its pioneering [[frequency modulation]] circuits provided front-line troops with reliable, static-free communications. The labs also fielded multichannel FM radio relay sets (e.g., AN/TRC-1) in the [[European Theater of Operations]] as early as 1943. Multichannel radio broadcasting allowed several channels of communications to be broadcast over a single radio signal, increasing security and range and relieving [[frequency spectrum]] crowding.

In December 1942, the War Department directed the Signal Corps General Development Laboratories and the [[Camp Evans]] Signal Lab to combine into the Signal Corps Ground Service (SCGS) with headquarters at [[Bradley Beach, New Jersey]] (Hotel Grossman). The Department also directed the Signal Corps Ground Service to cut total military and civilian personnel from 14,518 military and civilian personnel to 8,879 by August 1943. In June 1944, "Signees", former Italian [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], arrived at Fort Monmouth to perform housekeeping duties. A lieutenant colonel and 500 enlisted men became hospital, mess, and repair shop attendants, relieving American soldiers from these duties.

One of the more unusual units of the Signal Corps were the joint assault signals companies (JASCOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=United States Army In World War II-The Technical Services-The Signal Corps: The Outcome (Mid-1943 Through 1945) |last=Thompson |first=George Raynor |author2=Harris, Dixie R. |year=1991 |publisher=Center Of Military History, United States Army |page=231 |accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies were Signal Corps units that were made up of several hundred [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]], and [[United States Navy]] communications specialists specially trained to link land, sea and air operational elements. They saw combat throughout the Pacific and European&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|year=1944|title=Video: American Army Women Serving On All Fronts Etc.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; theaters during [[World War II]] in late 1943. JASCOs were much larger than normal signal companies. The joint assault signals companies were the predecessor to the [[Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company]] that exists today. JASCOs represented but one of many unprecedented Signal Corps' activities in the Pacific theater. Shipboard fighting was a new kind of combat for Signal Corps soldiers. Army communicators sometimes plied their trade aboard Navy and civilian ships. Signal Corps personnel also served on Army communications ships.

In particular the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA) formed a fleet, unofficially known as the "Catboat Flotilla" and formally as the CP fleet that served as command and communication vessels during amphibious operations, starting with two Australian schooners ''Harold'' and [[Booya (ship)|''Argosy Lemal'']] acquired by the Army and converted during the first half of 1943 by Australian firms into communications ships with AWA radio sets built by Amalgamated Wireless of Australia installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Masterson |first=Dr. James R. |year=1949 |pages=370, 570–571 |url=http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cdm/ref/collection/p4013coll11/id/903 |title=U.

[[File:Argosy Lemal.jpg|thumb|thumb|[[Booya (ship)|''Argosy Lemal'']] c. 1940, one of two Australian vessels acquired by the SWPA chief signal officer for the SWPA CP fleet.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The first task was to obtain ships more suitable than the ''Harold'' or the ''Argosy''. Such a ship was the freighterpassenger, FP-47, acquired by Signal Corps in March 1944, at Sydney. The Army had built her in the United States in 1942, a sturdy, wooden, diesel-driven vessel only 114 feet long, but broad, of 370 tons, intended for use in the Aleutians. Instead she had sailed to Australia as a tug. The Signal Corps fitted her with Australian transmitters and receivers, also with an SCR-300 walkietalkie, two SCR-808's, and an SCR-608, plus power equipment, antennas, and, finally, quarters for the Signal Corps operators. The Australian sets were intended for long-range CW signals operating in the high frequencies; the SCRs were short-range VHF FM radios for use in the fleet net and for ship-toshore channels. Armed with antiaircraft weapons and machine guns (served by 12 enlisted men of the Army ship and gun crews), navigated by a crew of 6 [[Army Transport Service]] officers and the 12 men already mentioned, the FP-47 was ready for service in June. Her Signal Corps complement consisted of one officer and 12 men.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The facilities of FP-47 were needed immediately at Hollandia to supplement the heavily loaded signal nets that could hardly carry the message burden imposed by the invasion and the subsequent build-up there of a great base. Arriving on 25 June, she anchored offshore and ran cables to the message centers on land. Her powerful transmitters opened new channels to SWPA headquarters in Brisbane and to the advance headquarters still at Port Moresby. At Hollandia, and at Biak, to which the FP-47 moved early in September, this one ship handled an average of 7,000 to 11,000 code groups a day.&lt;ref name=SC43-45 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many film industry personalities served in the Signal Corps, including [[Tony Randall]], the actor, and [[Jean Shepherd]], radio storyteller, author and narrator of ''A Christmas Story''.

In 1942 General [[George C. Marshall]] ordered the creation of the Army Pictorial Service (APS) to produce motion pictures for the training, indoctrination, and entertainment of the American forces and their [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The APS took over [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in 1942 and produced over 2,500 films during the war with over 1,000 redubbed in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordon.army.mil|title=Fort Gordon|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050605232527/http://www.gordon.army.mil/|archivedate=5 June 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Army left Astoria studios and film production in 1971.

[[Julius Rosenberg]] worked for the Signal Corps Labs from 1940 to 1945. He was dismissed early in 1945 when it was learned he had been a member of the [[History of Soviet espionage in the United States#Secret apparatus|Communist Party USA secret apparatus]], and had passed to the [[Soviet Union]] the secret of the [[proximity fuze]].

==Cold War==
[[File:Equipment at Repeater Station, Daegu 1950-08-01.jpg|right|thumb|SC345199 – Korean War Equipment at Repeater Station, [[Taegu, Korea]]. Quad cable terminal on left, testboard on right and center on 1 August 1950.]]

The Signal Corps' [[Project Diana]], in 1946, successfully bounced radar signals off the moon, paving the way for space communications.

In 1948 researchers at Fort Monmouth grew the first synthetically produced large [[quartz]] crystals. The crystals were able to be used in the manufacture of electronic components, and made the United States largely independent of foreign imports for this critical mineral. In 1949 the first auto-assembly of [[Printed circuit board|printed circuits]] was invented. A technique for assembling electronic parts on a printed circuit board, developed by Fort Monmouth engineers, pioneered the development and fabrication of miniature circuits for both military and civilian use. Although they did not invent the [[transistor]], Fort Monmouth scientists were among the first to recognize its importance, particularly in military applications, and did pioneer significant improvements in its composition and production.

Everything was to change as world tensions increased with the [[Cold War]] and the [[Berlin Airlift]]. To sustain the Army's worldwide commitments, it again became necessary to enlarge the capacity of every activity on-post.

In June 1950, with the onset of the [[Korean War]], President [[Harry S. Truman]] quickly received the necessary authorization to call the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and [[Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States|Organized Reserves]] to 21 months of active duty. He also signed a bill extending the [[Selective Service Act of 1948|Selective Service Act]] until 9 July 1951. The Officer Candidate School was reestablished.

The fighting in Korea brought to light the need for new techniques in the conduct of modern warfare. The use of mortars by the enemy, and the resultant need to quickly [[Counter-battery fire|locate and destroy]] the mortar sites resulted in development of the Mortar-Radar Locator AN/MPQ-3 and AN/MPQ-10 at the Communications Electronics Research and Development Engineering Center, better known as the [[Albert J. Myer]] Center, or simply, the Hexagon. Korea's terrain and road nets, along with the distance and speed with which communications were forced to travel, limited the use of wire. The Signal Corps' [[Very high frequency|VHF]] radio became the "backbone" of tactical communications throughout the war.

The development of new equipment, however, placed requirements on the Signal Corps to provide increased numbers of trained electronics personnel to work in the [[Fire-control system|fire control]] and [[guided missile]]s firing battery systems. To meet this need, Signal Corps Training Units—the 9614th and 9615th—were established at [[Aberdeen, Maryland#Aberdeen Proving Ground|Aberdeen]], Maryland and [[Redstone Arsenal]] in Alabama. These units provided instruction on electronics equipment used in the [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft artillery]] and guided missile firing systems.

Following the arrest of the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] in 1950, two former Fort Monmouth scientists, [[Joel Barr]] and [[Alfred Sarant]], defected to the Soviet Union. On 31 August 1953, having received word of possible [[Subversion (political)|subversive activities]] from Fort Monmouth's commanding general, Kirke B. Lawton, the Chairman of the [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] (PSI), [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Joseph McCarthy]], suspected a spy ring still existed in the Signal Corps labs. At first, McCarthy conducted his hearings behind closed doors, but opened them to the public on 24 November 1953. Extensive [[Congressional hearing]]s were continued in 1955 under the chairmanship of Senator [[John Little McClellan|John McClellan]] of Arkansas.

In the 1950s the Army Pictorial Service produced a series of television programs called ''[[The Big Picture (TV series)|The Big Picture]]'' that were often aired on American television. The last episode was produced in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ascendentimage.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012070522/http://ascendentimage.com/ |date=12 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 1958, with [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] assistance, the Signal Corps launched its first [[communications satellite]], [[Project SCORE]], demonstrating the feasibility of worldwide communications in delayed and real-time mode by means of relatively simple active satellite relays.

The Vietnam War's requirement for high-quality telephone and message circuits led to the Signal Corps' deployment of [[tropospheric scatter|tropospheric-scatter]] radio links that could provide many circuits between locations more than 200 miles apart. Other developments included the [[Syncom|SYNCOM]] satellite communications service, and a commercial fixed-station system known as the Integrated Wideband Communications System, the Southeast Asia link in the [[Defense Satellite Communications System|Defense Communications System]].

==Korean War and Vietnam War==
During the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]] the Signal Corps operated officer candidate schools initially at Fort Monmouth in 1950–1953, graduating 1,234 officers, and at [[Fort Gordon]] in 1965–1968, which produced 2,213 signal officers. (The World War II Signal OCS program at Fort Monmouth, from 1941–1946 graduated 21,033 Signal Corps Officers.)

Modern warfare utilizes three main sorts of signal soldiers. Some are assigned to specific military bases ("Base Ops"), and they are charged with installation, operation and maintenance of the base communications infrastructure along with hired civilian contracted companies. Others are members of non-signal Army units, providing communications capability for those with other jobs to accomplish (e.g. infantry, medical, armor, etc.) in much the same way as, say, the unit supply sections, unit clerks, or chemical specialists. The third major sort of signaleer is one assigned to a signal unit. That is to say, a unit whose only mission is to provide communications links between the Army units in their area of operations and other signal nodes in further areas served by other signal units.

Sending radio signals across the vast Pacific Ocean had always been unreliable. In August 1964, radio communications across the sea were given a huge boost in quality: The first satellite terminal ever installed in a combat zone was installed in Ba Queo, near [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]], led by Warrant Officer Jack Inman.&lt;ref&gt;Rienzi, Thomas. ''Vietnam Studies. Communications-Electronics 1962–1970'', Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., 1972. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  This enabled trustworthy communications to Hawaii, and thereby to Washington, D.C.

From north to south, communicating across the varied landscapes of Vietnam presented a variety of challenges, from mountains to jungle. The answer came by utilizing the technology of "troposcatter". A radio signal beamed up into the atmosphere is "bounced" back down to Earth with astonishingly good results, bypassing debilitating terrain. The Army had little experience with this technology, so they contracted the development of the systems to Page Engineering. In January 1962, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] approved the system of troposcatter units under the operational name of BACKPORCH.&lt;ref&gt;Rienzi. p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

The escalation of the number of troops in the Vietnam War caused an increasing need for more communications infrastructure. In the spring of 1966 the assorted Signal units were reassigned to the newly formed [[1st Signal Brigade (United States)|1st Signal Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;Raines, Rebecca Robbins, ''Getting the Message Through: A Branch History of the U.S. Army Signal Corps'', Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C. 1999. p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;  By the close of 1968 this brigade consisted of six signal groups, and 22 signal battalions—roughly 23,000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Rienzi. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Vietnam War Casualties|Vietnam War death]] on the battlefield was a Signal Corps radio operator, SP4 James Thomas Davis of the 3rd Radio Research Unit of the [[United States Army Security Agency]].

==Post Vietnam and Gulf War==
A major program in 1988 was the initial production and deployment phase of the mobile-subscriber equipment system (MSE). The MSE system called for setting up the equivalent of a [[Mobile phone|mobile telephone]] network on a battlefield, allowing a commander or [[Tactical Operations Center]] (TOC) to connect mobile telephones and fax machines in vehicles with each other, sending and receiving secure information. Talking through signal nodes, MSE established a seamless connection from the battlefield even back to commercial telephone lines. Significant to the Signal soldiers, MSE was fielded on the backs of [[Humvee]], rather than on the larger, less-mobile [[M35 2-1/2 ton cargo truck]]s—the "deuce and a half".&lt;ref&gt;Raines. pp. 394–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, most Army units had replaced their older [[AN/VRC-12|VRC-12]] series FM radios for the new [[SINCGARS]] ("SINgle-Channel Ground-Air Radio Systems") family of equipment. Rather than sending a signal along one signal frequency, the SINCGARS radios sent its signals across many frequencies, [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum|"hopping"]] from one frequency to another at high speed. This allowed many nets to share an already-crowded frequency spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) Newsletter No. 92-1, ''Operations Desert Shield – Desert Storm'', Jan. 1992. P. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of these radios combined the [[communications security]] (COMSEC) encryption devices with the receiver/transmitter, making a single easier-to-program unit. Most significant, the SINCGARS radios could send and receive digital traffic with great fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Raines. pp. 396–7.&lt;/ref&gt; By the advent of [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Shield]], all Army units were deployed using the most secure FM communications in the world. The SINCGARS radios have a failure rate in extreme heat of once every 7,000 hours compared to the VRC-12 series' failure rate of 2–300 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Raines. p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global War on Terror==
Since 11 September 2001, the Signal Corps has been supporting the [[Global War on Terror]] in both [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. The Signal Corps is currently fielding the [[Warfighter Information Network-Tactical|Warfighter Information Network]] – Tactical (WIN-T). It will eventually provide "On-The-Move" down to the company level for maneuver, fires and aviation brigades, and will fully support the [[Future Combat Systems]] (FCS) program; and also provide protected satellite communications "On-The-Move" capability against jamming, detection and intercept and will be aligned with the Telecommunications Satellite (TSAT) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://win-t.army.mil/wint/menu.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209082825/https://win-t.army.mil/wint/menu.cfm |archivedate=9 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Symbolism:
# Orange and white are the colors traditionally associated with the Signal Corps.
# The signal flag suspended from a baton is adopted from a badge that originated in 1865 and was called the Order of the Signal Corps.
# The bronze battle star represents formal recognition for participation in combat. It adorned a signal flag and was first awarded to Signal Corps soldiers in 1862.

===Branch insignia===
* The Signal Corps branch insignia is represented by two signal flags crossed, dexter flag white with a red center, the sinister flag red with a white center, staffs gold, with a flaming torch of gold color metal upright at center of crossed flags.
# "Crossed flags" have been used by the Signal Corps since 1868, when they were prescribed for wear on the uniform coat by enlisted men of the Signal Corps.
# In 1884, a burning torch was added to the insignia and the present design adopted on 1 July 1884.
# The flags and torch are symbolic of signaling or communication.

===Distinctive unit insignia===
* Description: A gold color metal and enamel device that consists of a gold eagle grasping a horizontal baton from which is suspended a red signal flag with a white center, enclosing the flag from a star at the bottom, a wreath of laurel all gold and at top left and right a white scroll inscribed PRO PATRIA at left and VIGILANS at right in gold.
* Symbolism:
# The gold eagle holds in his talons a golden baton, from which descends a signal flag.
# The design originated in 1865 from a meeting of Signal Corps officers, led by Major [[Albert J. Myer]], the chief signal officer, in Washington, D.C.
# The badge was a symbol of faithful service and good fellowship for those who served together in war and was called the Order of the Signal Corps.
# The motto ''Pro Patria Vigilans'' (Watchful for the Country) was adopted from the Signal School insignia and serves to portray the cohesiveness of Signal soldiers and their affiliation with their regimental home.
# The laurel wreath depicts the myriad of achievements through strength made by the corps since its inception.
# The battle star centered on the wreath represents formal recognition for participation in combat. It adorned a signal flag and was first awarded to Signal Corps soldiers in 1862. The battle star typifies the close operational relationship between the combined arms and the Signal Corps.

===Inception===
The Signal Corps was authorized as a separate branch of the Army by [[Act of Congress]] on 3 March 1863 (Public Law No. 58 Article VIII, Section 17 and 18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://howardlanham.tripod.com/linkgr3/link158.html |title=U.S. Army Regulations Illustration: Link 158 Signal Corps Uniforms |publisher=Howardlanham.tripod.com |accessdate=2012-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125015618/http://howardlanham.tripod.com/linkgr3/link158.html |archivedate=25 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Signal Corps dates its existence from 21 June 1860, when Congress authorized the appointment of one signal officer in the Army, and a War Department order carried the following assignment: "Signal Department—Assistant Surgeon Albert J. Myer to be Signal Officer, with the rank of Major, 17 June 1860, to fill an original vacancy."

===Branch color===
Orange with white piping. Orange was selected in 1872 as the Signal Corps branch color. In 1902, the white piping was added to conform to the custom that prevailed of having piping of a different color for all branches except the line branches.

==Notable members==
Notable members of the Signal Corps include General of the Army (later General of the Air Force) [[Henry H. Arnold]], [[Frank Capra]], [[John Cheever]], [[Frank Lautenberg]], [[Stan Lee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REH42cHNY4U |publisher=[[YouTube]] |title=Stan Lee gets inducted into the SCRA |date=March 3, 2017 |first=Samuel |last=Northrup}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russ Meyer]], [[Tony Randall]], [[Jean Shepherd]], [[John C.

'''SimpleTech''' is a consumer brand of external [[hard drive]]s and [[backup]] products owned by [[Fabrik Inc.]] and designed to integrate [[computer hardware]], [[software]], and [[online services]] to help consumers store, protect, manage, and share digital content. The brand and product line was originally created by Simple Technology, a company founded in 1990, which later changed its name to SimpleTech in 2001.

SimpleTech (now [[STEC, Inc.]]) sold the SimpleTech brand and consumer products: [[flash memory]] cards, [[USB flash drives]], memory upgrades, and external and portable disk drive storage, to Fabrik in February 2007. Fabrik acquired the SimpleTech's storage platform to integrate and deliver backup and [[content management]] software and [[web services]] (FabrikUltimateBackup.com and Joggle.com), allowing consumers to store, access, manage and share their digital content.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Martell, February 11, 2007. “[https://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSN0919422520070212 Fabrik buys consumer business of SimpleTech].” Reuters.

[[Image:Fishing lure spoon.png|thumb|100px|right]]
A '''spoon lure''', in [[sport fishing]], is an oblong, usually concave [[fishing lure|lure]], usually made of [[metal]] or a shell, shaped like the bowl of a [[spoon]]. The spoon lure is mainly used to attract fish by reflecting light and moving [[random]]ly.

The design of the spoon lure is simple: an oblong, concave metal piece with a shiny chrome or paint finish and a single or treble [[fish hook|hook]] on the end. While the basic principle of design has stayed the same over the years, application and use have changed somewhat. In its beginning, the spoon was used simply to cast and retrieve. However, as [[trolling motors]] have become popular on most [[fishing boat]]s, a new version of the classic was invented.

This new breed of lure was nothing more than a duplicate of the traditional casting spoon, but made with thinner material. Using a trolling motor, fishermen could cover a wider expanse of water, increasing the chances for a successful day. Using split shots or other forms of weights, fishermen could easily zero into their fishing lures' depth while running at the proper speed. Armed with the ability to cover more area, average fishermen could take their spoon lures to any body of water, without full knowledge of the underwater geography that is key to catching some species of fish. The regular casting spoon (heavier version) is used primarily by fishermen who already know the water and what lies beneath. The angler, anchoring the boat 10 to 20 feet behind the area where the fish are believed to be, can cast the spoon beyond this point and retrieve through the given strike zone.

Fish use their [[lateral line]] system to follow the [[vortex|vortices]] produced by fleeing prey, and the oscillating movements of the spoon lure can be a good way to imitate these. Spoon lures with mirror finishes can be additionally effective when the sun is at a sharp angle to the water in the mornings or evenings, cause a glint of reflective sunlight that mimics the flash of white-bellied prey fish. Different color variations and materials can be added to the classic spoon lure may also help catch fish.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Silver- or gold-plated or dyed finishes can give the lure a more vibrant or brilliant appearance.

[[Image:KNOPPIX booting.png|thumb|Knoppix system console showing the boot process]]
The '''system console''', '''computer console''', '''root console''', '''[[computer operator|operator]]'s console''', or simply '''console''' is the text entry and display device for system administration messages, particularly those from the [[BIOS]] or [[boot loader]], the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], from the [[init]] system and from the [[syslog|system logger]]. It is a physical device consisting of a keyboard and a screen, and traditionally is a [[text terminal]], but may also be a [[graphical terminal]]. System consoles are generalized to [[computer terminal]]s, which are abstracted respectively by [[virtual console]]s and [[terminal emulator]]s. Today communication with system consoles is generally done abstractly, via the [[standard streams]] ([[stdin]], [[stdout]], and [[stderr]]), but there may be system-specific interfaces, for example those used by the system kernel.

==History==
[[Image:IBM_1620_Model_1.jpg|thumb|[[IBM 1620]] console, with a typewriter and front panel]]
Prior to the development of alphanumeric [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] system consoles, some computers such as the [[IBM 1620]] had console typewriters and [[front panel]]s while the very first programmable computer, the [[Manchester Baby]], used a combination of electromechanical switches and a CRT to provide console functions—the CRT displaying memory contents in binary by mirroring the machine's [[Williams tube|Williams-Kilburn tube]] CRT-based RAM.

On traditional [[minicomputer]]s, the console was a '''serial console''', an [[RS-232]] serial link to a [[computer terminal|terminal]] such as a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT100]]. This terminal was usually kept in a secured room  since it could be used for certain privileged functions such as halting the system or selecting which media to boot from.  Large [[midrange computer|midrange system]]s, e.g. those from [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[IBM]], still use serial consoles. In larger installations, the console ports are attached to multiplexers or network-connected multiport serial servers that let an operator connect a terminal to any of the attached servers. Today, serial consoles are often used for accessing [[headless system]]s, usually with a [[terminal emulator]] running on a [[laptop]]. Also, routers, enterprise  [[network switches]] and other telecommunication equipment have RS-232 serial console ports.

On [[Personal computer|PC]]s and [[workstation]]s, the computer's attached [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer display|monitor]] have the equivalent function.  Since the monitor cable carries video signals, it cannot be extended very far. Often, installations with many servers therefore use keyboard/video multiplexers ([[KVM switch]]es) and possibly video amplifiers to centralize console access. In recent years, [[KVM/IP]] devices have become available that allow a remote computer to view the video output and send keyboard input via any TCP/IP network and therefore the [[Internet]].

Some PC [[BIOS]]es, especially in servers, also support serial consoles, giving access to the BIOS through a serial port so that the simpler and cheaper serial console infrastructure can be used. Even where BIOS support is lacking, some [[operating system]]s, e.g. [[FreeBSD]] and [[Linux]], can be configured for serial console operation either during bootup, or after startup.

It is usually possible to [[logging (computer security)|log in]] from the console. Depending on configuration, the operating system may treat a login session from the console as being more trustworthy than a login session from other sources.

[[File:A Hindu wedding ritual in progress b.jpg|thumb|A ''Tilaka'' ceremony in progress to welcome the groom at a [[Hindu wedding]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], the '''tilaka''' ({{lang-sa|तिलक}}) is a mark worn usually on the forehead, sometimes other parts of the body such as neck, hand or chest. Tilaka may be worn on a daily basis or for rites of passage or special religious occasions only, depending on regional customs.

The term also refers to the [[Hindu]] ritual of marking someone's forehead with a fragrant paste, such as of sandalwood or vermilion, as a welcome and expression of honor when they arrive.&lt;ref name=axelmichaels100&gt;Axel Michaels (2015), Homo Ritualis: Hindu Ritual and Its Significance for Ritual Theory, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0190262631}}, page 100-112, 327&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The tilaka is a mark created by the application of powder or paste on the forehead. Tilakas are vertical markings worn by [[Vaishnavites]]. The Vaishnava tilaka consists of a long vertical marking starting from just below the hairline to almost the end of one's nose tip, and they are also known as [[Urdhva Pundra]].&lt;ref name=lochtefeldupundra/&gt; It is intercepted in the middle by an elongated U. There may be two marks on the temples as well. This tilaka is traditionally made with sandalwood paste.

The other major tilaka variant is often worn by the followers of [[Shiva]], known by the names of Rudra-tilaka and [[Tripundra]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Klaus K.|last= Klostermaier|title=Mythologies and Philosophies of Salvation in the Theistic Traditions of India|year= 1984|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-158-3|pages=131, 371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Deussen|first=Paul| title=Sixty Upanishads of the Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYepeIGUY0gC&amp;pg=PA779|year= 1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1467-7|pages=789–790}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of three horizontal bands across the forehead with a single vertical band or circle in the middle. This is traditionally done with sacred ash from fire sacrifices. This variant is the more ancient of the two and shares many common aspects with similar markings worn across the world. 

[[Shaktas]], worshippers of the various forms of the Goddess ([[Devi]]), wear a large red dot of [[kumkum]] (vermillion or red turmeric) on the forehead.

===Significance===
Chapter 2 of the ''[[Kalagni Rudra Upanishad]]'', a Shaiva traditional text, explains the three lines of a Tilaka as a reminder of various triads: three [[Yajna#Agni|sacred fires]], three syllables in [[Om]], three ''[[Guṇa|gunas]]'', three worlds, three types of ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' (self), three powers in oneself, first three [[Vedas]], three times of extraction of the Vedic drink [[Soma (drink)|Soma]].{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|p=790}}{{Sfn|Nene|1999}}

*The first line is equated to ''Garhapatya'' (the sacred fire in a household kitchen), the ''A'' syllable of Om, the [[Rajas|Rajas guna]], the earth, the external self, ''[[Kriyā]]'' &amp;ndash; the power of action, the ''[[Rigveda]]'', the morning extraction of Soma, and [[Maheshvara]].{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|p=790}}{{Sfn|Nene|1999}}
*The second streak of ash is a reminder of ''Dakshinagni'' (the holy fire lighted in the South for ancestors), the sound ''U'' of Om, [[Sattva|Sattva guna]], the atmosphere, the inner self, ''[[Iccha-shakti|Iccha]]'' &amp;ndash; the power of will, the ''[[Yajurveda]]'', midday Soma extraction, and [[Sadashiva]].{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|p=790}}{{Sfn|Nene|1999}}
*The third streak is the Ahavaniya (the fire used for [[Homa (ritual)|Homa]]), the ''M'' syllable in Om, the [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamas guna]], [[Svarga]] &amp;ndash; heaven, the [[Paramatman]] &amp;ndash; the highest self (the ultimate reality of [[Brahman]]), Jnana &amp;ndash; the power of knowledge, the ''[[Samaveda]]'', Soma extraction at dusk, and [[Shiva]].{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|p=790}}{{Sfn|Nene|1999}}

These lines, states Antonio Rigopoulos, represent Shiva’s threefold power of will (icchāśakti), knowledge (jñānaśakti), and action (kriyāśakti).&lt;ref name=rigopoulos182/&gt; The Tripuṇḍra described in this and other Shaiva texts also symbolizes Shiva’s trident (triśūla) and the divine triad of Brahmā, Vishnu, and Shiva.&lt;ref name=rigopoulos182&gt;Antonio Rigopoulos (2013), Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 5, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004178960}}, pages 182-183&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vasudeva Upanishad]], a Vaishnava tradition text, similarly explains the significance of three vertical lines in ''Urdhva Pundra'' Tilaka to be a reminder of Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva; the Vedic scriptures – Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda; three worlds Bhu, Bhuva, Svar; the three syllables of [[Om]] – A, U, M; three states of consciousness – awake, dream sleep, deep sleep; three realities – [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]; the three bodies – Sthula, Sukshma, and Karana.&lt;ref&gt;Sunder Hattangadi (2000), [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/vasudeva.pdf Vasudeva Upanishad], Sama Veda, SanskritDocuments Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D Dennis Hudson (2008), The Body of God, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195369229}}, pages 90-95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Examples of Tilaks or sect-marks.jpg|thumb|360px|Examples of Tilaks or sect-marking in British India, summarized by 19th-century scholar Russell]]
Different Hindu traditions use different materials and shapes to make the tilaka.&lt;ref&gt;Makhan Jha, Anthropology of ancient Hindu kingdoms: a study in civilizational perspective, Page 126&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Saivite]]s typically mark their Tilak using ''[[vibhuti]]'' (ash) in three horizontal lines across the forehead.&lt;ref name=lochtefeldupundra/&gt; Along with the three horizontal lines, a ''bindu'' of sandalwood paste or a dot of red ''kumkum'' in the centre completes the Tilaka (''[[tripundra]]'').&lt;ref name=deussen60p789/&gt;&lt;ref name=chatterjeeshs11/&gt;
*[[Vaishnava]]s apply a Tilak with vermillion, clay, sandalwood paste (''Chandan''), or latter two mixed.&lt;ref name=lochtefeldupundra/&gt; They apply the material in two vertical lines, which may be connected at the bottom, forming a simple U shape, often with an additional vertical red marking in the shape of a [[tulsi]] leaf inside the U shape. Their tilaka is called the [[Tilak (Vaishnava)|Urdhva Pundra]].&lt;ref name=lochtefeldupundra/&gt; See also [[Srivaishnava Urdhva Pundra]], the [[Srivaishnava]] tilaka.
*[[Ganapatya]] use red sandal paste (''rakta candana'').&lt;ref&gt;p. 202, note 40. Grimes, John A. Ganapati: Song of the Self. (State University of New York Press: Albany, 1995) {{ISBN|0-7914-2440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Shakta]]s use ''kumkuma'', or powdered red [[turmeric]]. They draw one vertical line or dot (not to be confused with ''Bindi'' used by Indian women from different religions).
*Honorary tilakas (''Raja tilaka'' and ''Vira tilaka'' are usually applied as a single vertical red line. ''Raja tilaka'' will be used while enthroning kings or inviting prominent personalities. ''Vira tilaka'' is used to anoint victors or leaders after a war or a game.
*[[Swaminarayana]] tilaka is U-shaped in the middle of forehead along with the red dot in the middle of U (known as'' chandlo'').

===Cultural tradition===
[[File:A Tilaka on forehead of guest to welcome, honor.jpg|thumb|160px|Applying Tilaka on the forehead of guests to welcome and honor is a cultural tradition in India and Nepal.&lt;ref name=axelmichaels100/&gt;]]
*[[Sikhism|Sikhs]] apply the tilaka as well. The Darshan Darbar devotees apply red tilaka to the forehead. This tilaka is a long red mark veritically applied.  Saint Baba Budha ji applied tilaka to the first five Sikh Gurus.&lt;ref&gt;Purnima Dhavan(2011) "When Sparrows Became Hawks: The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699-1799.", p.36&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jainism|Jains]] use Tilaka to mark the forehead of Jaina images with sandalwood paste, during Puja ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, pages 221-222&lt;/ref&gt;
*Christians in India use Tilaka, both to mark special occasions and during their worship rites.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eric Frykenberg (2008), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20618639 Review: Christian Inculturation in India by Paul M. Collins], Journal: Church History (Cambridge University Press), Vol. 77, No. 4, pages 1118-1120&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hindus use the Tilaka ceremony, as a mark of honor and welcome to guests, something special or someone special.&lt;ref name=axelmichaels100/&gt; It may also be used, for same reason, to mark idols at the start of a [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship), to mark a rock or tree before it is cut or removed from its original place for artisan work, or a new piece of property.&lt;ref name=axelmichaels100/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Washburn Hopkins (1910), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087578 Mythological Aspects of Trees and Mountains in the Great Epic], Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 30, No. 4, pages 347-374&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
The choice of style is not mandated in Hindu texts, and it is left to the individual and the regional culture, leading to many versions. The known styles include&lt;ref name="Vijay Prakash Sharma page 72"&gt;Vijay Prakash Sharma, The sadhus and Indian civilisation, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; Vijayshree – white tilaka ''urdhwapundra'' with a white line in the middle,&lt;ref name="Vijay Prakash Sharma page 72"/&gt; founded by Swami Balanand of Jaipur; Bendi tilaka – white tilak ''urdhwapundra'' with a white round mark in the middle,&lt;ref&gt;Vijay Prakash Sharma, The sadhus and Indian civilisation, page 73&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Swami Ramprasad Acharya of Badasthan Ayodhya; and Chaturbhuji tilaka – white tilak ''urdhwapundra'' with the upper portion turned 90 degrees in the opposite direction, no ''shri'' in the middle, founded by Narayandasji of Bihar, ascetics of Swarg Dwar of Ayodhya follow it. Sharma has named additional styles as, Vallabh Sampraday Tilak, Sri Tilaka of Rewasa Gaddi, Ramacharandas Tilaka, Srijiwarama ka Tilaka, Sri Janakraja Kishori Sharan Rasik Aliji ka Tilaka, Sri Rupkalajee ka Tilaka, Rupsarasji ka Tilaka, Ramasakheeji ka Tilaka, Kamanendu Mani ka Tilaka, Karunasindhuji ka Tilaka, Swaminarayana Tilaka, Nimbarka ka Tilaka and Madhwa ka Tilaka.&lt;ref&gt;Vijay Prakash Sharma, The sadhus and Indian civilisation, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to bindi== 
The terms tilaka and [[bindi (decoration)|bindi]] overlap somewhat, but are not synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;personal faith&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the differences:
*A ''tilaka'' is always applied with paste or powder, whereas a ''bindi'' may be paste or jewel.
*A ''tilaka'' is usually applied for religious or spiritual reasons, or to honour a personage, event, or victory.  A ''bindi'' can signify marriage, or be simply for decorative purposes.
*A ''bindi'' is worn only between the eyes, whereas a tilaka can also cover the face or other parts of the body. Tilaka can be applied to twelve parts of the body: head, forehead, neck, both upper-arms, both forearms, chest, both sides of the torso, stomach and shoulder.

==Terminology==
[[File:Indus seal impression.jpg|thumb|140px|similar pictography from [[Indus Valley Civilization]]]]
It is also called '''tikli''' or '''sheether harr''' in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], '''tika''',  or '''tilakam''' or '''tilak''' in [[Hindi]]; {{lang-sa|तिलक}} {{IAST|tilaka}}; {{IPA-hns|t̪ɪˈlək}})&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte. ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary''. p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nepal]], [[Bihar]] and other regions, the tilakam is called a ''tikā''/''teeka'' (टिका {{IPA-hns|ʈɪkaː|}}), and is a mixture of ''[[abir]]'', a red powder, yoghurt, and grains of rice. The most common tikka is red powder applied with the thumb, in a single upward stroke.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70908">[[File:A New System of Chemical Philosophy fp.jpg|thumb|An image from [[John Dalton]]'s ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'', the first modern explanation of [[atomic theory]].]]
The '''timeline of chemistry''' lists important works, discoveries, ideas, inventions, and experiments that significantly changed humanity's understanding of the modern science known as [[chemistry]], defined as the scientific study of the composition of matter and of its interactions. The [[history of chemistry]] in its modern form arguably began with the Irish scientist [[Robert Boyle]],  though its roots can be traced back to the earliest recorded history.

Early ideas that later became incorporated into the modern science of chemistry come from two main sources.  [[Natural philosophy|Natural philosophers]] (such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Democritus]]) used [[deductive reasoning]] in an attempt to explain the behavior of the world around them.  [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] (such as [[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Geber]] and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi|Rhazes]]) were people who used experimental techniques in an attempt to extend the life or perform material conversions, such as turning base metals into gold.

In the 17th century, a synthesis of the ideas of these two disciplines, that is the ''deductive'' and the ''experimental'', leads to the development of a process of thinking known as the [[scientific method]].  With the introduction of the scientific method, the modern science of chemistry was born.

Known as "[[the central science]]", the study of chemistry is strongly influenced by, and exerts a strong influence on, many other scientific and technological fields.  Many events considered central to our modern understanding of chemistry are also considered key discoveries in such fields as physics, biology, astronomy, geology, and materials science to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Chemistry – The Central Science | work = The Chemistry Hall of Fame | publisher = York University | url = http://www.chem.yorku.ca/hall_of_fame/whychem.htm | accessdate = 2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the acceptance of the [[scientific method]] and its application to the field of chemistry, it is somewhat controversial to consider many of the people listed below as "chemists" in the modern sense of the word.  However, the ideas of certain great thinkers, either for their prescience, or for their wide and long-term acceptance, bear listing here.
;c. 3000 BC: [[Egyptians]] formulate the theory of the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], or the "primordial forces", from which all was formed.  These were the elements of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]], numbered in eight, that existed before the creation of the sun.&lt;ref name="Griffith"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffiths |first=J.

;c. 450 BC: [[Empedocles]] asserts that all things are composed of four primal [[chemical element|elements]]: earth, air, fire, and water, whereby two active and opposing [[force]]s, love and hate, or affinity and antipathy, act upon these elements, combining and separating them into infinitely varied forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parry |first=Richard |title=Empedocles |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |date=2005-03-04 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/empedocles/ |accessdate=2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;c. 440 BC: [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] propose the idea of the atom, an indivisible particle that all matter is made of.  This idea is largely rejected by natural philosophers in favor of the Aristotlean view (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berryman |first=Sylvia |title=Leucippus |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |date=2004-08-14 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leucippus/ |accessdate=2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berryman |first=Sylvia |title=Democritus |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |date=2004-08-15 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/ |accessdate=2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;c. 360 BC: [[Plato]] coins term ‘[[classical element|elements]]’ (''stoicheia'') and in his dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a rudimentary treatise on chemistry, assumes that the minute particle of each element had a special geometric shape: [[tetrahedron]] (fire), [[octahedron]] (air), [[icosahedron]] (water), and [[cube]] (earth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillar |first=Marian |year=2004 |url=http://www.socinian.org/aristotles_de_anima.html |title=The Problem of the Soul in Aristotle's De anima |publisher=NASA WMAP |accessdate=2006-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909004214/http://www.socinian.org/aristotles_de_anima.html |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waterfall''' was a style of furniture design in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the most prevalent variation on [[Art Deco]] furniture during this time,&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt; primarily created for the mass market and for bedroom suites.&lt;ref name="Fitz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Oscar P.|title=American Furniture: 1650 to the Present|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=469|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Jc9DwAAQBAJ|date=2018|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ireland"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ireland|first=Jeannie|title=History of Interior Design|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|edition=2nd|page=512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTFCDwAAQBAJ|date=2018|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing features==
The style was distinguished by numerous features. It was named "Waterfall" due to its distinctive rounded drops at the edges of all horizontal surfaces, intended to mimic a flowing waterfall. Pieces in this style were usually finished with a blond [[wood veneer|veneer]], though a small percentage were finished in a darker walnut finish. Drawer faces on more expensive Waterfall furniture often featured unusual designs such as decorative [[:wikt:crossband|crossbanding]] and [[bookmatched]] panels. Handles were typically of orange [[Bakelite]] and brass, and some [[lowboy|vanities]] had illuminated spheres or frosted panels.&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt; Pieces in this style were sometimes paired with oversized round mirrors with etched trim.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Dan|title=Furniture of the Jazz Age|journal=Old-House Interiors|publisher=William J. O'Donnell|volume=7|number=6|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zAEAAAAMBAJ|date=November 2011|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The furniture was made with [[plywood]], which would be molded during manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Ireland"/&gt; Higher-quality pieces would feature the Waterfall curve in molded plywood where the plywood softened edges of side corners. Mass-produced Waterfall furniture often simply featured a quarter-round edge.&lt;ref name="Bien"/&gt;

Waterfall furniture contrasted from boxy walnut or mahogany pieces of the 1920s due to Waterfall's curved lines and its use of imported woods, including blond-colored Carpathian elm and golden [[padouk]].&lt;ref name="Fitz"/&gt;

==History==
The Waterfall style became popular in America after creating a stir at the [[Paris Colonial Exposition]] in 1931. A company in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] was among the first to produce furniture in the style in the United States; their efforts were successful enough to inspire other furniture factories to produce Waterfall furniture, much of which was mass-produced and of poor quality.&lt;ref name="Bien"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bienenstock|first=Nathan I.|title=A History of American Furniture|publisher=Furniture World – Furniture South|date=1970|oclc=1452685}}&lt;/ref&gt;
