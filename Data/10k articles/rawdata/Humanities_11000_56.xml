Sidi '''Abdullah Al-Sha'ab''' was a [[Libya]]n [[Sufi]] scholar who died in the 16th century CE.

== Mausoleum ==
Located in Tripoli, the Abdullah Al-Sha'ab [[mausoleum]] containing his grave as well as the grave of about 50 other respected scholars, and was a religious place for local Sufi community. The [[Wall Street Journal]] reported that the mausoleum was bulldozed in [[Tripoli]] on 25 August 2012, under the view of local security forces. [[Salafi]]sts are suspected of being responsible for the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444230504577613260789607638|work=Wall Street Journal|date=26 August 2012|last=Coker|first=Margaret|title=Libyan Congress Seeks Answers in Attacks on Shrines}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actions have been criticized by the President's office. [[Reuters]] received a report that, surprised by the firepower of the militia leading the action, local security forces had to make a swift trade off, eventually choosing to seal the area to reduce clashes while letting the demolition take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/fighters-bulldoze-sufi-mosque-central-tripoli-172020410.html |title=Fighters bulldoze Sufi mosque in central Tripoli |publisher=Reuters |last=Zargoun |first=Taha |date=26 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827231155/http://news.yahoo.com/fighters-bulldoze-sufi-mosque-central-tripoli-172020410.html |archivedate=27 August 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Castellania (Valletta) Allegories of Justice and Truth.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Baroque allegorical figures of [[Lady Justice]] and [[Prudence|Lady Prudentia]], on the façade of the 18th century [[Castellania (Valletta)|Castellania]], in [[Valletta]]]]
'''Allegorical sculpture''' refers to sculptures that symbolize and particularly personify abstract ideas as in [[allegory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_A.html|title=Literary Terms and Definitions A|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common in the [[western world]], for example, are statues of [[Lady Justice]] representing [[justice]], traditionally holding scales and a [[Sword of Justice|sword]], and the statues of [[Prudence]], representing Truth by holding a mirror and squeezing a serpent.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thake |first1=Conrad |title=The Architectural legacy of Grand Master Pinto (2) |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-05-16/local-news/The-Architectural-legacy-of-Grand-Master-Pinto-(2)-207685 |work=[[The Malta Independent]] |date=16 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192321/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-05-16/local-news/The-Architectural-legacy-of-Grand-Master-Pinto-%282%29-207685 |archivedate=1 August 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This approach of using human form and its posture, gesture and clothing to wordlessly convey [[Value system|social value]]s and [[Theme (arts)|theme]]s.
It may be seen in [[church monument|funerary art]] as early as 1580. They were used on [[renaissance]] monuments when [[patron saint]]s became unacceptable. Particularly popular were the [[four cardinal virtues]] and the [[Theological virtues|three Christian virtues]], but others such as [[Pheme|fame]], [[Victoria (mythology)|victory]], [[hope]] and [[Father time|time]] are also represented. The use of allegorical sculpture was fully developed under the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. It is sometimes associated with [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, and is commonly found in works dating from around 1900.

'''ApologetiX''' is a [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] [[parody music|parody band]] from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The band was founded in 1992, and since then, has played in all 50 states,&lt;ref name="facility"/&gt; released 35 studio albums,&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{Cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.apologetix.com/faq/faq.php|publisher=ApologetiX}}&lt;/ref&gt; and built up a fan club that includes over 65,000 people.&lt;ref name="facility"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bonnett|first=Vaunda|title=ApologetiX show opens new facility|url=http://pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/s_307319.html |accessdate=August 20, 2010|newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=February 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band is currently composed of J. Jackson on vocals, Keith Haynie on bass guitar, Jimmy "Vegas" Tanner on drums, Bill Hubauer and Chris VonBartheld on keyboard, and Tom Milnes and Tom Tincha (a.k.a. "TNT"), both on lead guitar.&lt;ref name="bios"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bios|url=http://www.apologetix.com/bios/bios.php|publisher=ApologetiX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ApologetiX is a [[word play|play]] on its [[eponym]] ''[[apologetics]]'' – the defense of a religious doctrine, often, and in this case, referring to [[Christian apologetics]].&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; It is based on the Greek word for ''defense'', {{lang|el|ἀπολογία}} (''apologia'') The word is used in [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter 3:15]]: "But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer (defense or "apologia") to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect..." ([[New International Version|NIV]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1 Peter 3:15 - Passage Lookup |publisher=Bible Gateway |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A15&amp;version=NIV |accessdate=2010-12-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115141015/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A15&amp;version=NIV |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their logo, a [[triquetra]], is an ancient symbol that has gained Christian [[cultural appropriation|adoption]] to represent the [[Holy Trinity]].&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;

==History==
ApologetiX has had six official drummers. Jeff Pakula (June 1990 – September 1993), Rick Servocky (November 1993 – April 1995), Bob Flaherty (May 1995 – September 1998), Fred Behanna (February 1999 – January 2001), Bill "Moose" Rieger (March 2001 – January 2005) and Jimmy "Vegas" Tanner (October 2005 – present).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bios - Jimmy|url=http://www.apologetix.com/bios/jimmy.php|publisher=ApologetiX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ApologetiX has had multiple other drummers as well, including: their longtime fill-in drummer, Keith Harrold (who played on ''[[Isn't Wasn't Ain't]]'' and ''[[Keep the Change (album)|Keep the Change]]''); David McKee (who played on ''[[Jesus Christ Morningstar]]'' as well as two concerts in 1998); and [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz]] (the drummer for [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]), who played on seven tracks on ''[[Biblical Graffiti]]''.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt; Ron Zanski (two shows in 1993) and Allen Muckle (three shows in 2001) have also played with the band.

According to the band's website, Yankovic himself has told them that he thinks they do "fabulous work".&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;

Since 2014, the band has been following a quarterly release schedule, producing a new [[studio album]] about every three months by releasing double singles bi-weekly. From 2014 to 2017, they were able to produce four albums per year. In 2018, their studio computers started to have speed issues, which slowed down the production of their albums. So far they have released two albums, with a third album on its way.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
ApologetiX rewrites [[secular]] songs with Christian lyrics to create parodies with Christian messages, and, in the song "We're In A Parody Band," ApologetiX refers to itself as a cross between [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] and [[Billy Graham]].

The band's lyrical content is derived solely from Biblical passages and practices, frequently in a [[tongue-in-cheek]] manner.  It is also noteworthy that lyrics are often embedded with Scripture references for further exploration of the song's content.

Some of their parodies include:

'''Art world economics''' is a relatively unexplored area of [[financial]] exchange that exists at the edges of the regular financial industry. Investment in [[art]] has been an accepted form of deposit investment for several decades such as the purchase of works by [[Matisse]], [[Van Gogh]] and [[Picasso]]. However these works only have an assured value as long as there is a restricted supply of works on the open market - i.e. the artist is dead or producing small numbers of works and that the [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] of works can be verified by a small number of sources. In the case of contemporary artists it is the interest of collectors and therefore dealers to ensure a tightly controlled line of supply.

The intricacies of [[art world]] economics were exposed by the suit of the family of [[Mark Rothko]] against the Marlborough Fine Art Gallery brought during the 1970s. In an action known as the [[Rothko Case]], it was determined that Marlborough had knowingly manipulated their management of Rothko's works to maintain a higher sale price after his death, to the detriment of Rothko's family's interest in his estate.

The art market was hit by the 2008 financial crash; sales were down about 41 per cent by 2009, compared with a market peak of almost $66bn in 2007. Contemporary art was particularly badly hit, with sales in that category plunging almost 60 per cent over the two years 2008-09. However, by 2011 the value of sales had almost reached the record level of 2007, and they have remained between $56bn and $68bn in the years since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boom amid the bust |url=https://www.ft.com/content/9c5e3fe8-85ea-11e8-9199-c2a4754b5a0e |website=The Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audiovisual''' ('''AV''') means possessing  both a [[sound]] and a [[visual]] component, such as [[slide-tape]] presentations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=Slide-Tape Presentations on a Classroom Budget|jstor=4447864|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[film]]s, [[television program]]s, church services and live theater productions.

Audiovisual service providers frequently offer web streaming, video conferencing and live broadcast services.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg 2014, Audiovisual Services&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer-based audiovisual equipment is often used in education, with many schools and universities installing projection equipment and using interactive whiteboard technology.

Another audiovisual expression is the visual presentation of sound ([[visual music]]).

==Residential audiovisual==
Generally, residential audiovisual encompasses in-ceiling speakers, flat panel TVs, projectors and projector screens. This could include lighting, blinds, cinema rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Quin 2014, Universal Home Theatre&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial audiovisual==
The '''professional audiovisual industry''' is a multibillion-dollar industry, comprising the manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, consultants, programmers, presentations professionals and technology managers of audiovisual products and services.

Commercial audiovisual can sometimes be a very lengthy process to get it right. Boardroom audio visual can be installed for a number of reasons, but usually it is because the executives of the organization/business wants to have meetings with colleagues/customers/suppliers around the world. When creating an array of boardrooms for customers it has been seen that you have to be able to balance the pattern from the audio and microphone so there is no interruption in the sound quality for the individual/s listening in.&lt;ref&gt;Quin 2014, Universal Home Theatre&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of audiovisual [[communication technology|communications technologies]], including sound, video, lighting, display and projection systems, is evident in every sector of society: in business, education, government, the military, healthcare, retail environments, worship, sports and entertainment, hospitality, restaurants, and museums. The application of audiovisual systems is found in collaborative conferencing (which includes video-conferencing, audio-conferencing, web-conferencing and data-conferencing); presentation rooms, auditoriums, and lecture halls; command and control centers; [[digital signage]], and more. Concerts and corporate events are among the most obvious venues where audiovisual equipment is used in a staged environment. Providers of this type of service are known as rental and staging companies, although they may also be served by an in-house technology team (e.g., in a hotel or conference center).

According to a 2006 market forecast study by [[InfoComm International]], a leading trade association representing the audiovisual industry, 2006 was the fourth consecutive year that significant growth was projected for the industry.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} Revenue for surveyed North American companies was expected to grow by 40% in 2006, and by 10.7% for European audiovisual companies. The single biggest factor for this increase is the increased demand for networked audiovisual products due to the integration of audiovisual and IT technology. The two leading markets for AV equipment in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] continue to be business/IT and education, especially as conference room technologies become more advanced.

==Audiovisual education==
{{main article|Audiovisual education}}

This '''bibliography of anthropology''' lists some notable publications in the field of [[anthropology]], including its various subfields. It is not comprehensive and continues to be developed. It also includes a number of works that are not by anthropologists but are relevant to the field, such as literary theory, sociology, psychology, and philosophical anthropology.

Anthropology is the study of [[human]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Mission|url=http://www.therai.org.uk/about-the-rai/|publisher=[[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]]|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=L'Anthropologie |url=http://www.afa.msh-paris.fr/discipline.html |publisher=Association Française des Anthropologues |accessdate=17 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109101912/http://www.afa.msh-paris.fr/discipline.html |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "the most humanistic of sciences and the most scientific of the humanities",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.discoveranthropology.org.uk/about-anthropology/what-is-anthropology.html|work=Discover Anthropology|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered to bridge the [[natural science]]s, [[social science]]s and [[humanities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shore|first=Bradd|title=Creating consilience: integrating the sciences and the humanities|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-979439-3|pages=140–158|editor=Edward Slingerland and Mark Collard|chapter=Unconsilience: Rethinking the Two-Cultures Conundrum in Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and draws upon a wide range of related fields. In North America, anthropology is traditionally divided into four major subdisciplines: [[biological anthropology]], [[sociocultural anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]] and [[archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boas|first=Franz|title=The History of Anthropology|journal=Science|year=1904|volume=20|issue=512|pages=513–524|doi=10.1126/science.20.512.513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Segal|editor1-first=Daniel A.|editor2-last=Yanagisako|editor2-first=Sylvia J.|title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-8684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other academic traditions use less broad definitions, where one or more of these fields are considered separate, but related, disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=Anthropology and Anthropologists: the Modern British School|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-11895-8|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulf|first=Christoph|title=Anthropology: A Continental Perspective|year=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0-226-92507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological anthropology ==
[[Biological anthropology]] is traditionally conceived of as part of the North American four-field approach. In some universities, however, the subject has repositioned itself as ''human evolutionary biology''. In Europe, it is sometimes taught as an individual subject at college level or as part of the discipline of biology. Its methods are informed by evolutionary biology, hence the adjunct ''biological''. Since 1993, the Biological Anthropology Section of the [[American Anthropological Association]] has awarded the W.W. Howells Book Award in Biological Anthropology.&lt;ref name=Howells&gt;{{cite web|title=W. W.

== Archaeology ==
Archaeological anthropology is traditionally conceived of as part of the North American four-field approach. With the four-field approach being questioned for its orthodoxy, the subject has gained considerable independence in recent years and some archaeologists have rejected the label ''anthropology''. In Europe, the subject maintains closer connections to history and is simply conceived of as ''archaeology'' with a distinct research focus and methodology.

== Some points of reference in related disciplines ==
Anthropological research has exerted considerable influence on other disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[literary theory]], and [[philosophy]]. Conversely, contemporary anthropological discourse has become receptive to a wide variety of theoretical currents which in turn help to shape the cognitive identity of the subject(s). Among the key publications from related disciplines that have advanced anthropological scholarship are:

'''Borobudur Temple Compounds''' is a term used by the [[World Heritage]] designation of the area of three Buddhist temples in [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]]. It comprises [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], and [[Pawon]]. These three temples are located in a straight line, and have been considered as being  built during the [[Shailendra dynasty]] circa 8th–9th centuries.

Approximately {{convert|40|km|mi}} northwest of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], Borobudur is located in an elevated area between two twin volcanoes, [[Mount Sundoro|Sundoro]]-[[Mount Sumbing|Sumbing]] and [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]]-[[Mount Merapi|Merapi]], and two rivers, the Progo and the Elo. According to local myth, the area known as [[Kedu Plain]] is a Javanese [[List of Sacred Places in Java|'sacred' place]] and has been dubbed 'the garden of Java' due to its high [[soil fertility|agricultural fertility]].&lt;ref name="p1"&gt;Soekmono (1976), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{stack|[[File:Borobudur Map en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The location of three Buddhist temples - Borobudur, Pawon and Mendut - in one straight line]]}}

During the restoration in the early 20th century, it was discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, [[Pawon]] and [[Mendut]], are positioned along a straight line.&lt;ref name="krom"&gt;{{cite book| author=N. J. Krom| title=Borobudur, Archaeological Description| year=1927| publisher=Nijhoff| location=The Hague| url=http://www.borobudur.tv/mendut_borobudur.htm| accessdate=17 August 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817055309/http://borobudur.tv/mendut_borobudur.htm| archivedate=17 August 2008| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might be accidental, but the temples' alignment is in conjunction with a native [[Folklore|folk tale]] that a long time ago, there was a brick-paved road from Borobudur to Mendut with walls on both sides. The three temples (Borobudur–Pawon–Mendut) have similar architecture and ornamentation derived from the same time period, which suggests that ritual relationship between the three temples, in order to have formed a sacred unity, must have existed, although exact ritual process is yet unknown.&lt;ref name="moens"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Barabudur, Mendut en Pawon en hun onderlinge samenhang (''Barabudur, Mendut and Pawon and their mutual relationship'') |author=J.

Besides these three temples, there are other [[Buddhist temple|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu temple|Hindu]] temples scattered in the area. The earliest is [[Gunung Wukir]] or Canggal Hindu temple dated 732&amp;nbsp;CE, according to [[Canggal inscription]] discovered in the temple complex, the Shivaite King [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]] commissioned a [[Shivalinga]] sanctuary to be built on the Wukir hill, only {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Borobudur.&lt;ref name="holing"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Indonesia |title=In Search of "Ho-Ling" |author=W.

The ruin of Banon temple, a Hindu temple located several hundred meters north of Pawon temple. The ruin of Banon temple is unreconstructable because many stones were missing, however several stone statues of Hindu gods were discovered in good condition in this area. Today the Banon statues of Vishnu, Brahma, Shiva and Ganesha were displayed in [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].

'''Calypso''' is a style of [[Afro-Caribbean music]] that originated in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] during the early to mid-19th century and eventually spread to the rest of the Caribbean [[Antilles]] and [[Venezuela]] by the mid-20th century. Its rhythms can be traced back to West African [[Kaiso]] and the arrival of French planters and their slaves from the [[French Antilles]] in the 18th century.

Calypso drew upon African and French influences, and became the voice of the people{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}. It was characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, and was most often sung in a [[French-based creole languages|French creole]] and led by a [[griot]]. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a ''chantuelle'' and eventually, ''[[calypsonian]]''. As English replaced "patois" ([[Antillean creole]]) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the doings of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of [[Port of Spain]] and [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]]. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression, and also served to document the history of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago.

Calypso in the Caribbean includes a range of genres, including: the [[Benna (genre)|Benna]] genre of [[music of Antigua and Barbuda|Antiguan and Barbudan music]]; [[Mento]], a style of [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican]] [[folk music]] that greatly influenced [[ska]] and [[reggae]]; [[Ska]], the precursor to [[rocksteady]] and reggae; [[Spouge]], a style of Barbadian popular music; [[Dominica]] [[Cadence-lypso]], which mixed calypso with the [[cadence rampa|cadence]] of [[Haiti]]; and [[soca music]], a style of [[Kaiso]]/calypso, with influences from cadence-lypso, [[Soul music|soul]], and [[funk]].

It is thought that the name "calypso" was originally "kaiso" which is now believed to come from [[Efik language|Efik]] "ka isu" ("go on!") and [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]] "kaa iso" ("continue, go on"), used in urging someone on or in backing a contestant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Allsopp, ''Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Trinidadian term "cariso" that means "old-time" calypsos.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes (1986), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "calypso" is recorded from the 1930s onwards. Alternatively, the insert for ''The Rough Guide to Calypso and Soca'' (published by [[World Music Network]]) favours John Cowley's arguments in ''Carnival, Canboulay and Calypso: Traditions in the Making,'' that the word might be a corruption of the French ''carrouseaux'' and through the process of patois and Anglicization became ''caliso'' and then finally "calypso"; however, Cowley also notes that the first mention of the word "calypso" is given in a description of a dance in 1882 by [[Abbé Masse]].&lt;ref&gt;John Cowley, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rHFOemkETacC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22Abb%C3%A9+Masse%22+calypso&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yCiZXj3znX&amp;sig=1Sw7oZ37Mb4366LcDQiSrsJ4mrk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QXJFUrq_Aq2b0wWe3YCABg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Abb%C3%A9%20Masse%22%20calypso&amp;f=false ''Carnival, Canboulay and Calypso: Traditions in the Making''], Cambridge University Press, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Calypso music was developed in [[Trinidad]] in the 17th century from the West African [[Kaiso]] and [[canboulay music]] brought by African slaves imported to that Caribbean island to work on sugar plantations. The slaves, brought to toil on sugar plantations, were stripped of all connections to their homeland and family and not allowed to talk to each other. They used calypso to mock the slave masters and to communicate with each other. Many early calypsos were sung in [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]] by an individual called a [[griot]]. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a ''chantuelle'' and eventually, ''[[calypsonian]]''.

Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] song ''[[lavway]]'', French Creole ''[[Bèlè (dance)|belair]]'' and the [[calinda]] stick-fighting [[chantwell]]. Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by [[Trinidadian]] slaves, including [[canboulay]] drumming and the music masquerade processions. The French brought [[Carnival]] to Trinidad, and calypso competitions at Carnival grew in popularity, especially after the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] in 1834.

===Recordings===
The first identifiably calypso genre song was recorded in 1912, by [[Lovey's String Band]] while visiting [[New York City]]. In 1914, the second calypso song was recorded, this time in Trinidad, by [[chantwell]] Julian Whiterose, better known as the Iron Duke and famous calinda stick-fighter. Jules Sims would also record vocal calypsos. The majority of these calypsos of the [[World War I]] era were instrumentals by Lovey and [[Lionel Belasco]]. Perhaps due to the constraints of the wartime economy, no recordings of note were produced until the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the "golden era" of calypso would cement the style, form, and phrasing of the music.

Calypso evolved into a way of spreading news around Trinidad. Politicians, [[journalists]] and public figures often debated the content of each song, and many islanders considered these songs the most reliable news source. [[Calypsonian]]s pushed the boundaries of free speech as their lyrics spread news of any topic relevant to island life, including speaking out against political corruption. Eventually British rule enforced [[censorship]] and police began to scan these songs for damaging content.

Even with this censorship, calypsos continued to push boundaries, with a variety of ways to slip songs past the scrutinizing eyes of the editor. [[Double entendre]], or double-speak, was one way, as was the practice of denouncing countries such as Hitler's Germany and its annexation of [[Poland]], while making pointed references toward the [[UK]]'s policies on Trinidad. Sex, scandal, gossip, innuendo, politics, local news, bravado and insulting other calypsonians were the order of the day in classic calypso, just as it is today with classic [[Hip hop|hip-hop]]. And just as the hip-hop of today, the music sparked shock and outrage in moralistic sections of society.

Countless recordings were dumped at sea in the name of censorship, although in truth, rival US companies did this in the spirit of underhanded competition, claiming that the rivals' material was unfit for US consumption. [[Decca Records]] lost untold pressings in this manner, as did its rival, [[RCA]]'s Bluebird label.

An entrepreneur named [[Eduardo Sa Gomes]] played a significant role in spreading calypso in its early days. Sa Gomes, a Portuguese immigrant who owned a local music and [[phonograph]] equipment shop in [[Port of Spain]], promoted the genre and gave financial support to the local artists. In March 1934, he sent [[Roaring Lion]] and [[Attila the Hun (calypsonian)|Attila the Hun]] to New York City to record; they became the first calypsonians to record abroad, bringing the genre out of the West Indies and into pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;Funk, Ray. [http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/kaiso25.htm "Roaring Lion (Raphael Arius Kairiyama De Leon AKA Hubert Raphael Charles, 15.6.08 – 11.7.99)".]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Invader]] was quick to follow, and staying in [[New York City]] after a protracted legal case involving the theft of his song "[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]", a hit by the [[Andrews Sisters]], made his home there along with [[Wilmoth Houdini]], and became one of the great calypsonians of the USA.

Early forms of calypso were also influenced by [[jazz]] such as Sans Humanitae. In this [[extempo]] ([[extemporaneous]]) melody calypsonians lyricise impromptu, commenting socially or insulting each other, "sans humanité" or "no mercy" (which is again a reference to French influence).

== Popularity==
The first major stars of calypso started crossing over to new audiences worldwide in the late 1930s. Attila the Hun, Roaring Lion and [[Lord Invader]] were first, followed by [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]], one of the longest-lasting calypso stars in history—he continued to release hit records until his death in 2000.  1944's "[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]" by the [[Andrews Sisters]], a [[cover version]] of a Lord Invader song, became an American hit despite the song being a very critical commentary on the explosion of prostitution, inflation and other negative influences accompanying the American military bases in Trinidad at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlBS-NQhLEYC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=%22rum+and+coca+cola%22+trinidad+prostitution&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Qe482n7Qeh&amp;sig=fVpVGt72r620chVZ7V51Xr_fHBA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result ''Consuming the Caribbean''].&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most straightforward way to describe the focus of calypso is that it articulated itself as a form of protest against the authoritarian colonial culture which existed at the time.

Calypso, especially a toned-down, commercial variant, became a worldwide craze with the release of the "[[Banana Boat Song]]", or "Day-O", a traditional [[Jamaica]]n folk song, whose best-known rendition was done by [[Harry Belafonte]] on his album ''[[Calypso (album)|Calypso]]'' (1956); ''Calypso'' was the first full-length record to sell more than a million copies. The success of that album inspired hundreds of "Folkies", or the [[American folk music revival]] to imitate the "Belafonte style", but with a more folk-oriented flavor. The [[Kingston Trio]] would be a good example. 1956 also saw the massive international hit "[[Jean and Dinah]]" by [[Mighty Sparrow]]. This song too was a sly commentary as a "plan of action" for the calypsonian on the widespread prostitution and the prostitutes' desperation after the closing of the U.S. [[naval base]] on Trinidad at [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]].

In the [[Broadway theater|Broadway-theatre]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Jamaica (musical)|Jamaica]]'' (1957), [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]] cleverly [[parody music|parodied]] "commercial" Belafonte-style calypso. Several films jumped on the calypso craze in 1957 such as ''[[Island in the Sun (film)|Island in the Sun]]'' ([[20th Century Fox]]) that featured Belafonte and the low-budget films ''[[Calypso Joe]]'' ([[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]), ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'' ([[Columbia Pictures]]), and ''[[Bop Girl Goes Calypso]]'' ([[United Artists]]).
[[Robert Mitchum]] released an album, ''Calypso...Is Like So'' (1957), on [[Capitol records]], capturing the sound, spirit, and subtleties of the genre.
[[Dizzy Gillespie]] recorded a calypso album ''Jambo Caribe'' (1964) with [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]] and [[Kenny Barron]].

Soul shouter [[Gary U.S. Bonds|Gary "US" Bonds]] released a calypso album ''Twist up Calypso'' (1962) on Legrand records, shortly after returning home from his military post in Port of Spain. Nithi Kanagaratnam from Sri Lanka sang calypso-styled songs in Tamil in 1968, which was a success and earned him the title "Father of Tamil Popular Music". Since Baila rhythm was popular in Sri Lanka, most of his songs were classified as Tamil Baila. 

In the mid-1970s, women entered the calypso men's-oriented arena. [2] Calypso Rose was the first woman to win the Trinidad Road March competition in 1977 with her song "Gimme More Tempo". The following year with "Come Leh We Jam", she won the "Calypso King " competition, the first time a woman had received the award. The competition's title was changed to Calypso Monarch in her honour.
The French and pioneer electronic musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]] released an album in 1990 called ''[[Waiting for Cousteau]]''. The album has four tracks: "Calypso", "Calypso part 2", "Calypso part 3 Fin de Siècle" and "Waiting for Cousteau". It was dedicated to [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] in his 80th birthday. This album had a special participation of the Amocco Renegades (a traditional steel-drum band from [[Trinidad and Tobago]]). In the first track is possible to notice a strong style influence. Calypso had another short burst of commercial interest when [[Tim Burton]]'s horror/comedy film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988) was released, and used Belafonte's "[[Jump In The Line (Shake, Senora)|Jump In The Line]]" as the soundtrack´s headliner and also "The Banana Boat Song" in the dinner-party scene. [[Disney]]'s song "[[Under the Sea]]", a calypso theme from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1989 as well as the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media]] in 1991.

'''Carol Nagy Jacklin''' (1939 - 2011) was a developmental psychologist and gender scholar. She was the first woman to be dean of the Division of Social Sciences at the [[University of Southern California]]. She was a Women's Rights activist.

== Education ==
Carol Nagy was born in Chicago, Illinois on February 23, 1939.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marecek|first=Jeanne|last2=Thorne|first2=Barrie|title=Carol Nagy (Jacklin) (1939–2011).|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0030381|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=67|issue=9|pages=802–802|doi=10.1037/a0030381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nagy completed high school in Oak Park.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As Nagy was preparing for college at the University of Wisconsin, she met and married her husband, and transferred to the University of Connecticut.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.feministvoices.com/carol-nagy-jacklin/|title=Carol Nagy Jacklin - Psychology's Feminist Voices|last=George|first=Meghan|website=www.feministvoices.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacklin completed a BA and MA in psychology at the [[University of Connecticut]]. Short on money, Carol Jacklin became a teacher at the University of Connecticut and then San Jose City College.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After attending a psychology conference she realised she wanted to get a PhD in developmental psychology, after which she applied and was accepted for postgraduate studies at Brown University.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She completed her PhD at [[Brown University]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Research ==
Jacklin moved to Stanford, where she completed postdoctoral studies alongside [[Eleanor Maccoby]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jacklin and Maccoby began to observe parent-child interactions, identifying negative portrayals of women in scientific literature. Their research was published in the critically acclaimed 1974 book "''The Psychology of Sex Differences''", which became front page of [[The New York Times Book Review]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1160097|title=The psychology of sex differences|last=1917-|first=Maccoby, Eleanor E.,|date=1974|publisher=Stanford University Press|others=Jacklin, Carol Nagy.|isbn=9780804708593|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=1160097}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 it was a best seller in [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/27/archives/editors-choice-best-seller-list.html|title=Editors' Choice|date=1975-04-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here they dismissed many beliefs about gender differences: that girls are more social than boys, have lower self-esteem and are better at rote learning, arguing that the evidence does not support the existence of gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/435911851|title=Sex, power, conflict : evolutionary and feminist perspectives|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Buss, David M., Malamuth, Neil M.|isbn=0195355997|location=New York|oclc=435911851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Stanford Jacklin became a vocal [[women's rights]] activist, who campaigned against injustices facing women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was a founding member of the [[Clayman Institute for Gender Research]] alongside [[Myra Strober]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/remembering-carol-louise-nagy-jacklin-founding-member-clayman-institute|title=Remembering Carol Louise Nagy (Jacklin), Founding Member of the Clayman Institute {{!}} The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|website=gender.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1983, [[The New York Times]] described her as a "leading expert on gender differences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/20/style/aggression-still-a-stronger-trait-for-males.html|title=Aggression: Still a Stronger Trait for Males|last=Nelson|first=Bryce|date=1983-06-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacklin and Maccoby were two of the first researchers to study the differences between boys’ and girls’ learning.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Jacklin moved to the [[University of Southern California]] in 1983, where she was the first woman to become a tenured psychology professor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was the first woman to be chair of the psychology department in 1990, the first paid chair of the ''Program for the Study of Women and Men in Society'', and the first woman to be appointed Dean of the Division of Social Sciences in 1992.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/997/in-memoriam-carol-nagy-72/|title=In Memoriam: Carol Nagy, 72 &gt; News &gt; USC Dornsife|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Gerald P.|last2=Jacklin|first2=Carol Nagy|date=1988-05-01|title=Changes in sexist attitudes toward women during introductory women's and men's studies courses|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00287964|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=18|issue=9-10|pages=611–622|doi=10.1007/bf00287964|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacklin took leave to work with biologists researching endocrinology at CalTech, and implemented policy change to fairly treat women faculty members and students.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Clandestine chemistry''' is [[chemistry]] carried out in secret, and particularly in [[Illegal drug trade|illegal drug]] [[Laboratory|laboratories]]. Larger labs are usually run by [[gang]]s or [[organized crime]] intending to produce for distribution on the black market. Smaller labs can be run by individual chemists working clandestinely in order to synthesize smaller amounts of controlled substances or simply out of a hobbyist interest in chemistry, often because of the difficulty in ascertaining the purity of other, illegally synthesized drugs obtained on the [[Underground economy|black market]]. The term ''clandestine lab'' is generally used in any situation involving the production of illicit compounds, regardless of whether the facilities being used qualify as a true laboratory.

==History==
Ancient forms of clandestine chemistry included the manufacturing of explosives.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Another old form of clandestine chemistry is the illegal [[brewing]] and [[distillation]] of [[alcohol]]. This is frequently done to avoid taxation on spirits.

From [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|1919]] to [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|1933]], the United States [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibited the sale, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic beverages]]. This opened a door for brewers to supply their own town with alcohol. Just like modern-day drug labs, distilleries were placed in [[rural]] areas. The term ''[[moonshine]]'' generally referred to "corn whiskey", that is, a [[whiskey]]-like liquor made from [[maize|corn]]. Today, American-made corn whiskey can be labeled or sold under [[corn whiskey|that name]], or as [[bourbon whiskey|Bourbon]] or [[Tennessee whiskey]], depending on the details of the production process.

==Precursor chemicals==
Prepared substances (as opposed to those that occur naturally in a consumable form, such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[psilocybin mushrooms]]) require [[reagents]]. Some drugs, like cocaine and morphine, are extracted from plant sources and refined with the aid of chemicals. Semi-synthetic drugs such as [[heroin]] are made starting from [[alkaloid]]s extracted from plant sources which are the precursors for further synthesis. In the case of heroin, a mixture of alkaloids is extracted from the [[opium poppy]] (''Papaver somniferum'') by incising its seed capsule, whereupon a milky fluid (the opium 'latex') bleeds out of the incisions which is then left to dry out and scraped off the bulbs, yielding raw opium. Morphine, one of many alkaloids in opium, is then extracted out of the opium by [[acid-base extraction]] and turned into heroin by reacting it with [[acetic anhydride]]. Other drugs (such as [[methamphetamine]] and [[MDMA]]) are normally made from commercially available chemicals, though both can also be made from naturally occurring precursors. [[Methamphetamine]] can also be made from [[ephedrine]], one of the naturally occurring alkaloids in [[ephedra]] (''Ephedra sinica''). MDMA can be made from [[safrole]], the major constituent of several etheric oils like sassafras. Governments have adopted a strategy of chemical control as part of their overall drug control and enforcement plans. Chemical control offers a means of attacking illicit drug production and disrupting the process before the drugs have entered the market.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Because many legitimate industrial chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia and iodine are also necessary in the processing and synthesis of most illicitly produced drugs, preventing the diversion of these chemicals from legitimate commerce to illicit drug manufacturing is a difficult job. Governments often place restrictions on the purchase of large quantities of chemicals that can be used in the production of illicit drugs, usually requiring licenses or permits to ensure that the purchaser has a legitimate need for them.

==Suppliers of precursor chemicals==
Chemicals critical to the production of cocaine, heroin, and synthetic drugs are produced in many countries throughout the world. Many manufacturers and suppliers exist in Europe, China, India, the United States, and a host of other countries.

Historically, chemicals critical to the synthesis or manufacture of illicit drugs are introduced into various venues via legitimate purchases by companies that are registered and licensed to do business as chemical importers or handlers. Once in a country or state, the chemicals are diverted by rogue importers or chemical companies, by criminal organizations and individual violators, or acquired as a result of coercion and/or theft on the part of drug traffickers. In response to stricter international controls, drug traffickers have increasingly been forced to divert chemicals by mislabeling the containers, forging documents, establishing front companies, using circuitous routing, hijacking shipments, bribing officials, or smuggling products across international borders.

The Multilateral Chemical Reporting Initiative encourages governments to exchange information on a voluntary basis in order to monitor international chemical shipments.&lt;ref name="INCB1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Board|first1=INCB - International Narcotics Control|title=Precursors and chemicals frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances : report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 1997 on the implementation of Article 12 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988.|date=1998|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=92-1-148105-8|pages=8–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3PCAwn7oS0C&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–9}} Over the past decade, key international bodies like the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the U.N. General Assembly's Special Session (UNGASS) have addressed the issue of chemical diversion in conjunction with U.S. efforts.&lt;ref name="INCB1998"/&gt;{{rp|9, 67–74}} These organizations raised specific concerns about [[potassium permanganate]] and acetic anhydride.&lt;ref name="World2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=UNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME Vienna|title=World Drug Report 2014|date=2014|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=978-92-1-148277-5|pages=xiv, 68|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2014/World_Drug_Report_2014_web.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate the international flow of information about precursor chemicals, the United States, through its relationship with the Inter-American Drug Control Abuse Commission (CICAD), continues to evaluate the use of precursor chemicals and assist countries in strengthening controls.&lt;ref name="INCB1998"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Many nations still lack the capacity to determine whether the import or export of precursor chemicals is related to legitimate needs or illicit drugs. The problem is complicated by the fact that many chemical shipments are either brokered or transshipped through third countries in an attempt to disguise their purpose or destination.&lt;ref name="UNStrategy2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=The National Drug Control Strategy: 2000 Annual Report|date=2000|publisher=White House, Office of National Drug Control Policy|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in July 2001, the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) has opted to organize an international conference with the goal of devising a specific action plan to counter the traffic in MDMA precursor chemicals.&lt;ref name="Report2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=REPORT  2015 International Narcotics Control Board|title=Report  2015|date=2 March 2016|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.incb.org/documents/Publications/AnnualReports/AR2015/English/AR_2015_E.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}} They hope to prevent the diversion of chemicals used in the production of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), including [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) and [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="Report2015"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

In June 2015, the European Commission approved Regulation (EU) 2015/1013 which outlined for the monitoring of drug precursors traded between the Union and third countries. The Regulation also establishes uniform procedures for licensing and registration of operators and users who are listed in a European database tracking drug precursors.&lt;ref name="Report2015"/&gt;{{rp|88}}

Despite this long history of law enforcement actions, restrictions of chemicals, and even covert military actions, many illicit drugs are still widely available all over the world.

===Cocaine===
Operation Purple is a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] driven international chemical control initiative designed to reduce the illicit manufacture of [[cocaine]] in the Andean Region, identifying rogue firms and suspect individuals; gathering intelligence on diversion methods, trafficking trends, and shipping routes; and taking administrative, civil and/or criminal action as appropriate. Critical to the success of this operation is the communication network that gives notification of shipments and provides the government of the importer sufficient time to verify the legitimacy of the transaction and take appropriate action. The effects of this initiative have been dramatic and far-reaching. Operation Purple has exposed a significant vulnerability among traffickers, and has grown to include almost thirty nations. According to the DEA, Operation Purple has been highly effective at interfering with cocaine production. However, illicit chemists always find new methods to evade the DEA's scrutiny.

In countries where strict chemical controls have been put in place, illicit drug production has been seriously affected. For example, few of the chemicals needed to process coca leaf into cocaine are manufactured in Bolivia or Peru. Most are smuggled in from neighbouring countries with advanced chemical industries or diverted from a smaller number of licit handlers. Increased interdiction of chemicals in Peru and Bolivia has contributed to final product cocaine from those countries being of lower, minimally oxidized quality.

As a result, Bolivian lab operators are now using inferior substitutes such as cement instead of lime and [[sodium bicarbonate]] instead of [[ammonia]] and recycled solvents like ether. Some non-solvent fuels such as [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]] and [[diesel fuel]] are even used in place of solvents. 
Manufacturers are attempting to streamline a production process that virtually eliminates oxidation to produce cocaine base. Some laboratories are not using sulfuric acid during the maceration state; consequently, less cocaine alkaloid is extracted from the leaf, producing less cocaine hydrochloride, the powdered cocaine marketed for overseas consumption.

===Heroin===
Similarly, heroin-producing countries depend on supplies of [[acetic anhydride]] (AA) from the international market. This heroin precursor continues to account for the largest volume of internationally seized chemicals, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. Since July 1999, there have been several notable seizures of acetic anhydride in Turkey (amounting to nearly seventeen metric tons) and Turkmenistan (totaling seventy-three metric tons).

Acetic anhydride, the most commonly used chemical agent in [[heroin]] processing, is virtually irreplaceable. According to the DEA, Mexico remains the only heroin source route to heroin laboratories in Afghanistan. Authorities in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan routinely seize ton-quantity shipments of diverted acetic anhydride.

The lack of acetic anhydride has caused clandestine chemists in some countries to substitute it for lower quality precursors such as [[acetic acid]] and results in the formation of impure [[black tar heroin]] that contains a mixture of drugs not found in heroin made with pure chemicals.

DEA's Operation Topaz is a coordinated international strategy targeting acetic anhydride. In place since March 2001, a total of thirty-one countries are currently organized participants in the program in addition to regional participants. The DEA reports that as of June 2001, some 125 consignments of acetic anhydride had been tracked totaling 618,902,223 kilograms. As of July 2001, there has been approximately 20 shipments of AA totaling 185,000 kilograms either stopped or seized.

===Amphetamines===

The practice of clandestine chemistry to synthesize [[controlled substance]] analogues and circumvent drug laws was first noticed in the late 1960s, as types of drugs became [[controlled substance]]s in many countries.&lt;ref name="Karch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karch|first1=Steven B.|title=Drug abuse handbook|date=2006|publisher=CRC/Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9780849316906|page=4|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFbm2SRUUNsC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of October 27, 1970 [[amphetamines]] became controlled substances in the United States.&lt;ref name="Controlled Substances Act"&gt;{{cite web | title=Controlled Substances Act | url=http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm | work=United States Food and Drug Administration | date=11 June 2009 | accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleiman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kleiman|first1=Mark A.R.|last2=Hawdon|first2=James E.|title=Encyclopedia of drug policy|date=2011|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc|location=Thousand Oaks|isbn=978-1412976954|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OePnCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bzptablet.jpg|right|thumb|An impure tablet sold as MDMA seized by law enforcement in the United States. The tablet was determined to contain no MDMA; instead, it contained a mixture of [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[caffeine]].]]
As of the early 1990s, [[methamphetamine]] use was concentrated among young white males in California and nearby states. Since then its use has spread both demographically and geographically.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dobkin|first1=Carlos|last2=Nicosia|first2=Nancy|title=The War on Drugs: Methamphetamine, Public Health, and Crime|journal=American Economic Review|date=February 2009|volume=99|issue=1|pages=324–349|doi=10.1257/aer.99.1.324|pmc=2883188|pmid=20543969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methamphetamine has been a favorite among various populations including [[biker gang|motorcycle gangs]],&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt; truckers,&lt;ref name="Garriott"/&gt; laborers, soldiers, and [[rave]]rs.&lt;ref name="Pine"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cansler|first1=Clay|first2=Jason|last2=Pine|title=Making sense of making meth|journal=Distillations|date=2015|volume=1|issue=4|pages=36–39 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/making-sense-of-making-meth|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as a "[[club drug]]", the National Institute on Drug Abuse tracks its incidence of use in children as young as twelve, and the prevalence of users increases with age.&lt;ref name="Club"&gt;{{cite web|title=Club Drugs|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/club-drugs|website=National Institute on Drug Abuse|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and early 1990s, most methamphetamine production in the United States occurred in small independent laboratories.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt; [[Phenylacetone]], one precursor of methamphetamine, became a [[List of Schedule II drugs (US)|Schedule II controlled immediate precursor]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEPARTMENT OF LICENSING AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS  BOARD OF PHARMACY  PHARMACY – CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES|url=http://w3.lara.state.mi.us/orrsearch/1478_2014-140LR_AdminCode.pdf|website=Michigan.gov|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Underground [[chemist]]s searched for alternative methods for producing methamphetamine. The two predominant methods which appeared both involve the reduction of [[ephedrine]] or [[pseudoephedrine]] to methamphetamine.&lt;ref name="Wallach"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallach|first1=Jason|title=A Comprehensive Guide to the Clandestine Chemistry of 'Breaking Bad'|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-clandestine-chemistry-of-breaking-bad|website=Motherboard|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, neither was a [[watched chemical]], and pills containing the substance could be bought by the thousands without raising any kind of suspicion.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt;

In the 1990s, the DEA recognized that legally imported precursors were being diverted to the production of methamphetamine.  Changes to federal regulations in 1988 and throughout the 1990s enabled the DEA to more closely track the  ephedrine and pseudoephedrine precursors.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt; Many individual States have enacted precursor control laws which limit the sale of over-the-counter cold medications which contain ephedrine or pseudoephedrine.&lt;ref name="NAMSDL"&gt;{{cite web|title=States That Schedule Ephedrine|url=http://www.namsdl.org/library/80C5FDEA-1C23-D4F9-74225C89E6806A41/|website=THE NATIONAL ALLI ANCE FOR MODEL STATE DRUG LAWS|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it somewhat more difficult for underground chemists to produce methamphetamine.  In May 1995, the DEA shut down two major suppliers of precursors in the United States, seizing 25 metric tons of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine from Clifton Pharmaceuticals and 500 cases of pseudoephedrine from X-Pressive Looks, Inc. (XLI).  The immediate market impact suggests that they had been providing more than 50 percent of the precursors used nationally to produce methamphetamine. However, the market rapidly rebounded.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt;

The methamphetamine situation also changed in the mid-1990s as Mexican organized crime became a major player in its production and distribution, operating "super-labs" which produced a substantial percentage of the drugs being sold.&lt;ref name="Dobkin"/&gt; According to the DEA, the seizure of 3.5 metric tons of [[pseudoephedrine]] in Texas in 1994 revealed that Mexican trafficking groups were producing methamphetamine on an unprecedented scale.&lt;ref name="NDCP2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Programs and Initiatives  6. REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF ILLEGAL DRUGS|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ondcppubs/publications/policy/ndcs01/chap3_6.html|website=The National Drug Control Strategy: 2001 Annual Report|publisher=Office of National Drug Control Policy|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent reports indicate an ongoing presence of Mexican trafficking.&lt;ref name="NDIC2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Methamphetamine Threat Assessment 2008|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs26/26594/strat.htm|website=National Drug Intelligence Center|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the prevalence of domestic meth labs continues to be high in western states, they have spread throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="NDCP2001"/&gt; It has been suggested that "do-it-yourself" meth production in rural areas is reflective of a broader DIY approach that includes activities such as hunting, fishing, and fixing one’s cars, trucks, equipment, and house.&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt; Toxic chemicals resulting from methamphetamine production may be hoarded or clandestinely dumped, damaging land, water, plant life and wild life, and posing a risk to humans.&lt;ref name="NDCP2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt;  Waste from methamphetamine labs is frequently dumped on federal, public, and tribal lands. The chemicals involved can explode and clandestine chemistry has been implicated in both house and wild land fires.&lt;ref name="NDCP2001"/&gt;

Statistics reporting the prevalence of meth labs and arrest of meth producers can vary greatly from county to county and state to state. Factors affecting policing and reporting include funding, specialized training, support from local residents, willingness to make the issue a priority in policing. How information is categorized and tracked may also inflate or minimize the apparent results. [[Missouri]], which has tended to report some of the highest numbers of meth-lab arrests in the country, has pursued an aggressive and highly publicized policing policy, resulting in as many as 205 cases a year in one county.&lt;ref name="Pine"/&gt; In contrast, [[West Virginia]] tends to report and prosecute very few cases, possibly because there the agency that reports a meth lab is held responsible for paying for its cleanup. Cleanup of toxic and hazardous materials at a single site may cost tens of thousands of dollars. This is a disincentive for agencies with limited budgets.&lt;ref name="Garriott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garriott|first1=William|title=Policing methamphetamine : narcopolitics in rural America|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814732403|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michigan]] reported an increase in incidents in 2016, following the formation of the Midland County Methamphetamine Protocol Team in 2015. Many of the cases reported involved meth users who were making small amounts of the drug in a simple "one-pot method" for both personal use and sale to others.&lt;ref name="Waterman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waterman|first1=Cole|title=Meth busts double, from 28 to 64, in one year in Great Lakes Bay Region|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/08/police_meth_busts_double_from.html|accessdate=10 January 2017|work=Michigan News|date=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] El Paso Intelligence Center data is showing a downward trend in the number of clandestine drug labs seized for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine down from a high of 15,196 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Methamphetamine Lab Incidents, 2004-2014|url=https://www.dea.gov/resource-center/meth-lab-maps.shtml|accessdate=10 January 2017|work=DEA Drug Enforcement Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seizures"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meth lab seizures down in 2012|url=http://www.twincities.com/2013/09/11/apnewsbreak-meth-lab-seizures-down-in-2012/amp/|accessdate=10 January 2017|work=Pioneer Press|date=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug seizure quantities, on the other hand, are steadily increasing since 2007, according to data from the DEA's System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) (see table to the right). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=71|author=PARLIAMENT OF VICTORIA LAW REFORM, DRUGS AND CRIME PREVENTION COMMITTEE|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1433_inquiry.pdf|website=Law Reform, Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee|publisher=Melbourne, Victoria|date=2014|title=INQUIRY INTO THE SUPPLY AND USE OF METHAMPHETAMINES, PARTICULARLY ICE, IN VICTORIA Final Report }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleanup===
Clean up processes were regulated by the EPA as of 2007.&lt;ref name="Cleanup"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary Guidelines for Methamphetamine Laboratory Cleanup|url=https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/voluntary-guidelines-methamphetamine-laboratory-cleanup|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007 required EPA to develop guidelines for remediation of former methamphetamine labs. This creates guidelines for States and local agencies to improve "our national understanding of identifying the point at which former methamphetamine laboratories become clean enough to inhabit again." The legislation also required that EPA periodically update the guidelines, as appropriate, to reflect the best available knowledge and research.
 		
Making a former meth lab site safer for habitation requires two basic efforts:
 		
Gross chemical removal: This is the process in which law enforcement or a Drug Enforcement Administration contractors removes the obvious dangers from the site. Obvious dangers include containers of chemicals, equipment, and apparatus that could be used to make illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, and other illegal items. This process does not cleanup or remove chemical spills, stains or residue that could be harmful to inhabitants. A property that has had only a gross chemical removal is not fit for habitation. 
 		
Clandestine Remediation: The cleaning of interior structures and, if applicable, the surrounding land, surface waters and groundwater by an EPA approved or National Crime Scene Clean Up Association certified company. This is the process of removing the residue and waste from the site after the gross chemical removal is done. A property that has been re-mediated should present minimal to no health risk to occupants.

==Explosives==
Clandestine chemistry is not limited to [[recreational drug use|drugs]]; it is also associated with [[explosives]], and other illegal chemicals. Of the explosives manufactured illegally, [[nitroglycerin]] and [[acetone peroxide]] are easiest to produce due to the ease with which the precursors can be acquired.

[[Uncle Fester (author)|Uncle Fester]] is a writer who commonly writes about different aspects of clandestine chemistry. ''Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture'' is among one of his most popular books, and is considered required reading for DEA Agents. More of his books deal with other aspects of clandestine chemistry, including explosives, and poisons. Fester is, however, considered by many to be a faulty and unreliable source for information in regard to the clandestine manufacture of chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

{{Nihongo|'''''Clannad'''''|クラナド|Kuranado}} is a Japanese [[visual novel]] developed by [[Key (company)|Key]] and released on April 28, 2004 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[Personal computer|PCs]]. While both of Key's first two previous works, ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' and ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', had been released first as [[Eroge|adult games]] and then censored for the younger market, ''Clannad'' was released with a rating for all ages. It was later [[Porting|ported]] to the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Vita]] and [[PlayStation 4]] consoles. An English version for Windows was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] by [[Sekai Project]] in 2015. The story follows the life of [[List of Clannad characters#Tomoya Okazaki|Tomoya Okazaki]], an average high school student who meets many people in his last year at school, including five girls, and helps resolve their individual problems.

The [[gameplay]] of ''Clannad'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the [[player character]]. The game was ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Key went on to produce an adult [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] titled ''[[Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life]]'' in November 2005, which expanded on the scenario of [[List of Clannad characters#Tomoyo Sakagami|Tomoyo Sakagami]], one of the five heroines from ''Clannad''.

''Clannad'' has made several transitions to other media. There have been four [[manga]] adaptations published by [[ASCII Media Works]], [[Flex Comix]], [[Fujimi Shobo]] and [[Jive (publisher)|Jive]]. [[Comic anthology|Comic anthologies]], [[light novel]]s and [[art book]]s have also been published, as have [[audio drama]]s and several albums of music. An animated film by [[Toei Animation]] was released in September 2007, followed by two [[anime]] series including two [[original video animation]] (OVA) episodes by [[Kyoto Animation]] produced between 2007 and 2009. Both anime series and their accompanying OVAs are licensed by [[Sentai Filmworks]] and were released in North America in 2009. The animated adaptations have received high sales figures in Japan as well as critical acclaim abroad.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Nagisa Furukawa Key screenshot.png|thumb|200px|left|Average dialogue and narrative in ''Clannad'' depicting the main character Tomoya talking to Nagisa.]]
''Clannad'' is a [[drama]] and [[Romance (love)|romance]] [[visual novel]] in which the player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki. Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. ''Clannad'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings; depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, five which are initially available.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Clannad|developer=[[Key (company)|Key]]|publisher=[[VisualArt's]]|platform=[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices to change the plot progression.

When first playing the game, the scenarios for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios are available in what is called the School Life [[story arc]]. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an [[Orb (optics)|orb]] of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt; To view the true ending of ''Clannad'', all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.&lt;ref name="fan-book" /&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting and themes===
The first half of the story takes place primarily at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the bakery run by Nagisa's parents, and the dormitory where [[List of Clannad characters#Youhei Sunohara|Youhei Sunohara]] lives. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt; While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can infer that the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the many companies and establishments that share this name.

There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. The main theme is the value of having a family, as the title of the series implies because the main scenario writer [[Jun Maeda]] mistakenly thought the name of the [[Clannad|Irish band Clannad]] meant "clan" or "family" in [[Irish language|Irish]].&lt;ref name="pre-Clannad"&gt;{{cite book|title=pre-Clannad|publisher=[[SoftBank|SoftBank Creative]]|isbn=4-7973-2723-5|id={{ASIN|4797327235|country=jp}}|date=April 15, 2004|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the six main characters, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Kotomi have no siblings, though their parents are major factors in their stories. Nagisa's story was written to incorporate what Maeda described as a "perfect family" with a focus on mental consciousness.&lt;ref name="fan-book" /&gt; In Nagisa's story, there is a recurring appearance of {{Nihongo|"The Big [[Dango]] Family"|だんご大家族|Dango Daikazoku}} (a fictional group [[mascot]] for children) that Nagisa is fond of.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt; Tomoya's and Nagisa's characters were written in a style to exemplify a "growth to adulthood" by the end of the story.&lt;ref name="fan-book" /&gt; Fuko's and Kyou's stories have their sisters playing an integral part, and Tomoyo's story is influenced by her entire family.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt; A minor motif of Irish words continues with the opening theme of the game, "[[Mag Mell]]", which means roughly "plain of joy" and is connected with Irish mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=MacKillop, James|title=Dictionary of Celtic Mythology|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-860967-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arrangement|arrange]] album, a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game, that was bundled with the original game release was titled ''[[Mabinogion|Mabinogi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.product.co.jp/?enter=1&amp;page=1&amp;id=159|title=''Clannad'' PC limited edition official listing|publisher=[[VisualArt's]]|accessdate=June 6, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a collection of [[prose]] stories from [[medieval]] [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guest, Lady Charlotte|title=The Mabinogion|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1997|isbn=0-486-29541-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main characters===
{{main article|List of Clannad characters}}
The player assumes the role of [[List of Clannad characters#Tomoya Okazaki|Tomoya Okazaki]], the protagonist of ''Clannad''. Tomoya has been labeled a [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquent]]; at the beginning of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where ''Clannad'' is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he comes off as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt;

Tomoya meets [[Nagisa Furukawa]], the main heroine of ''Clannad'', at the onset of the story. Nagisa is a shy girl who has an illness which causes her to rely on those around her for support. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as [[anpan]]. [[Kyou Fujibayashi]], another of ''Clannad''{{'s}} heroines, is a loud, aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a more subdued side, especially towards her younger [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twin]] sister [[List of Clannad characters#Ryou Fujibayashi|Ryou Fujibayashi]].&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt;

Tomoya meets a [[genius]] girl named [[List of Clannad characters#Kotomi Ichinose|Kotomi Ichinose]], one day in the school library. She is ranked in the top 10 throughout the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a quiet girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading, even if they make loud disturbances around her. ''Clannad''{{'s}} fourth heroine is a second-year student named [[List of Clannad characters#Tomoyo Sakagami|Tomoyo Sakagami]] who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo is known to be a strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is athletic. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt; Tomoyo appears in Key's fifth game, ''[[Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life]]'', as the main heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/product/tomoyo/character/|title=''Tomoyo After'' official character bios|publisher=[[Key (company)|Key]]|accessdate=May 29, 2009|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last heroine in ''Clannad'' is a first-year student named [[Fuko Ibuki]] who is eccentric and childish, before she met Tomoya, was generally seen alone by herself making wood carvings of [[starfish]] with a small knife to give to others as presents. Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish, or things that are star-shaped, and will often go into short [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt;

===Story===
''Clannad''{{'s}} story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year high school student who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to [[alcoholism|alcohol]] and [[Problem gambling|gambling]], and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him to distance himself from others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.

The story opens on Monday April 14, 2003 at the beginning of the school year,&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt; when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a soft-spoken girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems.

====After Story====
In the second part of the story, which starts immediately after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa's illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter [[List of Clannad characters#Ushio Okazaki|Ushio]], she [[Maternal mortality in fiction|dies]], which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He is barely able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa's parents, [[List of Clannad characters#Akio Furukawa|Akio]] and [[List of Clannad characters#Sanae Furukawa|Sanae]], take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with [[List of Clannad characters#Shino Okazaki|Shino Okazaki]], his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father's traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya's current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her—Tomoya even quits his job—but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after.

Tomoya's psychology is developed in his dreams of a bleak world, called the {{Nihongo|Illusionary World|幻想世界|Gensō Sekai}}, where small orbs of light float around. In the first few dreams, he sees a world devoid of all life, except for one girl. Each time he dreams, he finds out more about the world. Tomoya discovers that the girl has a special ability to fuse junk together to create new things, which she uses to create a body for him. Over time, Tomoya comes to the conclusion that only the two of them are "alive". To pass time, Tomoya and the girl try to build another doll with more junk they find, but as it has no soul, it fails to come to life. Remembering the distant world where he came from, Tomoya convinces the girl to build a ship so that the two can escape the approaching winter and continue to live a happy life. Eventually, winter sets in, and the girl becomes cold to the point where she cannot move any more. The girl tells Tomoya that he has another chance to go back and make things right. To do so, he must collect certain "lights" (symbols of happiness) similar to those floating around in the Illusionary World. If all the "lights" are collected throughout both story parts, a chance to save Nagisa from dying will become available, as well as the true ending, where she survives and lives with Tomoya and Ushio.

==Development==
The executive producer for ''Clannad'' was Takahiro Baba from [[VisualArt's]],&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt; the publishing company which controls Key. [[Jun Maeda]], who was one of three main scenario writers with Kai, and [[Yūichi Suzumoto]], led the planning for ''Clannad'' and wrote the majority of the scenarios. Scenario assistance was provided by Tōya Okano. [[Itaru Hinoue]] headed the art direction, and also worked on the character design.&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=3454|title=Clannad staff information|publisher=ErogameScape|accessdate=June 8, 2007|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719141645/http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=3454|archivedate=July 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miracle Mikipon, Mochisuke, [[Na-Ga]], and Shinory supplemented the [[computer graphics]]. Torino provided the background art.&lt;ref name="Clannad-VN" /&gt; The game's music was [[composer|composed]] by Maeda, [[Shinji Orito]], and [[Magome Togoshi]].&lt;ref name="staff" /&gt;

For Key's second visual novel ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', Maeda admitted he felt he was able to write what he wanted to for the game's scenario, but he later discovered that ''Air'' was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key's next work ''Clannad'', he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on ''Clannad'' almost immediately after ''Air''{{'}}s completion. From the start of ''Clannad''{{'}}s planning, Maeda did not want to write a story like in ''Air'', but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the 'people and the town', and 'humanity'.&lt;ref name="fan-book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Clannad Visual Fan Book|publisher=[[Enterbrain]]|year=2004|isbn=978-4-7577-2025-1|id={{ASIN|4757720254|country=jp}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in ''Clannad'', and equates ''Clannad''{{'}}s writing process as a "wall that I will never be able to get over again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011213916/http://gs.dengekinet.com/ranking/maker.html |url=http://gs.dengeki.com/ranking/maker.html |title=Jun Maeda comments on ''Clannad''{{'}}s popularity |publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]] |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |accessdate=October 25, 2008 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game's base scenario which caused the 'branch' scenarios to increase as well.&lt;ref name="fan-book" /&gt;

There were more concerns about ''Clannad'' being similar to ''Air''. When Nagisa's scenario was being written, there were some disputes concerning the length of her scenario, and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine. Some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how ''Air'' was structured with the overall focus on [[Air (visual novel)#Main characters|Misuzu Kamio]]. Takahiro Baba, the company president of VisualArt's, is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters' scenarios, but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game's evaluation by players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different, and thought the end result was a good one. Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc, mainly a continuation of Nagisa's scenario, would eclipse the entire game's scenario, much like what happened with ''Air'' according to Maeda. In order to prevent the same thing happening in ''Clannad'', Maeda focused on making the first half of the story, the School Life arc, just as enjoyable by making it long and heart-breaking.&lt;ref name="fan-book" /&gt; ''Clannad'' is Key's second longest work, as reported by [[Yūto Tonokawa]] where he stated that ''Clannad'' is about 4,000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game ''[[Little Busters!|Little Busters! Ecstasy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= [[Yūto Tonokawa]]|url= http://key.visualarts.gr.jp/diary/2008/06/post_22.html|title=''Little Busters EX'' Development Journal|publisher=[[Key (company)|Key]]|date=June 26, 2008|accessdate=August 16, 2008|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He praised the second half of the season as "the best-written quarter of ''Clannad''," stating that it "effectively builds up and delivers its emotional appeal, reinforces the series' central theme (i.e. the importance of family), and peaks visually," and concluding that "only the most cynical of souls will avoid shedding at least a few tears at certain points."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Clannad After Story Sub.DVD 2 - Collection 2|author=Theron Martin|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/clannad-after-story/sub.dvd-2|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[DVD Talk]] website, the reviewer Todd Douglass Jr. gave ''Clannad After Story'' a "Highly Recommended" rating, stating that "the range of emotions ''Clannad'' takes you through is quite daunting. It's charming, cute, hilarious, mysterious, and tragic all at the same time. Few shows are as memorable, and few are this good for this long." He concludes that the storytelling is "heartfelt" and "memorable in so many ways," and that "few shows rise to the levels this one does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clannad: After Story - Collection 2|author=Todd Douglass Jr.|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|date=December 8, 2009|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/40990/clannad-after-story-collection-2/|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ASCII Media Works]] and Vridge produced the PlayStation 2 visual novel {{Nihongo|''Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Cosplay Hajimemashita''|乃木坂春香の秘密 こすぷれ、はじめました♥||lit. ''Haruka Nogizaka's Secret: Cosplaying Has Begun''}} based on the [[light novel]] series ''[[Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu]]''. Released in September 2008, the game features the series' characters [[cosplay]]ing in various costumes either depicting characters from five popular light novel series published by ASCII Media Works, or three ''Clannad'' heroines. [[Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu#Main characters|Haruka Nogizaka]] can cosplay as Kotomi Ichinose, [[Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu#Nogizaka family|Mika Nogizaka]] can cosplay as Nagisa Furukawa (albeit with long hair), and [[Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu#Classmates and teachers|Shiina Amamiya]] can cosplay as Tomoyo Sakagami.&lt;ref name="nogizaka1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.dengeki.com/elem/000/000/103/103016/|title=Other Works' Costumes Appearing in ''Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu''!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17616">The '''Creoles of color''' are a historic ethnic group of [[Creole peoples|Creole people]] that developed in the former French and Spanish colonies of [[Louisiana]] (especially in the city of [[New Orleans]]), Southern Mississippi, Alabama, and Northwestern Florida in what is now the United States. French colonists in Louisiana first used the term "Creole" to refer to whites born in the colony, rather than in France. It was also used for slaves born in the colony.

But as a group of [[mixed-race]] people developed from unions between Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans, the term Creoles of color was applied to them. In some cases, white fathers would free their concubines and children, forming a class of ''Gens de couleur libres'' ([[free people of color]]). The French and Spanish gave them more rights than the slaves.

==History==
[[File:George Herriman and fans.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Creole cartoonist [[George Herriman]]]]
[[Mixed-race]] Creoles of color became identified as a distinct ethnic group, ''[[Gens de couleur libres]]'' ([[free persons of color]]), prior to the 19th century. During [[History of Louisiana|Louisiana's]] colonial period, ''Créole'' referred to people born in Louisiana whose ancestors had come from elsewhere; i.e., all natives other than [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. The term ''Créole'' was first used by French colonists to distinguish themselves from foreign-born settlers, and later as distinct from [[English American|Anglo-American]] settlers. Colonial documents show that the term ''Créole'' was used variously at different times to refer to [[white people]], [[mixed-race]] people, and [[black people]], including slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color''. Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73. {{ISBN|9780807126011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Creoles of color were free, and their descendants often enjoyed many of the same privileges that whites did, including (but not limited to) property ownership, formal education, and service in the militia. During the [[antebellum South|antebellum]] period, their society was structured along class lines and they tended to marry within their group. While it was not illegal, it was a social taboo for Creoles of color to marry slaves and it was a rare occurrence. Some of the wealthier and prosperous Creoles of color owned slaves themselves. Other Creoles of color, such as [[Thomy Lafon]], used their social position to support the abolitionist cause.

Another Creole of color, wealthy planter [[Francis E. Dumas]], emancipated all of his slaves in 1863 and organized them into a company in the Second Regiment of the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|Louisiana Native Guards]], in which he served as an officer.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Elizabeth Thompson, ''Exiles at Home: The Struggle to Become American in Creole New Orleans'', Harvard University Press, 2009, pg. 162. {{ISBN|9780674023512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians suggest that New Orleans was the cradle of the civil rights movement in the United States, due to the earliest efforts of Creoles to integrate the military ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=Louisiana's Free People of Color-Digitization Grant-letter in support|url=https://www.academia.edu/3505760/Louisianas_Free_People_of_Color-Digitization_grant_awarded_to_LSU_Hill_library_others|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creoles of Color had been members of the militia for decades under both French and Spanish control of the colony of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]. For example, around 80 free Creoles of Color were recruited into the militia that participated in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Battle of Baton Rouge]] in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gayarré, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk4TAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+Louisiana:+The+Spanish+Domination+1867&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqh6GrpPPdAhXqg1QKHRSvBVwQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false History of Louisiana: The Spanish Domination]'', William J. Widdleton, 1867, pp 126-132. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States made the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and acquired the large territory west of the Mississippi, the Creoles of color in New Orleans volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to their new country. They also took an oath of loyalty to [[William C. C. Claiborne]], the Louisiana Territorial Governor appointed by President [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Clarence|title=The Territorial Papers of the United States, Vol. IX, The Territory of Orleans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvE8AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Territorial+Papers+of+the+United+States+carter+1940&amp;dq=The+Territorial+Papers+of+the+United+States+carter+1940&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBjoHWpPPdAhU5GDQIHURED8YQ6AEIKTAA|year=1940|page=174}} {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Months after the colony became part of the United States, Claiborne's administration was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the U.S.; integration in the military by incorporating entire units of previously established "colored" militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=1811 Slave Uprising, etc|url=https://www.academia.edu/1910804/Gov._Claiborne_in_his_own_words--a_salon_publique_at_Pitot_House_Bayou_St._John|work=Salon Publique, Pitot House, November 7, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a February 20, 1804 letter, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn wrote to Claiborne saying, "…it would be prudent not to increase the Corps, but to diminish, if it could be done without giving offense…" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Dunbar|title=Official Letter Books of W.C.C.

This was the commencement of the [[Battle of New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=1811 Slave Uprising-Governor on Trial: Claiborne in His Own Words|url=https://www.academia.edu/1910804/Gov._Claiborne_in_his_own_words--a_salon_publique_at_Pitot_House_Bayou_St._John|work=Salon Publique, Pitot House, November 7, 2011, pp. 11-13|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Louisiana Purchase]], many Creoles of color lost their favorable social status, despite their service to the militia and their social status prior to the U.S. takeover. The territory and New Orleans became the destination of many migrants from the United States, as well as new immigrants. Migrants from the South imposed their [[binary slave society system|caste system]]. In this new caste system, all people with African ancestry or visible African features were classified as black, and therefore categorized as second class citizens, regardless of their education, property ownership, or previous status in French society. Former free Creoles of Color were relegated to the ranks of [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipated slaves]]. 

With the advantage of having been better educated than the new [[freedman|freedmen]], many Creoles of color were active in the struggle for [[civil rights]] and served in political office during Reconstruction, helping to bring freedmen into the political system.&lt;ref&gt;Kathe Managan, [http://www.lameca.org/dossiers/new_orleans_creole/eng/p2.htm The Creole Community and the Struggle for Civil Rights], lameca.org, Accessed November 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Fairclough, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QnQbw5EyPREC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Race%20%26%20Democracy%3A%20The%20Civil%20Rights%20Struggle%20in%20Louisiana%2C%201915-1972&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Race &amp; Democracy: The Civil Rights Struggle in Louisiana, 1915-1972], University of Georgia Press, 2008, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt; During late [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], white Democrats regained political control of state legislatures across the former Confederate states by intimidation of blacks and other Republicans at the polls. Through the late nineteenth century, they worked to impose white supremacy under [[Jim Crow]] laws and customs. They [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchised]] the majority of blacks, especially by creating barriers to voter registration through devices such as poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, etc., stripping African Americans, including Creoles of color, of political power.

Creoles of color were among the African Americans who were limited when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the case of ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' in 1896, deciding that "separate but equal" accommodations were constitutional. It permitted states to impose Jim Crow rules on federal railways and later interstate buses.

Finally, more than a century later, social change had reversed much of its two-century eclipse. On June 14, 2013 Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal signed into law Act 276, creating the "prestige" license plate stating "I'm Creole", in honor of the Creoles' contributions, culture, and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=13RS&amp;b=HB147&amp;sbi=y]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the term [[Louisiana Creole people]], or Creole, generally refers to people of mixed-race and descendants of the early Catholic culture.

==Contribution to the arts==

===Music===
[[File:Bechet.gif|thumb|right|200px|Creole jazz musician [[Sidney Bechet]], a virtuoso on the [[soprano saxophone]]]]
Some Creoles of color trained as classical musicians in 19th-century Louisiana. These musicians would often study with those associated with the French Opera House; some traveled to [[Paris]] to complete their studies. Creole composers of that time are discussed in ''[[Music and Some Highly Musical People]]'' by [[James Monroe Trotter]], and ''Nos Hommes et Notre Histoire'' by [[Rodolphe Desdunes|Rodolphe Lucien Desdunes]].

[[File:CrossingTheWater.jpg|thumb|First edition (UK)]]
'''''Crossing the Water''''' is a 1971 posthumous collection of poetry by [[Sylvia Plath]] that was prepared for publication by [[Ted Hughes]]. These are transitional poems that were written along with the poems that appear in her poetic opus, ''Ariel''. The collection was published in the United Kingdom by Faber &amp; Faber (1975) and in the United States by Harper &amp; Row (1976).

The poems here tend to dwell on one's state of being in an environment. "Wuthering Heights," for example, details a walk that Plath takes along the Yorkshire moors where [[Emily Brontë]] once trekked, Finisterre is a stormy island where Plath and her family once visited and "Among the Narcissi" describes Plath's similarities at being among asexual vegetation.

==Overview==
{{Medref|section|date=August 2017}}
DSDs are medical conditions involving the way the reproductive system develops from infancy (and before birth) through young adulthood. There are several types of DSDs and their effect on the external and internal reproductive organs varies greatly.

A frequently-used social and medical adjective for people with DSDs is "intersex".&lt;ref name="un-2016"&gt;{{Cite| last1 = UN Committee against Torture | author1-link = United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture | last2 = UN Committee on the Rights of the Child | author2-link = Committee on the Rights of the Child  | last3 = UN Committee on the Rights of People with Disabilities | author3-link = Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | last4 = UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment | last5 = Juan Méndez, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment | author5-link = Juan E.

This helps reduce confusion about the differences between being intersex, being transgender, and being gay/lesbian.

The most common DSD is [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), which results in a person with female (XX) chromosomes having genitals that look somewhat masculine. In mild cases, CAH results in a slightly enlarged clitoris, while in more severe cases it can be difficult to decide on observation whether a baby is male or female (ambiguous genitalia). CAH is caused by a problem with the adrenal glands and is usually treated by taking a daily medication to replace or supplement the missing adrenal hormones. (When this adrenal problem occurs in people with male (XY) chromosomes, the result is over-masculinization and premature puberty).

Another common DSD is [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS),also known as testicular feminising syndrome in which a person with male (XY) chromosomes does not respond to testosterone in the usual way. This results in a body that to some degree has a feminine appearance. In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) the result is a totally feminine appearance, including typical female breast development. Consequently, most young women with CAIS are unaware of their condition until the early teen years when they fail to menstruate. In the milder form, called partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), the genitals can vary from mostly female to almost completely male. Some people with PAIS think of themselves as women or girls, others regard themselves as men or boys, and some consider themselves [[genderqueer|nonbinary]].

One of the more uncommon DSDs is [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] (5ARD). It is caused by a shortage early in life of an enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT. DHT is required for the development of extrenal male genitilia. Therefore,In this condition, a person with male (XY) chromosomes has a body that appears female before puberty. After puberty begins, other testosterone-activating enzymes become available and the body soon takes on a masculine appearance, with the scrotum and penis usually reaching typical or nearly-typical size. If 5ARD is diagnosed at a young age, the child is often raised as a boy (a 1996 Brazilian study suggested that the majority of adults with this condition consider themselves men&lt;ref&gt;Mendoca et al (1996), "Male Pseudohermaphroditism Due to Steroid 5-alpha Reductase 2 Deficiency", ''Medicine'', Vol 75, No 2.&lt;/ref&gt; but this has been questioned in some more recent research).

In addition to CAH, CAIS, PAIS, and 5ARD there are several rarer types of DSDs, and in some cases, it is not possible to make a clear diagnosis of the underlying condition.

[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|The [[Quigley scale]] is a method for describing genital development in AIS.]]
The penis (males) and clitoris (females) are essentially the same organ (differing only in size, and generically called the phallus). In typical males, the urethra is located at the tip of the penis, while in typical females the urethra is located below the base of the clitoris. When the phallus is of intermediate size, it is possible also to have a urethral opening located along the shaft; this condition is known as hypospadias which helps us raise a suspicion of DSD.

Open-minded parenting, appropriate and conservative [[intersex medical intervention|medical intervention]], and age-appropriate child involvement in the treatment plan contribute greatly to successful outcomes for the entire range of DSDs.&lt;ref name=Zderic&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen |last=Zderic|title=Pediatric gender assignment : a critical reappraisal ; [proceedings from a conference ... in Dallas in the spring of 1999 which was entitled "pediatric gender assignment - a critical reappraisal"]|date=2002|publisher=Kluwer Acad. / Plenum Publ.|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0306467593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==

*'''47,XXY females''' - There are case reports of 47,XXY females; in some cases SRY or androgen receptor abnormalities are detected.&lt;ref&gt;Röttger, S., K. Schiebel, G. Singer, S. Ebner, W. Schempp, and G. Scherer. Röttger, S., K. Schiebel, G. Singer, S. Ebner, W. Schempp, and G. Scherer.

U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2001. Web. 12 Aug. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''47,XXY males''' - see [[Klinefelter syndrome]] below
*'''[[48, XXXX]]''' (also known as '''tetrasomy X''', '''quadruple X''', and '''XXXX syndrome''') - A condition that describes a female with two extra female chromosomes. It is considered a variation of [[Triple X syndrome]]. Women with 48, XXXX may or may not have issues associated with the condition though most are developmentally delayed and only about 50% undergo puberty normally.
*'''[[XXYY syndrome|48, XXYY]]''' (also known as '''XXYY syndrome''') - A condition that describes a male with one extra female chromosome and one extra male chromosome. It occurs in 1 in 18,000 to 40,000 male births.&lt;ref name="pmid18481271"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tartaglia N, Davis S, Hench A |title=A New Look at XXYY Syndrome: Medical and Psychological Features |journal=Am. J. Med. Genet. A |volume=146A |issue=12 |pages=1509–22 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18481271 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.32366 |pmc=3056496 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 48, XXYY may result in [[infertility]], low [[testosterone]], and [[neurodevelopmental disorders]] like [[ADHD]] or [[autism]] but some men have no issues.
*'''[[49, XXXXX]]''' (also known as '''pentasomy X''' and '''XXXXX syndrome''') - A condition that describes a female with three extra female chromosomes. It is considered a variant of [[Triple X syndrome]]. Women with 49, XXXXX usually suffer from numerous health issues such as [[patent ductus arteriosus]], [[scoliosis]], kidney [[hypoplasia]], and abnormal [[lobulation]] of the lungs. Physical deformities include [[microcephaly]], [[micrognathia]], and [[webbed neck|webbing of the neck]].
*'''[[49, XXXXY syndrome|49, XXXXY]]''' - A condition that describes a male with three extra female chromosomes. It is rare, occurring in 1 in 85,000 to 100,000 males.&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://www.xxxxysyndrome.com/what_is___.htm What is XXXXY syndrome?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327055333/http://xxxxysyndrome.com/what_is___.htm |date=2008-03-27 }} Retrieved March 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17062147"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Visootsak J, Graham JM |title=Klinefelter syndrome and other sex chromosomal aneuploidies |journal=Orphanet J Rare Dis |volume=1 |issue= |pages=42 |year=2006 |pmid=17062147 |pmc=1634840 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-1-42 |url=http://www.ojrd.com/content/1//42|last2=Graham Jr }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a variation of [[Klinefelter syndrome]]. Men with 49, XXXXY syndrome often suffer from [[Intellectual disability|mental retardation]].
*'''[[5α-reductase deficiency]]''' (also known as '''5-ARD''') - An [[autosomal recessive]] condition caused by a mutation of the [[5-alpha reductase]] type 2 gene. It only affects people with Y chromosomes, namely genetic males. People with this condition are fertile, with the ability to father children, but may be raised as females due to amibiguous or feminized genitalia.
*'''[[17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency]]''' - A condition characterized by impaired androgen and estrogen synthesis in males and females, respectively. Results in pseudohermaphroditism/undervirilization in males and in excessive virilization of adult females.
*'''[[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]]''' (also known as '''AIS''') - A condition which affects a genetic male's virilization. A person with androgen insensitivity syndrome produces androgens and testosterone but their body does not recognize it, either partially or completely. [[Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]] generally causes no developmental issues and people with this form are raised as males. [[Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]] results in ambiguous genitalia and there is no consensus regarding whether to raise a child with this form as male or female. [[Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]] causes a genetic male to have a vagina (often incompletely developed, nearly always blind-ending), breasts, and a clitoris and people with this form are raised as females.
*'''[[Aphallia]]''' - A rare occurrence where a male is born without a [[penis]] or where a female is born without a [[clitoris]]. As of 2005, only 75 cases of aphallia have been documented.&lt;ref name="pmid16142564"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chibber PJ, Shah HN, Jain P, Yadav P |title=Male gender assignment in aphallia: a case report and review of the literature |journal=Int Urol Nephrol |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=317–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16142564 |doi=10.1007/s11255-004-7974-0|last2=Shah |last3=Jain |last4=Yadav }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with [[Genital modification and mutilation|intentional or accidental amputation of the genitalia]].
*'''[[Aposthia]]''' - A congenital defect where a male is born without a [[foreskin]].
*'''[[Aromatase deficiency]]''' - A disorder in which, in females, is characterized by androgen excess and estrogen deficiency, and can result in inappropriate virilization, though without pseudohermaphroditism (i.e., genitals are phenotypically appropriate) (with the exception of the possible incidence of [[clitoromegaly]]).
*'''[[Aromatase excess syndrome]]''' (also known as '''familial hyperestrogenism''') - A condition that causes excessive [[estrogen]] production, resulting in feminization without pseudohermaphroditism (i.e., male genitalia at birth and female secondary sexual characteristics at puberty) in males and hyperfeminization in females.
*'''[[Clitoromegaly]]''' - A [[clitoris]] that is considered larger than average. While clitoromegaly may be a symptom of an [[intersex|intersex condition]], it may also be considered a normal variation in clitoris size. Clitoromegaly causes no health issues. Surgical reduction of the clitoris or its complete removal may be performed to normalize the appearance of the genitalia. While [[female genital mutilation]] is outlawed in many countries, reduction or the removal of the clitoris in cases of clitoromegaly are generally exempt, despite the fact that it is a nontherapeutic and sexually damaging surgery. Clitoromegaly may also be caused by females using [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] or [[anabolic steroids]] for purposes related to [[trans man|female to male]] [[gender transition]] or [[bodybuilding]].
*'''[[Combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency]]''' - A condition in which presents as a combination of the symptoms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and [[isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency]]. See those two conditions for more information.
*'''[[Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]]''' (also known as '''CAIS''') - A condition which completely affects a genetic male's ability to recognize [[androgens]]. It is considered a form of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and is the most severe form. People with complete androgen insensitivity are raised as females and usually do not discover they are genetic males until they experience [[amenorrhoea]] in their late teens or they need medical intervention due to a [[hernia]] caused by their [[undescended testes]]. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome results in a genetic male having a vagina, clitoris, and breasts which are capable of [[breastfeeding]]. However, they will not have [[ovaries]] or a [[uterus]]. Because they do not have ovaries or sufficiently developed testicles, people with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are [[infertile]].
*'''[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]''' (also known as '''CAH''') -  A condition that causes excessive [[androgen]] production, which causes excessive virilization. It is most problematic in genetic females, where severe virilization can result in her having vaginal agenesis (absence of vagina) and a functional penis which is capable of penetrative intercourse. Females with this condition are usually fertile, with the ability to become pregnant and give birth. The salt-wasting variety of this condition is fatal in infants if left untreated.
*'''[[Diphallia]]''' (also known as '''penile duplication''', '''diphallic terata''', and '''diphallasparatus''') - A condition where a male is born with two penises. It's extremely rare, with only 100 cases being recorded since 1609 and an occurrence rate of 1 in 5,500,000 in the United States. The penises may be side by side or one on top of the other, being of equal size or with one penis being distinctively larger than the other, and both penises may be suitable for urination and intercourse. Men with diphallia may be sterile.
*'''[[Estrogen insensitivity syndrome]]''' ('''EIS''') - The estrogen counterpart to androgen insensitivity syndrome. Extremely rare, with only one verified case having been reported; a biological male presented with tall stature, a heightened risk of osteoporosis, and sterility.
*'''[[Gonadal dysgenesis|Gonadal Dysgenesis]]''' - is any congenital developmental disorder of the reproductive system characterized by a progressive loss of [[primordial germ cells]] on the developing gonads of an embryo.
*'''[[Isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency]]''' - A condition that is characterized by an either partial or complete inability to produce androgens and estrogens. Results in partial or complete feminization and undervirilization in males and in a delayed, reduced, or absent puberty in both sexes, in turn causing sexual infantilism and infertility, among other symptoms.
*'''[[Klinefelter syndrome]]''' (also known as '''47, XXY''' and '''XXY syndrome''') - A condition that describes a male born with at least one extra female chromosome. Though the most common variation is 47, XXY, a man may also be 48, XXXY or [[49, XXXXY syndrome|49, XXXXY]]. It is a common occurrence, affecting 1 in 500 to 1,000 men.&lt;ref name="The Focus Foundation"&gt;The Focus Foundation. ''X &amp; Y Variations.'' [http://www.thefocusfoundation.org/FF/XYvariations.php thefocusfoundation.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113082846/http://www.thefocusfoundation.org/FF/XYvariations.php |date=2013-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some men may have no issues related to the syndrome, some may experience [[gynecomastia]], [[micropenis]], cognitive difficulties, [[hypogonadism]], reduced fertility/[[infertility]], and/or little or no [[facial hair]]. [[Testosterone]] therapy may be pursued by men who desire a more masculine appearance and those with gynecomastia may opt to undergo a [[reduction mammoplasty]]. Men who wish to father children may be able to do so with the help of [[IVF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fullerton G, Hamilton M, Maheshwari A.|title=Should non-mosaic Klinefelter syndrome men be labelled as infertile in 2009? |journal=Hum.

*'''[[Leydig cell hypoplasia]]''' - A condition solely affecting biological males which is characterized by a partial or complete inactivation of the [[luteinizing hormone receptor]], resulting in stymied androgen production. Patients may present at birth with a fully female phenotype, ambiguous genitalia, or only mild genital defects such as [[micropenis]] and [[hypospadias]]. Upon puberty, sexual development is either impaired or fully absent.
*'''[[Micropenis]]''' (also known as '''microphallus''') - A penis that measures 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) or less in length when erect. It is a common condition, occurring in 1 in 200 men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4071657.stm Op can boost size of micro-penis], [[BBC News]], Published December 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Micropenis may be the result of [[undervirilization]] during [[fetal development]] or may be caused by an underlying [[intersex]] condition, such as [[mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]], or [[Klinefelter syndrome]]. It may also be considered a natural variation of penis size. While the majority of men have no issues with having a micropenis, some may opt to use a [[prosthetic penis]] or undergo [[penile enlargement]] to increase the size of their penis.
*'''[[Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]''' - An endocrine disorder that arises from defects in the earliest stages of [[steroid hormone]] synthesis: the transport of [[cholesterol]] into the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and the conversion of cholesterol to [[pregnenolone]]—the first step in the synthesis of all [[steroid hormone]]s.
*'''[[Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]]''' (also known as '''MAIS''') - A condition which mildly affects a genetic male's ability to recognize [[androgens]]. It is considered a form of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and is considered the least severe form. While men generally do not need any specialized medical care related to this form, mild androgen insensitivity syndrome may result in [[gynecomastia]] and [[hypospadias]]. Neither gynecomastia nor hypospadias require surgerical intervention or adversely affect a man's health though some men may opt to undergo surgery to remove their breasts and/or repair their hypospadias. Men with mild androgen insensitivity syndrome may have reduced fertility.
*'''[[Mixed gonadal dysgenesis]]''' -  is a condition of unusual and asymmetrical gonadal development leading to an unassigned [[sex differentiation]]. A number of differences have been reported in the [[karyotype]], most commonly a [[mosaicism]] 45,X/ 46, XY.
*'''[[Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]]''' (also known as '''PAIS''') - A condition which partially affects a genetic male's ability to recognize [[androgens]]. It is considered a form of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] and while it is not as severe as [[complete androgen insensitivity syndrome]], it is more severe than [[mild androgen insensitivity syndrome]]. Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome causes major problems with [[gender assignment]] because it causes ambiguous genitalia such as a [[micropenis]] or [[clitoromegaly]] in addition to breast development. People with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome who are assigned as males may undergo testosterone therapy to virilize their body while those who are assigned as females may undergo surgical reduction of the clitoris and/ or estrogen therapy.
*'''[[Pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias]]''' (also known as '''PPSH''') - A form of ambiguous genitalia which results in a phallic structure that is smaller than a penis but larger than a clitoris, a [[chordee]], [[hypospadias]], and a shallow vagina.
*'''[[Swyer syndrome|Swyer Syndrome]]''' (Also known as '''Pure Gonadal Dysgenesis or XY gonadal dysgenesis''') is a type of [[hypogonadism]] in a person whose [[karyotype]] is 46,XY. The person is externally female with [[streak gonads]], and left untreated, will not experience [[puberty]]. Such gonads are typically surgically removed (as they have a significant risk of developing tumors) and a typical medical treatment would include [[hormone replacement therapy]] with female hormones.
*'''[[Triple X syndrome]]''' - A condition that describes a female born with an extra female chromosome, making her [[karotype]] 47, XXX. It is a common occurrence, affecting 1 in 1,000 females.&lt;ref name=ghr&gt;{{cite web |author=National Library of Medicine |title=Genetics Home Reference: Triple X syndrome |year=2007 |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=triplexsyndrome |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally causes no health issues or abnormal development.
*'''[[Turner syndrome]]''' (also known as '''Ullrich-Turner syndrome''' and '''gonadal dysgenesis''') - A condition that describes a female born without a female chromosome or with an abnormal female chromosome, making her karotype 45, XO. It occurs in 1 in 2,000 to 5,000 females. Turner syndrome causes numerous health and development problems, including but not limited to short stature, [[lymphedema]], [[infertility]], [[webbed neck]], [[coarctation of the aorta]], [[ADHD]], [[amenorrhoea]], and [[obesity]].
*'''[[Uterus didelphys]]''' (also known as '''double uterus''') - A condition where a female is born with two [[uteri]]. It is often accompanied by two vaginas. It is generally not considered a health issue and women with uterus didelphys usually have normal sex lives and pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/double-uterus/DS00821 Double uterus] [[Mayo Clinic]], Published September 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Müllerian agenesis]]''' (also known as '''MRKH''' or '''Vaginal Agenesis''') - A condition that causes the uterus and other reproductive organs in a 46,XX female to be small or absent, as well as the vaginal canal itself. It affects 1 out of 4,500 to 5,000 females and can also come with skeletal or endocrine system issues at conception.

==Controversy==
{{further|Intersex human rights|Intersex medical interventions}}
The term DSD (and particularly its association with medical ''disorders'') has been controversial. The argument over terminology reflects a deeper disagreement over the extent to which intersex conditions require medical intervention, the appropriateness of certain interventions, and whether physicians and parents should make irreversible treatment decisions on behalf of young children if the condition is not life-threatening.

* Use of the term disorder of sex development (DSD) is controversial among many activists and [[Intersex civil society organizations|community organizations]] due to the label "disorders".&lt;ref name="tiger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = interACT| authorlink = Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth | title = interACT Statement on Intersex Terminology| work = [[Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth]]| accessdate = 30 May 2016| date = May 2016 | url = http://interactadvocates.org/interact-statement-on-intersex-terminology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Briffa| first = Tony| author-link = Tony Briffa | title = Tony Briffa writes on "Disorders of Sex Development"| date = 8 May 2014 | url = http://oii.org.au/26808/tony-briffa-on-dsd/ | publisher = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ukia.co.uk/ukia/dsd.html | title = Why Not "Disorders of Sex Development"? | work = UK Intersex Association | accessdate = 30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments and international institutions use the term 'intersex' in preference to 'DSD', or have called for the review of medical classifications.&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iachr" /&gt;
* In the past the term "hermaphrodite" was sometimes erroneously used to describe people with intersex/DSD conditions. This term is no longer used to describe humans (or any other mammals). The correct technical definition of a hermaphrodite is a single organism that has complete sets of both male and female sexual organs, as is the case with most trees and flowering plants.
* Lee et al. in a 2006 ''Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders'' proposed a system of nomenclature based on "disorders of [[sex development]]" for clinical use, suggesting that "terms such as [[intersex]], [[pseudohermaphroditism]], [[hermaphroditism]], sex reversal, and gender based diagnostic labels are particularly controversial," may be perceived as pejorative, and are confusing to practitioners and parents alike.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; However, research by the [[Lurie Children's Hospital]], Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that affected persons, and care givers, object to the term, and that this may impact choice, access, and utilization of health care providers.&lt;ref name="johnson2017"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jpurol.2017.03.035| issn = 1477-5131| last1 = Johnson| first1 = Emilie K.| last2 = Rosoklija| first2 = Ilina| last3 = Finlayso| first3 = Courtney| last4 = Chen| first4 = Diane| last5 = Yerkes| first5 = Elizabeth B.| last6 = Madonna| first6 = Mary Beth| last7 = Holl| first7 = Jane L.| last8 = Baratz| first8 = Arlene B.| last9 = Davis| first9 = Georgiann| last10 = Cheng| first10 = Earl Y.| author9-link = Georgiann Davis | title = Attitudes towards "disorders of sex development" nomenclature among affected individuals| journal = Journal of Pediatric Urology| volume = 13| issue = 6| pages = 608.e1| date = May 2017| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1477513117301833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian sociological research on people born with atypical [[sex characteristics]], published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents choose the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics.&lt;ref name="jones2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Open Book Publishers| isbn = 978-1-78374-208-0| last1 = Jones| first1 = Tiffany| last2 = Hart| first2 = Bonnie| last3 = Carpenter| first3 = Morgan| last4 = Ansara| first4 = Gavi| last5 = Leonard| first5 = William| last6 = Lucke| first6 = Jayne| title = Intersex: Stories and Statistics from Australia| location = Cambridge, UK| date = 2016| accessdate = 2 February 2016| url = http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160914152729/http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf| archivedate = 14 September 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "We Used to Call Them Hermaphrodites," Eric Vilain states that "DSD" is not a synonym for [[intersex]]; he states that it replaces medical terms based on "hermaphrodite".&lt;ref name="vilain"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vilain E, Achermann JC, Eugster EA, Harley VR, Morel Y, Wilson JD, Hiort O | year = 2007 | title = We used to call them hermaphrodites | url = | journal = Genetics in Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 65–66 | doi=10.1097/gim.0b013e31802cffcf| pmid = 17304046 | last2 = Achermann | last3 = Eugster | last4 = Harley | last5 = Morel | last6 = Wilson | last7 = Hiort }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A committee of the [[Senate of Australia]] found that labelling intersex as "pejorative" appeared to be a post-hoc rationalisation in the 2006 ''Consensus statement''.

In 2013, [[Juan E.

In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement'' with the [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]]. Referencing the involuntary surgical "sex-normalising or other procedures" on "intersex persons", the report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/eliminating-forced-sterilization/en/ |title=Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement|work= [[World Health Organization]]|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Chal''' is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site located in the upper [[San Juan River (Guatemala)|San Juan River]] valley of the southeastern [[Petén Basin]] region, [[Guatemala]]. The site is situated approximately {{convert|30|km|mi}} to the north of the modern town of [[Dolores, Guatemala|Dolores]], near the contemporary village settlement of the same name, lying some {{convert|600|m|ft}} to the south.

El Chal was occupied from approximately 300 BC through to 1300 AD (from the Late Preclassic through to the Early Postclassic Periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]),&lt;ref name="Suasnávar98354"/&gt; although some Middle Preclassic activity has been identified in the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"/&gt; The Late Preclassic occupation of the city was concentrated around an [[E-Group]] ceremonial complex some {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of the later site core.&lt;ref&gt;Quezada et al 1998, pp.3, 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The site's major period of occupation was during the Late Classic Period, when it was an important centre in the southeastern Petén region.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"&gt;Laporte 2005, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the structures at the site is a large quadrangular residential complex, a structural type that is uncommonly found at Southern Maya lowland sites although there is a smaller one with similar characteristics at [[Machaquilá]].

{{As of|2010}} very little restorative work has been undertaken at the site. The archaeological site is protected by the Guatemalan [[Instituto de Antropología e Historia]].&lt;ref name="Morales493"&gt;Morales 1995, p.493.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:El Chal 1.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to the archaeological site]]
El Chal is located in the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of [[Dolores, Petén|Dolores]] in the [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Petén Department|Petén]] in northern Guatemala.&lt;ref name="Morales493"/&gt; El Chal is {{convert|40|km|mi}} south of [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]], the departmental capital.&lt;ref name="Suasnávar98354"&gt;Suasnávar 1998, p.354.&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological site is within the southern area of a village also named El Chal,&lt;ref name="Morales493"/&gt; {{convert|600|m|ft}} to the south of the highway to Flores.&lt;ref name="Morales495"&gt;Morales 1995, p.494.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is situated in the central Petén wet [[savanna]] in a well-drained area not subject to seasonal flooding.&lt;ref name="Morales493"/&gt; The local topography is [[Karst topography|karstic]] in nature, and includes hills that support some of the city's architecture.&lt;ref name="Morales94368"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.368.&lt;/ref&gt;

El Chal is located within the valley of the [[San Juan River (Guatemala)|San Juan River]], which is a tributary of the [[Pasión River]], at an altitude of {{convert|270|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref name="Morales493"/&gt; The site is situated on a natural north-south communication route between the [[Maya Mountains]] and the central Petén region.&lt;ref name="Morales493"/&gt; This route was used during the Colonial Period and was likely to have been inherited from pre-Conquest times.&lt;ref name="Morales493"/&gt;

Some of the major architecture of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including some large trees, while much of the city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes.&lt;ref name="Morales9314"&gt;Morales 1993, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mounds were destroyed in order to build the modern streets, in other cases the mounds were robbed of stone that was reused in modern construction.&lt;ref name="Morales9314"/&gt; There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms.&lt;ref name="Morales9314"/&gt; Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.&lt;ref name="Morales9315"&gt;Morales 1993, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
El Chal was first occupied in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic Period]], with ceramics associated with a burial being recovered from the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"/&gt; Late Preclassic occupation has only been identified in a few residential groups in the site core.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1995, p.499. Quezada et al 1998, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Preclassic the centre of the city was probably situated some distance to the northeast of the Late Classic centre, where a large ritual complex is located.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt;

[[File:El Chal 4.jpg|thumb|right|Badly eroded lower panel of Stela 4, depicting three kneeling captives]]
The major period of occupation at the site was during the Late Classic, when most of the major [[Maya architecture|architecture]] was built.&lt;ref name="Morales499"&gt;Morales 1995, p.499.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the city centre was moved to the site core around the newly built acropolis complex.&lt;ref name="Quezada9820"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpted monuments of the city indicate that it was important enough during the Late Classic to possess its own [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|Emblem Glyph]].&lt;ref name="Morales499"/&gt; The city experienced a period of intensive construction lasting from the Late Classic through to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt; All hieroglyphic texts sculpted on monuments at El Chal date to the 8th century AD, although the inscriptions are heavily eroded.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt; The residential groups constructed upon platforms in Panorama Sector were built in the Late Classic, when a flint workshop was in production in Panorama Group 19.&lt;ref name="Quezada9818"/&gt; During the Late Classic occupation also expanded throughout the other sectors of the city; Arrepentimiento, Municipal and Central.&lt;ref name="Quezada9820"/&gt;

During the Terminal Classic, El Chal maintained its primary place in the San Juan valley.&lt;ref name="Laporte05225"&gt;Laporte 2005, p.225.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidenced by major building activity in the site core where the massive structures were underwent new phases of construction and by the erection of new monuments to accompany the already existing Late Classic monuments.&lt;ref name="Laporte05228"&gt;Laporte 2005, p.228.&lt;/ref&gt; The continued importance of El Chal in the Terminal Classic resulted in other centres in the region being eclipsed, such as El Edén and El Tigrillo to the west and Copoja, La Puente and El Ocote to the southeast.&lt;ref name="Laporte05228"/&gt; During the Terminal Classic, El Chal developed its own ceramic production industry.&lt;ref name="Quezada9820"/&gt;

In spite of the continued intensive activity in the site core, in Panorama Sector and the other peripheral residential sectors there was a diminishing of activity compared to the Late Classic, perhaps leading up to the abandonment of the city.&lt;ref name="Quezada9818"/&gt;

[[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic Period]] occupation of El Chal has been identified from ceramic fragments recovered from Structure 1 in the Northwest Plaza.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p404"&gt;Chocón 2008, p.404.&lt;/ref&gt; A few Postclassic [[Sherd|potsherds]] were also excavated from Group 15 in the Central Sector.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap60"/&gt;

===Modern history===
The name El Chal first appears on a Spanish Colonial watercolour from 1735 together with other villages in the region, with the name of El Chal or El Chacal.&lt;ref name="Morales493"/&gt; It also appears on a map of central and southeastern Petén from 1860, together with [[Poptún]], Concepción, [[San Clemente, El Petén|San Clemente]] and the ruins of [[Ixkun]].&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1995, pp.493-494.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the stonework from the ruins has been stripped to be used in the construction of the modern village.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;

The site was visited by archaeologists Richard Kirsch and [[Ian Graham]] in 1974 and 1975 but their work was never published.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; In 1989 the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala mapped the site and catalogued the remaining monuments.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; In 1993 the first test excavations took place and an area of {{convert|4|km2|sqmi}} around the site core was explored.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;

In the 1970s some sculpted monuments were removed from El Chal by FYDEP (''Fomento y Desarrollo del Petén'' - "Petén Patronage and Development") and were later transferred to the [[Tikal]] National Park.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; By the mid-1990s the exact location and identity of these monuments had been lost.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;

Further excavations have taken place since the 1990s, including investigations of the West Plaza in 2003, the East Plaza in 2004, the acropolis in 2005&amp;ndash;2006 and the Northwest Plaza in 2006.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap42"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chocón 2008, p.402. Reyes 2008, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
[[File:El Chal 14.jpg|thumb|right|Front of Stela 4 showing an 8th-century ruler]]
The site core of El Chal consists of an acropolis and three ceremonial plazas in which the majority of sculpted monuments were found, the East Plaza, West Plaza and Northeast Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; There are also a number of other plazas in the site core.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The plazas and the majority of the residential structures were laid out upon naturally level terrain, while the acropolis was built upon a natural [[limestone]] hill and a very few residential groups were built upon artificial basal platforms.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;

A reservoir is located to the northwest of the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; It was built with irregular limestone blocks and measures {{convert|65|m|ft}} across.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; In the rain season it fills to a depth of {{convert|2|m|ft}} and contains {{convert|400|m3|cuft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;  A second, natural reservoir, is located to the south of the artificial reservoir and west of the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Morales9317"&gt;Morales 1993, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the rain season it also fills to a depth of {{convert|2|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales9317"/&gt;

The large ritual complex of El Chal was located a considerable distance to the northeast of the civic centre of the city and was probably first built in the Preclassic Period.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt;

Archaeologists have mapped 268 structures clustered in 53 groups around approximately 68 patios in the site core.&lt;ref name="Morales496"&gt;Morales 1995, p.496.&lt;/ref&gt; Residential structures were concentrated in the area surrounding the ceremonial centre, especially on the north and west sides near to the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Morales496"/&gt; Residences tended to be larger the closer they were to the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; The residential area of El Chal was extensive and archaeologists have divided it into four sectors.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt; Municipal consists of the area occupied by the modern village, El Arrepentimiento is the northeastern portion of the site, Panorama is the northwestern area, and Central is the site core.&lt;ref name="Quezada981"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Central El Chal contains 25 groups, Arrepentimiento contains 40 groups, Panorama contains 53 groups and Municipal contains 18 groups.&lt;ref&gt;Laporte 2005, p.212. Quezada et al 1998, pp.15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Panorama was an area of [[chert]] production while Municipal is associated with the ritual complex of the city.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt;

===Central Sector===

====Acropolis====
The '''acropolis''' was built on a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} high limestone hill.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The base is almost square, measuring {{convert|140|m|ft}} on each side.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The acropolis complex faced northwards onto the south side of the West Plaza.&lt;ref name="Corzo0571"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper part of the hill was levelled into three wide terraces with an average area of {{convert|2800|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The terraces were linked by a sunken stairway on the north side of the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The architecture of the acropolis is arranged in six groups.&lt;ref name="Corzo0572"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Terraces=====
'''Terrace 1''' is the highest terrace in the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Morales495"&gt;Morales 1995, p.494.&lt;/ref&gt; It supports three small patios labelled as Patios A, B and C.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; These patios are laid out between 10 structures.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; Among the structures found on Terrace 1, Structures 1, 3, 5 and 6 have been excavated by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Morales94370"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.370.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure 5 is the largest, on the west side of Patio A.&lt;ref name="Morales9315"/&gt; Terrace 1 has been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94370"/&gt; A complex stairway divided into three flights gave access to the terrace from the south side.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p272"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.272.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper flight descended seven steps to a small room measuring {{convert|1.3|by|1.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p272"/&gt; These steps had a tread of {{convert|0.3|m|ft}} and a riser of {{convert|0.25|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p272"/&gt; The second flight descended from the small room to another similar room, and the third flight descended in the opposite direction to the terrace supporting Patio F (Terrace 3).&lt;ref name="Reyes08p272"/&gt; The wall of the upper flight was decorated with a sculpted bas-relief frame, the wall of the middle flight was coated with stucco and were painted with a red and black design.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p272"/&gt;

[[File:El Chal map of site core.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Map of the site core showing the acropolis, and the East and West Plazas.]]
'''Terrace 2''' is situated {{convert|10|m|ft}} below Terrace 1.&lt;ref name="Morales9315"/&gt; It is divided into two patios (Patios D and E) by a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} high [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] temple.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; Patio D was accessed via a stairway from the West Plaza directly to the north, the stairway rose in two sections with a minor terrace between them, referred to as the Lower Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Corzo et al 2005, pp.72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower section of the stairway measured {{convert|59|m|ft}} long, extending {{convert|5|m|ft}} into the plaza at its lower end.&lt;ref name="Corzo0572"/&gt; Material excavated from the area around the stairway where it joined the base of the acropolis has been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Corzo0572"/&gt; Patio D itself was laid out at the very beginning of the Late Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Corzo0580"/&gt; It was resurfaced a number of times in the Late Classic, and the earliest of the surrounding structures were built at this time.&lt;ref name="Corzo0580"/&gt; Additional structures were built in the Terminal Classic, and the patio area was extended with the construction of the adjacent Patio G.&lt;ref name="Corzo0580"/&gt; Patio E was also accessed via a stairway from the base of the acropolis, although it is very poorly preserved.&lt;ref name="Corzo0577"/&gt; Ceramics recovered from the western portion of the Lower Terrace dated it to the Late and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Corzo0578"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.78.&lt;/ref&gt; A low platform was excavated in the extreme southwestern corner of the Lower Terrace, although most of the ceramic finds were dated to the Terminal Classic, some pieces dating to the Late Preclassic were also found.&lt;ref name="Corzo0580"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terrace 3''' is located on the southwest side of the acropolis at the same height as Terrace 2.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1993, p.315. Morales 1995, p.495.&lt;/ref&gt; It supports one residential patio group, Patio F, formed by five structures.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;

=====Patio A=====
'''Patio A''' was formed by a group of 5 buildings serving a dual residential and administrative function.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p245"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this is the fact that the structures in the group were divided into multiple rooms with internal benches,&lt;ref name="Reyes08p245"/&gt; a form of architecture that is recognised as being a palace and that may serve for either elite domestic or administrative activity.&lt;ref&gt;Seibert 2006, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone blocks used in construction measured approximately {{convert|40|cm|in}} on each side with a finely dressed front face, tapering towards the back in order to grip the structural fill.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p246"/&gt; This patio is situated on the west side of the main terrace of the acropolis, Terrace 1.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p245"/&gt; Patio A has an area of {{convert|432|m2|sqft}}, with the largest building on the west side.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p245"/&gt; Patio B lies to the east and Patio C to the west, a lower terrace supports Patio F to the southwest and Patio D to the north.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p245"/&gt; The patio was accessed via a short 3-step stairway on the southeast side.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes 2008, p.247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations identified 3 construction phases in Patio A, with the first two dating to the Late Classic and the final phase dating to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p246"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.246.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:El Chal 23.jpg|thumb|left|The heavily forested acropolis as seen from the West Plaza]]
'''Terrace 1 Structure 1''' is on the north side of Patio A.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.371.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a long platform access via a {{convert|23|m|ft|adj=on}} wide stairway on the south side.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1994, p.371. Reyes 2008, pp.247, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The stairway had three steps, each with a tread of {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} and a riser measuring {{convert|0.35|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p252"/&gt; Structure 1 experienced two construction phases, in the Late Classic and in the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p252"/&gt; In its final form it measured {{convert|34|m|ft}} long by {{convert|8.5|m|ft}} wide and stood {{convert|1.4|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p252"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt; The superstructure of the building possessed a C-shaped bench.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p252"/&gt;

'''Terrace 1 Structure 2''' is on the northeast side of Patio A.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.255.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a single level platform measuring {{convert|8|by|5|m|ft}} by {{convert|2|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"/&gt; It was accessed via a projecting stairway measuring {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide and protruding {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} from the structure.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"/&gt; The five steps each had a tread of {{convert|0.25|m|ft}} and a riser measuring {{convert|0.24|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"/&gt; Archaeologists were unable to investigate the summit of Structure 2 due to the large size of the trees growing upon it.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"/&gt; The structure clearly shows two construction phases, the first dating to the Late Classic and the second to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"/&gt; Finds dating to the Middle Preclassic were recovered from trenches sunk into the patio in front of the structure, consisting of 378 potsherds associated with Burial 265.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p255"/&gt; A Late Classic cache was also found at the base of the stairway, consisting of 2 [[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|eccentric]] [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] artefacts shaped like [[centipede]]s, a flint arrowhead, various pieces of waste flint, and a number of flint blades and obsidian [[prismatic blade]]s.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p261"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.261.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terrace 1 Structure 3''' is on the east side of Patio A and separates it from Patio B.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; Structure 3 was built in two construction phases.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; The first phase was covered in stucco and raised {{convert|1.3|m|ft}} above the level of the patio.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; The second phase consisted of a square platform that was {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; A bench on the east side of the platform raised the height to {{convert|2.1|m|ft}} above the floor of the patio.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; Structure 3 was built from small limestone blocks around a rubble core.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; In its final form the structure was a rectangular platform measuring {{convert|17|by|14.5|m|ft}} and standing {{convert|3|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p262"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.262.&lt;/ref&gt; The stairway measured {{convert|7.5|m|ft}} wide and was divided into two by a {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} block.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p262"/&gt; The platform supported a bench measuring {{convert|13.5|by|7|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p262"/&gt; An incomplete human skeleton was found next to the south wall (Burial 73), together with broken ceramic fragments dating to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; Although material excavated from the two construction phases has been dated to the Late Preclassic and the Early Classic, this material is believed to have been transported there and used as infill during the Late Classic construction of the building and not to represent earlier phases of the structure itself.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p262"/&gt;

'''Terrace 1 Structure 4''' is on the south side of Patio A.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p263"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest version of the building measured {{convert|31|by|6.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p263"/&gt; It supported a room that measured {{convert|28.5|by|2.5|m|ft}} with three doorways.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p263"/&gt; The central door was {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} wide and the flanking doorways measured {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p263"/&gt; The front of the building was dominated by a bench that ran the entire width of the structure and became a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} wide stairway descending to the patio and extending {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} from the platform.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p263"/&gt; The stairway had 3 steps, each with a height of {{convert|0.3|m|ft}} and a tread of {{convert|0.4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p263"/&gt; The first construction phase included a {{convert|1|m|ft|adj=on}} high wall that was later covered by the stucco floor of a small north-facing room.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; On the east side of the structure, the walls were still found to stand to a height of {{convert|2.55|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p263"/&gt; Structure 4 was deliberately demolished in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Morales94371"/&gt; The second construction phase extended the building to a size of {{convert|31|by|8.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p282"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.282.&lt;/ref&gt; It supported three rooms with benches, the combined width of the rooms was {{convert|28.5|m|ft}} by {{convert|2.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p282"/&gt; The same three doors from the earlier phase continued in use.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p282"/&gt;

'''Terrace 1 Structure 5''' is on the west side of Patio A.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.374.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a single platform that is the highest in the entire acropolis.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; It measures {{convert|19.5|by|6|m|ft}} and was {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p264"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.264.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure 5 was joined to Structures 1 and 4 since its earliest phase of construction.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; Structure 5 was accessed by a projecting stairway that ascended the east side,&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; it measured {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} wide and protruded {{convert|2.6|m|ft}} from the platform.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p264"/&gt; The stairway joins a {{convert|2.25|m|ft|adj=on}} ''[[Talud-tablero|talud]]'' wall topped by a {{convert|0.8|m|ft|adj=on}} high cornice that projects {{convert|10|cm|in}} from the ''talud'' wall.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; The walls of Structure 5 were built from finely dressed limestone blocks.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; No trace of any superstructure was found on top of the platform, nor was any earlier substructure identified.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; Only the lowest courses of limestone blocks were found to be still in place and it is believed that the upper courses were stripped in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; Finds made near the southeast corner of Structure 5 include a piece of a greenstone axe, two spherical stones, pieces of human bone (labelled as Burial 70) and a concentration of broken domestic ceramics.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; These finds are believed to represent activity from the very end of the Terminal Classic prior to the abandonment of the site.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; Burial 278, that of an infant, was found under the floor of Structure 5 and was dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p264"/&gt;

=====Patio B=====
[[File:El Chal 24.jpg|thumb|right|Structures on Terrace 1 of the acropolis]]
'''Patio B''' was filled with a large amount of rubble in order to bring it up to the same level as the pre-existing Patio A, which lies immediately to the west.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p288"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.288.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an enclosed courtyard with an area of {{convert|768|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p288"/&gt; Three structures were built upon the new patio, closing it on the north, east and south sides, while the west side was enclosed by Structures 1,2 and 3 of Patio A.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p288"/&gt;

'''Terrace 1 Structure 6''' is on the south side of Patio B.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; It is a square platform with two stepped levels.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; After the last phase of construction it had two benches on the top and a wide projecting stairway on the north side,&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; it measures {{convert|9|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p288"/&gt; The structure measures {{convert|14.5|by|12.5|m|ft}},&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; the first bench measures {{convert|11|by|5|m|ft}} and the second {{convert|10|by|3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p288"/&gt; Various human bone fragments, representing pieces of three individuals, were excavated together with domestic ceramics.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; A smaller second stairway jutted from the southeast corner of the building.&lt;ref name="Morales94374"/&gt; Structure 6 has been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p288"/&gt;

'''Terrace 1 Structure 7''' is a low platform on the east side of Patio B.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p290"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.290.&lt;/ref&gt; It measured {{convert|22.5|by|4|m|ft}} and stood {{convert|0.64|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p290"/&gt; Upon the platform was a {{convert|1.5|m|ft|adj=on}} wide bench, and a single {{convert|9.5|m|ft}} wide step lead down to the patio.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p290"/&gt; Excavations of the platform uncovered material that was dated to the Late Preclassic, Late Classic and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p290"/&gt; Structure 7 was the last to be built on Patio B, postdating the construction of Structures 6 and 8.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p291"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.291.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terrace 1 Structure 8''' is on the north side of Patio B.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p291"/&gt; It is a rectangular platform measuring {{convert|18|by|8.5|m|ft}} with a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=on}} wide south-facing embedded stairway.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p291"/&gt; The structure was not completely explored due to the dense vegetation covering it.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p291"/&gt;

=====Patio C=====
'''Patio C''' was added to Terrace 1 at the same time as Patio B, using a large amount of rubble to extend the terrace.&lt;ref name="Reyes08p331"&gt;Reyes 2008, p.331.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to the northwest of Patio A and is slightly lower than it.&lt;ref name="Valle08p349"&gt;Valle 2008, p.349.&lt;/ref&gt; Patio C is bordered by 2 structures, on the north and west sides, with the West Structure being the largest.&lt;ref name="Valle08p349"/&gt; The fill beneath the patio has a depth of {{convert|6|m|ft}}, which was previously the height of the retaining ''talud'' wall of the northwest side of Patio A, as found during excavations.&lt;ref name="Valle08p350"&gt;Valle 2008, p.350.&lt;/ref&gt; Patio C had 2 construction phases and served an administrative function directly associated with the buildings of Patio A.&lt;ref name="Valle08p350"/&gt;

The '''West Structure''' contained a {{convert|1.2|m|ft|adj=on}} wide room accessed via a {{convert|0.7|m|ft|adj=on}} wide doorway.&lt;ref name="Valle08p353"&gt;Valle 2008, p.353.&lt;/ref&gt; The rear room of the structure contained a bench, or throne, that measured {{convert|2.4|by|2.95|m|ft}} and stood {{convert|0.45|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Valle08p353"/&gt; Material recovered from the structure has been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic Periods, with a small amount dating to the Postclassic.&lt;ref name="Valle08p354"&gt;Valle 2008, p.354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North Structure''' was a low platform that was covered with stucco and painted red.&lt;ref name="Valle08p362"&gt;Valle 2008, p.362.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Patio D=====
'''Terrace 2 Structure 1''' is on the north side of Patio D.&lt;ref name="Corzo0582"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a low rectangular platform measuring {{convert|2|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Corzo0582"/&gt; Its walls rest upon the last surface layer of the patio and the structure's surface was littered with abundant Terminal Classic ceramic remains.&lt;ref name="Corzo0582"/&gt; A sunken stairway climbed the structure at a point {{Convert|10|m|ft}} from the southeast corner.&lt;ref name="Corzo0582"/&gt; The tread of the steps measured {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} deep while the risers measured {{Convert|0.2|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Corzo0582"/&gt; During the Late Classic this structure apparently had an administrative function. However, by the Terminal Classic it was used as a domestic building, as evidenced by the abundant ceramics and stone artefacts recovered, the latter include a fragment of a ''[[metate]]'' milling stone, an obsidian knife and two flint knives.&lt;ref name="Corzo0582"/&gt;

[[File:El Chal 10.jpg|thumb|left|Unrestored pyramid on the acropolis]]
'''Terrace 2 Structure 2''' is on the east side of Patio D.&lt;ref name="Corzo0588"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} tall pyramidal platform that did not possess a summit superstructure.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corzo0588"/&gt; The upper east side of the pyramid has collapsed and looters' trenches on the west side were filled in by IDAEH in 1991.&lt;ref name="Corzo0588"/&gt; The walls possessed ''taluds'' and excavations uncovered traces of red paint.&lt;ref name="Corzo0588"/&gt; The stairway faced west onto Patio D, the treads measured {{convert|0.2|m|ft}} and the risers {{convert|0.25|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Corzo et al 2005, pp.73, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The stairway projected {{convert|1.3|m|ft}} into the patio from the pyramid.&lt;ref name="Corzo0590"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; A burial cist was found near the front of the pyramid, it was labelled as Burial 264 and was dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Corzo0589"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; The platform had five layers of stucco flooring.&lt;ref name="Corzo0589"/&gt; Material recovered during excavation of the stairway dated to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Corzo0590"/&gt;

'''Terrace 2 Structure 3''' encloses the west side of Patio D.&lt;ref name="Corzo0593"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.93.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure 3 does not face onto Patio D but rather is part of the Terminal Classic construction activity that extended Terrace 2 with the addition of Patio G.&lt;ref&gt;"Corzo et al 2005, pp.93-94."&lt;/ref&gt; The structure measured {{Convert|7.8|m|ft}} from east to west.&lt;ref name="Corzo0593"/&gt; Excavated artefacts around the base have been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Corzo0593"/&gt; The stairway is on the west side, facing onto Patio G.&lt;ref name="Corzo0594"&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure is believed to have been built in a single burst of activity in the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Corzo0594"/&gt; It had two stepped levels and a north-south stairway was identified upon the summit of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Corzo et al 2005, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Patio F=====
'''Patio F''' is on a terrace at the same level as Patios D and E.&lt;ref name="Valle08p368"&gt;Valle 2008, p.368.&lt;/ref&gt; The patio is a closed courtyard formed by 5 structures on the west and south sides, while the other two sides are formed by the retaining walls of Patios A and C.&lt;ref name="Valle08p368"/&gt; The structures were residential buildings built upon low platforms, with the principal structure on the south side of the patio.&lt;ref name="Valle08p368"/&gt; A long, low platform on the west side supports two structures, labelled as Structures 1 and 2.&lt;ref name="Valle08p368"/&gt; Excavations of this platform recovered ceramic remains dating to the Late and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Valle08p370"&gt;Valle 2008, p.370.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 1''' measures {{convert|19.3|m|ft}} north-south by {{convert|4.8|m|ft}} east-west and was built upon the same platform that supports Structure 2.&lt;ref name="Valle08p368"/&gt; The structure had a single room measuring {{convert|7.5|by|2|m|ft}}, which contained a bench.&lt;ref name="Valle08p368"/&gt;

'''Structure 2''' is to the south of Structure 1, resting upon the same basal platform.&lt;ref name="Valle08p368"/&gt; It measured {{convert|7.1|by|5.6|m|ft}} with a room measuring {{convert|4.44|by|1.66|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Valle08p368"/&gt;

'''Structure 3''' was built directly upon Patio F, and is therefore lower than Structures 1 and 2.&lt;ref name="Valle08p370"/&gt; It was on the southwest side of Patio F and measured {{convert|6.2|by|5.3|m|ft}} and had a {{convert|2.13|m|ft|adj=on}} wide projecting stairway extending {{convert|0.66|m|ft}} from the facade.&lt;ref name="Valle08p370"/&gt; Ceramics from the structure were largely dated to the Terminal Classic, with a few pieces dating to the Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Valle 2008, p.371.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 4''' was located on the south side of Patio F.&lt;ref name="Valle08p374"&gt;Valle 2008, p.374.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramics from the structure were dated to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Valle08p374"/&gt;

====East Plaza====
[[File:El Chal 13.jpg|thumb|right|The East Plaza]]
The '''East Plaza''' covers an area of {{convert|6300|m2|sqft}},&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; making it the largest open ceremonial space in the entire city.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap42"/&gt; On its east side it is delimited by 2 medium-height structures (East Plaza Structures 1 and 2), on the south side by the base of the acropolis, on the west side by Structure 3 of the West Plaza and on the north side by the South Structure of the Northeast Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1995, pp.494, 503. Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Six stelae and three altars were found in the East Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94375"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.375.&lt;/ref&gt; The plaza had two construction phases, the first dated to the Late Classic and the second to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94375"/&gt; A few Late Preclassic ceramic fragments were also recovered.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap42"/&gt; The levelling of the East Plaza involved a considerable inversion of labour due to the limestone bedrock being extremely close to the surface at one side and {{convert|2|m|ft}} under the surface at the other.&lt;ref name="Morales94375"/&gt;

'''East Plaza Structure 1''' is on the east side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap42"/&gt; In its final form it was a platform with two levels standing to a total height of {{convert|7|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap43"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; It measured {{convert|20|m|ft}} north-south by {{convert|15|m|ft}} east-west.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap43"/&gt; The structure had a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on}} wide stairway climbing from the plaza on the west side, the stairway was {{convert|10|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap43"/&gt; The lower level was the main platform. It was built from finely dressed limestone blocks.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap43"/&gt; The upper level was built of very poor quality limestone and is extremely badly preserved.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap43"/&gt; A bench was built on top of the structure. It measured {{convert|8|by|3|m|ft}} with a protruding section measuring {{convert|3|by|5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap47"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; The bench was {{convert|25|cm|in}} high.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap47"/&gt; A large number of flint chippings were excavated from the structure. They have been dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap47"/&gt;

'''East Plaza Structure 2''' is also on the east side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap42"/&gt; It is a rectangular platform measuring {{convert|17|by|10|m|ft}} and facing westwards onto the plaza itself.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap48"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; A stairway climbs the west side of the building. It measures {{convert|12|by|1.2|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap48"/&gt; The platform supports a bench measuring {{convert|12|by|3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap48"/&gt; The broken remains of Stela 6 are scattered in front of the structure.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap48"/&gt; Relatively few ceramic remains were found associated with this structure. Those that were have been dated to the Terminal Classic, although a pit sunk into the summit uncovered remains dating to the Late Classic at a depth of {{convert|1|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap50"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; Lithic artefacts included a piece of an obsidian knife.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap50"/&gt;

====West Plaza====
[[File:El Chal 17.jpg|thumb|right|Fallen stela with associated altar in the West Plaza]]
The '''West Plaza''' covers an area of {{convert|3500|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The south side of the plaza is formed by the north side of the acropolis and the plaza is also enclosed by four structures that measure more than {{convert|5|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The highest structure is on the west side and measures {{convert|13|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; A {{convert|7.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} series of three steps stretched between the north wall of Structure 4 and the southwest corner of Structure 1 and gave access to the Northwest Plaza.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp110"/&gt; These steps had a {{convert|0.5|m|ft|adj=on}} tread and were {{convert|0.2|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp110"/&gt; Six monuments were found in the West Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; During the final phase of occupation during the Terminal Classic, refuse found at the base of the acropolis indicates that the West Plaza was occupied as a residential area, with the inhabitants using flimsy perishable structures.&lt;ref name="Corzo0577"&gt;Corzo et al. 2005, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''West Plaza Structure 1''' is on the north side of the West Plaza, near the northwest corner.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap51"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure faces southwards onto the plaza and has a stairway that measures {{convert|12|by|3|m|ft}} climbing the front of the building.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap51"/&gt; The final version of the structure measured {{convert|27|by|20|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap51"/&gt; A bench on the summit of the structure measures {{convert|22|by|4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure has two phases of construction, the earliest of which dates to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap52"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''West Plaza Structure 2''' is on the north side of the West Plaza.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap51"/&gt; It is a rectangular platform measuring {{convert|27|by|20|m|ft}} with a projecting stairway on the south side that measures {{convert|12|by|3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap56"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only building on the West Plaza that did not possess a bench upon the summit.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap56"/&gt; A number of potsherds dating to the Terminal Classic were recovered from the front of the platform.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap56"/&gt;

[[File:El Chal 20.jpg|thumb|left|West Plaza Structure 3 seen from the East Plaza]]
'''West Plaza Structure 3''' is on the east side of the West Plaza and separates it from the East Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94378"&gt;Morales et al. 1994, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a rectangular building with a wide stairway climbing from the west.&lt;ref name="Morales94378"/&gt; The structure measures {{convert|38|by|18|m|ft}} and possesses a bench on the summit that measures {{convert|25|by|6|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap58"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; After its final construction phase the platform stood {{convert|4.45|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Morales94378"/&gt; A pit sunk into the structure revealed the presence of two earlier substructures.&lt;ref name="Morales94378"/&gt; The first was {{convert|2.85|m|ft}} high and the second stood {{convert|3.15|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Morales94378"/&gt; All three stages were filled with a rubble core, although the earliest stage consisted of larger pieces than the latter stages.&lt;ref name="Morales94378"/&gt; Various artefacts were recovered from the southwest corner of the final stage of the stairway, including pieces of flint, obsidian blades, ''metates'' (milling stones) and a large amount of domestic ceramics.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"&gt;Morales et al. 1994, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Structure 4=====
'''West Plaza Structure 4''' is on the west side of the West Plaza and is the tallest structure at El Chal.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; The platform measures {{convert|46|m|ft}} north-south and {{convert|30|m|ft}} east-west;&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; it has a rectangular base that was formed of three stepped sections.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1994, p.379. Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest section measured {{convert|1.83|m|ft}} high with a {{convert|1.3|m|ft}} wide platform between its upper edge and the beginning of the second section.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp110"/&gt;  The middle section was {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} high with a {{convert|0.6|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} platform between its upper edge and the base of the upper section.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp110"/&gt; The wall of the top section is poorly preserved with just two courses of stonework remaining in place.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp110"/&gt; The sides of the structure have largely collapsed due to erosion, leaving the north side as the best preserved.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp110"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The stairway has not been positively identified but is believed to be a wide sunken stairway on the east side.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; The broken fragments of Stela 1 were found at the base of this stairway.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp115"/&gt;

The platform supported a long superstructure facing onto the West Plaza, as evidenced by the bases of its walls.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; Originally the superstructure consisted of a single, long room but this was later subdivided; another room to the south was probably demolished at the same time.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp112"/&gt; The floor of the superstructure is {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} above the level of the West Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; The walls were {{convert|1.1|m|ft}} thick and the entrance doorway measured {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; This superstructure was divided into five rooms, each measuring {{convert|2.9|by|0.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp111"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; These rooms were completely sealed, and in some cases destroyed, by a layer of compact white soil during the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp111"/&gt; The rooms were upon a low platform upon the summit and were accessed from the upper section of the basal platform via three steps measuring {{convert|22|m|ft}} wide, with a tread of {{convert|0.25|m|ft}} and a height of {{convert|0.3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp112"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Stucco fragments with traces of pigment indicate that the rooms were once painted.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp112"/&gt;

'''Room 1''' was extremely poorly preserved and is the southernmost of the rooms.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp113"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one doorjamb and a portion of wall belonging to a rear bench were found during excavations.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp113"/&gt;

'''Room 2''' is one of the best preserved of the rooms atop Structure 4.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp113"/&gt; It measured {{convert|2.9|m|ft}} north-south by {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} east-west.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp113"/&gt; The doorway to the room was {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp113"/&gt; The room has been dated to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp113"/&gt;

'''Room 3''' is the middle room of the superstructure.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp114"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only room not to have been sealed during the Terminal Classic and due to this is in a poor state of preservation.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp114"/&gt; The room possessed a bench against the back wall the measured {{convert|0.2|m|ft}} in height and {{convert|1|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp114"/&gt;

'''Room 4''' was well preserved and is very similar to Room 5.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp114"/&gt; It measured {{convert|2.9|m|ft}} north-south by {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} east-west,&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp114"/&gt; the door was {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp114"/&gt; The bench of the room measured {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1|m|ft}} thick.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp114"/&gt;

'''Room 5''' is of identical proportions as rooms 2 and 4.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp115"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; It was extremely well preserved, including the rear wall of the bench and the room was used as a model for investigations of the other rooms in Structure 4.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp115"/&gt;

Some artefacts were recovered from the northeastern portion of the structure.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; They included fragments of a ''[[metate]]'' and of a ''[[mano (stone)|manos]]'' (handstone for use with a ''metate'') and a large quantity of domestic ceramics.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; Stela 1 and Altar 7 were found in front of Structure 4.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp108"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ballcourt=====
The '''[[Mesoamerican ballcourt|Ballcourt]]''' is on the north side of the West Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; It runs north-south and measures {{convert|18|m|ft}} long by {{convert|4.8|m|ft}} wide.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The sides of the ballcourt measure approximately {{convert|4|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; These side structures supported rectangular stone benches.&lt;ref name="Morales94379"/&gt; The west structure has been damaged by a looters' trench and originally had a stairway that climbed the west side.&lt;ref&gt;Morales et al. 1994, pp. 379, 383.&lt;/ref&gt; Sculpted blocks of stone were found on the benches of both side structures and once decorated the aprons of the ballcourt.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"&gt;Morales et al. 1994, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The four surviving blocks bear geometric designs and parts of sculpted figures deity masks.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"/&gt; The stucco floor at the south end of the ballcourt was found to be well preserved.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"/&gt; The ballcourt has been dated to the Late Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"/&gt;

====Northeast Plaza====
The '''Northeast Plaza''' covers an area of {{convert|850|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; It is located to the north of the East Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.384.&lt;/ref&gt; The Northeast Plaza is enclosed by four structures of similar size and form and was accessed from the northeast corner.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The tallest structure measures {{convert|5|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The four buildings completely enclose an area measuring {{convert|30|by|35|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales9315"/&gt; These four structures consist of stepped rectangular platforms and were built from finely dressed limestone blocks.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt; Excavations revealed remains of the superstructure of the tallest structure, including rooms with different entrance doorways.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt; Construction at the plaza dates to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref name="Laporte05212"/&gt;

'''Northeast Plaza Structure 2''' has a rectangular base.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The structure is believed to have had three stepped levels that were built with finely dressed stone blocks, some of which were decorated with a double-trapezoid design.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; Some of the blocks were found to have a thin coating of cream-coloured stucco.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The rear of the structure has the form of a truncated pyramid.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The stairway and the upper parts of the structure were deliberately destroyed in antiquity, leaving only the lower courses of stonework in place.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The southeastern portion of the platform is the best preserved, where a ''talud'' wall stands to a height of {{convert|1.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; Structure 2 is believed to have faced onto the Northeast Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; Ceramic remains were found on the east side of the platform and also where Structure 2 joins Structure 4.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; Excavations of the upper platform revealed five layers of stucco flooring, all dating to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; Burial 67 was found deposited in a [[cist]] under the second layer, its location had been marked on that floor with a painted red circle.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; Upon the top of the platform were found traces of a small ({{convert|0.5|m|ft|adj=on}} wide) room with doorways facing the east and west.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.386.&lt;/ref&gt; The walls were {{convert|1.35|m|ft}} thick and their remains stand to a height of {{convert|35|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"/&gt; The floor of the room slopes noticeably down to the east.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"/&gt;

====Northwest Plaza====
{{Maya civilization}}
The '''Northwest Plaza''' covers an area of {{convert|3600|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;  It is enclosed by two structures, the largest of which is a pyramid on the west side.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; No monuments were found within the Northwest Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt; The plaza occupies a privileged position at the centre of the city although it does not have a high concentration of structures.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p400"&gt;Chocón 2008, p.400.&lt;/ref&gt; Three construction levels have been identified within the Northwest Plaza, all of them date to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p401"&gt;Chocón 2008, p.401.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northwest Plaza Structure 1''' has a rectangular base measuring {{convert|44|m|ft}} east-west by {{convert|25|m|ft}} north-south and standing {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p403"&gt;Chocón 2008, p.403.&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest level of the platform body has an inclining ''talud'' wall.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"/&gt; A {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} wide stairway projects {{convert|2|m|ft}} from the wall of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Chocón 2008, pp.401, 403.&lt;/ref&gt; The stairways was built during the earliest construction phase of the plaza, rising from the lowest plaza level.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p403"/&gt; After the second surfacing of the plaza an unusual inclining ''talud''-style [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] was added to the stairway.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p403"/&gt; At the same time a small bench-type structure was attached to the west side of the platform in order to widen the lower level of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1994, p.383. Chocón 2008, p.403.&lt;/ref&gt; The small blocks used in this extension contrast with the large, finely dressed blocks used in the main structure.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p403"/&gt; Potsherds recovered from the structure mainly represent Late to Terminal Classic utilitarian wares, with additional fragments representing a Postclassic occupation of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Chocón 2008, pp.403-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northwest Plaza Structure 2''' is a {{convert|5.5|m|ft|adj=on}} high pyramid on the west side of the plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Chocón 2008, pp.400, 404, 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Its base measures {{convert|30|by|24|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p408"/&gt; The architectural quality of the pyramid was poor, as demonstrated by the small, irregular blocks used in construction, and it has been badly damaged by the collapse of its sides.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p404"/&gt; These blocks average {{convert|10|cm|in}} on each side.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p406"&gt;Chocón 2008, p.406.&lt;/ref&gt; The pyramid has also been damaged by a looters' pit on the west side of the structure.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p408"&gt;Chocón 2008, p.408.&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural detail has been largely obliterated by the pyramid's poor state of preservation, but inset corners have been identified on the north and south sides.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p408"/&gt; Surface ceramic finds all date to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p408"/&gt; Artefacts recovered include portions of a ceramic [[Censer|incense burner]] and broken obsidian [[prismatic blade]]s.&lt;ref name="Chocon08p408"/&gt;

====Southeast Plaza====
'''Southeast Plaza Structure 1''' is a rectangular platform with at least two levels.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"/&gt; It has been dated to the Late Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"/&gt;

====Groups 13 and 15====
'''Group 13''' and '''Group 15''' are located just outside the protected archaeological zone, opposite the custodian's house.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap58"/&gt; Group 15 is situated immediately north of Group 13 and some structures are shared by both groups.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap59"/&gt; Ceramic fragments recovered from the two groups have been dated to the Late Preclassic, Late Classic, Terminal Classic and Postclassic, with the majority dating to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap59"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group 15 Structure 2''' is a rectangular platform with a projecting stairway.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap60"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005a, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; It measures {{convert|18|by|7.2|m|ft}} with a projecting stairway that measures {{convert|9|by|1.2|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap60"/&gt; A few domestic ceramics were recovered during excavations.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap60"/&gt;

'''Group 15 Structure 5''' was found to have a [[midden]] near the northwest corner from which were excavated a large amount of Terminal Classic potsherds together with a few pieces dating to the Postclassic Period.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap60"/&gt;

====Group 18====
This group is a residential group to the northeast of the site core.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"/&gt; Four low structures were built upon a basal platform, largely clustered on the east side.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"/&gt; The plaza area had an area of {{convert|300|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"/&gt; The plaza had two construction phases, the earliest dating to the Late Preclassic Period and the second to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"/&gt; Burial 68 was found in the centre of the plaza, under the earlier floor level.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt;

'''Group 18 Structure 1''' is on the north side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94387"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.387.&lt;/ref&gt; It was severely damaged when a modern street was laid out, cutting through its north side.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"/&gt; Only the south wall remains.&lt;ref name="Morales94386"/&gt;

'''Group 18 Structure 2''' is on the east side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94387"/&gt; Its earliest phase dates to the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref name="Morales94387"/&gt; The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west.&lt;ref name="Morales94387"/&gt; A later construction phase was built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.388.&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[pyrite]] disc was found near the front wall.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt;

'''Group 18 Structure 3''' is a rectangular platform located on the south side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94387"/&gt; The core consists of large pieces of rubble that suggest some kind of older substructure.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; The platform has been dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt;

'''Group 18 Structure 4''' is situated on the west side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94387"/&gt;

====Group 21====
This group is located to the north of the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; The layout of the group is difficult to discern due to destruction caused by the construction of a street, although two low structures survive.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; Group 21 is distinguished by being the only group outside of the ceremonial centre of the city to possess stone monuments, the badly eroded Stela 10 and Altar 6.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt;

====Other structures====
The various minor residential groups, including Groups 7 through to 12, were formed by clusters of very small structures with platforms not exceeding {{convert|1|m|ft}} in height.&lt;ref name="Morales499"&gt;Morales 1995, p.499.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups 4 to 6, 13 to 17, 20 to 24, 26 and 52 all date to the Late and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94390"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.390.&lt;/ref&gt; Late Preclassic ceramics were recovered from Group 23.&lt;ref name="Morales94390"/&gt;

===Municipal Sector and E-Group===
The '''Municipal Sector''' is the area north of the highway running from Flores to Dolores.&lt;ref name="Quezada983"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this sector actually falls within the municipality of Santa Ana.&lt;ref name="Quezada983"/&gt; Eighteen residential groups have been mapped in this sector.&lt;ref name="Quezada983"/&gt; These residential groups are clustered around a group of larger structures forming an [[E-Group]] ceremonial complex, located {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the site core.&lt;ref name="Quezada983"/&gt;

The '''E-Group''' consists of a number of structures around a small plaza.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"/&gt; These include a pyramid at the west side, a long structure on the east side supporting an upper platform and two smaller structures on the north and south sides.&lt;ref&gt;Quezada et al 1998, pp.4, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The E-Group was first built in the Late Preclassic Period, it was lightly occupied during the Early Classic and was then expanded with the addition of two structures in the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"/&gt; By this time major activity at El Chal had been transferred to the area around the acropolis, leaving the once central E-Group on the periphery.&lt;ref name="Quezada9812"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East Platform''' of the E-Group has produced ceramics dating to the Late Preclassic, Early Classic and Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada987"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, pp.7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The East Platform was built from limestone blocks and was accessed via a stairway at the rear of the building that projected {{convert|6|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;Quezada et al 1998, pp.7,11.&lt;/ref&gt; This stairway climbed a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} wide projection from the rear of the building.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"/&gt; The east platform does not support the usual lateral structures found at E-Groups, with the Central Platform being the only upper platform upon the basal platform.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"/&gt;

The '''Central Platform''' of the E-Group is situated upon the middle section of the East Platform.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"/&gt; It has produced ceramics dated to the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref name="Quezada989"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The platform has a total height of {{convert|8|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''West Pyramid''' of the E-Group produced ceramic evidence dating the Late Preclassic, Early Classic and Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada989"/&gt; Although the limestone blocks used for its construction are very poorly preserved, the West Pyramid is believed to have been a radial pyramid dating to the Late Preclassic Period.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"/&gt;

The '''North Structure''' of the E-Group has not been securely dated but is believed to date to the Late Classic, based on comparisons with E-Groups at other Maya cities.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"/&gt;

The '''South Structure''' of the E-Group has not been securely dated but is also believed to have been built in the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9811"/&gt;

===Arrepentimiento Sector===
The '''Arrepentimiento Sector''' is located beside the highway running from El Chal to [[Santa Elena, El Petén|Santa Elena]].&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains about 40 groups of structures concentrated upon karstic hills, with lesser occupation in low-lying areas.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; Settlement extends northwards from the highway for about {{convert|600|m|ft}} until the dry riverbed of the Río El Chal.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; The majority of the architectural groups are located among cattle pasture.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; Some of the groups have been heavily looted, mostly those groups covered by dense vegetation.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; Those groups in open pasture have not been subject to looting but have suffered from the stripping of their stonework in order to use it in modern construction.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt;

The arhcitectural groups of the Arrepentimiento Sector are residential in nature, with low platforms measuring between {{convert|10|and|40|cm|in}} high laid out around patios with alignments of uncut stones.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; The structures in these groups date to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt;

The North Mound of Group 1 and the South Mound of Group 2 are the only structures that are greater than {{convert|1|m|ft}} in height.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt;

===Panorama Sector===
[[File:Petén savannah 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Petén savanna used for cattle ranching, similar to the terrain of Panorama Sector]]
This sector is located within the lands owned by Finca Panorama, some {{convert|3|km|mi}} from El Chal along the highway towards Santa Elena.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; The altitude is very close to that of the site core, averaging {{convert|270|m|ft}} above mean sea level.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; Panorama Sector occupies an area of cattle pasture with very few trees but a great many [[Attalea cohune|Corozo Palms]], the fruit of which is used locally to produce [[Vegetable fats and oils|vegetable oil]].&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; The northern part of the sector possesses a number of hills upon which residential groups were built, while towards the south the land descends towards an area of unoccupied seasonal swamps.&lt;ref name="Quezada9815"/&gt; Panorama Sector possesses 53 architectural groups, 34 of which are in the periphery, together with a [[sacbe|causeway]].&lt;ref&gt;Quezada et al 1998, pp.15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the ceramic fragments recovered from Panorama Sector, 374 pieces have been dated to the Late Classic, representing 62% of the total ceramics found in the sector.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; The vast majority of these are domestic in nature.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; 234 pieces were dated to the Terminal Classic, representing the remaining 38%.&lt;ref name="Quezada9818"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group 4''' is located {{convert|80|m|ft}} west of Group 1.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of three structures arranged around a courtyard that is open on the south side.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Structure 1 is the largest structure in the group.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Structures 2 and 3 have been looted.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; The group has been dated to the Late Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt;

'''Group 5''' is {{convert|500|m|ft}} southwest of Group 1.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; It consists of three structures laid out around a patio that is open of the east side.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Group 5 is dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt;

'''Group 6''' is {{convert|30|m|ft}} south of Group 1.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Like Group 5 it consists of three structures laid out around a courtyard that is open on the east side.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Group 6 is dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt;

'''Group 7''' is located on a hillside to the east of Group 15.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; It consists of five structures completely enclosing a patio.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Structure 1, on the north side, and Structure 5, on the west side, are the largest structures in the group.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Structures 1, 2 and 3 have all been looted.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Group 7 dates to the Late Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt;

'''Group 9''' is {{convert|20|m|ft}} south of Group 7.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; It consists of 5 structures, four of them are small while the west structure is larger.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; This group is dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt;

'''Group 10''' is on a hillside to the southeast of Group 9.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; It consists of four structures forming an enclosed patio group and dates to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt;

'''Group 15A''' is located on an artificial platform formed by levelling a natural elevation.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; The group is formed of six structures, four of these are large and enclose a patio.&lt;ref name="Quezada9816"/&gt; Two smaller structures are located to the southeast and southwest.&lt;ref name="Quezada981617"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, pp.16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been looted, recovered ceramics date to the Late and Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"&gt;Quezada et al 1998, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Group 15B''' is situated on the south side of the same artificial platform that supports Groups 15A and 15C.&lt;ref name="Quezada981617"/&gt;

'''Group 15C''' is situated at the south end of the same artificial platform that supports Group 15A.&lt;ref name="Quezada981617"/&gt; It is composed of three structures arranged around a patio that is open on the north side.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; Group 15C has been dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt;

'''Group 16''' has not been excavated but is notable for a {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on}} long causeway running north-south past its plaza.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; The causeway is {{convert|9|m|ft}} wide and bordered by {{convert|20|cm|in|adj=on}} high parapets.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; The original length of the causeway has not been determined.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; The plaza itself is bordered by the remains of walls that stand {{convert|15|to|20|cm|in}} high.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt;

'''Group 19''' consists of three structures laid out around a patio that is open on the south side.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; The group has been tentatively identified as a stone workshop due to the great quantity of waste product found there, and it may have produced flint cores.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; Group 19 has been dated to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; Stela 19 and Altar 9 were found {{convert|40|m|ft}} east of Group 9. They are the only monuments that have been found in Panorama Sector.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt;

===Monuments===
Nineteen carved stone monuments were originally found at El Chal, all of which are badly eroded.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1995, pp.494, 496.&lt;/ref&gt; Various monuments are broken into fragments.&lt;ref name="Morales496"/&gt; Only five [[Maya stelae|stelae]] and three altars bore sculpted designs.&lt;ref name="Morales496"/&gt; The stelae exhibit a variety of forms but all the altars are circular.&lt;ref name="Morales496"/&gt; None of the [[Maya script|hieroglyphic texts]] found on the monuments of El Chal have yet been deciphered.&lt;ref name="Morales496"/&gt; The sculptural style of the monuments is similar to that of 8th century monuments from [[Sacul, El Petén|Sacul]], [[Ucanal]] and [[Naranjo]].&lt;ref name="Morales499"/&gt;

'''Stela 1''' was found at the west side the West Plaza, at the base of Structure 4.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp108"/&gt; It was associated with Altar 7.&lt;ref name="Morales496"/&gt; The stela is broken into various fragments and was sculpted with a rectangular frame containing the portrait of a standing person with an elaborate feathered headdress, holding a staff in his right hand.&lt;ref name="Morales496497"&gt;Morales 1995, pp.496-497.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure is accompanied by a vertical hieroglyphic panel containing a [[Maya calendar|calendrical date]].&lt;ref&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p.117. Morales 1995, p.497.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is badly eroded but the numbers 10 and 13 can be read.&lt;ref name="Morales497"&gt;Morales 1995, p.497.&lt;/ref&gt; The stela was resting upon the last construction phase of the plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; Stela 1 measured {{convert|1.75|m|ft}} high by {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} wide and was {{convert|0.35|m|ft}} thick.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp115"/&gt; The best preserved fragment, that possessing the sculpted portrait, was moved to the [[Museo Regional del Sureste de Petén]] ("Southeastern Petén Regional Museum") in Dolores in 2005.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp117"&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; This fragment measured {{convert|1.75|m|ft}} high by {{convert|0.66|m|ft}} wide and was {{convert|0.35|m|ft}} thick.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp117"/&gt; Five stela fragments were left where they had fallen, they contained parts of the frame and of the feathered headdress.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp117"/&gt; The central pieces of the stela were not found during the excavations that took place in 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp117"/&gt;

'''Stela 2''' was found in centre of the West Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales495497"&gt;Morales 1995, pp.495, 497.&lt;/ref&gt; The butt of this stela was found in its original location, although the shaft has broken and fallen backwards.&lt;ref name="Morales496497"/&gt; Stela 2 does not appear to have had any sculpted designs or text.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; It was associated with Altar 1.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt;

'''Stela 3''' was found in the West Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales495"/&gt;  Stela 3 was originally erected at the base of Structure 3.&lt;ref name="Morales496497"/&gt; It was sculpted with a rounded frame containing the figure of a person facing left and accompanied by a badly eroded and completely illegible hieroglyphic text.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; Stela 3 had been moved from its original location and was associated with Altar 2.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt;

[[File:El Chal 3.jpg|thumb|right|Stela 4, front, showing a king standing upon three war captives. Altar 3 is in the foreground.]]
'''Stela 4''' was found in the northern part of the East Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic text with a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's [[Maya script#Emblem glyphs|Emblem Glyph]].&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; This side of the stela depicts a Maya [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting ritual]] with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at [[Naranjo]].&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; A child or youth is seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold something in their hands that cannot now be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is different, with the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; This probably indicates that both sides were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the floor level of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt;

[[File:El Chal 6.jpg|thumb|left|Stela 5]]
'''Stela 5''' was situated at the base of Structure 1 in the East Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; The figure is standing with the legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt;

'''Stela 6''', '''Stela 7''', '''Stela 8''' and '''Stela 9''' are all either fragments or butts of stelae that were removed in the 1970s by FYDEP and are now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 1995, pp.494, 498.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these stelae fragments are situated in the southern half of the East Plaza, with Stela 6 to the east and Stela 9 to the west.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt;

'''Stela 6''' is broken into multiple pieces that are scattered at the base of East Plaza Structure 2.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap48"/&gt; It was a plain limestone monument.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Ap48"/&gt;

'''Stela 10''' was found in Group 21 together with Altar 6. They are among the very few monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; Stela 10 was carved with a frame containing a figure, now badly eroded.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; The figure is standing with feet separated and turned outwards. Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; Stela 10 had been moved from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt;

'''Stela 11''' was found at the base of one of the structures in the Southeast Plaza, it was a plain monument.&lt;ref name="Morales496498"&gt;Morales 1995, pp.496, 498.&lt;/ref&gt; Stela 11 has fallen and is lying on its back.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"/&gt;

'''Stela 12''' was found with Altar 9 some {{convert|40|m|ft}} east of Group 19 and {{convert|350|m|ft}} south of the highway to Flores, in Panorama Sector.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; They are the only monuments to have been found in Panorama Sector.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; Stela 12 is a plain monument sculpted from limestone. It has fallen from its upright position and is half buried.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; It is broken in the middle and measures {{convert|2|m|ft}} long by {{convert|0.8|m|ft}} wide by {{convert|0.3|m|ft}} thick.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt;

'''Altar 1''' was found in centre of the West Plaza, together with Stela 2.&lt;ref name="Morales495497"/&gt; This altar was found in its original location. It was a plain monument.&lt;ref name="Morales496497"/&gt;

'''Altar 2''' was found in the West Plaza, where it was associated with Stela 3 at the base of Structure 3.&lt;ref name="Morales495497"/&gt; Altar 2 was a plain monument and had been moved from its original location.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt;

'''Altar 3''' was found in the northern part of the East Plaza, where it was associated with Stela 4.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; It was sculpted although it is now badly eroded.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; It bears the images of two seated anthropomorphic figures but further details cannot be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt;

[[File:Guate Sep-Oct 2010 813.jpg|thumb|right|The badly eroded Altar 4]]
'''Altar 4''' is a circular monument.&lt;ref name="Morales9315"/&gt; It was also found in the northern part of the East Plaza and was associated with Stela 4.&lt;ref name="Morales497498"&gt;Morales 1995, pp.497-498.&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts three seated prisoners, the central figure is facing to the left while the other two are facing inwards towards him.&lt;ref name="Morales498"&gt;Morales 1995, p.498.&lt;/ref&gt; Hieroglyphic texts are carved underneath the prisoners and upon the sides of the altar.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; The altar has been dated on stylistic grounds to the latter part of the 8th century AD.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt;

'''Altar 5''' was found in the East Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales497498"/&gt; It has been broken into various pieces and is badly eroded but is believed to have been sculpted with a scene similar to that represented on Altar 4.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt;

'''Altar 6''' is a plain monument that was found in Group 21 together with Stela 10.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; Like its associated stela it had been moved from its original location in antiquity but was probably not moved far.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt;

'''Altar 7''' was found in the West Plaza at the base of Structure 4 together with Stela 1.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes &amp; Laporte 2005b, pp.115, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The altar is plain, without sculpted figures or text and rests upon the last construction phase of the plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales497"/&gt; It was circular and measured {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} in diameter and was {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp117"/&gt; It is broken in three parts.&lt;ref name="ReyesLaporte05Bp117"/&gt;

'''Altar 8''' was found in its original location in the Southeast Plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales496498"/&gt; It was a plain altar without signs of being sculpted.&lt;ref name="Morales498"/&gt; The monument is badly cracked.&lt;ref name="Morales94383"/&gt;

'''Altar 9''' was found with Stela 12 in Panorama Sector, near Group 19.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; It is located {{convert|10|cm|in}} from one end of Stela 12 and is also a plain monument.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; It is a circular altar, broken in fragments and half buried.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; It measures {{convert|60|cm|in}} in diameter and {{convert|45|cm|in}} thick.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt; Only the upper {{convert|20|cm|in}} are exposed.&lt;ref name="Quezada9817"/&gt;

'''Altar 11''' was found in its original location.&lt;ref name="Morales496"/&gt;

===Burials===
'''Burial 67''' was found in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The skeleton was lying on its back with the head towards the north.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; Of the skull only some dental remains were found.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The facial features of the figures are unusual.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer.&lt;ref name="Morales94384"/&gt; The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94385"&gt;Morales et al 1994, p.385.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 68''' was found in the centre of the Group 18 plaza.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; The corpse was poorly preserved, it was laid out on its back with the skull towards the north.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; The remains were covered with small pieces of limestone mixed with brown soil.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; Four ceramic pieces were deposited as an offering; two plates, an earthenware bowl and a bowl.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt;

'''Burial 69''' was found in front of the base of Group 18 Structure 2.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; The remains were extremely poorly preserved but the deceased may have been laid out on their back with the head towards the north.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; Associated funerary offerings included a tripod plate, a polychrome vase and a flint projectile point.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt; The burial was securely dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Morales94388"/&gt;

'''Burial 264''' was found in a cist under the earliest level of the stucco flooring of Terrace 2 Structure 2, a pyramid on the acropolis.&lt;ref name="Corzo0589"/&gt; The cist was built from stone slabs and measured {{convert|0.7|by|0.6|m|ft}} by {{convert|1.4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Corzo0589"/&gt; The human remains consist of some skull fragments and some pieces of the longbones, with the skull at the east end.&lt;ref name="Corzo0589"/&gt; The offering consisted of a ceramic pot with lid dated to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref name="Corzo0589"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14641">The [[English language]] is sometimes described as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of computing. In comparison to other sciences, where [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] are the principal sources of vocabulary, [[computer science]] borrows more extensively from English. Due to the technical limitations of early computers, and the lack of international standards on the [[Internet]], computer users were limited to using English and the Latin alphabet. However, this historical limitation is less present today. Most software products are [[Internationalization and localization|localized]] in numerous languages and the use of the [[Unicode]] character encoding has resolved problems with non-Latin alphabets. Some limitations have only been changed recently, such as with [[domain name]]s, which previously allowed only [[ASCII]] characters.

==Influence on other languages==
The computing terminology of many languages borrows from English. Some language communities resist actively to that trend, and in other cases English is used extensively and more directly. This section gives some examples for the use of English terminology in other languages, and also mentions any notable differences.

===Bulgarian===
Both English and Russian have influence over [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] computing vocabulary. However, in many cases the borrowed terminology is translated, and not transcribed phonetically. Combined with the use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] this can make it difficult to recognize loanwords. For example, the Bulgarian term for [[motherboard]] is 'дънна платка' (IPA /danna platka/ or literally "bottom board").

* компютър /kompiutar/ – computer
* твърд диск /tvard disk/ – hard disk
* дискета /disketa/ – [[floppy disk]]; like the French disquette
* уеб сайт /web sait/ – web site; but also "интернет страница" /internet page/

===Faroese===
The [[Faroese language]] has a sparse scientific vocabulary ''based on the language itself''. Many Faroese scientific words are borrowed and/or modified versions of especially Nordic and English equivalents. The vocabulary is constantly evolving and thus new words often die out, and only a few survive and become widely used. Examples of successful words include e.g. "telda" (computer), "kurla" (at sign) and "ambætari" (server).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmn.fo/listar/teldord/teldord-f-e-d3.htm List of Faroese-English-Danish IT words]&lt;/ref&gt;

===French===
{{see also|Franglais}}
In [[French language|French]], there are some generally accepted English loan-words, but there is also a distinct effort to avoid them. In France, the [[Académie française]] is responsible for the standardisation of the language and often coins new technological terms. Some of them are accepted in practice, in other cases the English loanwords remain predominant. In Quebec, the [[Office québécois de la langue française]] has a similar function.

* ''email/mail'' (in Europe); ''courriel'' (mainly in [[French-speaking Canada]], but increasingly used in French-speaking Europe); ''mél.'' (only used as an abbreviation, similar to "tél."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academie-francaise.fr/questions-de-langue#26_strong-em-courriel-ml-em-strong "Questions de langue" on the Académie Française's website]&lt;/ref&gt;); more formally ''courrier électronique''
* ''pourriel'' – spam
* ''hameçonnage'', phishing – phishing
* ''télécharger'' – to download
* ''site web'' – website
* ''lien'', ''hyperlien'' – website [[hyper-link]]
* ''base de données'' – database
* ''caméra web'', ''webcaméra'', short ''webcam'' – webcam
* ''amorcer'', ''démarrer'', ''booter'' – to boot
* ''redémarrer'', ''rebooter'' – to reboot
* ''arrêter'', ''éteindre'' – to shut down
* ''amorçable'', ''bootable'' – bootable
* ''surfréquençage'', ''surcadençage'', overclocking – overclocking
* ''refroidissement à l'eau'' – watercooling
* ''tuning PC'' – [[case modding]]

=== German ===
{{see also|Denglisch}}
In [[German language|German]], English words are very often used as well:
* nouns: Computer, Website, Software, E-Mail, Blog
* verbs: downloaden, booten, crashen

=== Icelandic ===
The [[Icelandic language]] has [[Icelandic vocabulary#Modern neologisms|its own vocabulary of scientific terms]], still English borrowings exist. English or Icelandicised words are mostly used in casual conversations, whereas the Icelandic words might be longer or not widespread.

=== Norwegian ===
It's quite common to use English words in regards to computing in all Scandinavian languages.

nouns: keyboard, webside, mail, software, blogg, spam

verbs: å boote, å spamme, å blogge

=== Polish ===
[[Polish language]] words derived from English:
* ''[[wikt:dżojstik|dżojstik]]'': [[joystick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sjp.pwn.pl/slownik/2562347/joystick|title=dżojstik|publisher=[[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN]]|work=[[Słownik języka polskiego]]|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[:pl:wikt:kartridż|kartrydż, kartridż]]'': [[wikt:cartridge|cartridge]]
* ''[[:pl:wikt:interfejs|interfejs]]'': [[interface (computing)|interface]]
* ''[[wikt:mejl|mejl]]'': [[e-mail]]

=== Russian ===
* [[History of computer hardware in Soviet Bloc countries]]
* [[Computer Russification]]

=== Spanish ===
The English influence on the software industry and the internet in Latin America has borrowed significantly from the Castilian lexicon.

;Frequently untranslated, and their Spanish equivalent
*email: ''correo electrónico''
*mouse (only in Latin America): ''ratón'' (mainly in Spain)
*messenger: ''mensajero''
*webcam: ''cámara web''
*website: ''página web, sitio web''
*blog: ''bitácora'', 'blog'
*ban/banned: ''vetar, vetado''
*web: ''red''

;Not translated
*flog

;Undecided
Many computing terms in Spanish share a common root with their English counterpart. In these cases, both terms are understood, but the Spanish is preferred for formal use:
*link vs ''enlace'' or ''vínculo''
*net vs ''red''

== Character encoding ==
The early computer software and hardware had very little support for alphabets other than the Latin. As a result of this it was difficult or impossible to represent languages based on other scripts. The [[ASCII]] character encoding, created in the 1960s, only supported 128 different characters. With the use of additional software it was possible to provide support for some languages, for instance those based on the Cyrillic alphabet. However, complex-script languages like Chinese or Japanese need more characters than the 256 limit imposed by 8-bit character encodings. Some computers created in the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had native support for the Cyrillic alphabet.

The wide adoption of [[Unicode]], and [[UTF-8]] on the web, resolved most of these historical limitations. ASCII remains the de facto standard for command interpreters, [[programming language]]s and text-based communication protocols.

* [[Mojibake]] – Text presented as "unreadable" when software fails due to character encoding issues.

== Programming language ==
{{see also|Non-English-based programming languages}}
The syntax of most programming languages uses English keywords, and therefore it could be argued some knowledge of English is required in order to use them. However, it is important to recognize all [[programming languages]] are in the class of [[formal languages]]. They are very different from any natural language, including English.

Some examples of non-English programming languages:

* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: [[ARLOGO]], [[Qalb (programming language)|قلب]] 
* [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: [[BangaBhasha]]
* [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: [[Chinese BASIC]]
* [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: [[Superlogo]]
* [[French language|French]]: [[LSE (programming language)|LSE]], [[WinDev]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal (although the English version is more widespread)]]
* [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: [[Hebrew Programming Language]]
* [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: [[Fjölnir (programming language)|Fjölnir]]
* [[Languages of India|Indian Languages]]: [[Hindawi Programming System]]
* [[Russian language|Russian]]: [[Glagol]]
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: [[Lexico]]

== Communication protocols ==
Many application protocols use text strings for requests and parameters, rather than the binary values commonly used in lower layer protocols.  The request strings are generally based on English words, although in some cases the strings are contractions or acronyms of English expressions, which renders them somewhat cryptic to anyone not familiar with the protocol, whatever their proficiency in English.  Nevertheless, the use of word-like strings is a convenient mnemonic device that allows a person skilled in the art (and with sufficient knowledge of English) to execute the protocol manually from a keyboard, usually for the purpose of finding a problem with the service.

Examples:
* [[FTP]]: USER, PASS (password), PASV (passive), PORT, RETR (retrieve), STOR (store), QUIT
* [[SMTP]]: HELO (hello), MAIL, RCPT (recipient), DATA, QUIT
* [[HTTP]]: GET, PUT, POST, HEAD (headers), DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS

It is notable that response codes, that is, the strings sent back by the recipient of a request, are typically numeric: for instance, in HTTP (and some borrowed by other protocols)
* '''200 OK'''                   request succeeded
* '''301 Moved Permanently'''    to redirect the request to a new address
* '''404 Not Found'''            the requested page does not exist

This is because response codes also need to convey unambiguous information, but can have various nuances that the requester may optionally use to vary its subsequent actions.  To convey all such "sub-codes" with alphabetic words would be unwieldy, and negate the advantage of using pseudo-English words.  Since responses are usually generated by software they do not need to be mnemonic.  Numeric codes are also more easily analysed and categorised when they are processed by software, instead of a human testing the protocol by manual input.

== Localization ==
{{see also|Internationalization and localization}}

=== BIOS ===
Many personal computers have a [[BIOS]] chip, displaying text in English during boot time.

=== Keyboard shortcut ===
[[Keyboard shortcut]]s are usually defined in terms of English keywords such as [[CTRL+F]] for [[Find (Unix)|find]].

== English on the World Wide Web ==
{{see also|Internet slang|Languages used on the Internet}}
[[English language|English]] is the largest language on the [[World Wide Web]], with 27% of internet users.

=== English speakers ===
Web user percentages usually focus on raw comparisons of the first language of those who access the web. Just as important is a consideration of second- and foreign-language users; i.e., the first language of a user does not necessarily reflect which language he or she regularly employs when using the web.

==== Native speakers ====
English-language users appear to be a plurality of web users, consistently cited as around one-third of the overall (near one billion). This reflects the relative affluence of English-speaking countries and high Internet penetration rates in them. This lead may be eroding due mainly to a rapid increase of Chinese users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/online/archives/2005/08/16/english_grip_on_internet_being_eroded.html English grip on internet being eroded | Technology | Guardian Unlimited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

First-language users among other relatively affluent countries appear generally stable, the two largest being German and Japanese, which each have between 5% and 10% of the overall share.

=== World Wide Web content ===
One widely quoted figure for the amount of [[web content]] in English is 80%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishenglish.com/english_facts_8.htm What percentage of the internet is in English?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources show figures five to fifteen points lower, though still well over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Usage of content languages for websites|url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language/all|work=W3Techs.com|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verisign.com/press_releases/pr/page_029135.html |title=News |website=Symantec |accessdate=31 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224063055/http://www.verisign.com/press_releases/pr/page_029135.html |archivedate=24 December 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2001/112101/English_could_snowball_on_Net_112101.html English could snowball on Net TRN 112101&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are two notable facts about these percentages:

The English web content is greater than the number of first-language English users by as much as 2 to 1.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Given the enormous lead it already enjoys and its increasing use as a ''lingua franca'' in other spheres, English web content may continue to dominate even as English first-language Internet users decline. This is a classic [[positive feedback loop]]: new Internet users find it helpful to learn English and employ it online, thus reinforcing the language's prestige and forcing subsequent new users to learn English as well.

Certain other factors (some predating the medium's appearance) have propelled English into a majority web-content position. Most notable in this regard is the tendency for researchers and professionals to publish in English to ensure maximum exposure. The largest database of medical bibliographical information, for example, shows English was the majority language choice for the past forty years and its share has continually increased over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1175804 Language and country preponderance trends in MEDLINE and its causes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that non-Anglophones regularly publish in English only reinforces the language's dominance. English has a rich technical vocabulary (largely because native and non-native speakers alike use it to communicate technical ideas) and many IT and technical professionals use English regardless of country of origin ([[Linus Torvalds]], for instance, comments his code in English, despite being from Finland and having Swedish as his first language).

{{Fantasy}}
'''Fantastic art''' is a broad and loosely defined [[art]] [[genre]].&lt;ref name="jahsonic" /&gt; It is not restricted to a specific school of artists, geographical location or historical period.  It can be characterised by subject matter – which portrays non-realistic, mystical, [[mythical]] or [[folklore|folkloric]] subjects or events – and style, which is representational and naturalistic, rather than abstract - or in the case of magazine illustrations and similar, in the style of [[graphic novel]] art such as [[manga]].

Fantasy has been an integral part of art since its beginnings,&lt;ref name="Schurian"/&gt; but has been particularly important in [[mannerism]], [[magic realism|magic realist]] painting, [[romantic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[surrealism]] and [[lowbrow (art movement)|lowbrow]]. In French, the genre is called le [[fantastique]], in English it is sometimes referred to as ''visionary art'', ''grotesque art'' or [[mannerism|mannerist art]]. It has had a deep and circular interaction with [[fantasy literature]].

The subject matter of Fantastic Art may resemble the product of hallucinations, and Fantastic artist [[Richard Dadd]] spent much of his life in mental institutions.  [[Salvador Dalí]] famously said: "the only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=thinkexist.com |url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_only_difference_between_me_and_a_madman_is/175604.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130804105007/http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_only_difference_between_me_and_a_madman_is/175604.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some recent Fantastic Art draws on the artist's experience, or purported experience, of [[hallucinogenic drugs]].

The term '''Fantasy Art''' is closely related, and is applied primarily to recent art (typically 20th century onwards) inspired by, or illustrating, fantasy literature.  The term has acquired some pejorative overtones.

Fantastic art has traditionally been largely confined to painting and illustration, but since the 1970s has increasingly been found also in photography. Fantastic art explores fantasy, imagination, the dream state, the [[grotesque]], visions and the uncanny,&lt;ref name="Schurian"&gt;Schurian, Walter (2005) Beyond Mere Understanding. In: ''Fantastic Art'', Schurian, W. &amp; Grosenick, U. (Ed.), [[Taschen]], p.6-25. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-2954-7}} (English edition)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as so-called "[[Goth]]" art.

==Related genres==
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}
Genres which may also be considered as Fantastic Art include the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of the [[Victorian era]], and [[Surrealism]].  Works based on classical mythology, which have been a staple of European art from the [[Renaissance]] period, also arguably meet the definition of Fantastic Art, as art based on modern mythology such as [[JRR Tolkien]]'s [[Middle Earth]] mythos unquestionably does.  [[Religious art]] also depicts supernatural or miraculous subjects in a naturalistic way, but is not generally regarded as Fantastic Art.

== Historic artists and fine artists ==
Many artists have produced works which fit the definition of fantastic art.  Some, such as [[Nicholas Roerich]], worked almost exclusively in the genre, others such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]], who has been described as the first "fantastic" artist in the Western tradition,&lt;ref name="Schurian"/&gt;  produced works both with and without fantastic elements, and for artists such as [[Francisco de Goya]], fantastic works were only a small part of their output.  Others again such as [[René Magritte]] are usually classed as Surrealists but use fantastic elements in their work. It is therefore impossible to give an exhaustive list of fantastic artists, but a selection of major and influential figures is listed below.&lt;ref name=jahsonic&gt;{{cite web|title=Jahsonic, a vocabulary of culture|url=http://www.jahsonic.com/FantasticArt.html|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=David (ed.)|title=Fantastic Art|year=1973|publisher=Pan Ballantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
The rise of [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] "pulp" magazines demanded artwork to illustrate stories and (via cover art) to promote sales.  This led to a movement of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] artists prior to and during the Great Depression, as anthologised by [[Vincent Di Fate]], himself a prolific SF and [[space]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Fato|first=Vincent|title=Infinite Worlds: The Fantastic Visions of Science Fiction Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in the 1930s, a group of Wisconsin artists inspired by the Surrealist movement of Europe created their own brand of fantastic art. They included [[Madison, Wisconsin]]-based artists Marshall Glasier, Dudley Huppler and [[John Wilde]]; Karl Priebe of [[Milwaukee]] and [[Gertrude Abercrombie]] of [[Chicago]]. Their art combined macabre humor, mystery and irony &lt;ref&gt;Sara Krajewski, “Surreal Wisconsin: Surrealism and its Legacy of Wisconsin Art,” Madison Art Center, 1998  http://members.aol.com/MenuBar/surreal/surreal.htm accessed 3/26/2003&lt;/ref&gt; which was in direct and pointed contradiction to the [[American Regionalism]] then in vogue.

In postwar [[Chicago]], the art movement [[Chicago Imagism]] produced many fantastic and grotesque paintings, which were little noted because they did not conform to New York [[abstract art]] fashions of the time.  Major imagists include [[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]], [[Gladys Nilsson]], [[Jim Nutt]], [[Ed Paschke]], and [[Karl Wirsum]].&lt;ref name=Vine&gt;Richard Vine, "Where the Wild Things Were", ''[[Art in America]]'', May 1997, pp. 98-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple''' also Gavipuram Cave Temple, an example of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]], is located in [[Bangalore]] in the state of [[Karnataka]] in [[India]]. The temple is famous for its mysterious stone discs in the forecourt and the exact planning allowing the sun to shine on shrine in certain time of the year. It was built in the 16th-century by [[Kempe Gowda I]], the founder of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shastry|first1=Vyasa|title=The mysteries of Bengaluru’s famed Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple|url=http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/X3uvXrojiRaPr31fhf6IQI/The-mysteries-of-Bengalurus-famed-Gavi-Gangadhareshwara-tem.html|work=Livemint|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple==
This cave temple dedicated to [[Shiva]] in Bengaluru is a well visited temple. Built in the 16th century AD by Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bengaluru, Temple Gavi Gangadhareshwara is an architectural marvel that attracts the faithful by the hordes. One of the oldest temples in Bengaluru, Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple was built by Kempe Gowda in recognition after being released from prison of five years by Rama Raya. There are other idols inside idol Agnimurthi including having two heads, seven hands and three legs. Those who worship this deity believe will cure one of the defects of the eye. The temple is also known for its four monolithic pillars, representing [[Damaru]], [[Trishula|Trishul]] and two fans on the patio.

Built in a natural cave in Gavipuram, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and cut into a monolithic stone. The courtyard of the temple here contains several monolithic sculptures. The main attractions of Gavi Gangadhareshvara temple are two granite pillars that support the giant disk of the sun and moon, while the other two have a number of Nandi at the top.

On the occasion of [[Makar Sankranti]], temple witnesses a unique phenomenon in the evening sunlight passes through an arc between the horns of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] and falls directly on the [[linga]] inside the cave and illuminating the interior idol. This phenomenon is a proof of the technical excellence of the ancient architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illumination of shrine by the Sun ==
Thousands of devotees come in mid January every year on [[Makar]] [[sankranti]] Day to this cave temple. This is a special day  when the sunrays fall on the [[Shivalinga]] for one hour as it passes between the horns of the [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]. Such was the knowledge of architecture and astronomy that the ancient sculptors could craft the horns of the stone bull  outside the temple so that the sun's rays would pass through its horns and light up the deity [[Shiva]] [[Linga]] inside the cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Comparison of contemporary structures and earlier drawings by [[Thomas Daniell]] and William Daniell show that earlier the temple has less structures and the Sun illuminated the shrine in summer and winter solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also today the Sun illuminates Shivalinga two times per year - from 13 to 16 January in late afternoons and from 26 November to 2 December.

A '''gord''' is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Slavs|Slavic]] fortified wooden settlement, sometimes known as a '''burgwall''' after the [[German language|German]] term for such sites. Gords were built during the late [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and early [[Iron Age]]s by the [[Lusatian culture]] (c. 1300–500 [[Common Era|BCE]]), and later in the 8th–7th centuries BCE, in what is now [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]], eastern [[Germany]], [[Romania]]/[[Moldova]], [[Belarus]] and western [[Ukraine]]. These settlements were usually founded on strategic sites such as hills, riverbanks, lake islands, or peninsulas.

==Construction and evolution==

A typical gord was a group of wooden houses built either in rows or in circles, surrounded by one or more rings of walls made of earth and wood, a [[palisade]], and/or [[moat]]s. Some gords were ring-shaped, with a round, oval, or occasionally polygonal fence or wall surrounding a hollow. Others, built on a natural hill or a man-made mound, were cone-shaped. Those with a natural defense on one side, such as a river or lake, were usually horseshoe-shaped. Most gords were built in densely populated areas on sites that offered particular natural advantages.

As Slavic tribes united to form states, gords were also built for defensive purposes in less-populated border areas. Gords in which rulers resided or that lay on trade routes quickly expanded. Near the gord, or below it in elevation, there formed small communities of servants, merchants, artisans, and others who served the higher-ranked inhabitants of the gord. Each such community was known as a ''suburbium'' ({{lang-pl|podgrodzie}}). Its residents could shelter within the walls of the gord in the event of danger. Eventually the ''suburbium'' acquired its own fence or wall. In the [[High Middle Ages]], the gord usually evolved into a [[castle]] or [[citadel]] ([[Kremlin (fortification)|kremlin]]) and the ''suburbium'' into a [[town]].

Some gords did not stand the test of time and were abandoned or destroyed, gradually turning into more or less discernible mounds or rings of earth ([[Russian language|Russian]] ''gorodische,'' [[Polish language|Polish]] ''grodzisko,'' [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''horodyshche,'' [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''hradisko,'' [[Czech language|Czech]] ''hradiště,'' and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''gradiška''/''градишка''). Notable archeological sites include [[Biskupin]], Poland; and Bilsk, Ukraine (see [[Gelonus]]).

==Etymology==

The term ultimately descends from the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European]] root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵʰortós|ǵʰortós]]'', enclosure. From this same root come the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word elements *''gard'' and *''gart'' (as in  [[Stuttgart]]), and likely also the names of [[Graz]], [[Austria]] and [[Gartz]], [[Germany]]. Cognate to these are English words such as ''yard'', ''garth'', ''girdle,'' and ''court.''&lt;ref&gt;ON. ''garðr''; goth. gards; den. -gaard; island. -gard; cimb. -garthur; aleman. -gardo; welsh. -gardd; holln. -gaerde; span. -gardin; pomern. -gard; slav. -grod, -hrad&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language. Oxford. 1911; Jane Chance. Tolkien and the invention of myth. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8LLxZXqgJdwC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=gar%C3%B0r+gaard+gard&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=OARyTeDGKs7JswaHo5mEDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEsQuwUwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false . 70]&lt;/ref&gt; Also cognate but less closely related are Latin ''hortus,'' a garden, and its English descendants ''horticulture'' and ''orchard''.

Further afield, in [[Greater Iran|ancient Iran]], a fortified wooden settlement was called a ''gerd'', which became ''jerd'' under later Arab influence. Burugerd or [[Borujerd]] is a city in the West of Iran. The Indian suffix ''-garh,'' meaning a [[fort]] in [[Hindi]], [[Sanskrit]], and other [[Indo-Iranian languages]], appears in many Indian place names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/most/p2vidal.htm|title=Urban vocabulary in Northern India – City Words WP No. 4|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that both Slavic and Indo-Iranian are sub-branches of Indo-European and that there are numerous similarities in [[Russian language|Russian]] vocabulary and [[Sanskrit]] vocabulary, it is plausible that ''garh'' and ''gorod'' are related, although this is strongly contradicted by the phoneme /g/ in Indo-Iranian, which cannot be a reflex of the Indo-European palatovelar /*ǵ/.&lt;ref Name="RBTH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://in.rbth.com/blogs/2014/11/01/sanskrit_and_russian_ancient_kinship_39451|title=Sanskrit and Russian: Ancient kinship|website=in.rbth.com|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Proto-Slavic]] word ''*gordъ'' later differentiated into '''grad''' ([[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: град) and '''gorod''' (Cyrillic: город), etc.&lt;ref Name="Taylor1898"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Taylor  | first =Isaac   | authorlink =Isaac Taylor (canon) | title =Names and Their Histories: A Handbook of Historical Geography and Topographical Nomenclature  | publisher =Rivingtons  | year =1898  | location =Original from the University of Michigan  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=faxMAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=wall+Grad+gorod&amp;cad=0  | doi =    | page =331  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Taylor1864"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Taylor  | first =Isaac   | authorlink =Isaac Taylor (canon) | title =Words and Places, Or, Etymological Illustrations of History, Ethnology, and Geography  | publisher =Macmillan  | year =1864  | location =Original from Oxford University  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=fxQLAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=wall+Grad+gorod&amp;cad=0  | doi =    | page =128  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Anthropologische"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Anthropologische Gesellschaft in Wien  | first =  | authorlink =  | title =Mittheilungen der anthropologischen Gesellschaft in Wien  | publisher =F.

It also has evolved into words for a [[garden]]:
*[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ''город'' (horod)
*[[Russian language|Russian]] ''огород'' (ogorod)
*[[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] ''градина'' (gradina)
*[[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''oграда''/''ograda''
*[[Polish language|Polish]] ''ogród''
*[[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''záhrada''
*[[Czech language|Czech]] ''zahrada''

Additionally, it has furnished numerous modern Slavic words for a [[city]] or town:
*[[Russian language|Russian]] ''gorod''
*[[Pomeranian language|Ancient Pomeranian]] and modern [[Kashubian language|Kaszubian]] ''gard''
*[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''град''(grad)
*[[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]] ''hrad'' (the modern word for ''castle'')
*[[Polish language|Polish]] ''gród''

The names of many Central and Eastern European cities harken back to their pasts as gords. Some of them are in countries which once were but no longer are mainly inhabited by Slavic-speaking peoples. Examples include:
* [[Horodok (disambiguation)|Horodok]]
* [[Gorod (toponymy)]]
* [[Hrod (toponymy)]]
* [[Harad (toponymy)]]
* [[Hrud (toponymy)]]
* [[Horod (toponymy)]]
* [[Hrad (toponymy)]]
* [[Gard (Slavic toponymy)|Gard (toponymy)]]
* [[Grod (toponymy)]]
* [[Grad (toponymy)]]

The Polish word for ''suburbium'', ''podgrodzie'', literally means a settlement beneath a town: the ''gród'' was frequently built at the top of a hill, and the ''podgrodzie'' at its foot. (The Slavic prefix ''pod-'', meaning "under/below" and descending from the Proto-Indo-European root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/pṓds|pṓds]],'' meaning foot, is equivalent to Latin ''sub-''.)  The word survives in the names of several villages ([[Podgrodzie, Subcarpathian Voivodeship]]) and town districts (e.g., that of [[Olsztyn]]), as well as in the names of the German municipalities [[Puttgarden]], [[Wagria]] and [[Putgarten]], [[Rügen]].

'''Grace Marion Jantzen''' (May 24, 1948 &amp;ndash; May 2, 2006) was a [[Canadian people|Canadian]] [[Feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]] and [[Feminist theology| theologian]]. She was professor of [[religion]], [[culture]] and [[gender]] at [[Manchester University]] from 1996 until her death from cancer at the age of 57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/deaths/grace-jantzen-academic-1948-2006/article318933|location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|title=Grace Jantzen (1948-2006)|date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Becoming Divine: Towards a Feminist Philosophy of Religion'', Jantzen proposed a new [[philosophy of religion]] from a feminist perspective. She also authored works on Christian mysticism and the foundations of modernity. Her approach was influenced by Continental scholarship, particularly that of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]].&lt;ref Name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Carrette|first=Jeremy|title=Grace Jantzen|work=Obituary|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|date=May 11, 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1772262,00.html|accessdate=March 31, 2017|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feminist Theology"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Grace Jantzen (1948-2006)|journal=Feminist Theology|year=2006|volume=15|issue=1|url=http://intl-fth.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/15/1/121.pdf|pages=121–23|doi=10.1177/0966735006071131}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her final publication, ''Foundations of Violence,'' Jantzen, sketches the fascination with death and violence -- what she calls a 'necrophilia' -- that she believes has characterized much of Western culture from classical antiquity through Christianity to present paradigms.  In Jantzen's view, this emphasis on violence and death comes at the expense of the physical body in the present (a denigration of the senses, sexuality and sensuality), and thus, establishes a yearning for mystical worlds beyond the here and now.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Dictionary of Christianity, "Death, Feminist Views of" by [[Kathleen O'Grady]].

'''Guy Somner Lowman Jr.''' (born in [[Columbia, Missouri]], 1909; died in 1941) was an American [[linguistics|linguist]] who received a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1929 and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the [[University of London]] in 1931. From 1931 to 1933 he was a Sterling Fellow at [[Yale]] University. He worked as chief field investigator for the [[Linguistic Atlas of the United States and Canada]] from 1931 to 1941, interviewing more than a thousand informants along the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada. He also conducted field interviews in Southern England to find correspondences in English and American dialects. He was a member of the [[Modern Language Association]] and served as chairman of the [[phonetics]] section.

After his death in 1941, the University of Wisconsin–Madison established the Guy S. Lowman Scholarship to further research in linguistics.

'''Hirkan National Park''' ({{lang-az|Hirkan Milli Parkı}}) — is a [[National Parks of Azerbaijan|national park]] of [[Azerbaijan]]. It was established by the decree of the [[President of Azerbaijan]] [[Ilham Aliyev]], in an area in [[Lankaran Rayon]] and [[Astara Rayon]] administrative districts on February 9, 2004 on the basis of the former "Hirkan State Reserve" which it superseded, on a surface area of {{convert|29760|ha|km2}}. It was enlarged by presidential decree on April 23, 2008 from {{convert|29760|ha|km2}} to {{convert|40358|ha|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eco.gov.az/en/milliparklar-hirkan.php ″Hirkan National Park″] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726115201/http://www.eco.gov.az/en/milliparklar-hirkan.php |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area of Hirkan National Park is 99% covered by forests in a primarily mountainous region, and is strictly protected. It constitutes one of the largest contiguous forests in Azerbaijan, which is not interrupted by any settlement or pasture.

The Hirkan National Park protects the [[humid subtropical]] and [[ocean|humid temperate]] [[forest]]s in the area of the  [[Lenkoran Lowland]] and the [[Talysh Mountains]], sheltering many [[Endemism|endemic]] [[plant]] and [[animal]] [[species]].

The [[ecosystem]] of the Hirkan National Park, belongs to the [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests|Caspian Hyrcanian (Girkan) mixed forests]] [[ecoregion]], an area of lush [[deciduous]] [[broadleaved]] lowland and montane forests ([[rainforest|subtropical]] and [[temperate rainforests]]) that completely cover the Talysh Mountains and partially cover the Lankaran Lowland.

==Climate==
The Hirkan National Park normally has very high [[humidity]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] throughout the year, averaging from 1,400&amp;nbsp;mm to 1,600&amp;nbsp;mm per year in the lowlands to 1,800&amp;nbsp;mm per year in the mountains. The maximum annual precipitation is the highest precipitation in Azerbaijan.
The Hirkan National Park has a [[humid subtropical climate]] in the lowlands, an [[oceanic climate]] in the middle elevations and a [[humid continental climate]] on the mountain peaks.

The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of [[old growth forest]]s give the park an unusual richness of [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora===
{{Main|Flora of Azerbaijan}}
This area preserves many endemic plants species, relicts of the [[Tertiary]] period which were not affected by [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]]s.

The Caspian Hyrcanian (Girkan) forests account for 150 endemic species of trees and bushes out of 435 species of trees and bushes. Some endemic tree species are, the Hyrcanian box tree (''[[Buxus hyrcana]]''), Caucasian pear (''[[Pyrus communis]] subsp. caucasica''), Lenkoran acacia (''[[Albizia julibrissin]]''), chestnut-leaved oak (''[[Quercus castaneifolia]]''), Caucasian oak (''[[Quercus macranthera]]''), Caucasian ash (''[[Fraxinus angustifolia]]'' subsp. ''oxycarpa''), European ash (''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''), European hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]''), Oriental hornbeam (''[[Carpinus orientalis]]''), Oriental beech (''[[Fagus orientalis]]''), Caucasian persimmon (''[[Diospyros lotus]]''), Caspian locust tree (''[[Gleditsia caspica]]''), Caucasian alder (''[[Alnus subcordata]]''), black alder (''[[Alnus glutinosa]]'' subsp.'' barbata''), white poplar (''[[Populus alba]]'') Caucasian wingnut (''[[Pterocarya fraxinifolia]]''), Persian ironwood (''[[Parrotia persica]]''), Caucasian zelkova (''[[Zelkova carpinifolia]]''), butcher's broom (''[[Ruscus aculeatus]]''), velvet maple (''[[Acer velutinum]]''), Cappadocian maple (''[[Acer cappadocicum]]''), wych elm (''[[Ulmus glabra]]''), Caucasian lime tree (''[[Tilia dasystyla]]'' subsp. ''caucasica''), wild cherry (''[[Prunus avium]]''), wild service tree (''[[Sorbus torminalis]]''), sweet chestnut (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), among many others.

Shrub species occurring in the area include the poet's laurel (''[[Danae racemosa]]''), Hyrcanian holly (''[[Ilex]] hyrcana''), greenbrier (''[[Smilax]] excelsa''), common ivy (''[[Hedera helix]]''), etc.

===Fauna===
{{Main|Fauna of Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Flanmingo, Hirkan NP, Azerbaijan.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Flamingos in Hirkan National Park]]
There are several endemic subspecies of birds, of which the [[Caspian tit]] (''Poecile hyrcanus'') subspecies of the [[titmouse]]; the [[common pheasant|Caucasus pheasant]] (''Phasianus colchicus colchicus'') subspecies of the [[common pheasant]] of the Talysh Mountains are common.

The [[Caspian tiger]] (''Panthera tigris virgata'') once roamed these mountains, but is now extinct. Other large mammals here are the [[Persian leopard]] (''Panthera pardus saxicolor''), [[Eurasian lynx|lynx]] (''Lynx lynx''), [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[golden jackal]] (''Canis aureus''), [[jungle cat]] (''Felis chaus''), [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes''), [[roe deer]] (''Capreolus capreolus''), [[European badger|badger]] (''Meles meles''), [[Eurasian otter|otter]] (''Lutra lutra''), etc.

The Persian leopard (''Panthera pardus saxicolor'') subspecies of the [[leopard]], lives in the southern regions in Azerbaijan, primarily in the Talysh Mountains, [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]]. Despite occasional sightings, it was not clear whether leopards had been extinct in Azerbaijan by the late 1990s until a species was caught on camera in March, 2007 in the Hirkan National Park.

==Expansion and reforestation==
The Hirkan National Park was established in 2004 on the basis of the Hirkan State Reserve which it superseded, on a surface area of {{convert|29760|ha|km2}}, it was enlarged in 2008 to {{convert|40358|ha|km2}}.

The [[plain]] part of the Hirkan National Park ("Moscow Forest") lies within the Lankaran Lowland. The Moscow Forest is the only preserved part of the [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests]] which covered most of the lowland, that was later cleared for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecotourism.aznet.org/naturalobjects/girkan.html "Girkan Reserve"]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there is a [[reforestation]] program of the lowland, on a designated non-forested lot which is the only non-cultivated land on the plain, in order to (partially because the Lankaran Lowland is far too valuable for its [[agricultural productivity]] for Azerbaijan, to be given up for reforestation) [[Restoration ecology|restore the ecology]] to its previous forested state. This lot will become the second forest in the lowland after the Moscow Forest and once it is reforested, it will become an additional part of the Hirkan National Park in the lowland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hirkan.com/ Hirkan National Park Azerbaijan Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNESCO Status Application==
For the purpose of including the Hirkan National Park and the Caspian Hyrcanian (Girkan) forests respectively into [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]] list of cultural and natural heritage and [[Biosphere Reserves]] Programme, documents substantiated from the scientific point of view have been prepared and introduced to the UNESCO Secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.az/hirkan/en/menu16.htm UNESCO - Ecological, Social and Economic Factors Forming the Basis of Plot Selection For Biosphere Reserve Organization of the Girkan State Reserve and the Caspian Hyrcanian (Girkan) forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613164944/http://www.science.az/hirkan/en/menu16.htm |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche's critique of the '''historical subject''' is based in the rejection of an existing substance in favor of forces and wills combining to form combinations, sometimes in the form of a [[consciousness]]. [[Heidegger]] later traced the [[concept]] of subject to the metaphysical concept of ''[[ousia]]'' to demonstrate the impossibility of eliminating the subject by simply historicizing it. The modern definition of subjectivity, according to Heidegger, recovered [[Immanuel Kant]]'s definition of the substance in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s definition of ''ousia'' in ''[[Metaphysics]]''.

The term "historical subject" is also used by [[Michel Foucault]], as a concept opposed to the eternal and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] subject of the juridical and philosophical [[discourse]], yet still identified as an object. Foucault proposes a [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|"historical and political discourse"]].

The '''history of glass-making''' dates back to at least 3600 years ago in [[Mesopotamia]]. However, they may have been producing second-rate copies of glass objects from [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], where this complex craft originated.&lt;ref name="Egyptglass"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glassmaking-may-have-begun-egypt-not-mesopotamia |title=Glassmaking may have begun in Egypt, not Mesopotamia Artifacts from Iraq site show less sophisticated technique, color palette |accessdate=2016-11-25 |date=2016-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or Egypt.&lt;ref name="Glass Online: The History of Glass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |title=Glass Online: The History of Glass |accessdate=2007-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415194738/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |archivedate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known glass objects, of the mid second millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as the accidental by-products of [[Metalworking|metal-working]] ([[slag]]s) or during the production of [[Egyptian faience|faience]], a pre-glass [[Lustre (mineralogy)#Vitreous lustre|vitreous]] material made by a process similar to [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]].{{refn|group=n|name=ReferenceA|True glazing over a ceramic body was not used until many centuries after the production of the first glass.}} Glass products remained a luxury until the disasters that overtook the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|late Bronze Age]] civilizations seemingly brought glass-making to a halt.

From across the former [[Roman Empire]] archaeologists have recovered glass objects that were used in domestic, industrial and [[funerary]] contexts.
[[Anglo-Saxon glass]] has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.

==Origins==
[[File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia 2 retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Berlin glass amphora from Olbia|glass amphora]] from the [[Hellenistic period]].]]
Naturally occurring [[glass]], especially the [[volcanism|volcanic]] glass [[obsidian]], has been used by many [[Stone Age]] societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]] or [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Glass Online: The History of Glass"/&gt; Because of Egypt's favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of [[Metalworking|metal-working]] ([[slag]]s) or during the production of [[Egyptian faience|faience]], a pre-glass [[Vitrification|vitreous]] material made by a process similar to [[Compacted oxide layer glaze|glazing]].{{refn|group=n|name=ReferenceA}}

During the [[Late Bronze Age]] in [[Egypt]] (e.g., the [[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep "Treasure"]]) and [[Western Asia]] (e.g., [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]),&lt;ref&gt;These early examples are drawn from {{cite journal|author=Christine Lilyquist|title=Granulation and Glass: Chronological and Stylistic Investigations at Selected Sites, ca. 2500-1400 B.C.E.|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=290/291 |year=1993|issue=290|pages=29–94|jstor=1357319}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was a rapid growth in [[glassmaking]] technology. Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass [[ingots]], vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized [[hardstone carvings]] in [[Gemstone|semi-precious stones]]) and the ubiquitous beads. The [[alkali]] of Syrian and Egyptian glass was [[soda ash]] ([[sodium carbonate]]), which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably [[halophile]] seashore plants like [[saltwort]]. The latest vessels were 'core-formed', produced by winding a ductile rope of glass around a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it with repeated reheatings.

Threads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of [[oxide]]s were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools. The vessel would then be rolled smooth ([[marver]]ed) on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body. Handles and feet were applied separately. The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly [[Annealing (glass)|annealed]] and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out. Glass shapes for [[inlay]]s were also often created in moulds. Much early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, H. "Technologische Innovationen im 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr.

By the 15th century BC, extensive glass production was occurring in [[Western Asia]], [[Crete]], and [[Egypt]]; and the [[Mycenaean Greek]] term {{lang|gmy|𐀓𐀷𐀜𐀺𐀒𐀂}}, ''ku-wa-no-wo-ko-i'', meaning "workers of [[lapis lazuli]] and glass" (written in [[Linear b]] [[syllabic script]]) is attested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16799|title=The Linear B word ku-wa-no-wo-ko|website=Palaeolexicon.

It is thought that the techniques and recipes required for the initial fusing of glass from raw materials was a closely guarded [[trade secret|technological secret]] reserved for the large palace industries of powerful states. Glass workers in other areas therefore relied on imports of preformed glass, often in the form of cast ingots such as those found on the [[Ulu Burun]] [[shipwreck]] off the coast of modern [[Turkey]].

Glass remained a luxury material, and the [[Bronze Age collapse|disasters]] that overtook [[Late Bronze Age]] civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt. It picked up again in its former sites, Syria and Cyprus, in the 9th century BC, when the techniques for making colorless glass were discovered. The first glassmaking "manual" dates back to ca. 650 BC. Instructions on how to make glass are contained in [[cuneiform]] tablets discovered in the library of the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]]. In Egypt glass-making did not revive until it was reintroduced in [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Alexandria]]. Core-formed vessels and beads were still widely produced, but other techniques came to the fore with experimentation and technological advancements. During the [[Hellenistic]] period many new techniques of glass production were introduced and glass began to be used to make larger pieces, notably table wares. Techniques developed during this period include 'slumping' [[viscous]] (but not fully molten) glass over a mould in order to form a dish and '[[millefiori]]' (meaning 'thousand flowers') technique, where canes of multicolored glass were sliced and the slices arranged together and fused in a mould to create a mosaic-like effect. It was also during this period that colorless or decolored glass began to be prized and methods for achieving this effect were investigated more fully.&lt;ref name=douglas&gt;{{Cite book|author=Douglas, R. W.|title=A history of glassmaking|publisher=G T Foulis &amp; Co Ltd|place=Henley-on-Thames|year=1972|isbn=0-85429-117-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Phoenicia]]n traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the [[Belus River]]. [[Georgius Agricola]], in ''[[De re metallica]]'', reported a traditional serendipitous "discovery" tale of familiar type:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The tradition is that a merchant ship laden with [[nitre|nitrum]] being moored at this place, the merchants were preparing their meal on the beach, and not having stones to prop up their pots, they used lumps of nitrum from the ship, which fused and mixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed streams of a new translucent liquid, and thus was the origin of glass."&lt;ref name=Agricola&gt;[[Georg Agricola|Agricola, Georgius]], ''[[De re metallica]]'', translated by Herbert Clark Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover, Dover Publishing.

This account is more a reflection of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area was used in the production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its high purity levels. During the 1st century BC [[glass blowing]] was discovered on the Syro-Judean coast, revolutionizing the industry.  Glass vessels were now inexpensive compared to pottery vessels. A growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world.{{Citation needed|reason=no source for glass use in Roman world|date=December 2010}} Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria{{Citation needed|reason=no source for Jewish glassblowers|date=December 2010}} spread throughout the Roman Empire. With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of [[manganese dioxide]]), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes. Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]]. Over the next 1,000 years, glass making and working continued and spread through southern Europe and beyond.

==History by culture==
===Iran===
The first Persian glass was discovered in the explorations of Dinkhahtepe in Azarbaijan by Burny.  It was glass bead from the late Bronze Age (1600 B.C.).  Then in the middle Elam era of Chogha, Zanbil Temple existed. Many glass tubes were discovered by French teams.  Today it is certain that the mosaic glass cups from the Iron Age of North Iran, such as Hassnlou Tepe, Marlik Tepe. It resembles a number of Mesopotamian examples, in Susa of late Elam, a few glass vessels were discovered, of core forming technique.  Also in Azarbaijan and Kordestan, the Gilan provinces, a few kohl tubes were discovered from the late Iron Age that continued into the Achamenid period. In this time achamind bowls and colorless glass growing on empair but in selukid and parthian times helleni and roman techniques were Prevalented and Sassanian era seem local motives on glass vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{salehvand,2016}}=title= the history of glass and glass making, glassware of Arsacid era in the collections of Iran National museum and reza Abbasi museum|publisher = Samira| year = 2016| isbn = 9789648955491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Indian development of glass technology in [[South Asia]] may have begun in 1730 BC.&lt;ref name="Gowlett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lukashevichus.info/knigi/mcintosh_ancient_indus_valley.pdf|title=The Ancient Indus Valley|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this culture includes a red-brown glass bead along with a hoard of beads dating to that period, making it the earliest attested glass from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] locations.&lt;ref name=Gowlett/&gt; Glass discovered from later sites dating from 600–300 BC displays common colors.&lt;ref name=Gowlett/&gt;

[[File:Nanyue flat blue glass.JPG|thumb|Blue glass plaques found in the [[Mausoleum of the Nanyue King]], dating from late 2nd century BC]]
In Chinese history, glass played a peripheral role in the arts and crafts, when compared to ceramics and metal work.&lt;ref&gt;Braghin, C. (2002) "Introduction" pp. XI-XIV in Braghin, C. (ed) ''Chinese Glass. Archaeological studies on the uses and social contest of glass artefacts from the Warring States to the Northern Song Period (fifth century B.C. to twelfth century A.D.)''. {{ISBN|8822251628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The limited archaeological distribution and use of glass objects are evidence of the rarity of the material. Literary sources date the first manufacture of glass to the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Soame Jenyns (art historian)|Jenyns, R.]] (1981) ''Chinese Art III: Textiles, Glass and Painting on Glass''. Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, the earliest archaeological evidence for glass manufacture in China comes from the [[Warring States period]] (475 BC to 221 BC).

Chinese learned to manufacture glass comparably later than the Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Indians.&lt;ref name=pinder&gt;Pinder-Wilson, R. (1991) "The Islamic lands and China"  p. 140 in Tait, H. (ed) ''Five thousand years of glass''.

During the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) the use of glass diversified. The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects.&lt;ref name=pinder/&gt; The Chinese glass objects from the Warring States period and [[Han Dynasty]] vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects. The glasses from this period contain high levels of [[barium oxide]] (BaO) and [[lead]], distinguishing them from the soda-lime-silica glasses of Western Asia and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, R. and Wood, N.

===Islamic world===
{{main|Islamic glass}}
Islamic glass continued the achievements of pre-Islamic cultures, especially the [[Sasanian glass]] of [[Persia]]. The [[Arabic poetry|Arab poet]] al-[[Buhturi]] (820–897) described the clarity of such glass: "Its color hides the glass as if it is standing in it without a container."&lt;ref name=Glass&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan|Hassan, Ahmad Y]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2093.htm Assessment of ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715024128/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2093.htm |date=2010-07-15 }}, ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]]-[[Arab]] chemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber) described 46 recipes for producing colored glass in ''Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna'' (''The Book of the Hidden Pearl''), in addition to 12 recipes inserted by al-Marrakishi in a later edition of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Ahmad Y.

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:AndelysVitrail.jpg|thumb|left|A 16th-century stained glass window]]
The Roman tradition of very fine glassmaking did not continue in the Middle Ages, and [[Anglo-Saxon glass]] and other regional traditions were mainly functional pieces, mostly somewhat crude [[forest glass]].  The [[claw beaker]] was popular as a relatively easy to make but impressive vessel that exploited the unique potential of glass.  Only at the end of the period did European glass vessels once again become very fine in quality, imitating those imported from the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

Glass objects from the 7th and 8th centuries have been found on the island of [[Torcello]] near [[Venice]]. These form an important link between Roman times and the later importance of that city in the production of the material. Around 1000&amp;nbsp;AD, an important technical breakthrough was made in Northern Europe when soda glass, produced from white pebbles and burnt vegetation was replaced by glass made from a much more readily available material: [[potash]] obtained from wood ashes. From this point on, northern glass differed significantly from that made in the Mediterranean area, where soda remained in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://nautarch.tamu.edu/class/anth605/File5.htm| title = Glass Conservation|accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Donny L. Hamilton|publisher = Conservation Research Laboratory, Texas A&amp;M University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 12th century, [[stained glass]] – glass to which metallic or other impurities had been added for coloring – was not widely used, but it rapidly became an important medium for [[Romanesque art]] and especially [[Gothic art]].  Almost all survivals are in church buildings, but it was also used in grand secular buildings.  The 11th century saw the emergence in [[Germany]] of new ways of making sheet glass by blowing spheres. The spheres were swung out to form cylinders and then cut while still hot, after which the sheets were flattened. This technique was perfected in 13th century [[Venice]]. The [[Crown glass process]] was used up to the mid-19th century. In this process, the [[glassblower]] would spin approximately 9 [[Avoirdupois|pounds]] (4&amp;nbsp;kg) of molten glass at the end of a rod until it flattened into a disk approximately 5 feet (1.5&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter. The disk would then be cut into panes. Domestic glass vessels in late medieval Northern Europe are known as [[forest glass]].

====Anglo-Saxon world====
{{Main|Anglo-Saxon glass}}
Anglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.&lt;ref name="Bayley2000"&gt;Bayley, J.

London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. {{ISBN|0861591275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD with the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]], there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass.&lt;ref name="Evison2000"&gt;Evison, V. I. (2000). "Glass vessels in England, 400–1100 CE" pp. 47–104 in Price, J. ''Glass in Britain and Ireland AD 350–1100''. London: British Museum Occasional paper 127. {{ISBN|0861591275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation of [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] sites have revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule.&lt;ref name=" Evison2000"/&gt;

The majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently.

====Murano====
{{main|Murano glass|Venetian glass}}
The center for luxury Italian glassmaking from the 14th century was the island of [[Murano]], which developed many new techniques and became the center of a lucrative export trade in [[dinnerware]], [[mirror]]s, and other items. What made Venetian [[Murano glass]] significantly different was that the local quartz pebbles were almost pure silica, and were ground into a fine clear sand that was combined with [[soda ash]] obtained from the [[Levant]], for which the Venetians held the sole [[monopoly]]. The clearest and finest glass is tinted in two ways: firstly, a natural coloring agent is ground and melted with the glass. Many of these coloring agents still exist today; for a list of coloring agents, see below. Black glass was called ''obsidianus'' after obsidian stone. A second method is apparently to produce a black glass which, when held to the light, will show the true color that this glass will give to another glass when used as a dye.&lt;ref name=Agricola1&gt;[[Georg Agricola]] ''[[De Natura Fossilium]]'', Textbook of Mineralogy, M.C. Bandy, J. Bandy, Mineralogical Society of America, 1955, p. 111 [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/agricola-metallica/page_001 Section on Murano Glass, De Natura Fossilium]. Retrieved 2007-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venetian ability to produce this superior form of glass resulted in a trade advantage over other glass producing lands. [[Murano]]’s reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire might burn down the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many took a risk and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.

====Bohemia====
{{main|Bohemian glass}}
[[Bohemian glass]], or Bohemia crystal, is a decorative [[glass]] produced in regions of [[Bohemia]] and [[Silesia]], now in the current state of the [[Czech Republic]], since the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nbig6p_r24C&amp;q=%C2%A0%C2%A0Bohemian+glass,+is+a+decorative+glass+produced+in+regions+of+Bohemia+and+Silesia&amp;dq=%C2%A0%C2%A0Bohemian+glass,+is+a+decorative+glass+produced+in+regions+of+Bohemia+and+Silesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9vtbD2NfUAhVY-mMKHUweDioQ6AEIJDAA|title=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|last=inc|first=Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|isbn=9780852295533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the [[Lusatian Mountains]] of Northern Bohemia. Most notable sites of glass-making throughout the ages are [[Skalice u České Lípy|Skalice]] ({{lang-de|Langenau}}), [[Kamenický Šenov]] ({{lang-de|Steinschönau}}) and [[Nový Bor]] ({{lang-de|Haida}}). Both Nový Bor and Kamenický Šenov have their own Glass Museums with many items dating since around 1600. It was especially outstanding in its manufacture of glass in high [[Baroque]] style from 1685 to 1750. In the 17th century, [[Caspar Lehmann]], [[Gemstone|gem]] cutter to [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with [[copper]] and [[bronze]] wheels.

==Modern glass production==

===New processes===
[[Image:Ravenscroft Glass VAndA.jpg|thumb|right|Examples of [[George Ravenscroft|Ravenscroft's]] glass.]]
A very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using [[Coal#Ranks|sea-coal]] as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the "working period" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate. The process was first discovered by [[George Ravenscroft]] in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, allowing England to overtake Venice as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Seeking to find an alternative to Venetian ''cristallo'', he used [[flint glass|flint as a silica source]], but his glasses tended to [[wikt:crizzle|crizzle]], developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency. This was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Roy G.|author2=Sandra Davison|title=Conservation of Glass|year=1989|series=Butterworth – Heinemann Series in Conservation and Museology|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]]|location=London|isbn=0-408-10623-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production and refinement moved from his glasshouse on the Savoy to the seclusion of [[Henley-on-Thames]].&lt;ref name=macleod&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3105182 |jstor=3105182 |pages=776–803 |last1=MacLeod |first1=Christine |title=Accident or Design? George Ravenscroft's Patent and the Invention of Lead-Crystal Glass |volume=28 |issue=4 |journal=Technology and Culture |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1696, after the patent expired, twenty-seven glasshouses in England were producing flint glass and were exporting all over [[Europe]] with such success that, in 1746, the British Government imposed a [[Glass tax|lucrative tax]] on it. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as ''Excise glasses''.&lt;ref name=hurst-vose&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurst-Vose|first=Ruth|title=Glass|year=1980|series=Collins Archaeology|publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]]|location=London|isbn=0-00-211379-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British glass making industry was able to take off with the repeal of the tax in 1845.

Evidence of the use of the [[blown plate glass]] method dates back to 1620 in London and was used for mirrors and coach plates. Louis Lucas de Nehou and A. Thevart perfected the process of casting [[Polished plate glass]] in 1688 in France. Prior to this invention, mirror plates, made from blown "sheet" glass, had been limited in size. De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table rendered the manufacture of very large plates possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 11th edition (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; This method of production was adopted by the English in 1773 at [[Ravenhead]]. The polishing process was industrialized around 1800 with the adoption of a steam engine to carry out the grinding and polishing of the cast glass.

===Industrial production===
[[File:Crystal Palace - Queen Victoria opens the Great Exhibition.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The façade of [[the Crystal Palace]], one of the first buildings to use glass as a main material for construction.]]
The use of glass as a building material was heralded by [[The Crystal Palace]] of 1851, built by [[Joseph Paxton]] to house the [[Great Exhibition]]. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the [[British Crown Glass Company]] (later [[Chance Brothers]]) became the first company to adopt the [[cylinder blown sheet|cylinder method]] to produce sheet glass with the expertise of [[Georges Bontemps]], a famous French glassmaker.{{refn|group=n|This process was used extensively until early in the 20th Century to make window glass.}} This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr]], down which it was carried by a system of rollers.&lt;ref&gt;''Bontemps on Glassmaking: the Guide du Verrier of Georges Bontemps'', translated by Michael Cable (2008). Society of Glass Technology. {{ISBN|0900682604}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations.

An early advance in automating glass manufacturing was patented in 1848 by the engineer [[Henry Bessemer]]. His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing and was later abandoned by its sponsor, Robert Lucas Chance of Chance Brothers, as unviable. Bessemer also introduced an early form of "Float Glass" in 1843, which involved pouring glass onto liquid tin.

In 1887, the mass production of glass was developed by the firm Ashley in [[Castleford]], [[Yorkshire]]. This semi-automatic process used machines that were capable of producing 200 standardized bottles per hour, many times quicker than the traditional methods of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3M5TAAAAMAAJ|title=Glass: its tradition and its makers|author=Buch Polak, Ada |year=1975|publisher=Putnam|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance Brothers also introduced the machine rolled patterned glass method in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Chance_Brothers_and_Co|title=Chance Brothers and Co|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:StHelensPilkingtonsTheHotties.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Pilkington]]'s factory, where the [[float glass]] process was developed in the 1950s.]]
In 1898, [[Pilkington]] invented Wired Cast glass, where the glass incorporates a strong steel-wire mesh for safety and security. This was commonly given the misnomer "Georgian Wired Glass" but it greatly post-dates the [[Georgian era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3dqs6zRCcEC|title=Practical Building Conservation: Glass and glazing|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=468|isbn=9780754645573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Machine drawn cylinder sheet glass|Machine Drawn Cylinder technique]] was invented in the US and was the first mechanical method for the drawing of window glass. It was manufactured under licence in the UK by [[Pilkington]] from 1910 onwards.

In 1938, the [[Polished plate glass|polished plate process]] was improved by [[Pilkington]] which incorporated a double grinding process to give an improved quality to the finish. Between 1953 and 1957, Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]] and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary [[float glass]] process, the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten [[tin]] bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1969.0212|title=Review Lecture. The Float Glass Process|first=L. A. B.|last=Pilkington|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences|volume=314|issue=1516|pages=1–25|jstor=2416528|year=1969|publisher=The Royal Society|bibcode=1969RSPSA.314....1P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method gave the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern [[window]]s are made from float glass. Most float glass is [[soda-lime glass]], but relatively minor quantities of specialty [[borosilicate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schott.com/hometech/english/products/borofloat/index.html "Borosilikatglas BOROFLOAT®"]. SCHOTT AG.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flat panel display]] glass are also produced using the float glass process. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight.&lt;ref name=floatpatent&gt;Bickerstaff, Kenneth and Pilkington, Lionel A B {{US Patent |2911759}} "Manufacture of flat glass". Priority date December 10, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960.

A [[Heavy Neolithic]] assemblage of [[flint]] tools made by the [[Qaraoun culture]] was collected from some [[Olive]] terraces bordering on the road and from an area above them that was disturbed in the construction of a trackway. The flint was of a brown, [[Nummulitic]], [[Eocene]] type, some having been [[patinated]] to white while others were found fresh. Several broad blades were found along with heavy scrapers on flakes, massive cores, [[Plane (tool)|rabot]]s, [[racloir]]s and a few smaller scrapers. The material  now stored in the [[Museum of Lebanese Prehistory]] was studied by [[Henri Fleisch]], who concluded that the site was likely used as a [[prehistoric]] [[factory]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt;

'''Liberal corporatism''' is the application of economic [[corporatism]] by [[Liberalism|liberal]] political parties and organizations, that recognizes the bargaining interests of multiple groups within society, such as in the business, labour, and agricultural sectors and licenses them to engage in bargaining over economic policy with the state.&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999. P36"&gt;Frank Bealey, Richard A. Chapman, Michael Sheehan. ''Elements in political science''. Edinburgh, UK: Edinburgh University Press, 1999. P36. {{ISBN|0748611096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal corporatism is often in conflict from proponents of liberal [[Ontological pluralism|pluralism]] that opposes the granting of power to organized [[interest group]]s.&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999. P36"/&gt; English liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] supported corporatist-like economic associations as needing to predominate in society to create equality for labourers and give them a voice in management through democratic economic rights.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Samuel. ''The commercial society: foundations and challenges in a global age''. Lanham,USA; Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, 2007. Pp. 109. {{ISBN|073911994X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a number of other forms of corporatism, liberal corporatism does not reject capitalism or [[individualism]], but believes that the capitalist firm is a social institution that requires its managers to go beyond achieving the [[Net income|bottom line]], by recognizing the needs of their members.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"&gt;Waring, Stephen P. ''Taylorism Transformed: Scientific Management Theory Since 1945''. University of North Carolina Press, 1994. Pp. 193. {{ISBN|0807844691}}&lt;/ref&gt; This liberal corporatist ethic was similar to [[Taylorism]] but called for democratization of the capitalism firm.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"/&gt; Liberal corporatists believed that inclusion of all members in the election of management would bring them into the process of management and in effect "reconcile ethics and efficiency, freedom and order, liberty and rationality".&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"/&gt;

Liberal corporatism was an influential component of the [[progressivism in the United States]] that has been referred to as "interest group liberalism".&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 134"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J. ''Corporatism and comparative politics''. M.E. Sharpe, 1996. Pp. 134. {{ISBN|156324716X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support by labour leaders' advocacy of liberal corporatism of the U.S. progressives is believed to have been influenced by an attraction to the [[syndicalism]] and particularly the [[anarcho-syndicalism]] at the time in Europe.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 134"/&gt; In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the [[New Deal]] economic program of the United States in the 1930s as well as in [[Fordism]] and [[Keynesianism]].&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243"&gt;R. J. Barry Jones. ''Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A-F''. Taylor &amp; Frances, 2001. Pp. 243. {{ISBN|0415243521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal corporatism is commonly supported by proponents in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Frank Bealey 1999.

'''''Mani pulite''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈmaːni puˈliːte|lang}}, [[Italian language|Italian]] for "clean hands") was a nationwide judicial investigation into [[political corruption in Italy]] held in the 1990s. ''Mani pulite'' led to the demise of the so-called "[[History of Italy as a Republic#The First Republic .281947-1992.29|First Republic]]", resulting in the disappearance of many political parties. Some politicians and industry leaders committed [[suicide]] after their crimes were exposed. [[Antonio Di Pietro]] was the main judicial figure in charge of the operation.

In some accounts, as many as 5,000 public figures fell under suspicion. At one point, more than half of the members of the [[Italian Parliament]] were under [[indictment]]. More than 400 city and town councils were dissolved because of corruption charges. The estimated value of [[bribe]]s paid annually in the 1980s by Italian and foreign companies bidding for large government contracts reached [[United States dollar|US$]]4 billion dollars (6.5 trillion [[Italian lira|lire]]).&lt;ref name="Koff2002"/&gt;

The corrupt system uncovered by the investigation was referred to as '''''Tangentopoli''''' ({{IPA-it|tandʒenˈtɔːpoli}}).&lt;ref name="Moliterno"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Moliterno| first = Gino| title = Encyclopedia of contemporary Italian culture| publisher = Routledge| year = 2000| isbn = 0-415-14584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from ''tangente'', which means "[[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]]" and in this context refers to kickbacks given for [[public works]] contracts,&lt;ref name="Koff2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen P. Koff|title=Italy: From the 1st to the 2nd Republic|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-00536-1|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[polis|poli]]'' meaning city;&lt;ref&gt;''-poli'' is also used as a suffix for a scandal (e.g. ''[[2006 Italian football scandal|Calciopoli]]'', ''[[2011–12 Italian football scandal|Scommessopoli]]''), much like "[[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|-gate]]" in the English language (i.e. [[Lewinsky scandal|Zippergate]], [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russiagate]]).&lt;/ref&gt; it is thus sometimes translated as '''"Bribesville"''' or '''"Kickback City"'''.

==Arrest of Mario Chiesa==
''Tangentopoli'' began on 17 February 1992 when [[Antonio Di Pietro|Judge Antonio Di Pietro]] had [[Mario Chiesa (politician)|Mario Chiesa]], a member of the centre-left [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI), arrested for accepting a [[bribe]] from a [[Milan]] cleaning firm. The PSI distanced themselves from Chiesa, with PSI leader [[Bettino Craxi]] calling him ''mariuolo'', or "villain", a "wild splinter" of the otherwise clean party. Upset over this treatment by his former colleagues, Chiesa began to give information about corruption implicating them. This marked the beginning of the ''mani pulite'' investigation; news of [[political]] corruption began spreading in the Italian press.

==Extension of anti-corruption investigations==
In the [[Italian general election, 1992|1992 elections]], the centre-right [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC) held on to power when its [[coalition government]] kept a small majority, while leftist opposition parties gained support. However, the [[Italian Communist Party]] split after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], depriving the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] of leadership. Many votes went to the far-right [[Lega Nord]], which was not inclined to form alliances with other parties at the time. The resulting parliament was therefore weak and difficult to bring to an agreement.

During April 1992, many industrial figures and politicians from both the government and the opposition were arrested on charges of corruption. While the investigations started in Milan, they quickly spread to other towns as more politicians confessed. One grotesque situation occurred when a Socialist politician immediately confessed to all of his crimes to two [[Carabinieri]] who had come to his house, only to later discover that they had come to deliver a mere [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] for a traffic violation. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Fundamental to this increased exposure was the general attitude of the main politicians to drop support for subordinates who got caught; this made many of them feel betrayed, and they often implicated many other figures, who in turn would implicate even more. On 2 September 1992, the Socialist politician Sergio Moroni, charged with corruption, committed [[suicide]]. He left a letter pleading guilty, declaring that crimes were not for his personal gain but for the party's benefit, and accused the financing system of all the political parties.

==Effect on national politics==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Craxi coins.jpg|thumb|[[Bettino Craxi]], viewed by many as the symbol of [[Tangentopoli]], leader of the [[Italian Socialist Party]], is greeted by a salvo of coins as a sign of loathing by protesters contesting him.]] --&gt;
In the local December elections, DC lost half of their votes. The day after that, Craxi was officially accused of corruption. After many other politicians were accused and jailed, Craxi eventually resigned from the PSI.

On 5 March 1993, the Italian government of [[Giuliano Amato]] and his justice minister [[Giovanni Conso]] tried to find a solution with a decree, which allowed criminal charges for several bribery-related crimes to be replaced by administrative charges instead; according to Italian popular opinion at the time, that would have resulted in a ''de facto'' [[amnesty]] for most corruption charges. Amid public outrage and nationwide rallies, the [[President of Italy|Italian president]] [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]] refused to sign the decree, deeming it unconstitutional. The following week, a US$250 million affair involving [[Eni]], the government-controlled national energy company, was revealed. The stream of accusations, confessions and jailing continued.

On 25 March, the Italian parliament changed the municipal electoral law in favor of a majoritarian system. Later, on 18 April, the public overwhelmingly backed the abrogation of the existing [[proportional representation]] parliamentary electoral law in a referendum (a [[Mixed member proportional representation|mixed system]] was introduced that August), causing Amato to resign three days later. Still shocked by the recent events, the parliament was unable to produce a new government. [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], former governor of the [[Bank of Italy]], was appointed head of the government; he appointed a [[technical government]] without political influences. In the meantime, the investigation of Craxi was blocked by the parliament. Several members of the government, having been in office just three days, resigned in protest; among them were [[Minister of the Environment (Italy)|Minister of the Environment]] [[Francesco Rutelli]] and [[Italian Minister of Finance|Minister of Finance]] [[Vincenzo Visco]]. In new local elections on 6 June 1993, DC lost half of its votes once again; the PSI virtually disappeared. Instead [[Lega Nord]], a far-right protest movement, became the strongest political force in [[Northern Italy]]. The left-wing opposition was approaching majority, but still lacked unity and leadership.

Eventually, all four parties in the 1992 government disappeared, at different times in different ways: DC, the PSI, the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party (historical)|Italian Socialist Democratic Party]], and the [[Italian Liberal Party (1943)|Italian Liberal Party]]. The [[Democratic Party of the Left]], the [[Italian Republican Party]] and the [[Movimento Sociale Italiano]] were the only surviving national parties; the Republican Party is the only one that has maintained its name since.

==The Cusani trial==
On 20 July 1993, the former Eni president, Gabriele Cagliari, committed suicide in jail. His wife later gave back US$3 million of illegal funds. Meanwhile, Cusani faced trial and was accused of crimes connected to Enimont, a joint venture between Eni and another energy company, [[Montedison]]. The trial was broadcast on national television, and was a sort of showcase of the old politics being brought to their responsibilities. While Cusani himself was not a major figure, the connection of his crimes to the Enimont affair called in all the nation's major politicians as witnesses.

A high note was reached in the Cusani trial when former head of government [[Arnaldo Forlani]], answering a question, simply said, "I don't remember"; he happened to be very nervous and did not notice that sweat was accumulating on his lips, and that image was by many considered symbolic of the people's disgust for the corrupt system. Craxi, instead, admitted that his party received $93 million of illegal funds, defending his actions by saying that "everyone was doing this." Even the Lega Nord was implicated in the trial; secretary [[Umberto Bossi]] and former treasurer Alessandro Patelli were convicted for receiving 200 million lire of illegal funding (approx. $100,000 at the time).

A bribe to the Italian Communist Party was alleged, but it was not established who had committed the offence. A number of Milanese members of the Democratic Party of the Left were charged with corruption during their time as members of the PCI, but they were [[acquittal|acquitted]]. As prosecutor [[Antonio Di Pietro]] stated, "Penal responsibility is personal. I cannot bring here a person with the first name [[Communist]] and last name Party". (''La responsabilità penale è personale, non posso portare in giudizio una persona che si chiami Partito di nome e Comunista di cognome.'')

The Enimont trial itself was carried out after the Cusani trial, with much less public interest.

==Investigations on other fronts==
In the meantime, the investigation expanded outside the political range: on 2 September 1993, the Milan judge Diego Curtò was arrested. On 21 April 1994, 80 financial regulators and 300 industry personalities were charged with corruption. A few days later, the secretary of [[Fiat]] admitted corruption with a letter to a newspaper. Media tycoon [[Silvio Berlusconi]] entered politics later that year and won the [[Italian general election, 1994|1994 general election]], in what many thought was a move to shield his many business concerns from possible scrutiny. This suspicion was reinforced on 11 February, when Berlusconi's brother, [[Paolo Berlusconi|Paolo]], admitted to corruption crimes. 

On 13 July 1994, the Berlusconi government made a new law to avoid jail time for most corruption crimes, the passage of which was timed to coincide with Italy's defeat of [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in the [[Football World Cup 1994|1994 Football World Cup]]'s semifinals in the hopes that the public would be distracted. However, as [[Roberto Baggio]] shot high the last penalty against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], and newscasts showed images of corrupt politicians leaving jail, public opinion became enraged; the images of [[Francesco De Lorenzo]], former [[Italian Minister of Health|Minister of Health]], were especially striking, since the general public perceived stealing money from hospitals an especially heinous act.

Just a few days before, the arrested regulators had been talking about corruption in [[Fininvest]], the holding company controlled by the Berlusconi family. Most of the judge pool declared that they would respect the state's laws, but they could not work in a situation where duty and conscience were to conflict: they requested therefore to be reassigned to other duties. Since the government could not afford to be seen as an adversary of the popular judge pool, the decree was hastily revoked and marked a "misunderstanding"; [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Interior Minister]] [[Roberto Maroni]], of Lega Nord, claimed that he had not even had the chance to read it. While the [[Italian Minister of Justice|Minister of Justice]] was [[Alfredo Biondi]], allegations that the decree was written by [[Cesare Previti]], a lawyer from Fininvest, are at least credible.

On 29 July Berlusconi's brother was again arrested and immediately released.

==Escalating conflict between Berlusconi and Di Pietro==
At this point a public conflict erupted between Berlusconi and Di Pietro. While Berlusconi's companies were being investigated, "inspectors" were sent from the government to the Milanese judges' office to look for formal irregularities. None were ever found, but this tactic, coupled with Berlusconi's firm grip on the media, helped spread what is described in other environments as [[fear, uncertainty and doubt]]. The battle ended without winners: Di Pietro resigned on 6 December, two weeks before the Berlusconi government resigned ahead a critical [[confidence vote]] in parliament that was expected to go against them.

During 1995, many investigations were started against Di Pietro, who would years later be cleared of all charges. Meanwhile, Berlusconi incurred other charges of corruption. It was later found that the man prosecuting Di Pietro, Fabio Salamone from [[Brescia]], was the brother of a man that Di Pietro himself had prosecuted and sent to jail for various corruption charges. However, it wasn't until later that authorities realized the [[conflict of interest]] and reassigned Salamone, even though his investigations had taken a completely different direction: Paolo Berlusconi and Previti were accused of a conspiracy against Di Pietro, but the prosecutor who later replaced Salamone asked for their acquittal and so did the court.

After being cleared, Di Pietro went into politics, despite previously not wishing to exploit the popularity gained doing what he perceived to be just his duty. His movement is named [[Italia dei Valori]] ("Italy of values"). In 1998, Cesare Previti, then sitting in parliament after the Berlusconi government, avoided jail thanks to parliamentary intervention, even though Berlusconi and his allies were in opposition. Craxi was sentenced to several years cumulative jail time in definitive convictions and fled to [[Tunisia]], where he remained until his death on 19 January 2000.

==Statutory term strategy==
After 1994, trials became likely to be cancelled due to the [[statute of limitations|expiration of statutory terms]]. The government ignored the pleas of the judiciary system for more funding to buy equipment, and passed laws that made Italy's notoriously slow legal system even slower and subject to earlier prescription. The intricate nature of these laws allowed lawyers to use many delaying tactics: an instructive example was a prosecution of Berlusconi, where he was accused of misappropriation of Fininvest's funds in order to prepare [[black fund]]s that could have been used for bribes or other illegitimate purposes; on the last possible day, a lawyer from Fininvest appeared in court and complained that his company had not been formally notified of the trial. While this trial was well publicized in the media, the formality forced the trial to be restarted from scratch, and Berlusconi was finally acquitted by expiration of statutory terms. Being acquitted in this first trial, he could later benefit from a general reduction of terms for other trials, which in turn expired earlier with a [[domino effect]].

After Berlusconi's victory in the [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 election]], public opinion had turned so far against judges, where it is not only openly acceptable to criticize them for having carried out ''Mani pulite'', but also increasingly difficult to broadcast opinions favorable to Milan's pool. Some blame Berlusconi's media influence as having played a role in this change, or the inability of the opposition to gain the consent of conservative electors. Even [[Umberto Bossi]], whose Lega Nord has been an opposition party, became highly critical of judges.

==Lottizzazione==

The term ''lottizzazione'', meaning the way a terrain is divided up in minor parts or ''lotti'', came to indicate the procedure of awarding top positions in important state conglomerates such as [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|IRI]], [[Enel|ENEL]] or [[Eni|ENI]] to political figures, or at least managers with a clear political orientation. This usually trickled down to lower levels, creating power centres depending on political parties that controlled a significant part of the production system. The available seats were usually awarded so that government parties (and opposition parties like the [[Italian Communist Party]]) would get a share of power corresponding to their perceived influence in the government.

==In modern culture==
In 2005, artist Gianni Motti created a piece of [[soap]], named ''Mani Pulite'', based on the scandal. This piece was claimed to have been created out of the fat from a [[liposuction]] of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. It was sold at the 36th edition of [[Art Basel]] for 15,000 euros.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/2005/f/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/motti/sapovendu/sapovendu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 television series titled ''[[1992 (TV series)|1992]]'' is based on the events of ''mani pulite''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Deborah|title='1992': Berlin Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/1992-berlin-review-771715|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15179">[[File:Mauricio Kagel (1985).jpg|thumb|Mauricio Kagel, 1985]]
'''Mauricio Raúl Kagel''' ({{IPA-es|mauˈɾisjo ˈkaɣel}}; December 24, 1931 – September 18, 2008) was a [[Germans|German]]-[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[composer]] notable for developing the [[theatrical]] side of musical [[performance]] {{harv|Grimshaw|2009}}. He spent his last fifty years in Germany, dying after a long illness at the age of 76 {{harv|Nonnenmann|2008}}.

==Biography==
Kagel was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], into an Ashkenazi Jewish family that had fled from Russia in the 1920s {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. He studied music, history of [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] in [[Buenos Aires]] {{harv|Grimshaw|2009}}. In 1957 he moved as a scholar to [[Cologne]], Germany, where he lived until his death.

===As teacher===

From 1960–66 and 1972–76 he taught at the [[Darmstädter Ferienkurse|International Summer School at Darmstadt]] {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He also taught from 1964–65 at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] as [[Slee Professor of music theory]]. At the [[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|Berlin Film and Television Academy]] he was a visiting lecturer. He served as director of courses for new music in [[Gothenburg]] and Cologne {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He was professor for new music theatre at the [[Cologne Conservatory]] from 1974–97.&lt;!--Attinello 2001 would cover this as well, except he does not give the terminal date.--&gt; Among his students were [[Maria de Alvear]], [[Carola Bauckholt]], [[Branimir Krstić]], [[David Sawer]], {{ill|Rickard Scheffer|sv}}, [[Juan Maria Solare]], [[Gerald Barry (composer)|Gerald Barry]], and [[Chao-Ming Tung]]. {{See LMST|Mauricio|Kagel}}

===As composer===

Some of his pieces give specific theatrical instructions to the performers {{harv|Kennedy and Bourne|2006}}, such as to adopt certain facial expressions while playing, to make their stage entrances in a particular way, to physically interact with other performers, and so on. For this reason commentators at times related his work to the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He has been regarded by music historians as deploying a critical intelligence interrogating the position of music in society {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}.&lt;!--Is this a quote or paraphrase?--&gt; He was also active in the fields of film and photography, proving that the possibilities of music are inexhaustible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1991 Kagel was invited by [[Walter Fink]] as the second composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenporträt]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]]. In 2000 he received the [[Ernst von Siemens Music Prize]].

==Works==
''Staatstheater'' (1970) remains, probably, Kagel’s best-known work. It is the piece that most clearly shows his absurdist tendency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} He described it as a “[[ballet]] for non-dancers,”{{Cite quote|date=September 2008}} although it is in many ways more like an [[opera]]; the devices it uses as [[musical instrument]]s include [[chamber pot]]s and [[enema]] equipment. As the work progresses, the piece itself, and opera and ballet in general, becomes its own subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Similar is the [[radio]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''Ein Aufnahmezustand'' (1969) which is about the incidents surrounding the recording of a radio play. In ''Con voce'' (With Voice), a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. ''Match'' (1964), is a “tennis game” for cellists with a percussionist as umpire {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}} (for [[Siegfried Palm]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!--Formerly offered citation, [http://www.bertdekkers.nl/klassiek/kagel_list.html Kagel: Match], lists a recording made by Palm, but does not confirm the work was written for him.--&gt;), also the subject of one of Kagel's films and perhaps the best-known of his works of instrumental theatre {{harv|Griffiths|1981|loc=812}}.

But Kagel wrote a large number of more conventional “pure” pieces too, including [[orchestra]]l music, [[chamber music]]. Many of these make references to music of the past by, among others, Beethoven, Brahms, Bach and Liszt ({{harvnb|Warnaby|1981|loc=38}}; {{harvnb|Decarsin|1985|loc=260}}).

Kagel also made [[film]]s, with one of the best known being ''[[Ludwig van (film)|Ludwig van]]'' (1970), a critical interrogation of the uses of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s music made during the bicentenary of that composer's birth {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}. In it, a reproduction of Beethoven's studio is seen, as part of a fictive visit of the [[Beethoven House]] in [[Bonn]]. Everything in it is papered with sheet music of Beethoven's pieces. The soundtrack of the film is a [[piano]] playing the music as it appears in each shot. Because the music has been wrapped around curves and edges, it is somewhat distorted, but Beethovenian motifs can still be heard. In other parts, the film contains parodies of radio or TV broadcasts connected with the "Beethoven Year 1770". Kagel later turned the film into a piece of sheet music itself which could be performed in a concert without the film—the score consists of close-ups of various areas of the studio, which are to be interpreted by the performing [[pianist]].

[[File:67elcona.JPG|thumb|Typical mobile home from the late 1960s and early 1970s: twelve by sixty feet]]
[[File:1958 photo of Zimmer trailer in a trailer park in Tampa Florida.jpg|thumb|1958 photo of Zimmer trailer in a trailer park in Tampa Florida, this area is now a gated community with new houses]]

A '''mobile home''' (also '''trailer''', '''trailer home''', '''house trailer''', '''static caravan''', '''residential caravan''') is a [[prefabrication|prefabricated]] structure, built in a factory on a permanently attached chassis before being transported to site (either by being towed or on a trailer). Used as permanent [[home]]s, or for holiday or temporary accommodation, they are left often permanently or semi-permanently in one place, but can be moved, and may be required to move from time to time for legal reasons.

Mobile [[home]]s share the same historic origins as [[travel trailers]], but today the two are very different in size and furnishings, with travel trailers being used primarily as temporary or vacation homes. Behind the cosmetic work fitted at installation to hide the base, there are strong trailer frames, axles, wheels, and tow-hitches.

== History ==
In the [[United States]], this form of housing goes back to the early years of cars and motorized highway travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/regulations/nycrr/title_10/part_17/|title=Part 17, Mobile Home Parks|work=ny.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was derived from the [[travel trailer]] (often referred to during the early years as "house trailers" or "trailer coaches"), a small unit with wheels attached permanently, often used for camping or extended travel. 
The original rationale for this type of housing was its mobility. Units were initially marketed primarily to people whose lifestyle required mobility. However, beginning in the 1950s, the homes began to be marketed primarily as an inexpensive form of housing designed to be set up and left in a location for long periods of time, or even permanently installed with a masonry foundation. Previously, units had been eight feet or less in width, but in 1956, the 10-foot (3 m) wide home ("ten-wide") was introduced, along with the new term "mobile home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?q=289810|title=Mobile Manufactured Homes|author=|date=|website=ct.gov|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The homes were given a rectangular shape, made from pre-painted aluminum panels, rather than the streamlined shape of travel trailers, which were usually painted after assembly. All of this helped increase the difference between these homes and home/travel trailers. The smaller, "eight-wide" units could be moved simply with a car, but the larger, wider units ("ten-wide", and, later, "twelve-wide") usually required the services of a professional trucking company, and, often, a special moving permit from a state highway department. During the late 1960s and early 70s, the homes were made even longer and wider, making the mobility of the units more difficult. Nowadays, when a factory-built home is moved to a location, it is usually kept there permanently and the mobility of the units has considerably decreased. In some states, mobile homes have been taxed as personal property if the wheels remain attached, but as real estate, if the wheels are removed. Removal of the tongue and axles may also be a requirement for real estate classification.

===Manufactured home===
{{Main|Manufactured housing}}
[[File:Exterior Sectional.jpg|thumb|Example of a modern manufactured home in [[New Alexandria, Pennsylvania]]. 28 feet x 60 feet]]
Mobile homes built in the United States since June 1976, legally referred to as manufactured homes, are required to meet [[Federal Housing Administration|FHA]] certification requirements, and come with attached metal certification tags. Mobile homes permanently installed on owned land are rarely mortgageable, whereas FHA code manufactured homes are mortgageable through [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]], FHA, and [[Fannie Mae]].

Many people who could not afford a traditional site-built home, or did not desire to commit to spending a large sum of money on housing, began to see factory-built homes as a viable alternative for long-term housing needs. The units were often marketed as an alternative to apartment rental. However, the tendency of the units of this era to depreciate rapidly in resale value{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} made using them as collateral for loans much riskier than traditional home loans. Terms were usually limited to less than the thirty-year term typical of the general home-loan market, and interest rates were considerably higher.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  In this way, mobile home loans resembled motor vehicle loans more than traditional home [[mortgage loan]]s.

== Construction and sizes ==
[[Image:Manufactured Home Side walls are built and attached.jpg|thumb|Exterior wall assemblies being set in place during manufacture]]
Mobile homes come in two major sizes, ''single-wides'' and ''double-wides''. Single-wides are {{convert|18|ft|m}} or less in width and {{convert|90|ft|m}} or less in length and can be towed to their site as a single unit. Double-wides are {{convert|20|ft|m}} or more wide and are {{convert|90|ft|m}} in length or less and are towed to their site in two separate units, which are then joined together. ''Triple-wides'' and even homes with four, five, or more units are also built, although not as commonly.

While site-built homes are rarely moved, single-wide owners often "trade" or sell their home to a dealer in the form of the reduction of the purchase of a new home. These "used" homes are either re-sold to new owners or to park owners who use them as inexpensive rental units. Single-wides are more likely to be traded than double-wides because removing them from the site is easier. In fact, only about 5% of all double-wides will ever be moved.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

While an [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF1]] tornado might cause minor damage to a site-built home, it could do significant damage to a factory-built home, especially an older model or one that is not properly secured. Also, structural components (such as windows) are typically weaker than those in site-built homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterburycaravans.com.au/resources/caravan-repairs-insights.aspx|title=Caravan Repairs? Great Caravan Repair Deals!|work=canterburycaravans.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70 miles per hour (113 kilometers per hour) winds can destroy a mobile home in a matter of minutes. Many brands offer optional hurricane straps, which can be used to tie the home to anchors embedded in the ground.

== Regulations ==

===USA===
[[Image:F2 tornado damage example.jpg|thumb|right|Home struck by [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F2]] tornado]]
In the United States, these homes are regulated by the U.S. [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD), via the Federal National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. This national regulation has allowed many manufacturers to distribute nationwide because they are immune to the jurisdiction of local building authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drivinglaws.aaa.com/laws/titles-for-mobile-homes/|title=Titles for Mobile Homes|work=AAA Digest of Motor Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, producers of [[modular homes]] must abide by state and local building codes. There are, however, wind zones adopted by HUD that home builders must follow. For example, statewide, Florida is at least windzone 2. South Florida is windzone 3, the strongest wind zone. After [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992, new standards were adopted for home construction. The codes for building within these wind zones were significantly amended, which has greatly increased their durability. During the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004 hurricanes in Florida]], these standards were put to the test, with great success. Yet, older models continue to face the exposed risk to high winds because of the attachments applied such as carports, porch and screen room additions. These areas are exposed to "wind capture" which apply extreme force to the underside of the integrated roof panel systems, ripping the fasteners through the roof pan causing a series of events which destroys the main roof system and the home.

The popularity of the factory-built homes caused complications the [[legal system]] was not prepared to handle. Originally, factory-built homes tended to be taxed as vehicles rather than real estate, which resulted in very low property tax rates for their inhabitants. This caused local governments to reclassify them for taxation purposes.

However, even with this change, rapid [[depreciation]] often resulted in the home occupants paying far less in property taxes than had been anticipated and budgeted. The ability to move many factory-built homes rapidly into a relatively small area resulted in strains to the infrastructure and governmental services of the affected areas, such as inadequate water pressure and sewage disposal, and highway congestion. This led jurisdictions to begin placing limitations on the size and density of developments.

Early homes, even those that were well-maintained, tended to depreciate in value over time, much like motor vehicles.  This is in contrast to site-built homes which include the land they are built on and tend to appreciate in value.  The arrival of these homes in an area tended to be regarded with alarm, in part because of the devaluation of the housing potentially spreading to preexisting structures.

This combination of factors has caused most jurisdictions to place [[zoning]] regulations on the areas in which factory-built homes are placed, and limitations on the number and density of homes permitted on any given site. Other restrictions, such as minimum size requirements, limitations on exterior colors and finishes, and foundation mandates have also been enacted. There are many jurisdictions that will not allow the placement of any additional factory-built homes. Others have strongly limited or forbidden all single-wide models, which tend to depreciate in value more rapidly than modern double-wide models.

Apart from all the practical issues described above, there is also the constant discussion about legal [[Fixture (property law)|fixture]] and [[Personal property|chattels]] – meaning that the legal status of a trailer is, or could be, affected by its incorporation to the land or not. This sometimes involves such factors as whether or not the wheels have been removed.

The city of [[Cleveland, Mississippi|Cleveland]] in the state of [[Mississippi]]&amp;mdash;the poorest in the United States&amp;mdash;has made efforts to eliminate its "run-down mobile homes", which the city describes as "unsightly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Armour | first = Bryce | title = Are Cleveland, MS Old Homes and Trailers Still an Eyesore | publisher = EZ Homes | date = January 8, 2017 | url = http://www.mobilehomesell.com/are-cleveland-ms-old-homes-and-trailers-still-an-eyesore/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Carolina Board of Transportation allowed 14-foot-wide homes on the state's roads, but until January 1997, 16-foot-wide homes were not allowed. 41 states allowed 16-foot-side homes, but these were not sold in North Carolina. Under a trial program approved January 10, 1997, the wider homes could be delivered  on specific roads, at certain times of day, traveling 10 MPH below the speed limit, with escort vehicles in front and behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hackett | first = Thomas | title = Extra-wide homes to take to the road | work= [[News &amp; Observer]] | date = January 11, 1997 | page = A3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Wider trailer transport OK'd | last= Mitchell | first= Kirsten B. |work= [[Star-News]] | date = January 10, 1997 | page = 1A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, all homes had to leave the state on interstate highways.&lt;ref name=Whitacre/&gt; In December 1997, a study showed the wider homes could be delivered safely, but some opponents still wanted the program to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Study: Keep Curbs on Transporting Wide Mobile Homes | work= [[The Charlotte Observer]] | date = December 1, 1997 | page = 4C }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2, 1999, the N.C. Manufactured Housing Institute asked the state Board of Transportation asked to expand the program to allow deliveries of 16-foot-wide homes within North Carolina.&lt;ref name=Whitacre&gt;{{cite news | title = Mobile-Home Makers Look to Squeeze on N.C. Roads | last= Whitacre | first= Dianne |work= The Charlotte Observer | date = December 2, 1999 | page = 1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the board extended the pilot program by three months but did not vote to allow shipments within the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Program for wide mobile homes extended | last= Bonner | first= Lynn | work= News &amp; Observer | date = January 7, 2000 | page = A3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2000, the board voted to allow 16-foot-side homes to be shipped to other states on more two-lane roads, and to allow shipments in the state east of [[U.S. Route 220 in North Carolina|US 220]]. A third escort was required, including a [[law enforcement officer]] on two-lane roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Wide mobile homes given final approval | work= News &amp; Observer | date = June 3, 2000 | page = A3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile home parks ==
{{main|Trailer park}}
[[File:FEMA - 44989 - Ames, Iowa Mobile Homes Under Water.jpg|thumb|Meadow Lanes Estates Mobile Home Park, [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]], [[Iowa]],  August 2010, during a flood]]
Mobile homes are often sited in land lease communities known as [[trailer park]]s (also 'trailer courts', 'mobile home parks', 'mobile home communities', 'manufactured home communities', 'factory-built home communities' etc.), these communities allow homeowners to rent space on which to place a home. In addition to providing space, the site often provides basic utilities such as water, sewer, electricity, or natural gas and other amenities such as mowing, garbage removal, community rooms, pools, and playgrounds.

There are over 38,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhbo.com/ |title= Database of Mobile Home Parks in the United States |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; trailer parks in the United States ranging in size from 5 to over 1,000 home sites. Although most parks appeal to meeting basic housing needs, some communities specialize towards certain segments of the market. One subset of mobile home parks, retirement communities, restrict residents to those age 55 and older. Another subset of mobile home parks, seasonal communities, are located in popular vacation destinations or are used as a location for summer homes.

Newer homes, particularly double-wides, tend to be built to much higher standards than their predecessors and meet the [[building code]]s applicable to most areas. This has led to a reduction in the rate of value depreciation of most used units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/mobile-home |title= Homes |accessdate=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, modern homes tend to be built from materials similar to those used in site-built homes rather than inferior, lighter-weight materials. They are also more likely to physically resemble site-built homes. Often, the primary differentiation in appearance is that factory-built homes tend to have less of a roof slope so that they can be readily transported underneath bridges and overpasses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

The number of double-wide units sold exceeds the number of single-wides, which is due in part to the aforementioned zoning restrictions. Another reason for higher sales is the spaciousness of double-wide units, which are now comparable to site-built homes. Single-wide units are still popular primarily in rural areas, where there are fewer restrictions. They are frequently used as temporary housing in areas affected by natural disasters when restrictions are temporarily waived.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Another recent trend has been parks in which the owner of the mobile home owns the lot on which their unit is parked. Some of these communities simply provide land in a homogeneous neighborhood, but others are operated more like condominiums with club homes complete with swimming pools and meeting rooms which are shared by all of the residents, who are required to pay membership fees and dues.

== Mobile homes, by country ==
Mobile home (or mobile-homes) are used in many European campgrounds to refer to fixed [[travel trailer|caravans]], purpose-built [[Cottage|cabins]], and even large tents, which are rented by the week or even year-round as cheap accommodation, similar to the US concept of a [[trailer park]]. Like many US [[loanwords]], this term is not used widely in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== United Kingdom ===
[[Image:caravans at beer devon arp.jpg|thumb|right|A static caravan park on the cliffs above [[Beer, Devon|Beer]], [[Devon]], [[England]].]]
In the UK static caravans, which have wheels and a rudimentary chassis with no suspension or brakes, are therefore transported on the back of large flatbed lorries, the axle and wheels being used for movement to the final location when the static caravan is moved by tractor or 4x4. A static caravan will normally stay on a single plot for many years, and have many of the [[modern conveniences]] one would normally find in a home.

Mobile homes are designed and constructed to be transportable by road in one or two sections. Mobile homes are no larger than {{convert|20| x| 6.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} with an internal maximum height of {{convert|3.05|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. Legally, mobile homes can still be defined as "caravans".

Static holiday caravans generally have sleeping accommodation for 6 to 8 people in 2 to 3 bedrooms and on convertible seating in the lounge. They tend towards a fairly "open-plan" layout, and while some units are insulated and centrally heated for year-round use, cheaper models without double glazing or central heating are available for mainly summer use. Holiday homes are intended for leisure use and are available in {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} widths, a small number in {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on}} widths, and a few {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, consisting of two {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide units joined together. Generally, holiday homes are clad in painted steel panels, but can be clad in PVC panels. Static caravans are sited on caravan parks where the owner of the site leases a plot to the caravan owner. Many of these parks are sited in areas that are prone to flooding and anyone considering buying a sited static caravan needs to take particular care in checking that their site is not liable to flooding. Some park owners used to have unfair conditions in their lease contracts but the Office of Fair Trading has produced a guidance document available for download called [http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/business_leaflets/unfair_contract_terms/oft734.pdf Unfair Terms in Holiday Caravan Agreements] which aims to stop unfair practices.

=== Israel ===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1805 Architecture of Israel הצבת הקארוונים הכתומים.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Posting of ''caravan'' in [[Mitzpe Hila]], Israel, 1982]]
{{Main|Caravan (Israel)}}
Many [[Israeli settlement]]s and [[Israeli outpost|outposts]] are originally composed of caravans ({{lang-he|קראוואן}} ''caravan''; pl. קראוואנים, ''caravanim''). They are constructed of light metal, are not insulated but can be outfitted with heating and air-conditioning units, water lines, recessed lighting, and floor tiling to function in a full-service capacity. Starting in 2005, prefabricated homes, named ''caravillas'' ({{lang-he|קרווילה}}), a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of the words caravan, and [[villa]], begin to replace mobile homes in many Israeli settlements.

== Difference from modular homes ==
{{Main|Modular home}}

Because of similarities in the manufacturing process, some companies build both types in their factories. Modular homes are transported on flatbed trucks rather than being towed, and lack axles and an automotive-type frame. However, some of these homes are towed behind a [[semi-truck]] or [[toter]] on a frame similar to that of a trailer. The home is usually in two pieces and is hauled by two separate trucks. Each frame has five or more axles, depending on the size of the home. Once the home has reached its location, the axles and the tongue of the frame are then removed, and the home is set on a concrete foundation by a large [[crane (machine)|crane]].

Both styles are commonly referred to as factory-built housing, although that term's technical use is restricted to a class of homes regulated by the Federal National Mfd. Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974.

Most zoning restrictions on the homes have been found to be inapplicable or only applicable to modular homes. This occurs often after considerable litigation on the topic by affected jurisdictions and by plaintiffs failing to ascertain the difference. Most modern modulars, once fully assembled, are indistinguishable from site-built homes. Their roofs are usually transported as separate units. Newer modulars also come with roofs that can be raised during the setting process with cranes. There are also modulars with 2 or 3 stories. As the legal differentiation between the two becomes more codified, the market for modular homes is likely to grow.

The '''National Cultural Heritage Act''' (with the designation of '''Republic Act No. 10066''') is a law, or [[Republic Act]], of the [[Republic of the Philippines]].  It created the [[Philippine Registry of Cultural Property]] and took other steps to preserve historic buildings that are over 50 years old.&lt;ref name=Inquirer /&gt; It was signed into law on March 25, 2009.&lt;ref name=Ivan&gt;{{cite web|last=Henares|first=Ivan|title=Republic Act No. 10066 - National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009|url=http://www.ivanhenares.com/2010/04/republic-act-no-10066-national-cultural.html|publisher=Ivan about Town|accessdate=30 August 2012|date=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was passed in response to the 2000 demolition of the [[Manila Jai Alai Building]].&lt;ref name=Inquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Villalon|first=Toti|title=Remember jai alai: Stop making Manila heritage demolition victim|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/57505/remember-jai-alai-stop-making-manila-heritage-demolition-victim|accessdate=30 August 2012|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A house that has significant importance to the Filipino culture is declared to be a "Heritage House" by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] (NHCP), previously known as the National Historical Institute.&lt;ref name=Ivan /&gt;  Historical markers are placed on the houses by the commission to indicate their significance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelogphilippines.com/index.php/2009/11/silay-ancestral-house/ "Touring the Ancestral Houses of Silay, Negros Occidental"].

National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Retrieved on 2011-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The act also requires:

* That for "cultural property declared as Immovable Cultural Property, the appropriate cultural agency shall, after registration, give due notice to the Registry of Deeds having jurisdiction for annotation on the land titles..."&lt;ref name="RA1066"&gt;Section 14, Republic Act No. 10066.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That "Local government units, through their cultural offices, shall likewise maintain an inventory of cultural property under its jurisdiction and shall furnish the Commission a copy..."&lt;ref name="RA1066" /&gt;
* That "All government agencies and instrumentalities, [ [[government owned and controlled corporation]]s]...including public and private educational institutions, shall report their ownership and/or possession of such items to the pertinent cultural agency and shall register such properties within three (3) years from the effectivity of this Act."&lt;ref name="RA1066" /&gt;
* That "Private collectors and owners of cultural property shall register such properties, within three (3) years from the effectivity of this Act. The private collectors and owners of cultural property shall not be divested of their possession and ownership...even after registration of said property..." and that information on such private property "shall remain confidential and may be given only upon prior consent of the private owner."&lt;ref name="RA1066" /&gt;

The act defines "cultural property" as "all products of human creativity by which a people and a nation reveal their identity, including churches, mosques and other places of religious worship, schools and natural history specimens and sites, whether public or {{Sic|hide=y|privately|-}}owned, movable or immovable, and tangible or intangible." It deems all heritage structures, which are at least 50 years old, as presumed important cultural properties despite non-declaration by cultural agencies. Nonetheless, the government mandates all local government units to register these presumed important cultural properties to the database of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts for cultural documentation and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Republic Act No. 10066&lt;/ref&gt;

The citizen retains the ownership of the house; the government is only declaring the heritage value of the structure and providing funding for its protection and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;(2010-09-03).

''New Worlds, New Lives'' discusses the effects of globalization on a [[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]] identity,&lt;ref name=Takenakap250&gt;Takenaka, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; concerning those from the main islands of Japan and those from [[Okinawa]].&lt;ref&gt;Masterson, p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt; This discussion of the Nikkei includes those from the [[Japanese Bolivian|Bolivia]], [[Japanese Brazilian|Brazil]], [[Japanese Canadian|Canada]], [[Japanese Paraguayan|Paraguay]], [[Japanese Peruvian|Peru]] and [[Japanese American|United States]],&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1081/&gt; and also the ''[[dekasegi]]'', Nikkei who reside in [[Dekasegi|Japan]].&lt;ref name=Moyap389&gt;Moya, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; The editors state that to understand how globalization has affected the Nikkei community one must put together Japan, the originating country, and the overall Nikkei community in a "triadic perspective";&lt;ref name=Takenakap250251&gt;Takenaka, p. 250-251.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book, the "triadic framework" means examining Japan&lt;!--the "country of origin"--&gt;, the host country, and the ethnic organizations that link the host country and Japan along with the reproduction and maintenance of Nikkei ethnic identities. Yoko Yoshida of the ''[[Journal of International Migration and Integration]]'' wrote that "The greatest insight one can glean from this book is that only looking at ethnic groups in relation to their host societies does not capture the entire dynamics of the migration experience and the negotiation of cultural identity."&lt;ref name=Yoshidap447&gt;Yoshida, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; Ayumi Takenaka of the [[University of Oxford]] argued that the book's chapters "neither address their relationship nor the impact of globalization."&lt;ref name=Takenakap250251/&gt;

The book considers five results that may occur due to globalization. It may increase the Nikkei identity; erode the Nikkei identity; have no visible impact on the said identity; reduce the prominence of the Nikkei identity by, as Yoshida states, creating "global consciousness"; or generate an indicator of a decreasing Nikkei identity by establishing new "hybrid" identities.&lt;ref name=Yoshidap446&gt;Yoshida, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshida wrote that the editors of the book "fail to answer fully which outcome has emerged because globalization is never consistently conceptualized throughout this book."&lt;ref name=Yoshidap447/&gt;

Of the chapters, half only cite their own case studies and do not cite anything else. Jose C. Moya of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] argued that, in those chapters, this results in "a certain parochialism in their inability to engage the broader literature on migration and ethnicity."&lt;ref name=Moyap389/&gt; Keiko Yamanaka of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] wrote that before this book was published, there was scarce information about the Japanese in South America in English, and a lot of the information had been published in Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese, inaccessible to Anglophones.&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1082&gt;Yamanaka, p. 1082.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The volume, divided into 20 chapters,&lt;ref name=Takenakap250/&gt; includes 18 articles.&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1081/&gt; Of the eighteen authors, seventeen are either Japanese or Nikkei. The book's arguments are presented in the second and third sections.&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1081/&gt; The question of conjunction and disjunction of Nikkei identities is presented in sections two and three. Yoshida argued that this was "an interesting way to frame these sections".&lt;ref name=Yoshidap446/&gt;

Yamanaka wrote that most chapters have general discussions on their topics and are short in length.&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1082/&gt; Yoshikuni Igarashi of [[Vanderbilt University]] stated that the average chapter length was 16 pages, and because of the short length the essays "read more like encyclopedia entries than critical essays."&lt;ref name=Igaraship327&gt;Igarashi, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Takenaka argued that concluded that "most of the chapters seem to address some aspects of conjunction and disjunction of identities in one way or another" and that the chapters should have been organized by topic or geographic region.&lt;ref name=Takenakap250/&gt; Igarashi wrote that the book had organized its nomenclature along country-based boundaries.&lt;ref name=Igaraship328/&gt;

There are four chapters that discuss Peru.&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt; One chapter chronicle Japanese Peruvian history, covering from the year 1899 to the rule of [[Alberto Fujimori]]. Another chapter refers to one opinion poll of Peruvian Japanese conducted in 1989 and another conducted in 1998 and compares and contrasts the two.&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt;

There is an essay that discusses the Japanese political empowerment movements in three places: Brazil, Hawaii, and [[Gardena, California]] in [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Greater Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt;

There is also a section where the book discusses the formation of cosmopolitan, hybrid, and transnational identities.&lt;ref name=Moyap389/&gt; Robert Efird of [[Seattle University]] stated that the essays by Yuko Takezawa and Makoto Araki examine the boundary of what a "Nikkei" is.&lt;ref name=Efird&gt;Efird&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part One===
The first section is Part One: The Impact of Globalization on Nikkei Identities. It includes two chapters. Prior to those two chapters is the introduction to part one by [[Eiichiro Azuma]].&lt;ref name=TOCp1&gt;Hirabayashi, Kikumura-Yano, and Hirabayashi, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WOG8KRKse2MC&amp;pg=PR9 ix]. (Table of Contents, first page).&lt;/ref&gt;

Harumi Befu wrote "Globalization as Human Dispersal: Nikkei in the World",&lt;ref name=TOCp1/&gt; the introductory chapter, which puts Japanese immigration in a historical context.&lt;ref name=Mastersonp531&gt;Masterson, p. 531. "Doris Moromisato Miasato argues that women are vitually shut out of leadership roles in the most vital groups, such as the prefectural ''(kenjinkai)'' associations. She suggests that traditional patriarchical patterns in the Japanese-Peruvian community have submerged a complex and adaptive feminine perspective under the simplified term of ''Nikkei identity''."&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter is an overview of Japanese immigration from the 15th through the 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=Moyap390&gt;Moya, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter argues that the Japanese government encouraged immigration after 1870 in order to relieve pressures of a growing population and Befu believed that the Japanese government had acted in a callous manner towards these immigrants.&lt;ref name=Mastersonp531/&gt; Befu believes that the emigration policies of Japan had significant influence from the country's desire to gain a prominent position in the international system.&lt;ref name=Yoshidap446/&gt;

Befu categorizes into three phases the transition of Japanese immigration processes: pre-modern, modernization, and post-World War II.&lt;ref name=Yoshidap446/&gt; Befu categorizes Japanese immigrants into eight groups: premodern immigrants, pre-[[World War II]] immigrants, post-World War II immigrants, war brides, multinational businesspersons and their families, Japanese engaging in marriages to foreigners, and who Igarashi calls "those who have forsaken Japan".&lt;ref name=Igaraship327&gt;Igarashi, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Befu believes that examining the development of Nikkei communities in relation to the international economic and political structures is the best way of understanding them. Yoshida wrote that "Nevertheless, the rest of the book lacks a consistent and explicit engagement of this theme and the concept of globalization is used differently in the various works."&lt;ref name=Yoshidap446/&gt;

The second chapter in Part One is titled "The Impact of Contemporary Globalization on Nikkei Identities" and it is written by the volume's three editors.&lt;ref name=TOCp1/&gt;

===Part Two===
Part two, titled "Conjunctions of Nikkei Identities,"&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1081/&gt; discusses the "conjunction" of a Nikkei identity, meaning maintaining and spreading the identity.&lt;ref name=Takenakap250/&gt; Part 2 has eight chapters organized into two subparts: "Community Formations and Linkages" and "The Politics of Ethnic Reproduction: Education and Representation."&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1081/&gt; The introduction to part two is written by Lloyd Inui.&lt;ref name=TOCp1/&gt;

In subpart one, Jeffrey Lesser wrote "In Search of the Hyphen: Nikkei and the Struggle over Brazilian National Identity."&lt;ref name=TOCp1/&gt; This chapter discusses the interaction between [[Brazilian nationalism]] and the identity politics of Brazil's immigrant groups.&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt; Lesser's chapter chronicles the Brazilian Japanese peoples' attempt to find a place in the world society as the ''[[dekasegi]]'' can be perceived as foreigners in both Japan and Brazil.&lt;ref name=Mastersonp531/&gt; The other articles in subpart one are "Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia: Relief Materials and Nikkei Populations in the United States and Canada" by Masako Uno,&lt;ref name=TOCp1/&gt; "An Approach to the Formation of Nikkei Identity in Peru: Issei and Nisei" by Raúl Araki, and "The "Labor Pains" of Forging a Nikkei Community: A Study of the Santa Cruz Region in Bolivia" by Kozy Amemiya.&lt;ref name=TOCp2&gt;Hirabayashi, Kikumura-Yano, and Hirabayashi, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WOG8KRKse2MC&amp;pg=PR10 ix]. (Table of Contents, second page).&lt;/ref&gt; Amemiya's essay discusses efforts by the Japanese community in the Santa Cruz region to commemorate their history.&lt;ref name=Igaraship327/&gt;

The articles in subpart two are ""The Twain Shall Meet" in the Nisei? Japanese Language Education and U.S.-Japan Relations, 1900-1940" by Teruko Kumei, "The Nikkei's Education in the Japanese Language in Paraguay: The Japanese Educational System and Its Influence on the Colonies" by Emi Kasamatsu, "Peruvian Nikkei: A Sociopolitical Portrait" by Amelia Morimoto, and "Pathways to Power: Comparative Perspectives on the Emergence of Nikkei Ethnic Political Traditions" by Lane Ryo Hirabayashi.&lt;ref name=TOCp2/&gt;

Yoshida wrote that "I found that most of the literature cited in the second section lacks a specific link to the theme of globalization and its effects."&lt;ref name=Yoshidap446/&gt;

===Part Three===
The third part, titled, "Disjunctions of Nikkei Identities,"&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1081/&gt; discusses globalization-induced "disjunctions" of a Nikkei identity.&lt;ref name=Takenakap250/&gt; This part, which has a total of nine chapters, is divided into three subparts: "Gender and Identity," "The [[Dekasegi]] Phenomenon," and "Emerging Identities."&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1081/&gt; Richard Kosaki wrote the introduction to part three.&lt;ref name=TOCp2/&gt;

Included in subpart one is "I Woman, I Man, I Nikkei: Symbolic Construction of Femininity and Masculinity in the Japanese Community of Peru" by Doris Moromisato Miasato.&lt;ref name=TOCp2/&gt; Miasato's essay discusses the role of gender in Japanese Peruvian communities.&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt; Miasato argues that the Japanese-Brazilian community's patriarchical patterns are hiding a feminine perspective present in the community and that many vital Peruvian Nikkei groups including prefectural associations of ''kenjinkai''.&lt;ref name=Mastersonp531/&gt; Another chapter compares and contrasts the formations of the Peruvian and United States Nikkei communities in terms of class, nationalism, and race.&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt; In addition, the subpart has "Migration as a Negotiation of Gender: Recent Japanese Immigrant Women in Canada" by Audrey Kobayashi.&lt;ref name=TOCp2/&gt; This essay, which chronicles Japanese women who had recently emigrated to Canada, argues for a conclusion similar to that of Miasato's.&lt;ref name=Mastersonp531/&gt; Igarashi stated that both essays show the importance of women in the Nikkei communities.&lt;ref name=Igaraship327/&gt; The next article is "Race, Gender, Ethnicity and the Narrative of National Identity in the Films of Tizuka Yamazaki" by Naomi Hoki Moniz.&lt;ref name=TOCp2/&gt; This chapter discusses the Brazilian filmmaker [[Tizuka Yamazaki]].&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt;

The first article in the second subpart is "The Japanese-Brazilian ''Dekasegi'' Phenomenon: An Economic Perspective" by Edson Mori. The second article is "The ''Dekasegi'' Phenomenon and the Education of Japanese Brazilian Children in Japanese Schools" by Masato Ninomiya.&lt;ref name=TOCp3&gt;Hirabayashi, Kikumura-Yano, and Hirabayashi, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WOG8KRKse2MC&amp;pg=PR11 xi]. (Table of Contents, third page).&lt;/ref&gt; This essay is about children of Nikkei Latin Americans living in Japan and their issues in the Japanese educational system.&lt;ref name=Mastersonp531/&gt; The third article is "The Emigration of Argentines of Japanese Descent to Japan" by Marcelo G. Higa.&lt;ref name=TOCp3/&gt;

The first article in the third subpart is "The Nikkei Negotiation of Minorit/Majority Dynamics in Peru and the United States" by Steven Masami Ropp. The second is "The ''Uchinanchu'' Diaspora and the Boundary of "Nikkei"" by Makoto Arakaki.&lt;ref name=TOCp3/&gt; This essay, a discussion on the specific Okinawan identity,&lt;ref name=Takenakap250/&gt; chronicles the use of academic conferences, business conferences, and organizations to create a worldwide Okinawan perspective.&lt;ref name=Mastersonp531/&gt; The third article is "Nikkeijin and Multicultural Existence in Japan: Kobe after the Great Earthquake" by Yasuko I. Takezawa.&lt;ref name=TOCp3/&gt; It discusses the civil responses to the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin–Awaji earthquake]].&lt;ref name=Yamanakap1082/&gt;

Yoshida wrote that compared to the chapters of section two, "the chapters in section three more convincingly show how Nikkei communities have been affected by globalization."&lt;ref name=Yoshidap446/&gt;

===Part Four===
The concluding essay is "Retrospect and prospects," written by the three editors of the volume.&lt;ref name=TOCp3/&gt; In this chapter the editors wrote that the primary concern of the book is not the experiences of individual ethnic Japanese but instead with the concept of ethnic Japanese communities being "ethnic reproduction".&lt;ref name=Igaraship329&gt;Igarashi, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Daniel M. Masterson of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] argued that the book's editors "are to be complimented for this anthology's important contribution to the field of Japanese migration studies."&lt;ref name=Mastersonp531/&gt;

Moya states that the book is a "commendable effort",&lt;ref name=Moyap389/&gt; but that there is a sense of "conceptual looseness",&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt; or a lack of ability to compare the Nikkei of various countries because the authors did not collect and use the same statistics for all Nikkei groups.&lt;ref name=Moyap389/&gt; Moya concluded that "the book contains much that should be of interest to the readers of this journal."&lt;ref name=Moyap390/&gt;

Efird states that "not just essential reading for students and scholars of Nikkei issues" but also is an "instructive [primer] on the contingency of ethnic identity."&lt;ref name=Efird/&gt; He argues that the main weakness is "scant attention to the increasing intermarriage between Nikkei and other ethnic groups."&lt;ref name=Efird/&gt;

Igarashi argued that while the book's editors successfully created an encyclopedic reference about ethnic Japanese and the recent academic discussions about them, this resource "remains, regrettably, largely unusable because of their fragmented presentation", stating that "the appeal of the collection will likely be limited to a handful of Nikkei readers."&lt;ref name=Igaraship329/&gt; Igarashi wrote that the book "reconfirms" the "boundaries of the Nikkei" by trying to create a comprehensive resource and that it is difficult to analyze the cases in the volume due to the amount of information.&lt;ref name=Igaraship328/&gt;

The '''Oley Hills site''', or '''Oley Hills stone work site''', located in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]], is an enigmatic complex of snaking [[dry stone]] walls, carefully shaped rock piles or [[cairn]]s, perched boulders, and unusually shaped natural boulders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neara.org/Muller/mulleroleyhills.pdf "Accenting the Landscape: Interpreting the Oley Hills Site" by Norman Muller]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to see animal and human forms in some of the rock piles and boulders, but whether those images were intended by the builders or are phenomena of the imaginations of modern observers has not been demonstrated. The site boasts other features such as an enormous "split-wedged boulder," a split boulder with another stone wedged into the split.

When the complex was built and who built it is not known. The complex is large and elaborate, at {{convert|46|acre|ha}} in the central site alone, with many outliers along the ridge, as shown by the work of Norman Muller, conservator of the [[Princeton University Art Museum]], who argued it was thus unlikely to have been the product of a field clearing operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neara.org/MULLER/intro.htm Examination of a portion of the Oley Hills site]&lt;/ref&gt; Muller argued instead that the site was the product of Native American ceremonial practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neara.org/Muller/stonerows.htm Comparative study of sites at Oley Hills, PA and Montville, CT]&lt;/ref&gt; It may be an example of the [[ceremonial stone landscape]]s described by USET, United Southern and Eastern Tribes, Inc. in their resolution on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usetinc.org/images/images_res/2007037.pdf USET Resolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204022/http://www.usetinc.org/images/images_res/2007037.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''River North Gallery District'''  or simply '''River North''', in [[Chicago]], is in the [[Near North Side, Chicago]].  It hosts the largest concentration of [[Contemporary art gallery|art galleries]] in the [[United States]] outside of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | title = 2007 LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon Runner Information | work = www.chicagomarathon.com | publisher = LaSalle Bank | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012212715/http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | archivedate = 2011-10-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
River North has experienced vast changes in the years 1990 - 2012 including the development of vast highrise buildings, nightclubs and restaurants.   River North has become one of Chicago's top neighborhoods for nightlife especially on and around Hubbard Street.

A common definition puts the River North neighborhood in the area north of the Chicago River and the [[Merchandise Mart]], south of [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]], east of the Chicago River and west of Wabash Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rivernorthassociation.com|title=River North Business Association - RNBA - Home|website=www.rivernorthassociation.com|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with hundreds of art galleries, the area holds many bars, dance clubs, popular restaurants and entertainment venues. Subsections of River North include:

==History==

===Smokey Hollow===

River North was named Smokey Hollow around the turn of the 20th century due to the many factories and forges in the area. The smoke was often so thick that sunlight was blocked. At the time Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River with the surrounding areas. The Merchandise Mart still has railroad tracks underneath the building.  Massive [[coal bin]]s were throughout the neighborhood both bringing coal into the area from ships and storage for the multitude of factories and forges in River North. The Merchandise Mart was a major storage warehouse for goods. The Merchandise Mart was later purchased by the Kennedy family. Former retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North.

===Little Sicily===

Little Sicily in Chicago was also located in River North.  The city's first Italian Roman Catholic Church in Chicago was Assumption Parish on Illinois Street, with a mandate to be the Parish for all Italians living between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River.  Later Sicilians began to move northward from the immediate vicinity of Assumption and began to form their own parishes. Italians whose family roots were from other parts of Italy tended to move west along Grand Street and formed Parishes west of Assumption.

===Prohibition===

In 1921, Dean O'Banion married Viola Kaniff and bought an interest in William Schofield's River North flower shop, near the corner of West Chicago Avenue and North State Street.  O'Banion needed a legitimate front for his bootlegging operation. In addition, he was fond of flowers and was an excellent arranger.

Schofield's became the florist of choice for many funerals.

The shop happened to be directly across the street from Holy Name Cathedral, where O'Banion and Weiss attended Mass. The rooms above Schofield's were used as the headquarters for the North Side Gang which controlled the bootlegging operations in what would later be called River North and the Gold Coast area of Chicago.

On the morning of November 10, 1924, O'Banion was clipping chrysanthemums in Schofield's back room. Frankie Yale entered the shop with Torrio and Capone gunmen John Scalise and Albert Anselmi. When O'Banion attempted to greet Yale with a handshake, Yale clasped O'Banion's hand in a death grip.    At the same time, Scalise and Anselmi fired two bullets into O'Banion's chest, two in his cheeks, and two in his throat and Dean O'Banion died instantly.

===Punk rock history===

One of the biggest punk rock clubs of the 1970s was located in River North - called O'Banion's after the infamous hit on Dean O'Banion.

The River North neighborhood fell on difficult times starting in the 1960s with many families moving into the suburbs to escape urban blight.  Many buildings were torn down and became parking lots. Crime was a dangerous part of daily life.

Assumption Church on Illinois Street during this time reported that many of its Parishioners had moved to the suburbs and that few people remained living within its Parish boundaries as established by the Archdiocese of Chicago. Assumption Parish survived during this time on Parishioners who traveled from the suburbs to attend Mass in the old neighborhood every Sunday.

===Development of the River North neighborhood===

[[Image:20090518 Trump International Hotel and Tower, Chicago.jpg|thumb|310px|[[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]] as viewed from the [[Chicago River]]]]

The River North neighborhood got its name from Chicago real estate developer Albert Friedman (chief executive of Friedman Properties Ltd.), who in 1974 started to buy, restore and build commercial property in the southeast sector.&lt;ref name=tribune11&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/communities/chi-river-north_chomes_0711jul11,0,1786787.story | title = River North: From gritty roots to urban chic | work = www.chicagotribune.com | publisher = Chicago Tribune | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-11 | first=Susan | last=Diesenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the area was a [[skid row]] at the time, so in an effort to attract tenants Friedman started calling the area "River North".&lt;ref name=tribune11/&gt; Within a few years, Friedman found photographers, ad agencies and art galleries willing to rent the low cost space and coalesce into what is now the River North Gallery District,&lt;ref name=tribune11/&gt; which has the largest concentration of art galleries in the United States outside of Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | title = 2007 LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon Runner Information | work = www.chicagomarathon.com | publisher = LaSalle Bank | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012212715/http://www.chicagomarathon.com/CMS400Min/Chicago_Marathon/runner_information/index.aspx?id=486 | archivedate = 2011-10-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
River North from 1990 to 2012 became one of Chicago's top neighborhoods for nightlife especially along Franklin Street and Hubbard Street. It is a top destination for restaurants, nightclubs and living for people who move to Chicago.  During this time numerous highrises have been developed, dramatically increasing the population of River North.

'''Robert Elsie''' (June 29, 1950 – October 2, 2017) was a Canadian-born German scholar who specialized in [[Albanian literature]] and 
[[Albanian mythology|folklore]].

== Life ==
Born on June 29, 1950 [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, Elsie studied at the [[University of British Columbia]], graduating in 1972 with a diploma in [[Classical antiquity|Classical Studies]] and [[Linguistics]]. In the following years, he continued his post-graduate studies at the [[Free University of Berlin]], at the ''[[École Pratique des Hautes Études]]'' and at the [[University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne]], at the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]], and at the [[University of Bonn]], where he finished his doctorate on Linguistics and Celtic Studies in 1978 at the Linguistics Institute.

From 1978 on, Elsie visited Albania several times with a group of students and professors from the University of Bonn. For several years, he also attended the [[:sq:Seminari Ndërkombëtar për Gjuhën, Letërsinë dhe Kulturën Shqiptare|International Seminar on Albanian Language, Literature and Culture]], held in [[Pristina]], Kosovo. From 1982 to 1987, he worked for the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in Bonn, and from 2002 to 2013 for the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] in The Hague, in particular as an interpreter for several noted cases including the [[trial of Slobodan Milošević]].

Elsie's scholarly travels and interest in [[Albanian dialects]] brought him into contact with [[Albanians]] from Albania, [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo]], [[Albanians in Greece|Greece]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanians of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Albanians in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Albanians in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and [[Albanians in Turkey|Turkey]] and made dozens of recordings of the [[Albanian language]].&lt;ref name="TiranaTimesElsie2"/&gt;

As a translator Robert Elsie offered the reader “a selection of songs from the best known cycle of [[Albanian epic verse]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=John Kolsti | title=Robert Elsie and Janice Mathie-Heck, eds. and trans.| publisher=Journals.ku.edu |work=Folklorica| url= https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/folklorica/article/viewFile/3776/3614| accessdate= June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsie during his lifetime authored many works of scholarship and had no unpublished work left for completion prior to his death.&lt;ref name="TiranaTimesElsie2"/&gt;

== Founders and history ==

Rome2rio was founded by Bernhard Tschirren and Dr Michael Cameron, two ex-Microsoft software engineers. The site was born out of their frustrations with the lack of a fast, easy-to-use, and comprehensive multi-modal search engine with global coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnooz.com/2011/04/07/tlabs/tlabs-showcase-rome2rio/ TLabs Showcase – Rome2rio].

'''''The Shaker Quarterly''''' was a [[Periodical literature|periodical]] published by the [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]] from 1961 to 1996. It served as a [[academic journal|journal]] and [[newsletter]] about the [[Shakers]], and at times also doubled as a [[mail order]] catalog advertising products created by the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake. It was the first regular Shaker publication since the ''Manifesto'' ceased publication in 1899.&lt;ref name=Paterwic&gt;{{cite book|last=Paterwic|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQhY03JJvTAC|title=The A to Z of the Shakers|location=Plymouth|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|isbn=9780810870567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Quarterly'' was launched in 1961 by Theodore E.

'''Victor Chan''' ([[Hong Kong]], 1945) is a physicist and a Hong-Kong-born Canadian writer. Founder of the [[Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education]], Chan has known the [[14th Dalai Lama]] since 1972. Co-author with him of two essays, he also wrote a guide of pilgrimage to Tibet. He lives in Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tibethouse.us/programs/full-calendar/view/671975/114 Book Signing With Victor Chan - The Wisdom of Compassion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109182831/http://tibethouse.us/programs/full-calendar/view/671975/114 |date=2014-01-09 }}, mars 2013, [[Tibet House]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC bookworld"&gt;en [http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=2502  Victor Chan], [[B.C. BookWorld]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Victor Chan was born in 1945 in Hong Kong which he left at the age of 20 years. He continued his education in Canada and the United States. He performed his graduate studies at the [[Enrico Fermi Institute]]&lt;ref name="Victoria Finlay"&gt;[[Victoria Finlay]], [http://www.wisdomofforgiveness.com/iv_scmp.htm Spiritual Grazing Ground], [[South China Morning Post]], 22 avril 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  of the [[University of Chicago]] in the field of [[particle physics]].&lt;ref name="ABC bookworld" /&gt;

In 1971, after his studies, Chan traveled to Europe in a van. His route took him to the [[Netherlands]] to [[Turkey]], and then through [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]. During the travel, he was joined by two women, Cheryl Crosby, an American, and Rita, a German. In [[Kabul]], they were taken in hostage until the vehicle of hijackers crashed, allowing them to escape. Cheryl Crosby, a New York Buddhist practitioner, proposed Chan to go to [[Dharamshala]] in India, where they arrived in March 1972. Cheryl had a letter of introduction to meet the Dalai Lama to discuss meditation. After answering her questions, the Dalai Lama turned to Victor Chan. Chan asked him if he hated the Chinese. He unhesitatingly replied negatively, explaining that he had forgiven the Chinese and did not blame the Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;en John B. Roberts, Elizabeth A. Roberts, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BSb-a72RyQMC&amp;pg=PA177 Freeing Tibet: 50 Years of Struggle, Resilience, and Hope]'', AMACOM, 2009, {{ISBN|0814413757}}, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Chan became a close friend of the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Pico Iyer" /&gt;

Between 1984 and 1988, he lived 4 years in [[Nepal]], using [[Kathmandu]] as a base to travel to [[Tibet]]. In 1984, Chan made his first visit there, traveling 42,000 kilometers by foot, horse, yak, coracle, truck and bus.&lt;ref name="Kirkus Reviews"&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/dalai-lama/wisdom-compassion/ Tales of kindness and understanding from the Dalai Lama.], [[Kirkus Reviews]], 23 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in 1990 and traveled some of the main paths of sacred Tibetan pilgrimage, including [[Kailash]], Tsari and Lapchi, the 3 most sacred mountains.&lt;ref name="ABC bookworld" /&gt; He then left Tibet and began to write. After 5 years of research in Europe, he published his guide to Tibet in 1994, a book he presented to the Dalai Lama in London the same year, 22 years after their last meeting.&lt;ref name="Daniel Wood"&gt;Daniel Wood, ''[http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Buddhism+Dalai+Lama/1445748/story.html Buddhism: The Dalai Lama and me]'', ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'',  3 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Michael Aris]] wrote that this is the most detailed and comprehensive guide to Tibet, a landmark work of an worthy successor of the great explorers of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Kirkus Reviews"/&gt;

In 1999, Victor Chan asked the Dalai Lama if he could collaborate on a book.&lt;ref name="Daniel Wood2005"&gt;Daniel Wood,  [https://www.straight.com/life/wisdom-forgiveness-dalai-lama-and-victor-chan The Wisdom of Forgiveness, by the Dalai Lama and Victor Chan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106045724/http://www.straight.com/life/wisdom-forgiveness-dalai-lama-and-victor-chan |date=2014-01-06 }}, ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'', 17 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

For this book, ''[[The Wisdom of Forgiveness]]'', originally published in English in 2004, and translated into 14 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcbooklook.com/about/whos-who/ Who’s Who], BC BookLook&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Chan has recorded hundreds of hours in the company of the Dalai Lama, following him in his travels around the world for conferences and Buddhist ceremonies, and realized dozens of daily interviews at his residence in Dharamsala, India, observing, discussing with him&lt;ref name="Daniel Wood2005"/&gt; and witnessing private audiences granted to personalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressesduchatelet.com/livres/savoir-pardonner Dalaï-Lama, Victor Chan, Savoir pardonner]&lt;/ref&gt; When the Dalai Lama was asked why he allowed Chan to follow his life so closely, he explained: "His parents are Chinese. He grew up in Western atmosphere, but he is Chinese. I always believe in understanding. The Chinese living in America, it is very, very important to have one single Chinese, to have close contact, and a better understanding of Tibetans. Whenever they find opportunities to meet Chinese brothers and sisters showing interest in me and Tibet, to tell them the truth. I'm very happy. Secondly, (Victor) came to Dharamsala several meetings, on a few occasions he showed very strong emotions, so that means he's very sincere, not artificial, not cheating. Heart sincerity, that's important".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lomartire, ''[http://www.phayul.com/news/tools/print.aspx?id=7737&amp;t=1 Hangin' with His Holiness]'', [[The Palm Beach Post]], 23 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; From the book, the two men are good friends.&lt;ref name="Daniel Wood2005"/&gt;

[[File:Dalai Lama and Bishop Tutu. Carey Linde.jpg|thumb|[[14th Dalai Lama]] and [[Desmond Tutu]] at the [[Chan Centre for the Performing Arts]], Vancouver in 2004]]

With Pitman B. Potter, director of the [[Institute of Asian Research]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], Victor Chan organized&lt;ref name="Daniel Wood" /&gt; a symposium from 17 to 20 April 2004,&lt;ref name="David F. Dawes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Todd]], ''[http://www.wisdomofforgiveness.com/iv_lottery.htm Lama-palooza ticket rush to be solved through lottery]'', ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', 6 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Chan Centre for the Performing Arts]] Vancouver on the theme of peace and reconciliation. He invited the Dalai Lama to Canada where his last visit had 10 years previously. Two other Nobel laureates, [[Desmond Tutu]], a longtime friend of the Dalai Lama, and [[Shirin Ebadi]], gave each a conference. [[Václav Havel]], another longtime friend of the Dalai Lama initially invited, canceled his visit at the last minute due to medical reason.&lt;ref name="Pico Iyer"&gt;[[Pico Iyer]], [[The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama]], p. 70-82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ekman]], who attended the event in the public reports that Dr. Jo-Ann Archibald, Indian North America, and Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]] also pronounced a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Ekman]], ''[[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]], La voie des émotions, entretien avec Paul Ekman,'' (préface de [[Matthieu Ricard]]), City Editions, 2008, {{ISBN|2352881935}}, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Anglican Bishop [[Michael Ingham (bishop)|Michael Ingham]] was moderator of the discussion that closed the conference.&lt;ref name="David F.

With Pitman B. Potter, Victor Chan founded a Tibetan studies program.,&lt;ref name="ABC bookworld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Wood" /&gt;

Apart from the Dalai Lama to Vancouver three times in 2004, 2006, and 2009,&lt;ref name="ABC bookworld" /&gt; he also invited celebrities such as [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Matthieu Ricard]], [[Mia Farrow]], [[Jane Goodall]], [[Peter Buffett]], [[Daniel Goleman]], [[Daniel J.

Victor Chan founded the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education in Vancouver in 2005.&lt;ref name="ABC bookworld" /&gt; Chan's efforts led to the creation of an institution that, according to [[Douglas Todd]] has become a force field for global change - with a particular focus on education reform, global philanthropy and promoting women's rights.&lt;ref name="Douglas Todd2009"/&gt;

In 2013 he published with the Dalai Lama ''The Wisdom of Compassion'', which addresses, in particular, the scientific study of meditation on compassion.

[[Image:1896 DanLeno-WidowTwankey.jpg|thumb|[[Dan Leno]] in the role of Widow Twankey, for an 1896 performance at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], (photograph by [[Alfred Ellis (photographer)|Alfred Ellis]]).]]
'''Widow Twankey''' is a female character in the [[pantomime]] ''[[Aladdin]]''. The character is a [[pantomime dame]], portrayed by a man; and is a comic foil to the [[principal boy]], Aladdin—played by an actress.

==History==
The story of Aladdin is drawn from the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', a collection of [[Middle-Eastern]] fables. It was first published in England between 1704 and 1714; and this story was dramatised in 1788 by [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keefe]] for [[Royal Opera, London|Covent Garden]]. In 1813, a comic character of the "dumb slave" was introduced to ''Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp'', as a vehicle for the clown, [[Joseph Grimaldi]], and at the same time, a washer-woman, ''Ching Mustapha'' was introduced to the play.&lt;ref name=Play/&gt;

Widow Twankey first occurs in 1861; the character runs a [[Chinese laundry]] in [[Beijing|Peking]], China and is a [[pantomime dame]]; that is, always played by a man. One of her sons, Aladdin, is the hero of the pantomime, while her other son, often named Wishy Washy (or Wishee Washee), just helps in the laundry. She is not pivotal in the plot (such as it is), but more a source of interaction with the audience through [[joke]]s and [[innuendo]] – mostly centred on items of [[underwear]] on the [[washing line]].

The character has had a number of different names over the years: ''Ching Mustapha'' was followed by ''Wee Ping'', ''Chow Chow'', and ''Tan King''. In 1861, the character became the Widow Twankay – named after a cheap blend of China tea.&lt;ref name=Play&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/pantomime-origins/ "The origin of popular pantomime stories"], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Twankay'', or 'twankey' is an inferior grade of [[green tea]], with an old, ragged, open leaf – the implication is that the widow is 'past her best' — with the name Twankay deriving from [[Tunxi District|Tunxi]] in [[Anhui]], from where the tea in China originates.&lt;ref&gt;The Chambers Dictionary (8th edn, 1998) Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the spelling of her name in the programme (but not the pronunciation on the stage) is varied to make it look more like a "Chinese" personal name – e.g., "Tuang Kee Chung" in a 1979 [[Aladdin (1979 musical)|musical version]].

The story is located in a mythical China, but with many [[Arabic]] ideas, names and places which betray its Middle-Eastern origins. In some productions, the Chinese laundry is located in [[Limehouse]], in the [[East End of London]]. There was a considerable [[Chinatown, London|chinatown]] located here, since the early 19th century, to serve the needs of Chinese seamen. The area became infamous through exaggerated reports of [[opium den]]s and [[slum housing]]. Since the destruction of World War II, it has relocated to [[Soho]].

==Portrayals==
[[Joseph Grimaldi]] took many of the early female roles in pantomimes at Drury Lane. He was notable for introducing the pantomime dame, and the tradition of audience participation and community singing. He was a specialist in physical comedy; particularly tumbling and falling.&lt;ref name=grimaldi&gt;Moody, Jane. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/11630 "Grimaldi, Joseph (1778–1837)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The first "Widow Twankey" was played by James Rogers at the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] on 1 April 1861, in an 'extravanganza' by [[H. J. Byron]], ''Aladdin or The Wonderful Scamp'' – this play also featured a character named [[Pekoe]].&lt;ref name=Play/&gt; 

The comedian [[Dan Leno]] portrayed Widow Twankey from 1896 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], with [[Marie Lloyd]] in the role of principal boy – Aladdin. Leno introduced dancing and long monologues with the audience to the role – bringing the then popular [[music hall]] into pantomime.

Aladdin continues as a part of the repertoire of the Christmas season. Today, the dame is often played by popular television stars, but in 2004 and 2005, Sir [[Ian McKellen]] played the part of Widow Twankey at the [[Old Vic]]. This reintroduced a tradition of senior classical actors playing pantomime, which was originally played in the theatrical off-season between December and April. This script was heavy with adult innuendo such as "I've got something cheesy bubbling in my oven" and "your front porch could do with a good lick".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1377238,00.html ''Aladdin''] [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 20 December 2004 accessed 10 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A musical version of ''[[Aladdin (1979 musical)|Aladdin]]'' was commissioned from [[Sandy Wilson]], for the 1979–80 reopening season of the [[Lyric Hammersmith]].

[[Robert Bathurst]], [[Kenneth Connor]], [[Karen Dunbar]], [[Melvyn Hayes]], [[Sean Mathias]], [[George Herbert Rogers]], and [[Michael Fenton Stevens]] also have appeared in the role.

A character named "Widow Twanky" was also portrayed by [[Michael Hurst]] (credited as "Edith Sidebottom") in three ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'' episodes. First in the season four episode "[[...and Fancy Free]]", followed by the episode "[[Men in Pink]]". He later reprised the role for the final time in a season five episode entitled "[[Greece Is Burning]]". The character of Widow Twanky is a diva, married at least 12 times, and a teacher of dance.

[[File:Lutoslawski3.jpg|thumb|right|Witold Lutosławski. Courtesy of W. Pniewski and L. Kowalski.]]

'''Witold Roman Lutosławski''' ({{IPA-pol|ˈvitɔld lutɔsˈwafski|lang}}; 25 January 1913 – 7 February 1994) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[composer]] and orchestral [[Conducting|conductor]]. He was one of the major European composers of the 20th century, and one of the preeminent Polish musicians during his last three decades. He earned many international awards and prizes. His compositions (of which he was a notable conductor) include four [[symphony|symphonies]], a [[Concerto for Orchestra (Lutosławski)|Concerto for Orchestra]], a string quartet, instrumental works, [[concertos]], and orchestral [[song cycle]]s.

During his youth, Lutosławski studied piano and composition in [[Warsaw]]. His early works were influenced by Polish [[folk music]]. His style demonstrates a wide range of rich atmospheric [[texture (music)|textures]]. He began developing his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s. His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building [[harmony|harmonies]] from small groups of [[interval (music)|musical intervals]]. It also uses [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] processes, in which the rhythmic coordination of parts is subject to an element of chance.

During [[World War II]], after escaping German capture, Lutosławski made a living by playing the piano in [[Warsaw]] bars. After the war, [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] authorities banned his First Symphony for being "[[Russian Formalism|formalist]]"—allegedly accessible only to an elite. Lutosławski believed such anti-formalism was an unjustified retrograde step, and he resolutely strove to maintain his artistic integrity. In the 1980s, Lutosławski gave artistic support to the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement. Near the end of his life, he was awarded the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]], Poland's highest honour.

== Biography ==
Lutosławski's parents were both born into the Polish landed nobility. His family owned estates in the area of [[Drozdowo, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Drozdowo]]. His father Józef was involved in the Polish [[National Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democratic Party]] (''"Endecja"''), and the Lutosławski family became intimate with its founder, [[Roman Dmowski]] (Witold Lutosławski's middle name was Roman). Józef Lutosławski studied in [[Zürich]], where in 1904 he met and married a fellow student, Maria Olszewska, who later became Lutosławski's mother. Józef pursued his studies in London, where he acted as correspondent for the [[National Democracy|National-Democratic]] newspaper, ''Goniec''. He continued to be involved in National Democracy politics after returning to Warsaw in 1905, and took over the management of the family estates in 1908. Witold Roman Lutosławski, the youngest of three brothers, was born in Warsaw shortly before the outbreak of [[World War I]]. In 1915, with Russia at war with Germany, [[Prussia]]n forces drove towards Warsaw. The Lutosławskis travelled east to Moscow, where Józef remained politically active, organising [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] ready for any action that might liberate Poland (which was divided according to the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]]—[[Warsaw]] was part of [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]]). Dmowski's strategy was for Russia to guarantee security for a new Polish state. However, in 1917, the [[February Revolution]] forced the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] to abdicate, and the [[October Revolution]] started a new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government that made peace with Germany. Józef's activities were now in conflict with the [[Bolshevik]]s, who arrested him and his brother Marian. Thus, although fighting stopped on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Lutosławskis were prevented from returning home. The brothers were interned in [[Butyrka prison|Butyrskaya prison]] in central Moscow, where Witold—by then aged five—visited his father. Józef and Marian were executed by a firing squad in September 1918, some days before their scheduled trial.

After the war, the family returned to [[Second Polish Republic|the newly independent Poland]], only to find their estates ruined. After his father's death, other members of the family played an important part in his early life, especially Józef's half-brother [[Kazimierz Lutosławski]] – priest and politician.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw'': Marszałkowska 21. NIFC 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutosławski started piano lessons in Warsaw for two years from the age of six. After the [[Polish-Soviet War]] the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother returned to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In 1924 Lutosławski entered secondary school ([[Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Stefana Batorego (Warsaw, Poland)|Stefan Batory Gymnasium]]) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of [[Karol Szymanowski]]'s ''Third Symphony'' deeply affected him. In 1925 he started violin lessons at the Warsaw Music School.&lt;ref&gt;''Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw'': Plac Trzech Krzyży 18. NIFC 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 he enrolled at [[Warsaw University]] to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory. His only composition teacher was [[Witold Maliszewski]], a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. Lutosławski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly [[movement (music)|movements]] in [[sonata form]]. In 1932 he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of [[Jerzy Lefeld]], he gained a diploma for piano performance from the Conservatory in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Toccata]]'' and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|fourth piano concerto]]. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.

=== World War II ===
[[File:Andrzej Panufnik Witold Lutosławski 1990.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lutosławski (right) greets his old friend [[Andrzej Panufnik]] (left) in 1990.]]

Military service followed—Lutosławski was trained in signalling and radio operating in Zegrze near Warsaw. He completed his ''Symphonic Variations'' in 1939, and the work was premiered by the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by [[Grzegorz Fitelberg]], and this performance was broadcast on radio on 9 March 1939.&lt;ref&gt;''Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw'': Konopnickiej 6. NIFC 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most young Polish composers, Lutosławski wanted to continue his education in Paris. His plans for further musical study were dashed in September 1939, when [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded western Poland]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Russia invaded eastern Poland]]. Lutosławski was mobilised with the radio unit for the [[Kraków Army]]. He was soon captured by German soldiers, but he escaped while being marched to prison camp, and walked {{convert|400|km|order=flip}} back to Warsaw. Lutosławski's brother was captured by Russian soldiers and later died in a [[Siberia]]n [[Labor camp|labour camp]].

To earn a living, Lutosławski joined as an arranger-pianist "Dana Ensemble", the first Polish revellers, singing in "Ziemiańska Cafe".&lt;ref&gt;''Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw'': Mazowiecka 12. NIFC 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Then he formed a piano duo with friend and fellow composer [[Andrzej Panufnik]], and they performed together in Warsaw cafés.&lt;ref&gt;''Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw'': Królewska 11 („SiM”); Szpitalna 5 („Lira”); Mazowiecka 5 (Aria, U Aktorek). NIFC 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Their repertoire consisted of a wide range of music in their own arrangements, including the first incarnation of Lutosławski's ''Paganini Variations'', a highly original transcription of the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|24th Caprice]] for solo violin by [[Niccolò Paganini]]. Defiantly, they even sometimes played Polish music (the Nazis banned Polish music in Poland—including Chopin), and composed Resistance songs. Listening in cafés was the only way in which the Poles of German-occupied Warsaw could hear live music; putting on concerts was impossible since the Germans occupying Poland prohibited any organised gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;Panufnik (1987): see particularly Chapter 8, ''Occupation'', for an account of Panufnik and Lutosławski's duo in German-occupied Warsaw&lt;/ref&gt; In café ''Aria'', where they played, Lutosławski met his future wife Maria Danuta Bogusławska, a sister of the writer [[Stanisław Dygat]].

Lutosławski left Warsaw in July 1944 with his mother, merely a few days before the [[Warsaw Uprising]], salvaging only a few scores and sketches—the rest of his music was lost during the complete destruction of the city by Germans after the fall of uprising, as were the family's Drozdowo estates. Of the 200 or so arrangements that Lutosławski and Panufnik had worked on for their piano duo, only Lutosławski's ''Paganini Variations'' survived. Lutosławski returned to the ruins of Warsaw after the Polish-Soviet treaty in April 1945.

=== Post-war years ===
[[File:Lutoslawski witold 1952-53.jpg|thumbnail|Witold Lutosławski at the piano]]

During the postwar years, Lutosławski worked on his first symphony—sketches of which he had salvaged from Warsaw—which he had started in 1941 and which was first performed in 1948, conducted by Fitelberg. To provide for his family, he also composed music that he termed ''functional'', such as the ''Warsaw Suite'' (written to accompany a silent film depicting the city's reconstruction), sets of ''Polish Carols'', and the study pieces for piano, ''Melodie Ludowe'' ("Folk Melodies").

In 1945, Lutosławski was elected as secretary and treasurer of the newly constituted {{Interlanguage link multi|Union of Polish Composers|pl|3=Związek Kompozytorów Polskich|vertical-align=sup}} (ZKP—''Związek Kompozytorów Polskich''). In 1946, he married Danuta Bogusławska. The marriage was a lasting one, and Danuta's drafting skills were of great value to the composer: she became his copyist, and she solved some of the notational challenges of his later works.

In 1947, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] political climate led to the adoption and imposition by the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]] of the tenets of [[Socialist realism]], and the authorities' condemnation of modern music which was deemed to be non-conformist. This artistic censorship, which ultimately came from [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] personally, was to some degree prevalent over the whole [[Eastern bloc]], and was reinforced by the 1948 [[Zhdanov Doctrine|Zhdanov decree]]. By 1948, the ZKP was taken over by musicians willing to follow the party line on musical matters, and Lutosławski resigned from the committee. He was implacably opposed to the ideas of Socialist realism.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), pp. 36–37; Stucky (1981) p. 63 quotes Lutosławski speaking in 1957, "[I]t is difficult to conceive of a more absurd hypothesis than the idea that the achievements of the past several decades should be abandoned and that one should return to the musical language of the nineteenth century .... The period of which I speak may not have lasted long ... but all the same it was long enough to do our music immense harm."&lt;/ref&gt; His ''First Symphony'' was proscribed as "formalist", and he found himself shunned by the Soviet authorities, a situation that continued throughout the era of [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]], [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]], [[Yuri Andropov|Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko|Chernenko]]. In 1954, the climate of musical oppression drove his friend Andrzej Panufnik to [[defector|defect]] to the United Kingdom. Against this background, Lutosławski was content to compose pieces for which there was social need, but in 1954 this earned him—much to the composer's chagrin—the Prime Minister's Prize for a set of children's songs. He commented: "[I]t was for those functional compositions of mine that the authorities decorated me .... I realised that I was not writing indifferent little pieces, only to make a living, but was carrying on an artistic creative activity in the eyes of the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;Varga (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was his substantial and original [[Concerto for Orchestra (Lutosławski)|Concerto for Orchestra]] of 1954 that established Lutosławski as an important composer of art music. The work, commissioned in 1950 by the conductor [[Witold Rowicki]] for the newly reconstituted Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, earned the composer two state prizes in the following year.

=== Maturity ===
[[File:Lutoslawski2.jpg|thumb|right|Witold Lutosławski conducting]]

[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death in 1953 allowed a certain relaxation of the cultural totalitarianism in Russia and its [[Eastern bloc|satellite states]]. By 1956, [[History of the Soviet Union#De-Stalinization and the Khrushchev era|political events]] had led to a partial thawing of the musical climate, and the [[Warsaw Autumn]] Festival of Contemporary Music was founded. Conceived as a biennial festival, it has been held annually ever since 1958 (except under [[Martial law in Poland|Martial law in 1982]] when, in protest, the ZKP refused to organise it). The first performance of his ''[[Musique funèbre]]'' (in Polish, ''Muzyka żałobna'', English ''Funereal Music'' or ''Music of Mourning'') took place in 1958. It was written to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of [[Béla Bartók]], but took the composer four years to complete. This work brought international recognition, the annual ZKP prize and the [[International Rostrum of Composers]] prize in 1959.  Lutosławski's [[harmony|harmonic]] and [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] thinking were developed in this work, and in the ''Five songs'' of 1956–57, as he introduced his twelve-note system, the fruits of many years of thought and experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), chapter 3, ''The years of transition: 1955–1960''&lt;/ref&gt; He established another feature of his compositional technique, which became a Lutosławski signature, when he began introducing randomness into the exact [[synchronization|synchronisation]] of various parts of the musical ensemble in ''[[Jeux vénitiens]]'' ("Venetian games").&lt;ref&gt;Earlier use of a similar technique has been noted in the music of American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]], for example see {{cite web |title=Early Aleatory Counterpoint |url=http://aleacounterpoint.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/orpheus/ |author=Lynn Fisher |publisher=AleaCounterpoint |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These harmonic and temporal techniques became part of every subsequent work, and integral to his style.

In a departure from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym ''Derwid''. Mostly [[waltz]]es, [[Tango music|tangos]], [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrots]] and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish ''actors' songs''. Their place in Lutosławski's output may be seen as less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and in the light of his relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer [[Kalina Jędrusik]] (who was his wife's sister-in-law).

In 1963, Lutosławski fulfilled a commission for the [[Music Biennale Zagreb]], his ''Trois poèmes d'Henri Michaux'' for chorus and orchestra. It was the first work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutosławski was not cynical about the award this time), and Lutosławski gained an agreement for the international publication of his music with [[Chester Music]], then part of the Hansen publishing house. His [[String Quartet (Lutosławski)|String Quartet]] was first performed in [[Stockholm]] in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral [[song cycle|song-cycle]] ''Paroles tissées''. This shortened title was suggested by the poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-François Chabrun|fr|vertical-align=sup}}, who had published the poems as ''Quatre tapisseries pour la Châtelaine de Vergi''. The song cycle is dedicated to the tenor [[Peter Pears]], who first performed it at the 1965 [[Aldeburgh Festival]] with the composer conducting. The Aldeburgh Festival was founded and organised by [[Benjamin Britten]], with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.

Shortly after this, Lutosławski started work on his [[Symphony No. 2 (Lutosławski)|Second Symphony]], which had two premieres: [[Pierre Boulez]] conducted the second movement, ''Direct'', in 1966, and when the first movement, ''Hésitant'', was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in [[Katowice]]. The ''Second Symphony'' is very different from a conventional classical [[symphony]] in structure, but Lutosławski used all of his technical innovations up to that point to build a large-scale, dramatic work worthy of the name. In 1968, the work earned Lutosławski first prize from the [[International Music Council]]'s [[International Rostrum of Composers]], his third such award, which confirmed his growing international reputation. In 1967 Lutosławski was awarded the [[Léonie Sonning Music Prize]], Denmark's highest musical honour.&lt;ref name="Stucky 1981 p. 89"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stucky |first=S. |title=Lutoslawski and His Music |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-521-22799-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kts8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |access-date=April 29, 2018 |page=89 |quote=In 1967 he received the Gottfried von Herder Prize from the University of Vienna, and in August of that year he was given the Leonie Sonning Prize in Copenhagen 'in recognition and admiration of his mastery as a composer, which is a source of inspiration to the musical life of our age'. The award was presented at an all- Lutoslawski concert as part of the Royal Danish Festival of Music and Ballet celebrating the 800th anniversary of Copenhagen's founding.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International renown ===

The ''Second Symphony'', and ''Livre pour orchestre'' and the ''[[Cello Concerto (Lutosławski)|Cello Concerto]]'' which followed, were composed during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His mother died in 1967, and in 1967–70 there was a great deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'', which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in [[Czechoslovakia]]'s [[Prague Spring]], and the [[Gdańsk Shipyard]]s strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the ''Cello Concerto'' of 1968–70 for [[Rostropovich]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the ''Cello Concerto'' was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]], [[Arthur Bliss]] presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.

In 1973, Lutosławski attended a recital given by the baritone [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]] with the pianist [[Sviatoslav Richter]] in Warsaw; he met the singer after the concert and this inspired him to write his extended orchestral song ''Les espaces du sommeil'' ("The spaces of sleep"). This work, ''Preludes and Fugue'', ''Mi-Parti'' (a French expression that roughly translates as "divided into two equal but different parts"), ''Novelette'', and a short piece for cello in honour of [[Paul Sacher]]'s seventieth birthday, occupied Lutosławski throughout the 1970s, while in the background he was working away at a projected third symphony and a ''concertante'' piece for the [[oboe|oboist]] [[Heinz Holliger]]. These latter pieces were proving difficult to complete as Lutosławski struggled to introduce greater fluency into his sound world and to reconcile tensions between the harmonic and melodic aspects of his style, and between foreground and background. The [[Double Concerto (Lutosławski)|Double Concerto for oboe, harp and chamber orchestra]]—commissioned by Paul Sacher—was finally finished in 1980, and the [[Symphony No. 3 (Lutosławski)|Third Symphony]] in 1983. In 1977 he received the [[Order of the Builders of People's Poland]]. In 1983 he received the [[Ernst von Siemens Music Prize]].

During this period, Poland was undergoing yet more upheaval: in 1980, the influential movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarność]] was created, led by [[Lech Wałęsa]]; and in 1981, [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] was declared by General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]]. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland as a gesture of solidarity with the artists' [[boycott]]. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, as a gesture of support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the ''Third Symphony'' to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, he was awarded the Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.

He also bought a house in [[Oslo]] and had a cabin in the Norwegian countryside. He and his wife would stay here several times a year to be near her son from an earlier marriage, who was a Norwegian citizen.

=== Final years ===
[[File:lutoslawski.jpg|thumb|right|Witold Lutosławski in 1993]]
Through the mid-1980s, Lutosławski composed three pieces called ''Łańcuch'' ("Chain"), which refers to the way the music is constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain. ''Chain 2'' was written for [[Anne-Sophie Mutter]] (commissioned by Paul Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier ''Partita'' for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude, so that when played together the Partita, Interlude and ''Chain 2'' form his longest work.

The Third Symphony earned Lutosławski the first [[Grawemeyer Award (Music Composition)|Grawemeyer Prize]] from the [[University of Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], awarded in 1985.&lt;ref name=grawemeyer.org&gt;{{cite web |title=1985- Witold Lutoslawski |url=http://grawemeyer.org/music/previous-winners/1985-witold-lutoslawski.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724194941/http://grawemeyer.org/music/previous-winners/1985-witold-lutoslawski.html |archivedate=24 July 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of the prize lay not just in its prestige—other eminent nominations have included [[Elliott Carter]] and [[Michael Tippett]]—but in the size of its financial award (then US$150,000). The intention of the award is to remove recipients' financial concerns for a period to allow them to concentrate on serious composition. In a gesture of [[altruism]], Lutosławski announced that he would use the fund to set up a scholarship to enable young Polish composers to study abroad; Lutosławski also directed that his fee from the [[San Francisco Symphony Orchestra]] for ''Chain 3'' should go to this scholarship fund.

In 1987 Lutosławski was presented (by [[Michael Tippett]]) with the rarely awarded [[Royal Philharmonic Society#The Gold Medal|Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal]] during a concert in which Lutosławski conducted his Third Symphony; also that year a major celebration of his work was made at the [[Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival]]. In addition, he was awarded [[honorary doctorate]]s at several universities worldwide, including [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodman Rae (1999), p. 225, see also p. 271n&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutosławski was at this time writing his [[Piano Concerto (Lutosławski)|Piano Concerto]] for [[Krystian Zimerman]], commissioned by the [[Salzburg Festival]]. His earliest plans to write a piano concerto dated from 1938; he was himself in his younger days a [[virtuoso]] pianist. It was a performance of this work and the Third Symphony at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1988 that marked the composer's return to the conductor's podium in Poland, after substantive talks had been arranged between the government and the opposition.

Lutosławski also, around 1990, worked on a fourth symphony and his orchestral song-cycle ''[[Chantefleurs et Chantefables]]'' for [[soprano]]. The latter was first performed at a [[The Proms|Prom]] concert in London in 1991, and the Fourth Symphony in 1993 with the composer conducting the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]]. In between, and after initial reluctance, Lutosławski took on the presidency of the newly reconstituted "[[Polish Cultural Council]]". This had been set up after the reforms in 1989 in Poland brought about by the almost total support for Solidarity in [[Polish legislative election, 1989|the elections of that year]], and the subsequent end of communist rule and the reinstatement of Poland as an independent republic rather than the [[communist state]] of the [[People's Republic of Poland]].

[[File:Witold Lutoslawski monument.JPG|thumb|upright|The monument to Witold Lutosławski and his wife Maria Danuta in [[Powązki Cemetery]]]]
He continued his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, but by the first week of 1994 it was clear that cancer had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February at the age of eighty-one. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been [[Pope John Paul II]]). He was cremated; his wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.

Lutosławski described musical composition as a search for listeners who think and feel the same way he did—he once called it "fishing for souls".&lt;ref&gt;Lutosławski's notebook, in Varga (1976), also quoted and discussed in Jacobson, 1996 p. 100. "[...] I have a strong desire to communicate something, through my music, to the people. I am not working to get many 'fans' for myself; I do not want to convince, I want to find. I would like to find people who in the depths of their souls feel the same way as I do. That can only be achieved through the greatest artistic sincerity in every detail of music, from the minutest technical aspects to the most secret depths. I know that this standpoint deprives me of many potential listeners, but those who remain mean an immeasurable treasure for me. [...] I regard creative activity as a kind of soul-fishing, and the 'catch' is the best medicine for loneliness, that most human of sufferings."&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete list of Lutosławski's compositions in chronological order can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124732/http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/VEPM/lutos/lu-wrk-f.html ''The Polish Music Center''].

=== Folk influence ===
Lutosławski's works up until and including the ''Dance Preludes'' clearly show the influence of Polish [[folk music]], both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting it exactly. In some cases, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis, for example, in the [[Concerto for Orchestra (Lutosławski)|Concerto for Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 49: "Folk tunes are never simply quoted: they are radically transformed, manipulated, made to serve the composer's artistic vision. This approach makes possible a style which is at once so demonstrably 'national' as to be politically unassailable, yet modern enough and personal enough to burst the bounds of ''socrealizm''"; and p. 53: "''Przedzierzgnę się siwą golębicą'' is distorted beyond audible recognition ... it is thoroughly dismembered."&lt;/ref&gt; As Lutosławski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, "[in those days] I could not compose as I wished, so I composed as I was able",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stucky (1981), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; and about this change of direction he said, "I was simply not so interested in it [using folk music]". Also, Lutosławski was dissatisfied with composing in a "post-tonal" idiom: while composing the first symphony, he felt that this was for him a ''cul-de-sac''.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pitch organisation ===
In ''Five Songs'' (1956–57) and ''[[Musique funèbre]]'' (1958) Lutosławski introduced his own brand of [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone music]], marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in ''Musique funèbre'', [[augmented fourth]]s and [[semitone]]s). This system also gave him the means to write dense [[Chord (music)|chords]] without resorting to [[tone cluster]]s, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 120 quotes Lutosławski, "The different parts can play very complicated rhythms [...] and yet play only the notes of that [twelve-note] chord [...] It may occur that the chord never actually sounds in its entirety—it is supplemented by our memory and imagination."&lt;/ref&gt; Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[tone-row]] system,&lt;ref&gt;Bodman Rae (1999), p. 63. See also: C. Bodman Rae: ''Pitch Organisation in the Music of Witold Lutoslawski Since 1979'' (PhD thesis, University of Leeds, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; although ''Musique funèbre''' does happen to be based on a tone row.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and ''Paganini Variations''.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 71, also discussion of Symphony No. 1 pp. 24–25 and symmetrical chords in the pitch organisation of ''Overture for Strings'' pp. 37–39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aleatory technique ===
Although ''Musique funèbre'' was internationally acclaimed, his new harmonic techniques led to something of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 79: "Solutions to some rhythmic and formal questions still eluded him."&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 16 March 1960,&lt;ref&gt;''Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw'': Zwycięzców 39. NIFC 2013&lt;/ref&gt; listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear [[John Cage]]'s ''Concert&lt;!--NB: this is not a typo for "Concerto". Cage's title is "Concert".--&gt; for Piano and Orchestra''. Although he was not influenced by the sound or the philosophy of the music, Cage's explorations of [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]] set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching.&lt;ref&gt;Lutosławski 1976, p. 12, says, with reference to this event, "Composers often do not hear the music that is being played; it only serves as an impulse for something quite different—for the creation of music that only lives in their imagination"; see also Nordwall (1968), p. 20; Stucky (1981), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Three Postludes'' were hastily rounded off&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), pp. 78–83, Bodman Rae (1999), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.

In works from ''[[Jeux vénitiens]]'', Lutosławski wrote long passages in which the parts of the ensemble are not to be [[synchronization|synchronised]] exactly. At cues from the conductor, each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way, the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term ''aleatory'' are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski [[Musical notation|notated]] the music exactly; there is no [[improvisation]], no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 110 quotes Lutosławski: "I do not presuppose any improvised parts, even the shortest, in my works. I am an adherent of a clear-cut division between the role of the composer and that of the performer, and I do not wish even partially to relinquish the authorship of the music I have written."&lt;/ref&gt;

For his [[String Quartet (Lutosławski)|String Quartet]], Lutosławski had produced only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind them in a full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, as is the case with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance.&lt;ref&gt;Bodman Rae (1999), pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called ''mobiles''), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile.&lt;ref name="Stucky87"&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.

Lutosławski's called this technique of his mature period "limited aleatorism".&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), 109&lt;/ref&gt; This controlled freedom given to the individual musicians is contrasted with passages where the orchestra is asked to synchronise their parts; the score for these passages is notated conventionally using [[bar (music)|bars (measures)]] and [[time signature]]s.

{{Wide image|Lutosławski Symphony No. 2 nos. 7-9.gif|700px|'''Example 1''', numbers 7 to 9 from the score of the ''Second Symphony'' (1966–67), illustrates Lutosławski's harmonic and aleatory procedures from his mature style}}

Both Lutosławski's harmonic and aleatory processes are illustrated by ''example 1'', an excerpt from ''Hésitant'', the first movement of the Symphony No. 2. At number 7, the conductor gives a cue to the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who then play their parts in their own time, without any attempt to synchronise with the other instrumentalists. The harmony of this section is based on a 12-note chord built from [[major second]]s and [[perfect fourth]]s. After all the instrumentalists have finished their parts, a two-second general pause is indicated. The conductor then gives a cue at number 8 (and indicates the tempo of the following section) for two oboes and the cor anglais. They each play their part, again with no attempt to synchronise with the other players. The harmony of this part is based on the hexachord F{{music|sharp}}–G–A{{music|flat}}–C–D{{music|flat}}–D, arranged in such a way that the harmony of the section never includes any sixths or thirds. When the conductor gives another cue at number 9, the players each continue until they reach the [[repeat sign]], and then stop: they are unlikely to end the section at the same time. This "refrain" (from numbers 8 to 9) recurs throughout the movement, slightly altered each time, but always played by double-reed instruments which do not play elsewhere in the movement: Lutosławski thus also carefully controls the orchestral palette.&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in Bodman Rae (1999), pp. 103–104, and Stucky (1981), pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late style ===
The combination of Lutosławski's aleatory techniques and his harmonic discoveries allowed him to build up complex [[texture (music)|musical textures]]. According to Bodman Rae, in his later works Lutosławski evolved a more mobile, simpler, harmonic style, in which less of the music is played with an ''ad libitum'' coordination.&lt;ref&gt;The harmonic stasis inherent in Lutosławski's limited aleatorism is discussed by Bodman Rae (1999), p. 84, and his description of this development is discussed in Jacobson, 1996, pp. 112–13&lt;/ref&gt; This development first appeared in the brief ''Epitaph'' for oboe and piano,&lt;ref&gt;Bodman Rae (1999), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; around the time Lutosławski was struggling to find the technical means to complete his Third Symphony. In chamber works for just two instrumentalists the scope for aleatory counterpoint and dense harmonies is significantly less than for orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;Bodman Rae (1999), pp. 146–47&lt;/ref&gt; but these developments also influenced his orchestral style in late works including the Piano Concerto, ''Chantefleurs et Chantefables'', ''Chain 2'' and the ''Fourth Symphony'', which require mostly conventional coordination.

Lutosławski's formidable technical developments grew out of his creative imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions is a testament to his resolution of purpose in the face of the anti-[[formalism (music)|formalist]] authorities under which he formulated his methods.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky (1981), p. 106: "Lutosławski's life has given ample evidence of the strength of character and sureness of artistic purpose necessary to regard with equanimity both the blandishments of his 'fans' and the disparagements of his detractors."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodman Rae (1999), p. 262: "Above all, he is admired for the musical and moral integrity of his long search, and often difficult struggle, for the personal language and consummate technique that served his individual voice."&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutosławski's life, as well as detailed and thorough discussion of Lutosławski's music and compositional techniques, can be found in both Stucky (1981) and Bodman Rae (1994, 1996, 1999), but also in ''Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw'' (2013) by the National Institute of Fryderyk Chopin.
