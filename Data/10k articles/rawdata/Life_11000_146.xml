'''Alex John Banal''' (born December 28, 1988), more commonly known as '''A. J. “Bazooka” Banal''', is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]]. Banal resides in Ermita, [[Cebu City]], [[Cebu]], where he trains in the city's famed ALA Boxing Gym.

==Early life==
Banal's interest in boxing began through the inspiration of his uncle, Roselito Campaña, who was also a boxer for the ALA Boxing Gym. At the age of three, Banal joined the ALA team as an amateur, and has been with the organization ever since.

==Professional career==

===Super Flyweight===
Banal, aspiring to succeed in the sport, turned pro during the year of 2005. His first opponent being unheralded Sonny Saguing. The bout ended with a technical draw, with Banal suffering a big cut on his eyebrow due to an unintentional headbutt. Banal was very disappointed in the outcome of the fight, and aspired to keep his then undefeated record intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Banal underwent a huge change in competition in only his second year as a pro. He faced tougher opposition, compared to the fighters he previously faced at the time, fighting prospects, who like him, were undefeated. Banal had a record of 7-0-1 when he faced undefeated Indonesian prospect Ali Rochmad (13-0), whom Banal easily defeated with a 5th-round knockout (KO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, he faced undefeated Thai prospect Janesuk King Sports (11-0), who retired from the bout after the sixth round. And just a month after fighting the then undefeated Thai, Banal fought and defeated highly rated Indonesian contender, Angky Angkota, who sported a record of 17-3 before he lost to Banal by unanimous decision (UD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Super Flyweight Contention====
After winning his next five fights, including his U.S. debut, Banal then had a chance to collect his first regional belt, facing Esau Gaona of [[Mexico]]. Banal easily defeated the Mexican, winning the bout with a first-round KO with a powerful straight to the jaw, winning the then vacant [[WBO]] Asia Pacific Youth [[super flyweight]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then defended his title for the first and last time against [[Mexican people|Mexican]] Jovanny Soto, whom he defeated with a ninth-round technical knockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the Soto bout, Banal had an opportunity to fight for the mandatory contender spot in an [[IBF]] super flyweight title eliminator. On April 6, 2008, in [[Quezon City]], Philippines, Banal fought the then undefeated Caril Herrera of [[Uruguay]] (21-0) for this challenge. Banal, not to disappoint, defeated the then undefeated fighter with a fourth-round TKO, earning a shot at the IBF super flyweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First career loss====
Although he won a chance for the IBF title, Banal turned down the opportunity in order to fight under another sanctioning body. On July 26, 2008, in the [[Cebu Coliseum]] in Cebu City, Banal fought for the [[interim championship|interim]] [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] super flyweight title. Despite leading in all three judges' scorecards, he lost by knockout to [[Panama]]'s [[Rafael Concepción]]. Banal took a right hand to the temple region in Round 10 from Concepción, after being knocked down, he then took a knee throughout the referee's count, marking his first ever defeat in his professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bantamweight==
Following his knockout loss to Concepción, Banal moved up one weight class, to the [[bantamweight]] division. On January 31, 2009, in Banal's bantamweight debut, he faced Indonesian Nouldy Manakane, whom he defeated by knockout in just four rounds of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his two knockout wins over Manakane and Matumla, he faced rugged Mexican Jose Angel Beranza in the undercard of [[Brian Viloria]]'s first title defense of his newly won IBF [[light flyweight]] title, in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Banal was unable to knockout the always forwarding Mexican, but was able to prevail by UD, with scores of 99-92, 98-92, and 99-91, all in favor of AJ "Bazooka" Banal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On January 14, 2010, Banal defeated a former 4-time world title challenger in Cecilio Santos of [[Mexico]]. Banal, cheered by his hometown fans in Cebu, was hesitant to begin the fight. But in the following two rounds, Banal began to hit his mark. And finally, in the 4th round of the bout, Banal was able to land his dangerous left hook to the temple, followed up with his trademark aggression, eventually sending Santos to the canvas. The Mexican, with all his might just couldn't continue, and was eventually counted out in the 35-second mark of the 4th round, further pushing Banal to hopefully another world title fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Banal fought Japan's Big Yoo (16-2; 11 KO) on July 17, 2010 at the Carlos P. Garcia Stadium, [[Tagbilaran City]], [[Bohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=29232 | title =AJ Banal-Big Yoo Clash is Exticing Fight Fans in Bohol | last =Nathanielsz | first =Ronnie | work = | publisher =BoxingScene.com | date =July 14, 2010 | accessdate =July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Filipino fighter won the bout by KO in the 5th round.

'''Automated machine learning''' ('''AutoML''') is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying [[machine learning]] to real-world problems. In a typical machine learning application, practitioners must apply the appropriate [[data pre-processing]], [[feature engineering]], [[feature extraction]], and [[feature selection]] methods that make the dataset amenable for machine learning. Following those preprocessing steps, practitioners must then perform [[algorithm selection]] and [[hyperparameter optimization]] to maximize the predictive performance of their final machine learning model. As many of these steps are often beyond the abilities of non-experts, AutoML was proposed as an [[artificial intelligence]]-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning.&lt;ref name="autoweka1"&gt;{{cite conference | vauthors = Thornton C, Hutter F, Hoos HH, Leyton-Brown K | year = 2013 | title = Auto-WEKA: Combined Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization of Classification Algorithms | url = https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2487629 | conference = KDD '13 Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  | pages = 847–855  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoML2014ICML"/&gt; Automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform models that were designed by hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8242">'''Baroreceptors''' (or archaically, '''pressoreceptors''') are sensors located in the blood vessels of all vertebrate animals. They sense the [[blood pressure]] and relay the information to the brain, so that a proper blood pressure can be maintained.

Baroreceptors are a type of [[mechanoreceptor]] sensory neuron that are excited by a stretch of the blood vessel. Thus, increases in the pressure of blood vessel triggers increased [[action potential]] generation rates and provides information to the [[central nervous system]].  This sensory information is used primarily in [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic reflexes]] that in turn influence the heart [[cardiac output]] and vascular smooth muscle to influence [[total peripheral resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heesch|first=C. M.|date=December 1999|title=Reflexes that control cardiovascular function|journal=The American Journal of Physiology|volume=277|issue=6 Pt 2|pages=S234–243|issn=0002-9513|pmid=10644250|doi=10.1152/advances.1999.277.6.S234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baroreceptors act immediately as part of a [[negative feedback]] system called the [[baroreflex]],&lt;ref&gt;Stanfield, CL; Germann, WJ. (2008) Principles of Human Physiology, Pearson Benjamin Cummings. 3rd edition, pp.427.&lt;/ref&gt; as soon as there is a change from the usual [[Mean arterial pressure|mean arterial blood pressure]], returning the pressure toward a normal level.  These reflexes help regulate short-term blood pressure. The [[solitary nucleus]] in the [[medulla oblongata]] of the brain recognizes changes in the firing rate of action potentials from the baroreceptors, and influences cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.

Baroreceptors can be divided into two categories based on the type of blood vessel in which they are located: high-pressure arterial baroreceptors and low-pressure baroreceptors (also known as cardiopulmonary&lt;ref&gt;Levy, MN; Pappano, AJ. (2007) Cardiovascular Physiology, Mosby Elsevier. 9th edition, pp.172.&lt;/ref&gt; or volume receptors&lt;ref name="Stanfield, CL 2008 pp.430-431"&gt;Stanfield, CL; Germann, WJ. (2008) Principles of Human Physiology, Pearson Benjamin Cummings. 3rd edition, pp.430-431.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Arterial baroreceptors==

Arterial baroreceptors are stretch receptors that are stimulated by distortion of the arterial wall when pressure changes. The baroreceptors can identify the changes in both the average blood pressure or the rate of change in pressure with each arterial pulse. Action potentials triggered in the baroreceptor ending are then directly conducted to the brainstem where central terminations (synapses) transmit this information to neurons within the [[solitary nucleus]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965761862|title=Physiology|last=1947-|first=Costanzo, Linda S.,|others=Preceded by: Costanzo, Linda S., 1947-|isbn=9780323511896|edition= Sixth|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=965761862}}&lt;/ref&gt; which lies in the medulla. Reflex responses from such baroreceptor activity can trigger increases or decreases in the heart rate. Arterial baroreceptor sensory endings are simple, splayed nerve endings that lie in the [[tunica adventitia]] of the artery. An increase in the mean arterial pressure increases [[depolarization]] of these sensory endings, which results in [[action potentials]]. These action potentials are conducted to the solitary nucleus in the central nervous system by [[axons]] and have a reflex effect on the cardiovascular system through [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] neurons.&lt;ref&gt;Stanfield, CL; Germann, WJ. (2008) Principles of Human Physiology, Pearson Benjamin Cummings. 3rd edition, pp.424-425.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hormone]] secretions that target the heart and blood vessels are affected by the stimulation of baroreceptors.

At normal resting blood pressures, baroreceptors discharge with each heart beat. If blood pressure falls, such as on orthostatic hypotension or in [[hypovolaemic shock]], baroreceptor firing rate decreases and baroreceptor reflexes act to help restore blood pressure by increasing heart rate. Signals from the carotid baroreceptors are sent via the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] ([[glossopharyngeal nerve|cranial nerve]] IX). Signals from the aortic baroreceptors travel through the [[vagus nerve]] ([[vagus nerve|cranial nerve X]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bray, JJ; Cragg, PA; Macknight, ADC; Mills, RG. (1999) Lecture Notes on Human Physiology, Blackwell Publishing. 4th edition, pp.379.&lt;/ref&gt; Carotid sinus baroreceptors are responsive to both increases or decreases in arterial pressure, while aortic arch baroreceptors are only responsive to increases in arterial pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Arterial baroreceptors inform reflexes about arterial blood pressure but other stretch receptors in the large veins and right atrium convey information about the low pressure parts of the circulatory system.

Baroreceptors respond very quickly to maintain a stable blood pressure, but their responses diminish with time and thus are most effective for conveying short term changes in blood pressure. In people with [[essential hypertension]] the baroreceptors and their reflexes change and function to maintain the elevated blood pressure as if normal. The receptors then become less sensitive to change.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, MN; Pappano, AJ. (2007) Cardiovascular Physiology, Mosby Elsevier. 9th edition, pp.171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical stimulation of baroreceptors has been found to activate the [[baroreflex]], reducing sympathetic tone throughout the body and thereby reducing blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallbach|first1=M|last2=Koziolek|first2=MJ|title=Baroreceptors in the carotid and hypertension-systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of baroreflex activation therapy on blood pressure.|journal=Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association|date=9 November 2017|doi=10.1093/ndt/gfx279|pmid=29136223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-pressure baroreceptors==

The low-pressure baroreceptors, are found in large systemic [[vein]]s, in pulmonary vessels, and in the walls of the right atrium and ventricles of the [[heart]] (the [[atrial volume receptors]]).&lt;ref name="Stanfield, CL 2008 pp.430-431" /&gt; The low-pressure baroreceptors are involved with the regulation of blood volume.  The blood volume determines the mean pressure throughout the system, in particular in the venous side where most of the blood is held.

The low-pressure baroreceptors have both circulatory and renal effects; they produce changes in [[hormone]] secretion, resulting in profound effects on the retention of [[osmoregulation|salt and water]]; they also influence intake of salt and water.  The renal effects allow the receptors to change the mean pressure in the system in the long term.

Denervating these receptors 'fools' the body into thinking that it has  too low blood volume and initiates mechanisms that retain fluid and so push up the blood pressure to a higher level than it would otherwise have.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Baroreceptor dysfunction==
Baroreceptors are integral to the body's function: Pressure changes in the blood vessels would not be detected as quickly in the absence of baroreceptors. When baroreceptors are not working, blood pressure continues to increase, but, within an hour, the blood pressure returns to normal as other blood pressure regulatory systems take over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guyton|first=Arthur C.|date=1991|title=Blood Pressure Control-Special Role of the Kidneys and Body Fluids|journal=Science|volume=252|issue=5014|pages=1813–1816|doi=10.1126/science.2063193|jstor=2875873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroreceptors can also become oversensitive in some people (usually the carotid baroreceptors in older males). This can lead to bradycardia, dizziness and [[syncope (medicine)|fainting (syncope)]] from touching the neck (often whilst shaving).  This is an important cause to exclude in men having pre-syncope or syncope symptoms.

The '''Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy''' (sometimes called the '''Kentucky Tragedy''') was the murder of [[Kentucky]] legislator [[Solomon P. Sharp]] by [[Jereboam O. Beauchamp]] (bee-chum). As a young lawyer, Beauchamp had been an admirer of Sharp until Sharp allegedly fathered an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate child]] with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter.{{ref|cooke|[a]}} Sharp denied paternity of the [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] child. Later, Beauchamp began a relationship with Cooke, who agreed to marry him on the condition that he kill Sharp to avenge her honor. Beauchamp and Cooke married in June 1824, and in the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp murdered Sharp at Sharp's home in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]].

An investigation soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, and he was apprehended at his home in [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]], four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double [[suicide]] by drinking [[laudanum]] shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.

While Beauchamp's primary motive in killing Sharp was to defend the honor of his wife, speculation raged that Sharp's political opponents had instigated the crime. Sharp was a leader of the New Court party during the [[Old Court – New Court controversy]] in Kentucky. At least one Old Court partisan alleged that Sharp denied paternity of Cooke's son by claiming the child was a [[mulatto]], the son of a family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been verified. New Court partisans insisted that the allegation was concocted to stir Beauchamp's anger and provoke him to murder. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy served as the inspiration for numerous literary works, most notably [[Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allan Poe's]] unfinished ''[[Politian (play)|Politian]]'' and [[Robert Penn Warren]]'s ''World Enough and Time'' (1950).

==Background==
Jereboam Beauchamp was born in [[Barren County, Kentucky]], in 1802. Educated in the school of Dr. Benjamin Thurston, he resolved to study law at age eighteen. While observing the lawyers practicing in Glasgow and [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]], Beauchamp was particularly impressed with the abilities of Solomon P. Sharp. Sharp had twice been elected to the [[Kentucky General Assembly|state legislature]] and had served two terms in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. Beauchamp became disenchanted with Sharp when, in 1820, a planter's daughter named Anna Cooke claimed Sharp was the father of her child, who was stillborn. Sharp denied paternity, and public opinion favored him. The disgraced Cooke became a recluse at her mother's plantation outside Bowling Green.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anna Cooke.jpg|thumb|right|Anna Cooke alleged that Solomon Sharp was the father of her illegitimate child.]]
Beauchamp's father lived a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from Cooke's estate, and the young man wanted to meet her. Beauchamp gradually gained Cooke's trust by visiting under the guise of borrowing books from her library. By summer 1821, the two became friends and began a courtship. Beauchamp was eighteen; Cooke was at least thirty-four. As the courtship progressed, Cooke told Beauchamp that, before they could be married, he would have to kill Solomon Sharp. Beauchamp agreed to her request, expressing his own desire to dispatch Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt;

The preferred method of [[honor killing]] in that day was a [[duel]]. Despite Cooke's admonition that Sharp would not accept a challenge to duel, Beauchamp traveled to Frankfort to gain an audience with him. He had recently been named the [[Attorney General of Kentucky|state's attorney general]] by [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] [[John Adair]]. Beauchamp's account of the interview states that he bullied and humiliated Sharp, that Sharp begged for his life, and that Beauchamp promised to horsewhip Sharp every day until he consented to the duel. For two days, Beauchamp remained in Frankfort, awaiting the duel. He discovered that Sharp had left town, allegedly destined for Bowling Green. Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green, only to find that Sharp was not there and was not expected. Sharp was saved from Beauchamp's first attempt on his life.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, pp.128–129&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooke resolved to kill Sharp herself. The next time Sharp was in Bowling Green on business, she sent a letter to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and claimed she had broken off all contact with him. She asked Sharp to visit her at her plantation before he left town. Sharp questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would eventually have to return to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for Sharp to return. He never did.&lt;ref name=cooke129&gt;Cooke, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Beauchamp had not completed the task she set him, Cooke married the younger man in mid-June 1824.&lt;ref name=whited404&gt;Whited, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Beauchamp immediately hatched another plot to kill Sharp. He began sending letters &amp;ndash; each from a different post office and signed with a [[pseudonym]] &amp;ndash; requesting Sharp's assistance in settling a land claim and asking when he would again be in [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]] country. Sharp finally answered Beauchamp's last letter &amp;ndash; mailed in June 1825 &amp;ndash; but gave no date for his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, pp. 129–130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
[[Image:Solomon P Sharp.jpg|thumb|right|Solomon P. Sharp, the victim of the Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy]]
Serving as attorney general in [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] Adair's administration, Sharp had become involved in the Old Court – New Court controversy. The conflict was primarily between debtors who sought relief from their financial burdens after the [[Panic of 1819]] (the New Court, or Relief, faction) and the creditors to whom these obligations were owed (the Old Court, or Anti-Relief, faction). Sharp, who came from humble beginnings, sided with the New Court. By 1825, the New Court faction's power was on the decline. In an attempt to bolster the party's influence, Sharp resigned as attorney general in 1825 to run for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. His opponent was Old Court stalwart [[John J. Crittenden]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, pp. 130–131, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, Old Court supporters again raised the issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but said that Sharp had denied paternity of the child on the grounds that it was a [[mulatto]] and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.&lt;ref name=whited404 /&gt;

Word of Sharp's alleged claims soon reached Jereboam Beauchamp, reviving his resolve to kill him. Beauchamp abandoned the idea of killing Sharp honorably in a duel. Instead, he decided to murder him and cast suspicion on his political enemies. To add to the intrigue, Beauchamp plotted to commit the murder on the eve of the General Assembly's opening session.&lt;ref name=cooke136&gt;Cooke, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, reaching it on November 6.&lt;ref name=kleber63 /&gt; Unable to find lodging at the local inns, he rented a room in the private residence of Joel Scott, [[Corrections officer|warden]] of the state [[Prison|penitentiary]].&lt;ref name=omalley43&gt;O'Malley, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied.&lt;ref name=omalley44&gt;O'Malley, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the [[Kentucky River]], then proceeded to Sharp's house.&lt;ref name=cooke136 /&gt; Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel.&lt;ref name=cooke137&gt;Cooke, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.&lt;ref name=cooke137 /&gt;

Beauchamp approached the house at approximately two o'clock in the morning on November 7, 1825.&lt;ref name=kleber63&gt;Kleber, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Confession'', he described the encounter:

{{blockquote|I put on my mask, drew my dagger and proceeded to the door; I knocked three times loud and quick, Colonel Sharp said; "Who's there" - "Covington" I replied, quickly Sharp's foot was heard upon the floor. I saw under the door as he approached without a light. I drew my mask over my face and immediately Colonel Sharp opened the door. I advanced into the room and with my left hand I grasped his right wrist. The violence of the grasp made him spring back and trying to disengage his wrist, he said, "What Covington is this."  I replied John A. Covington.  "I don't know you," said Colonel Sharp, "I know John W. Covington."  Mrs. Sharp appeared at the partition door and then disappeared, seeing her disappear I said in a persuasive tone of voice, "Come to the light Colonel and you will know me," and pulling him by the arm he came readily to the door and still holding his wrist with my left hand I stripped my hat and handkerchief from over my forehead and looked into Sharp's face. He knew me the more readily I imagine, by my long, bush, curly suit of hair. He sprang back and exclaimed in a tone of horror and despair, "Great God it is him," and as he said that he fell on his knees. I let go of his wrist and grasped him by the throat dashing him against the facing of the door and muttered in his face, "die you villain." As I said that I plunged the dagger to his heart.|Jereboam Beauchamp|''Confession of Jereboam O. Beauchamp''}}

The wound severed Sharp's [[aorta]], killing him almost instantly.&lt;ref name=kleber63 /&gt; Sharp's wife Eliza witnessed the entire scene from the top of the stairs in the house, but Beauchamp fled before he could be identified or captured.&lt;ref name=kleber63 /&gt;&lt;ref name=omalley44 /&gt; Returning to the site where he had buried a change of clothes, he stripped off his disguise, tied it up with a rock, and sank them in the Kentucky River.&lt;ref name=cooke138&gt;Cooke, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In his regular clothes, he returned to his room at Scott's house, where he remained until the following morning.&lt;ref name=cooke138 /&gt;

==Arrest==
After learning of the murder, the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] authorized the [[Governor of Kentucky|governor]] to offer a reward of $3,000 for the arrest and conviction of Sharp's killer.&lt;ref name=ljohnson46&gt;L. Johnson, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of the city of [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] added a reward of $1,000, and friends of Sharp raised an additional $2,000 reward.&lt;ref name=omalley44 /&gt; Suspicion for the killing rested on three men: Beauchamp, Waring, and Patrick H. Darby. During Sharp's 1824 campaign for a seat in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]], Darby had remarked that, should Sharp be elected, "he would never take his seat and would be as good as a dead man".&lt;ref name=ljohnson46 /&gt; Waring had made similar threats, boasting that he had already stabbed six men.&lt;ref name=ljohnson45&gt;L. Johnson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] was sworn out for Waring's arrest, but officials soon learned that he was incapacitated, after being shot through both hips the day before Sharp's death. When Darby discovered that he was under suspicion, he began his own investigation into the murder. He traveled to [[Simpson County, Kentucky|Simpson County]] where he met Captain John F. Lowe, who told Darby that Beauchamp had related to him detailed plans for the assassination. He also furnished Darby with a letter that contained damaging admissions against Beauchamp.&lt;ref&gt;L. Johnson, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

The first night following the murder, Beauchamp stayed at the home of a relative in [[Bloomfield, Kentucky|Bloomfield]].&lt;ref name=omalley44 /&gt; The next day, he traveled to [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], where he spent the night.&lt;ref name=omalley44 /&gt; He lodged with his brother-in-law in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] on the night of November 9 before returning to his home in Glasgow on November 10.&lt;ref name=omalley44 /&gt; He and Anna had planned to flee to [[Missouri]], but before nightfall, a posse had arrived from Frankfort to arrest him.&lt;ref name=omalley45&gt;O'Malley, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

He was taken to Frankfort and tried before an examining court, but [[Commonwealth's Attorney]] Charles S. Bibb said that he had not yet collected enough evidence to detain him.&lt;ref name=cooke144 /&gt; Beauchamp was released, but agreed to stay in Frankfort for ten days to allow the court to finish its investigation.&lt;ref name=ljohnson46 /&gt; During this time, Beauchamp wrote letters to John J. Crittenden and [[George M. Bibb]] requesting their legal aid in the matter.&lt;ref name=cooke144&gt;Cooke, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Neither letter was answered.&lt;ref name=cooke144 /&gt; Meanwhile, Beauchamp's uncle, a state senator, gathered a defense team that included former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[John Pope (politician)|John Pope]].&lt;ref name=cooke144 /&gt;

During the investigation, unsuccessful attempts were made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

When questioned, Patrick Darby testified that in 1824, Beauchamp had solicited his services in order to bring suit against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related the story of Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he would kill him one day, even if he had to come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the [[circuit court]]'s next term, which began in March 1826.&lt;ref name=bruce16&gt;Bruce, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Beauchamp was [[indictment|indicted]], and his trial began May 8, 1826.&lt;ref name=cooke144 /&gt; Beauchamp pleaded not guilty, but never testified during the trial.&lt;ref name=cooke144 /&gt; Captain Lowe was called to repeat the story he had originally related to Patrick Darby regarding Beauchamp's threats to kill Sharp. He further testified that Beauchamp returned home following the murder waving a red flag and declaring that he had "gained the victory." He also turned over to the court a letter from the Beauchamps regarding the murder. In the letter, Beauchamp maintained his innocence, but told Lowe that his enemies were plotting against him and asked him to testify in his behalf. The letter gave Lowe several talking points to mention if called to testify, some true and some otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, pp. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jereboam O Beauchamp.jpg|thumb|left|Jereboam O. Beauchamp was convicted of Sharp's murder.]]
Eliza Sharp repeated her assertion that the murderer's voice was that of Beauchamp. Joel Scott, the warden who gave Beauchamp lodging the night of the murder, testified that he heard Beauchamp leave during the night and return later that night. He also mentioned that Beauchamp was extremely inquisitive about the crime upon being told of it the next morning. The most extensive testimony came from Darby, who recounted his 1824 meeting with Beauchamp. According to Darby, Beauchamp claimed that Sharp offered him and Anna $1,000, a slave girl, and {{convert|200|acre|km2}} of land if they would leave him alone. Sharp later reneged on the offer.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, pp. 21–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Some witnesses maintained that the killer's claim to be John A. Covington was telling. They said that both Sharp and Beauchamp had been acquainted with John W. Covington, and that Beauchamp often mistakenly called him John A. Covington. Other witnesses told of threats they had heard Beauchamp make against Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauchamp's defense team attempted to discredit Patrick Darby by stressing his association with the Old Court and suggesting the murder was politically motivated. They also presented witnesses who testified that they knew of no hostility between Beauchamp and Sharp, and questioned whether Darby and Beauchamp's 1824 meeting ever occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

During closing arguments, defense counsel John Pope attempted to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane.&lt;ref name=ljohnson48&gt;L. Johnson, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The trial lasted thirteen days, and despite the absence of any [[physical evidence]], including a murder weapon, the [[jury]] returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19.&lt;ref name=cooke144 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cooke144 /&gt;&lt;ref name=omalley47&gt;O'Malley, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by [[hanging]] on June 16, 1826.&lt;ref name=ljohnson49&gt;L. Johnson, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial, Anna Beauchamp appealed to John Waring for help on her husband's behalf. She also tried to entice John Lowe to commit [[perjury]] and testify on her husband's behalf. Both appeals were denied. On May 20, Anna was examined by two [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] on suspicion of being an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the murder, but was acquitted due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; At her request, Anna was permitted to stay in the cell with Beauchamp .&lt;ref name=kleber63 /&gt;

Pope's request to have the verdict overturned was denied, but the judge granted Beauchamp a [[stay of execution]] until July 7 to allow him to produce a written justification of his actions.&lt;ref name=cooke145&gt;Cooke, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Beauchamp said he had killed Sharp to defend Anna's honor.&lt;ref name=whited404 /&gt; Beauchamp had hoped to publish his work before his execution, but the [[libel]]ous charges it contained &amp;ndash; that prosecution witnesses committed perjury and [[bribery]] to see him convicted &amp;ndash; delayed its publication.&lt;ref name=whited404 /&gt;

==Execution==
The Beauchamps were accused of trying to bribe a guard to let them escape, but this effort failed. They also tried to get a letter to Senator Beauchamp, asking for his help in escaping. A final plea to Governor Desha for another stay of execution was denied on July 5.&lt;ref name=cooke145 /&gt; Later that day, the couple attempted a double [[suicide]] by taking large doses of [[laudanum]], but both survived.&lt;ref name=kleber63 /&gt;

[[File:Beauchamp hangs.jpg|thumb|left|Beauchamp was hanged for Sharp's murder on July 7, 1826.]]
On July 7, the morning of Beauchamp's scheduled execution, Anna requested that the guard allow her privacy while she dressed.&lt;ref name=kleber64&gt;Kleber, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Anna tried another overdose on laudanum, but was unable to keep it down.&lt;ref name=bruce8&gt;Bruce, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; She had smuggled a knife into the cell, and the couple attempted another double suicide by stabbing themselves with it.&lt;ref name=kleber64 /&gt; When they were discovered, Anna was taken to the jailer's home and tended to by doctors.&lt;ref name=kleber64 /&gt;

Weakened by his own wounds, Beauchamp was loaded on a cart to be taken to the [[gallows]] and hanged before he bled to death. He insisted on seeing his wife before being executed, but doctors told him she was not severely injured and would recover. Beauchamp protested that not being allowed to see his wife was cruel, and the guards consented to take him to her. Upon arriving, he was angered to see that the doctors had lied to him; Anna was too weak even to speak to him. He remained with her until he could no longer feel her pulse. He kissed her lifeless lips and declared "For you I lived &amp;mdash; for you I die."&lt;ref name=stclair307&gt;St. Clair, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

On his way to the gallows, Beauchamp asked to see Patrick Darby, who was among the assembled spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.&lt;ref name=ljohnson54&gt;L. Johnson, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

At the gallows, Beauchamp assured the assembled [[clergy]] that he had a [[salvation]] experience on July 6.&lt;ref name=cooke146&gt;Cooke, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Too weak to stand, he was held upright by two men while the noose was tied around his neck.&lt;ref name=kleber64 /&gt; At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played ''Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow'' while 5,000 spectators watched his execution.&lt;ref name=whited404 /&gt; It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history.&lt;ref name=omalley47 /&gt; Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial.&lt;ref name=omalley47 /&gt; The two bodies were placed in an embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested.&lt;ref name=omalley47 /&gt; They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in [[Bloomfield, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=whited404 /&gt; The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.&lt;ref name=kleber64 /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Beauchamp's confession was published in 1826, the same year as ''The Letters of Ann Cook'' &amp;ndash; the authorship of which is disputed. J. G. Dana and R. S. Thomas also published an edited transcript of Beauchamp's trial.&lt;ref name=whited404 /&gt; The following year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote ''Vindication of the character of the late Col. Solomon P. Sharp'' to defend Sharp from the charges made in Beauchamp's confession.&lt;ref name=whited404 /&gt; Patrick Darby threatened to sue Dr. Sharp if the work were published.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;Johnson, "New Light of Beauchamp's ''Confession''&lt;/ref&gt; John Waring threatened Dr. Sharp's life if he published ''Vindication''.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt; All copies of the work were left in the Sharps' home in Frankfort, where they were discovered many years later during a remodel.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt;

Though many regarded Sharp's murder as an honor killing, some New Court partisans charged that Beauchamp had been incited to violence by members of the Old Court party, specifically Patrick Darby. Sharp was thought to be the minority party's choice for Speaker of the House for the 1826 session. By enticing Beauchamp to murder Sharp, the Old Court could remove a political enemy. Sharp's widow Eliza appeared to believe this notion. In an 1826 letter in the ''New Court Argus of Western America'', she referred to Darby as "the chief instigator of the foul murder which has deprived me of all my heart held most dear on earth".&lt;ref name=bruceatq&gt;Bruce, "The Kentucky Tragedy and the Transformation of Politics in the Early American Republic"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Old Court partisans claimed that Governor Desha had offered Beauchamp a [[clemency|pardon]] if he would implicate Darby and Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, in his confession. Shortly before his execution, Beauchamp was heard to say he had "been New Court long enough, and would die an Old Court man." Beauchamp had steadfastly identified with the Old Court, and his claim seems to imply that he had at least considered colluding with the New Court powers to secure his pardon. Such a deal is explicitly mentioned in one version of Beauchamp's ''Confession''. Beauchamp ultimately rejected the deal for fear that he would be double-crossed by the New Court, leaving him imprisoned and deprived of the [[chivalry|chivalrous]] motive for his actions.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt;

Darby denied involvement with the murder, claiming that New Court partisans such as [[Francis P. Blair]] and [[Amos Kendall]] were seeking to defame him.&lt;ref name=bruceatq /&gt; He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the ''New Court Argus'' was written by New Court supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor.&lt;ref name=bruceatq /&gt; The claims and counterclaims between the two sides reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the ''New Court Argus'' suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old Court partisans and affix a stigma to them.&lt;ref name=bruceatq /&gt;

Darby eventually brought suit for libel against Kendall and Eliza Sharp, as well as Senator Beauchamp and Sharp's brother Leander.&lt;ref name=ljohnson49 /&gt; Numerous delays and [[change of venue|changes of venue]] prevented any of the suits from ever going to trial.&lt;ref name=cooke147&gt;Cooke, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Darby died in December 1829.&lt;ref name=cooke147 /&gt;

==In fiction==
The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works, notably [[Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allan Poe's]] unfinished play ''[[Politian (play)|Politian]]'' and [[Robert Penn Warren]]'s ''World Enough and Time''. [[William Gilmore Simms]] wrote three works based on the Sharp's murder and aftermath: ''Beauchampe: or The Kentucky Tragedy, A Tale of Passion'', ''Charlemont'', and ''Beauchampe: A Sequel to Charlemonte''. ''Greyslaer: A Romance of the Mohawk'' by [[Charles Fenno Hoffman]], ''Octavia Bragaldi'' by [[Charlotte Mary Sanford Barnes|Charlotte Barnes]], ''Sybil'' by John Savage, and ''Conrad and Eudora; or, The Death of Alonzo: A Tragedy'' and ''Leoni, The Orphan of Venice'' both by [[Thomas Holley Chivers]], all draw to some degree on the events that surround Sharp's murder.&lt;ref&gt;Whited, pp. 404–405&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">'''Capital punishment in the Isle of Man''' was formally abolished in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/e7722d243d1c0d89802565400061a903?Opendocument UN report Covenant on Civil and Political Rights], July 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Isle of Man]] is a [[British Crown Dependency]], but not part of the [[United Kingdom]] (which had effectively abolished capital punishment in 1965).

The last person to be actually hanged on the Isle of Man was [[John Kewish]], at [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]] in 1872. No execution had taken place on the island during the three decades before that. [[Capital punishment]] was not abolished by [[Tynwald]] (the island's parliament) until 1993. Many people were sentenced to death (for murder and various other crimes) on the Isle of Man between 1873 and 1992.

The last person to be sentenced to death on the Isle of Man (and anywhere in the [[British Isles]]) was Anthony Robin Denys Teare, at the [[Isle of Man High Court#Court of General Gaol Delivery|Court of General Gaol Delivery]] in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], in 1992. The case was heard before the Second [[Deemster]] of the Isle of Man, [[Henry Callow]]. Deemster Callow thus became the last judge in the British Isles to pass a death sentence (but chose not to wear a [[black cap]] whilst doing so). Following sentencing, Teare engaged a new lawyer, Louise Byrne, who immediately took the case to the appeal court, where the conviction was quashed. A retrial was ordered, and a search for new evidence was made.

At the second trial Teare was represented by Peter Thornton QC, an English counsel. William Kelly, a [[prison healthcare]] officer at the [[Isle of Man Prison]], gave evidence that Teare had told him on a number of occasions of how he had murdered the victim, Corinne Bentley. It was on his evidence alone that Teare was convicted of murder for the second time and entered the history books as the last man in the British Isles to be sentenced to death and the first in the Isle of Man to be sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] (all previous life sentences had been commuted from death sentences). Corinne's brother was in court as Teare, head bowed, received a minimum of twelve years imprisonment. He was sent to [[Wakefield (HM Prison)|HMP Wakefield]] in Yorkshire.

The Institute, inaugurated in 2014 and renamed on 9 May 2015, collaborates with international institutions on fields as [[astrophysics]], [[engineering]], earth and [[Atmospheric sciences|atmospheric science]], [[geology]] and [[biology]] with the goal of taking an interdisciplinary approach to the search for [[Astrobiology|life elsewhere]] in the universe and of the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] on Earth.&lt;ref name="Calla2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |title=Introducing: The Carl Sagan Institute |last=Glaser |first=Linda |date=January 27, 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227012302/http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |archivedate=2015-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Sagan]] was a faculty member at Cornell University beginning in 1968. He was the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences and director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies there until his death in 1996.&lt;ref name="Calla2015"/&gt;

==Research==

The main goal of the Carl Sagan Institute is to model atmospheric [[spectral signature]]s including [[biosignature]]s of known and hypothetical planets and moons to explore whether they could be habitable and how they could be detected.&lt;ref name='CSI-Research'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/research/ |title=Carl Sagan Institute - Research |date=May 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research focuses on exoplanets and moons  orbiting in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] around their host stars. The atmospheric characterization of such worlds would allow to potentially detect the first habitable exoplanet.&lt;ref name='CSI-Research'/&gt; A team member has already produced a "color catalog" that could help scientists look for signs of life on exoplanets.&lt;ref name="ColorCatalog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cofield |first=Calla |url=http://www.space.com/28906-alien-life-earth-microbe-catalog.html |title=Catalog of Earth Microbes Could Help Find Alien Life |work=Space.com |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioreflectance spectra catalog===
Team scientists used 137 different microorganism species, including [[extremophile]]s that were isolated from Earth's most extreme environments, and cataloged how each life form uniquely reflects sunlight in the visible and near-infrared to the short-wavelength infrared (0.35–2.5&amp;nbsp;µm) portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Surface biosignatures of exo-Earths: Remote detection of extraterrestrial life |journal=PNAS|date=31 March 2015 |last=Hegde |first=Siddharth |last2=Paulino-Lima |first2=Ivan G. |last3=Kent |first3=Ryan |last4=Kaltenegger |first4=Lisa |last5= Rothschild |first5=Lynn |volume=112 |issue=13 |pages=3886–3891 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1421237112 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/13/3886.short |accessdate=2015-05-11 |bibcode = 2015PNAS..112.3886H |pmid=25775594 |pmc=4386386}}&lt;/ref&gt; This database of individual 'reflection fingerprints' (spectrum) might be used by astronomers as potential [[biosignature]]s to find large colonies of microscopic life on distant exoplanets.&lt;ref name="ColorCatalog"/&gt; A combination of organisms would produce a mixed spectrum, also cataloged, of light bouncing off the planet.

'''César René Cuenca''' (born January 18, 1981) is an Argentine [[professional boxer]] and a former [[List of IBF world champions#Super lightweight|IBF super lightweight champion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Cesar_Rene_Cuenca&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pro career==
On March 20, 2009&lt;ref&gt;http://boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=570818&lt;/ref&gt; Cuenca won a twelve-round Unanimous Decision against undefeated contender [[Alex de Jesús]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saddoboxing.com/9430-boxing-south-border-weekend-results-5.html#more-9430&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2014 Cesar defeated Albert Mensah to become the mandatory challenger for the IBF Junior Welterweight belt, held by American [[Lamont Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.x-boxing.com/2014/05/ibf-jr-welterweight-final-elimination-it-is-africa-vs-south-america-as-albert-mensah-is-set-to-engage-cesar-cuenca |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714225756/http://www.x-boxing.com/2014/05/ibf-jr-welterweight-final-elimination-it-is-africa-vs-south-america-as-albert-mensah-is-set-to-engage-cesar-cuenca/ |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2015 he defeated [[Ik Yang (boxer)|Ik Yang]] in [[Macau]] by unanimous decision, in a bout he dominated and dropped his opponent, despite being knocked down himself. In the process, he won the vacant [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[light welterweight]] [[world championship]], after a thirteen-year career, that spanned 49 fights prior, including two 'no contests'.&lt;ref&gt;http://philboxing.com/news/story-110502.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuenca lost his world title in his very next fight on November 4, 2015 when he faced [[Eduard Troyanovsky]] in [[Kazan]], [[Russia]]. Cuenca, who was 48-0 at the time of the fight, was unable to get in range for the majority of the boxing match. Troyanovsky had re-hydrated much more than Cuenca and he seemed bigger in the ring, he used his size advantage well. After five rounds Cuenca had won just one, in a close fight, his left eye was cut open. In the sixth round, Troyanovsky landed a hard uppercut and Cuenca grabbed him at the waist, Troyanovsky leaned on the Argentine and he tumbled down, then as Troyanovsky was moving away it is possible that his foot hit Cuenca in his right eye. Immediately afterwards the American referee asked Cuenca if he could continue fighting, to which Cuenca told him in Spanish that his right eye was injured from the tumble and he needed time to recover, but the referee (who could not understand Spanish) asked him again more sternly and Cuenca repeated himself, gesturing to his right eye. The referee then waved off the fight, to the displeasure of Cuenca and his corner.

'''''Death and the Mother''''' ([[Denmark|Danish]]: Døden og moderen) is a sculpture created by the Danish sculptor [[Niels Hansen Jacobsen]]. Inspired by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s tale ''[[The Story of a Mother]]'', it depicts a [[Grim Reaper]] figure, in a dynamic pose, carrying a [[scythe]], striding over a mother with a dead child crouching on the ground. The original plaster model is in the holdings of the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Danish National Gallery]] while two bronze castings are located outside [[St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen|St. Peter's Church]] in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Vejen Art Museum]].

==History==
Hansen Jacobsen created the original plaster model in 1892, shortly after he had settled in [[Paris]] where he lived until 1901. His newly wedded wife Gabriela served as model for the mother crouching on the ground. The literary inspiration for the work was [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s tale ''The Story of a Mother''. When the sculpture was exhibited at [[Charlottenborg Palace|Charlottenborg]] in 1894, the catalogue contained a slightly modified version of the last sentence of the tale: "And she lowered her head into her lap. And Death took her child into the Unknown Lands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vejenkunstmuseum.dk/Dansk/samlingen/nhj/skulpturer/doeden.htm |title=Døden og Moderen |language=Danish |publisher=Vejen Art Museum |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914142237/http://www.vejenkunstmuseum.dk/Dansk/samlingen/nhj/skulpturer/doeden.htm |archivedate=2011-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was first exhibited at the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris where it was well received. The next year it was exhibited at Charlottenborg and in 1899 Hansen Jacobsen gave the model to the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Danish National Gallery]].

==Casts==
[[Image:Døden og moderen.JPG|thumb|200px|The cast at St. Peter's graveyard]]
After his return to Denmark in 1901, Hansen Jacobsen received a commission from [[Carl Jacobsen]]'s [[Albertina Foundation (Denmark)|Albertina Foundation]] for a bronze cast which was installed in front of [[Church of the Holy Ghost, Copenhagen|Church of the Holy Ghost]] in Copenhagen. In 1966 it had to be moved because the ward found it "profoundly depressing" and it was instead placed outside [[St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen|St. Peter's Church]].

Another cast was later placed outside Vejen Art Museum which had been opened to house his oeuvre.

==Description==
The portrayal of Death as the [[Grim Reaper]] was frequently seen in other artworks of the time, such as in paintings by [[Jean-François Millet]] and the Danish painter [[L. A. Ring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Emilie Anine Skovgaard Meng''' (31 July 1998 – {{circa|10 July 2016}}), a 17-year-old Danish girl, disappeared in [[Korsør]] in the early hours of 10 July 2016. Five months later, her body was found in [[Køge Municipality]]. The case received major media attention and an investigation of both police and civilians.

== Disappearance ==
Meng was last seen leaving [[Korsør]] train station after a night out in [[Slagelse]] with her friends at 4 a.m. on 10 July 2016. Many volunteers helped the police to look for Meng. Several tips led to three suspects, including a 33-year-old truck driver and a 67-year-old, who got his house searched five times, but they had nothing to do with the case. After four months the police had worked with three theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagens.dk/112/emilie-har-vaeret-vaek-i-fire-maaneder-her-er-politiets-tre-teorier Emilie har været væk i fire måneder]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of body==
Meng's body was found in a lake at Regnemarks Bakke near [[Borup, Køge Municipality|Borup]] on 24 December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sn.dk/Koege/Emilie-Meng-sagen-Kvinde-saa-mand-loefte-paa-tung-genstand/artikel/688511|title=Emilie Meng-sagen: Kvinde så mand løfte på 'tung genstand'|last=|first=|date=4 October 2017|work=sn.dk|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, a memorial ceremony was held at Korsør Station, where several hundred people were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.b.dk/nationalt/flere-hundrede-holdt-mindeceremoni-for-emilie-meng|title=Flere hundrede holdt mindeceremoni for Emilie Meng|last=|first=|date=26 December 2018|work=www.b.dk|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
On July 11, 2011, Zahau and Max Shacknai were at the Spreckels Beach House along with Zahau's teenage sister Xena when Shacknai’s son Max fell over a second-floor banister. Investigators speculate he may have tripped over a ball or the dog. He fell face-first, suffering [[spinal cord injury|injuries to his spinal cord]] and [[Facial skeleton|facial bones]], the former of which affected his [[heart rate]] and breathing. Zahau said she was in the bathroom at the time; she found Max moments later, and her younger sister called 911.&lt;ref name="SUT20110902"/&gt;  Max was not breathing and unresponsive, and was taken to [[Rady Children's Hospital]].&lt;ref name="SUT20110902"/&gt; Max died on July 16 due to [[brain damage]] caused by [[Cerebral hypoxia|oxygen deprivation]] resulting from his injuries.&lt;ref name="SUT20110902"/&gt;

On July 12, the day before her death, Zahau went to the airport to drop off her 13-year-old sister for her flight back to Missouri, and then picked up her boyfriend's brother, Adam Shacknai, who had just arrived on a flight from Memphis.&lt;ref name="KFMB20110916"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.760kfmb.com/story/15485069/records-reveal-final-cell-phone-calls-to-rebecca-zahau|work=KFMB 760 News|title=Records reveal final cell phone calls to Rebecca Zahau|last=Gotfredson|first=David|date=2011-09-16|accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahau and Adam Shacknai ate dinner with Jonah Shacknai and his friend Howard that evening, and then returned to the beach house.&lt;ref name="CBS20110921"/&gt; Adam Shacknai stayed at the house that night.&lt;ref name="SUT20110714"/&gt; There were reports of loud music coming from the house that evening.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/182280/20110718/jonah-shacknai-rebecca-nalepa-max-shacknai-adam-shacknai-spreckels-mansion-medecis-suicide-homicide.htm|periodical=International Business Times|title=Mysterious Deaths at Spreckels Mansion: 'Loud Party' the Day After Max Shacknai's Accident|date=2011-07-18|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews20110715"&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-07-15/news/29796660_1_mansion-autopsy-results-tim-curran|periodical=New York Daily News|last=Shahid|first=Aliya|title=Rebecca Nalepa, girlfriend of Medicis CEO Jonah Shacknai, found hanging dead in California mansion|date=2011-07-15|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah Shacknai was supposedly keeping a vigil at Max's bedside with Max's mother Dina Romano; he would leave the hospital to recuperate at a nearby [[Ronald McDonald House Charities|Ronald McDonald House]].&lt;ref name="SUT20110902"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS20110921"/&gt; Adam Shacknai stated that he found Zahau nude, hanging from a balcony, with her wrists and ankles bound, hands behind her back, at roughly 6:45 AM on the morning of July 13.&lt;ref name="SUT20110714"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; He called 911 at 6:48 AM, and then sent a text message to his brother to inform him of the news.&lt;ref name="KFMB20110916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS20110921"/&gt; He cut the body down prior to police's arrival.&lt;ref name="CBS20110921"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCNews20110907"&gt;{{citation|last=Caron|first=Christina|title=Rebecca Zahau's Death a Ritualistic Killing?|date=2011-09-07|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/rebecca-zahaus-death-ritualistic-killing-expert/story?id=14463695|periodical=ABC News|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zahau was gagged with a blue, long sleeve T-shirt wrapped around her head with the sleeves double knotted and stuffed into her mouth.

She was buried at St. Joseph's Memorial Park in St. Joseph, Missouri on July 23.&lt;ref name="CBSNews20110726"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/15145788/sister|periodical=CBS News|date=2011-07-26|accessdate=2011-09-09|title=Zahau's sister speaks out about her family's tragic loss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculations of foul play began early on in the case; however, investigators were unable to find any other DNA at the scene besides Zahau's.&lt;ref name="BNET20110920"/&gt; On September 2, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department formally announced their finding that Zahau committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/state&amp;id=8340332|periodical=ABC News|title=SD sheriff says mansion death was suicide|date=2011-09-02|accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence Considered ===
Zahau's autopsy results would reveal four instances of head trauma.&lt;ref name="IBTimes20110907" /&gt; Investigators and outside commentators expressed various theories regarding the head injuries. San Diego Medical Examiner Jonathan Lucas stated that "because there was evidence that she went over the balcony in a non-vertical position, she may have struck her head on the balcony on the way down." [[Werner Spitz]], an [[expert witness]] who testified during the [[Death of Caylee Anthony|trial of Casey Anthony]], said it was a possibility, stating, "When the body first dropped, she doesn't necessarily jump to her death, so she would drop directly downward and she could easily hit against the side of the structure from which she is hanging." However, he noted that the case was not "cut-and-dried" and that to draw stronger conclusions he would have preferred to see what the body looked like before the wrist bindings were removed. Forensic consultant and doctor of criminal psychology Maurice Godwin expressed doubt, stating, "The chances of bumping into the railing, going over the balcony and hitting your head four times is highly unlikely."&lt;ref name="ABCNews20110907" /&gt; 

A second autopsy was conducted by famed pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht at the family's request. He testified that he believed fractures in Zahau’s throat were caused by manual strangulation, not by suicidal hanging. He further stated that he thought "Rebecca Zahau’s death was a homicide.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/sd-me-zahau-pathologist-20180312-story.html|title=Well-known pathologist testifies in trial that Zahau was strangled|last=Winkley|first=Lyndsay|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other inaccuracies have been found with the Sheriff's department investigation, including evidence that may show that Rebecca was sexually assaulted before her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2017/11/28/attorney-claims-further-analysis-of-evidence-disproves-coronado-mansion-suicide/|title=Attorney claims further analysis of evidence disproves Coronado mansion suicide|date=2017-11-29|work=fox5sandiego.com|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family members expressed suspicions that Zahau's hands and feet were bound. In an interview about a week after the incident, San Diego county sheriff Roy Frank stated, "There are documentations of incidents throughout the country where people have secured their feet and hands as well to commit suicide," to prevent themselves from changing their minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mann|first=Camille|title=Police looking for answers in mysterious Calif. mansion deaths|date=2011-07-21|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20081407-504083.html|periodical=CBS News|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police re-enacted the scenario in an effort to determine whether it would have been possible for Zahau to bind herself in that fashion, and showed a video demonstration in which a woman wrapped a rope around her hands several times in front of her, slipped one hand out of the binding, then placed her hands behind her back, rebound them, and tightened the bindings with the aid of a string similar to the one which police found in Zahau's hands.&lt;ref name="SUT20110902" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gotfredson|first=David|title=Questions linger in Coronado mansion hanging death|date=2011-09-14|url=http://www.760kfmb.com/story/15466715/questions-linger-in-coronado-mansion-hanging-death|periodical=KFMB News|accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A black message had been painted on the door of the room leading to the balcony below where police found Zahau's body; according to Zahau's ex-husband Nalepa, it read "She saved him, can he save her." but officials declined to confirm this.&lt;ref name="SUT20110902" /&gt; In media comments, Sheriff Gore only stated that it was "not a clear suicide note"; however, investigators took it as further evidence of suicide. Zahau liked to paint as a hobby and had signed her paintings in the past; her siblings contended that the message did not match her handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Caron|first=Christina|title=Coronado Mansion Victim Rebecca Zahau Painted Message on Door|date=2011-09-02|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/coronado-mansion-victim-painted-message-door-died/story?id=14435011|periodical=ABC News|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nalepa also stated the note "did not appear to be something [Zahau] would have written."&lt;ref name="SUT20110902" /&gt;

As part of their investigation, police served [[Verizon]] and [[AT&amp;T]] with search warrants to obtain cell phone billing records, and took Zahau's [[Samsung Focus]] cell phone as evidence.&lt;ref name="CBS20110921"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/15505829/some-shacknai-search-warrants-to-be-unsealed|periodical=CBS News|title=Coronado mansion search warrants unsealed|date=2011-09-21|accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS20110922"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/15520745/sheriff-launches-forensic-exam-of-zahaus-cell-phone-new-witnesses-accounts-reported|periodical=CBS News|title=Sheriff launches forensic exam of Zahau’s cell phone; new witness accounts reported|first=David|last=Gotfredson|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zahau's AT&amp;T cell phone billing records, from roughly 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., Zahau talked and texted with her older sister Mary Zahau-Loehner, who confirmed that Xena had arrived home safely. At 10:48&amp;nbsp;p.m., Zahau received a text from Nina Romano, the twin sister of Shacknai's ex-wife Dina Romano. Nina Romano stated that she wanted to stop by the house and speak with Zahau about Max's accident. Zahau did not reply to that message. Police said she checked her voice-mail a few hours later, at 12:50&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 13, and listened to a message. Billing records do not show who left that message. Police stated it was a message regarding the worsening of Max's condition, but declined to confirm at that time who left the message. Mary Zahau-Loehner stated that police told her it was from Jonah Shacknai. The message was deleted, meaning that police and Zahau's family never heard the contents of the message.&lt;ref name="KFMB20110916"/&gt;

Because of [[evidence management]] concerns, San Diego County Sheriff's Department investigators initially did not attempt to power up the phone or operate it, fearing that they might overwrite evidence contained in its memory. Instead, they tried to determine whether forensic software was available which would allow them to examine that model of phone. On August 15, unable to identify any such technology, a detective turned on the phone and conducted a manual search of it, finding that the voice-mail message was not stored on the phone.&lt;ref name="KFMB20110925"/&gt; They did not request that AT&amp;T try to retrieve the deleted message from its servers.&lt;ref name="CBS20110922"/&gt; Later, on September 21, a homicide investigator with the department announced that they would be searching it again, using what they described as "new technology" to copy the phone's data for further investigation. Because Zahau's cell phone was a newer model that investigators were not familiar with, they had previously been unsure what software they could use to accomplish this task.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/sep/21/rebecca-zahaus-phone-to-be-re-examined/|periodical=San Diego Union Tribune|date=2011-09-21|accessdate=2011-09-23|title=Rebecca Zahau's phone to be re-examined}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early October, investigators completed their second examination of the cell phone. They stated that they did not uncover any additional information and would soon return the phone to Zahau's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.10news.com/news/29400834/detail.html|title=Investigators Finish 2nd Review Of Zahau Cell phone; Extended Probe Does Not Uncover New Information, Investigators Say|date=2011-10-05|accessdate=2011-10-07|work=10 News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
People close to Zahau expressed doubt that she would have committed suicide. Zahau's elder sister said in an interview that "I still believe my sister didn't take her life", and in a written statement on behalf of the family wrote that "Rebecca valued her life and lived her life to its fullest. Rebecca loved God, her family and life."&lt;ref name="SUT20110714"/&gt; Her younger sister commented more strongly by e-mail, "Becky did not commit suicide. My sister was murdered."&lt;ref name="Reuters20110909"/&gt; Her former trainer also stated that "She was always happy [and] always smiling when she came in. I didn't see a problem or anything like that."&lt;ref name="10News"/&gt; Family members disputed police characterizations of Zahau as depressed, describing her instead that as a happy person. Furthermore, they state that Zahau [[Christian views on suicide|believed as a Christian that suicide was wrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=San Diego Union-Tribune|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/sep/03/officials-sure-bizarre-case-suicide-family-unconvi/|title=Officials sure "bizarre" case a suicide; family unconvinced|date=2011-09-03|accessdate=2011-09-16|first=Peter|last=Rowe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sandiego6.com/news/local/story/Zahau-Family-Urges-Police-to-Re-Open-Case/gFKYozxkq0uA5C7k4_LDDg.cspx |periodical=San Diego 6 News |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2011-09-16 |title=Zahau Family Urges Police to Re-Open Case }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the suicide ruling, Neil Nalepa was quoted as stating, "I would not believe Rebecca would commit suicide. It’s out of character." However, Sheriff Bill Gore, who investigated the death, stated of the family's reluctance to accept the suicide ruling, "We laid out the case extensively to them in Missouri to answer their questions, and it’s unfortunate she can't accept the results."&lt;ref name="SUT20110902"/&gt; On September 7, the family launched a website [https://web.archive.org/web/20120909191342/http://www.justiceforrebecca.org/ JusticeForRebecca.org] seeking donations to fund their own investigation into Zahau's death. The site states: "It was obvious that the Sheriff’s Department had worked too hard to paint this picture of suicide and they were not about to let the Zahaus ruin it."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/sep/08/zahau-family-seeking-donations-help-pay-investigat/|periodical=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=2011-09-08|accessdate=2011-09-09|last=Baker|first=Debbi|title=Zahau family seeking donations for investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late September, they continued to demand that the case be re-opened.

On September 20, Jonah Shacknai wrote a letter to [[Attorney General of California|California Attorney General]] [[Kamala Harris]] requesting a state review of the investigation. Shacknai himself did not doubt the findings of investigations, but said he hoped a review would bring "confidence, comfort and resolution" to others close to Zahau.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/09/20/general-us-mansion-death_8689965.html|periodical=Forbes|date=2011-09-20|accessdate=2011-09-20|title=Drug tycoon seeks review of girlfriend's death}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Millionaire seeks state investigation of son's, girlfriend's deaths|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/20/justice/california-mansion-deaths/|periodical=CNN|date=2011-09-20|accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chief assistant attorney general [[Dane Gillette]] replied the following day, stating that "we must decline your invitation to review this investigation at this time"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=CNN|date=2011-09-22|accessdate=2011-09-23|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/22/justice/california-mansion-deaths/|title=California won't probe deaths of millionaire's son, girlfriend|first=Michael|last=Martinez|first2=Jason|last2=Hanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, family members appeared on [[Today (NBC program)|NBC ''Today'']] and called for a complete independent investigation by the state Attorney General's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/130854958.html|periodical=NBC San Diego|date=2011-09-30|accessdate=2011-10-02|title=Rebecca Zahau's Family Wants State to Investigate Coronado Mansion Death|first=R.|last=Stickney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawyers and public relations personnel===
Zahau's family hired Seattle attorney [[Anne Bremner]] to represent them. Bremner expressed derision at the medical examiner's conclusions, stating, "This would be the first case in the history of the world that a woman killed herself like this ... It's ridiculous on the face of it."&lt;ref name="SUT20110902"/&gt; Dan K. Webb of [[Winston &amp; Strawn]] LLP, a lawyer for Shacknai, alleges that other statements of Bremner's imply that Shacknai used his wealth and profile to improperly influence the probe into Zahau's death. He sent a [[cease and desist]] letter to Bremner warning her that certain statements of hers constituted [[defamation]], as well as being "highly insensitive on a human level" and contributing to "the harsh and unkind glare of a national media frenzy."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/09/rebecca-zahaus-boyfriend-warns-he-might-sue-her-familys-lawyer/|title=Rebecca Zahau’s Boyfriend Warns He Might Sue Her Family’s Lawyer|last=Caron|first=Christina|date=2011-09-08|accessdate=2011-09-09|periodical=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jim Edwards of CBS [[BNET]] suggested it was unlikely that Shacknai would actually sue, as it would simply [[Streisand effect|bring more publicity to the case]]; he expected that the situation effectively "leaves the Zahau family to continue their claims unchallenged."&lt;ref name="BNET20110920"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bnet.com/blog/drug-business/cellphone-records-leave-medicis-shacknai-stuck-in-catch-22/9758|periodical=CBS [[BNET]]|title=Cellphone Records Leave Medicis’ Shacknai Stuck in Catch-22|first=Jim|last=Edwards|date=2011-09-20|accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shacknai also hired [[public relations]] firm [[Sitrick and Company]] to represent him the week after Zahau's death.&lt;ref name="BNET20110908"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bnet.com/blog/drug-business/ceo-shacknai-wields-small-army-against-speculation-on-death-of-his-girlfriend/9609|last=Edwards|first=Jim|title=CEO Shacknai Wields Small Army Against Speculation on Death of His Girlfriend|date=2011-09-08|accessdate=2011-09-09|periodical=CBS [[BNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to media inquiries, a Sitrick and Company employee stated that Shacknai had hired the firm to handle his large volume of incoming calls in the days after the deaths, to give him time to grieve and make arrangements for the funerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.10news.com/news/28617230/detail.html|title=Coronado Mansion Owner Hires PR Firm|date=2011-07-20|accessdate=2011-09-10|periodical=10 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sitrick and Company executives later held discussions with journalists whom they believe had made errors in their reporting on the case.&lt;ref name="BNET20110908"/&gt;
A San Diego California civil jury awarded $5 million in damages on April 4th 2018 to the family of Zahau, determining that the brother of Shacknai was liable for her death.

'''Christianne and Robert Shepherd''' (known as Christi and Bobby respectively) were a brother and sister from [[Horbury]], [[West Yorkshire]] who died of [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning while on holiday in [[Corfu]] in October 2006. At the time of their deaths, Christi was seven years old and Bobby was six.

The cause of death was found to be a faulty gas boiler. Three people, including the manager of the hotel where they were staying, were found guilty of [[manslaughter]] by negligence following a criminal trial in [[Greece]] in 2010 and were each sentenced to seven years in prison. The jury at the inquest into Christi and Bobby's deaths, which was held at [[Wakefield]] Coroner's Court in 2015, returned a verdict of unlawful killing and concluded that travel group [[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook]] had "breached its duty of care".&lt;ref name="BBC News 13 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Corfu children's deaths: Thomas Cook 'breached duty of care'|url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32719823| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 13 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 14 May 2015"&gt;{{cite news | title= Corfu carbon monoxide tragedy: Can we trust tour operators with our safety? |url=  https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11606621/Corfu-carbon-monoxide-tragedy-Can-we-trust-tour-operators-with-our-safety.html| last= Trend| first= Nick| date= 14 May 2015 | work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaths==
In October 2006, Christi and Bobby Shepherd went on a one-week half-term holiday to the resort of Gouvia on the [[List of islands of Greece|Greek island]] of [[Corfu]] with their father, Neil Shepherd, and his girlfriend Ruth Beatson, for which he paid almost £2,000.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 27 April 2015"&gt;{{cite web |author= [[Press Association]] |title= Corfu carbon monoxide deaths 'the most appalling tragedy', says coroner |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/27/corfu-carbon-monoxide-deaths-the-most-appalling-tragedy-says-coroner| date=27 April 2015|work= [[The Guardian]] | accessdate= 18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After an initial problem in which the family was allocated a room in the main building of the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel, they were admitted to a semi-detached two-bedroom bungalow in the hotel's grounds.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 27 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 30 May 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title= Corfu gas death family secures legal aid for inquest |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-27638124| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 30 May 2014| website= BBC News | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty-eight hours after arriving, Beatson and the children started to feel unwell, with Bobby stumbling and appearing dizzy.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 27 April 2015"&gt;{{cite news | title= Corfu holiday carbon monoxide tragedy: Two children died after work 'bodged and botched' |url=  https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11565922/Corfu-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-tragedy.html| last= Turner| first= Camilla|date= 27 April 2015| newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christi became ill shortly after going to bed on 25 October and her father went to fetch a carrier bag for her to vomit into but he collapsed.&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 May 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title= Thomas Cook staff cleared over Corfu child deaths |url=  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/mobile/england/bradford/8658972.stm | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 4 May 2010| website= BBC News | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At approximately 11 am the following morning, a chambermaid found the adults both unconscious and the two children dead.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 27 April 2015"/&gt; Both adults only discovered the news of the deaths when they regained consciousness in hospital some days later.&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 February 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title= Staff stand trial in Corfu over carbon monoxide deaths|url=  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/mobile/england/west_yorkshire/8497394.stm  | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 4 February 2010| website= BBC News | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
A police investigation by [[West Yorkshire Police]] found that the holiday representative responsible for health and safety at the hotel had not received any specific training relating to it. It also identified failings in the hotel assessment process used by Thomas Cook holidays, which ignored ancillary buildings.&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday 10 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Holiday rep in charge of health and safety at Corfu hotel where two British children died of carbon monoxide poisoning 'had no safety training'|url=  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3075259/Holiday-rep-charge-health-safety-Corfu-hotel-two-British-children-died-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-no-safety-training.html| last= Bunyan| first= Nigel| date= 10 May 2015 | newspaper= [[The Mail on Sunday]] | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of death was identified as [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] caused by fumes which had seeped into the accommodation from a “decrepit” boiler situated in an outhouse directly adjacent to Bobby and Christi's bedroom.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 27 April 2015"/&gt; The police investigation also found that unrelated defects concerning balconies and fire doors had not been remedied two years after they had been reported to the hotel.&lt;ref name="Mail on Sunday 10 May 2015"/&gt;

Neil Shepherd and his girlfriend Ruth Beatson, together with the children's mother Sharon Wood and her husband Paul, campaigned in Corfu to secure a local police investigation and trial.&lt;ref name="BBC News 17 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Corfu gas death pair's parents' fury at Thomas Cook 'apology'|url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32771355| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 17 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]]’s Samantha Haines later reported in 2010: "Their actions made them both well-known and not always popular with the locals […] BBC reporter [[Jenny Hill (journalist)|Jenny Hill]] said the Corfu economy relied heavily on tourism and the publicity surrounding the case was ‘unwelcome’ on the island. But the family vowed to go back to Corfu again and again, until they could leave with what they said was ‘justice’ for the children."&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 May 2010 Samantha Haines"&gt;{{cite web | title= Thomas Cook staff cleared over Corfu child deaths |url=  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/mobile/england/bradford/8658972.stm | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 4 May 2010| website= BBC News | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Greek trial==
In February 2010, the trial of two Thomas Cook employees and ten Greek nationals began at [[Corfu (city)|Corfu Town]] courthouse. All of the defendants faced charges of manslaughter by negligence; one was later discharged. The three trial judges heard evidence from Harry Rogers, a [[mechanical engineer]], who said the installation of the ‘decrepit’ boiler responsible for the deaths was the worst he had seen in 50 years. He told the court that the leak had been caused by a wired-out gas valve, a bypassed thermostat, the lack of a flue and chimney, and a gap between the bungalow and the outhouse containing the boiler. Comparing it to a loaded gun, he said: "You can play with a gun for so long and it may not go off, but in certain circumstances someone will get killed”.&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 May 2010 Samantha Haines"/&gt;

During the trial, the hotel staff, maintenance engineers and builders denied responsibility for the deaths, blaming each other through their lawyers.&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 May 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title= Thomas Cook staff cleared over Corfu child deaths |url=  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/mobile/england/bradford/8658972.stm | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 4 May 2010| website= BBC News | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial concluded in May 2010, with three of the defendants found guilty. They included the hotel's manager, Georgios Chrysikopoulos, the head of its technical department, Petros Stoyiannos, and its electrician, Christos Louvros. All three were sentenced to seven years imprisonment. A further defendant, Dimitrios Xidias, was sentenced to two years’ probation for breaching building regulations.&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 May 2010"/&gt; However, in May 2015 it was reported that due to the Greek appeals process none had yet gone to prison.&lt;ref name="BBC News 13 May 2015"/&gt;

The remaining defendants, including both Thomas Cook travel representatives, were cleared; the travel company was also cleared of any responsibility for the deaths of the children.&lt;ref name="BBC News 17 May 2015"/&gt;

==2015 Inquest==

===Legal aid===
Following the conclusion of the Greek trial, the parents of Christi and Bobby were refused [[Legal aid#England and Wales|legal aid from England and Wales]] to pay for their representation at the inquest into the deaths, on the grounds that lawyers are not usually required. In March 2014, the issue was raised by Labour MP [[Mary Creagh]] during [[Prime Minister's Questions|Prime Minister's Questions]] in the House of Commons. The following month Shepherd and Wood met British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]], the legal aid minister [[Shailesh Vara]] and Creagh, who had organised the meeting. In a statement afterwards, Vara said: "This is a very tragic case in which two young children lost their lives and my deepest sympathies are with the family, with whom the prime minister and I recently met. Questions remain unanswered and I have therefore authorised legal aid for representation at the inquest to hopefully provide much-needed answers."&lt;ref name="BBC News 30 May 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title= Corfu gas death family secures legal aid for inquest |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-27638124| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 30 May 2014| website= BBC News | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepherd welcomed the news, saying: "We are now in a position to be able to concentrate on getting the full facts of Christi and Bobby's deaths out in the public without the added worry of cost." Wood said there was "an overwhelming public interest for the lessons of our tragedy to be learned so that no other family suffers as we have".&lt;ref name="BBC News 30 May 2014"/&gt;

===Coroner’s inquest hearing===
More than eight years after the children's deaths, a full inquest into the events surrounding them began at Wakefield Coroner's Court on 26 April 2015. Opening the inquest, West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff said: "The family of these children have waited a long, long time for this day to come".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 27 April 2015"/&gt; It heard that the bungalow "became available for this family to use because the previous occupants had become unwell and they had been detained in hospital for tests and treatment".&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 27 April 2015"/&gt; Heating engineer Harry Rogers told the inquest that the faulty boiler responsible for the children's deaths would have been shut down immediately if it had been inspected in the UK. Rogers told the jury that the most significant of its many failings was the lack of a flue to vent the fumes from the boiler room. He added that he had been told that this same defect applied to many of the other boilers at the hotel but that he had not been allowed to inspect them.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 27 April 2015"/&gt;

When Rogers said that he had been told that Thomas Cook's position was that the hotel had told the tour company they had no gas appliances for the purposes of heating or water, the barrister acting for Thomas Cook, Nicholas Purnell [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], clarified to the jury that it was his client's position that it had been lied to.  Asked by [[Leslie Thomas (barrister)|Leslie Thomas QC]], the barrister acting for the children's family, whether it reasonable for Thomas Cook to accept such an assurance from the hotel without questioning it, Rogers replied: "They’ve got a duty of care. If it’s not gas, how is it being heated?"&lt;ref name="The Guardian 27 April 2015"/&gt;

A second expert, Thomas Magner, described the installation work as having been “botched and bodged” and said that a safety cut-off device had been deliberately short-circuited to prevent it turning off. The short-circuiting appeared to have been carried out the day before the children died, in response to a complaint from another family about a lack of hot water in their bungalow.

At the inquest, a series of former and current Thomas Cook employees declined to answer questions about the events around the children's deaths.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 17 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Corfu deaths: parents not received 'disgraceful' Thomas Cook apology |url=  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/17/corfu-deaths-parents-thomas-cook-apology| last= Kennedy | first= Maev | date= 17 May 2015 | work= [[The Guardian]] | accessdate= 18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manny Fontenla-Novoa]], who was chief executive of the company's UK and Ireland operations at the time of the accident and subsequently chief executive of the Thomas Cook Group, was told by the coroner that he did not have to answer any questions that might incriminate him. When it was put to him by the barrister acting for the family, that "Thomas Cook put profit before safety" Fontenla-Novoa replied "I decline to answer"; he gave the same response to almost all of the questions he was asked.&lt;ref name="Independent 7 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Corfu carbon monoxide inquest: Thomas Cook boss refuses to apologise for children's deaths |url=  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/corfu-carbon-monoxide-inquest-thomas-cook-boss-refuses-to-apologise-for-childrens-deaths-10233090.html| last= Higgens| first= Dave| date= 7 May 2015 | newspaper= [[The Independent]] | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Cook's former director of government and external affairs and director-general of the Federation of Tour Operators, Andy Cooper, told the inquest "I don’t believe the duty of care of the tour operator is that they should be carrying out a full safety check" and described the checks conducted as "a basic audit". The company's head of health and safety, Peter Welsh, told the inquest that he understood that the hotel's management had told Thomas Cook there were no gas-powered heaters on the site.&lt;ref name="Travel Weekly 5 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Corfu deaths 'could happen again', Cooper tells inquest|url=  http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2015/05/05/54061/corfu-deaths-could-happen-again-cooper-tells-inquest.html| last= Hayhurst| first= Lee| date= 5 May 2015| work= [[Travel Weekly (UK)|Travel Weekly]] | accessdate= 17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked by the family's barrister: "My clients would like me to put it to you this is an inquest into the deaths of two young children. This is an opportunity to assist. Would you like to take that opportunity?" travel representative Nicola Jordison replied: "I decline to answer". She also declined to acknowledge that a statement she had made during the Greek trial was in fact hers. Jordison's husband David, also a Thomas Cook holiday representative, also declined to answer when the family's barrister asked him: "You knew there was gas there, because you had been there for a whole season, didn't you?" The company's health and safety manager, Clare Kenny, also declined to answer questions put to her.&lt;ref name="Travel Weekly 5 May 2015"/&gt;

The current Thomas Cook Group's chief executive officer [[Peter Fankhauser]], told the inquest: "I feel incredibly sorry for the family – incredibly sorry. But I don’t have to apologise".&lt;ref name="Travel Weekly 5 May 2015"/&gt; He went on to explain, "I feel so thoroughly, from the deepest of my heart, sorry, but there’s no need to apologise because there was no wrongdoing by Thomas Cook". He said his company had a policy of avoiding gas-fired hot water appliances but that it had been lied to by the hotel, which had said that it had no gas supply.&lt;ref name="Independent 7 May 2015"/&gt;

On 13 May 2015, the inquest jury returned a verdict of [[unlawful killing]]. The jury also found that Thomas Cook had "breached its duty of care".&lt;ref name="BBC News 13 May 2015"/&gt; Coroner David Hinchliff said that he would be making recommendations to the holiday industry.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 14 May 2015"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
Speaking after the inquest verdict, Christi and Bobby's mother said that she continued to blame Thomas Cook for the accident, saying: "It's clear Thomas Cook should and could have identified that lethal boiler. There will never be true justice for the deaths of my two innocent children. [The verdict] has brought this tragedy to a respectful end. Rest in peace our beautiful angels."&lt;ref name="BBC News 13 May 2015"/&gt; However, the company issued a statement in which it insisted that although it was "shocked and deeply saddened by the tragic loss", it was not at fault, citing the acquittal of its employees in the 2010 Greek trial.&lt;ref name="BBC News 13 May 2015"/&gt;

BBC North of England Correspondent Danny Savage noted that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] had reviewed the earlier West Yorkshire Police investigation and decided that there was insufficient evidence to bring prosecutions in the UK. He said "There's a strong possibility this will be the last time these events ever have such a high public profile. The parents of Bobby and Christi say they hope this is the last time they have to go through the painful details but, above all, they hope all the publicity will prevent this happening to another family."&lt;ref name="BBC News 13 May 2015"/&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2015 shortly after the conclusion of the inquest, Travel expert Nick Trend, said: "The most significant difference, a Thomas Cook spokesman told me, is the use of third party experts to conduct hotel inspections, introduced in 2012". He quoted the spokesman as adding, "Instruction of dedicated third party experts addresses any concerns about training, about monitoring information, about the expertise of the inspectors and the insistence of inspectors of looking at things in addition to relying upon what they are told by hoteliers."&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 14 May 2015"/&gt;

On 17 May 2015, the children's parents reacted angrily to news in that day's ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' that Thomas Cook had received £3.5m in compensation from the hotel in respect of lost profits and legal expenses relating to the deaths – an amount they said was ten times more than they had received themselves following the deaths of Bobby and Christi. They also claimed that they had first seen a letter of apology addressed to them when it was shown to them by news reporters. In a statement, Shepherd and Wood said: "We haven't had this so called letter of apology. It’s not an apology for their wrongdoing but a general offer of sympathy. It does not address the central issue that their Safety Management System failed and it does not apologise for that." Thomas Cook insisted the letter had been sent by chief executive Peter Fankhauser on Friday May 15.&lt;ref name="BBC News 17 May 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian 17 May 2015"/&gt;

The following day it was announced that Thomas Cook would be donating £1.5m – which it said was the remainder left after legal costs had been taken by its insurers - to charity. Group CEO Peter Fankhauser said: "Thomas Cook has not in any way profited from our claim against the hotel owner. In late 2012, we brought a claim against the hotelier for breaching their contract to provide safe accommodation to our customers and to comply with all applicable laws, which was decided in our favour. Today I have made arrangements for the full amount - £1.5m - to be donated in full to Unicef, the world's leading children's organisation. I believe this is the right thing to do and I apologise to the family for all they have gone through."&lt;ref name="BBC News 18 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Thomas Cook donates half of Corfu compensation |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32785374| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 18 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2015, the family's MP Mary Creagh responded to the announcement of Thomas Cook's charitable donation, saying that the children's parents had not been consulted about it, and that relatives and friends have been giving donations to another charity in Bobby and Christi's memory. She said: "Their feeling is that this once more is not about them, it’s about Thomas Cook".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 19 May 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Khomami |first= Nadia |title= Corfu holiday deaths: family not consulted over Thomas Cook donation |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/19/corfu-holiday-deaths-family-not-consulted-over-thomas-cook-donation| date= 19 May 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=19 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former managing director of Thomas Cook's international business and former chairman of the [[Association of British Travel Agents]], John McEwan, told [[BBC Radio 4]]’s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme: "I think they should have consulted the family. I think they should have actually had a discussion with the family about what would be best. I would have liked to have seen, for example, the family being involved in where should that money go, should it be used to set up a charity on behalf of the children which would perpetuate their memory? There should have been some offering of compassion, some recognition that this has been an appalling tragedy and some care exhibited for the family."&lt;ref name="The Guardian 19 May 2015"/&gt; In ''[[The Independent]]'' Joanna Bourke wrote: "Nothing Thomas Cook could ever do would bring back the two children killed by carbon monoxide poisoning on a Greek holiday in 2006. But the firm’s handling of the case has been a lesson in how not to manage a crisis".&lt;ref name="The Independent 19 May 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Bourke   |first= Joanna |title= Carbon monoxide deaths: From a tragedy to a corporate disaster for Thomas Cook |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/carbon-monoxide-deaths-from-a-tragedy-to-a-corporate-disaster-for-thomas-cook-10259735.html| date=19 May 2015|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London|accessdate=19 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2015, Fankhauser told the BBC he was "deeply sorry" for the deaths of Christi and Bobby, saying: "It is clear that there are things that we as a company could have done better in the past nine years. In particular the way we conducted our relationship with the family and this is something that we are going to change". He added that he took responsibility for the way the company had communicated and that he regretted saying Thomas Cook had done "nothing wrong" when giving evidence at the inquest hearing.&lt;ref name="BBC News 20 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Thomas Cook boss apologises over Corfu gas deaths |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-32809770| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 20 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' reported that Fankhauser had declined to say what he intended to do to help Bobby and Christi's family, quoting him as saying: "I’m not going to communicate in public about what we are going to do. […] We want to help the family to move on and that is it. I don’t want to repeat the mistakes the company did in the past. My intention is to see how they can move forward with their lives. I’m sorry about what they have had to go through. I’m personally sorry as a father myself." Asked if he wanted to end the wall of silence which the children's father had accused his company of hiding behind Fankhauser replied, "Yes".&lt;ref name="The Guardian 20 May 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Farrell |first= Sean |title= Thomas Cook says sorry over handling of children's deaths compensation case |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/thomas-cook-says-sorry-over-handling-of-chidrens-deaths-compensation-case| date=20 May 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=20 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Fankhauser had a three-hour meeting with the children's parents. Afterwards it was announced that Thomas Cook was to make an undisclosed "financial gesture of goodwill" to them, and Fankhauser said: "I am so grateful for the opportunity to meet and listen to Sharon Wood and Neil Shepherd. Having heard what they have had to say today, my heart breaks for them. This is a meeting which should have happened when I first took over as chief executive in November and frankly something Thomas Cook should have done nine years ago."&lt;ref name="The Guardian 21 May 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Elgot |first= Jessica |title= Thomas Cook makes 'sincere and heartfelt apology' over children's deaths |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/21/thomas-cook-sincere-heartfelt-apology-christi-bobby-shepherd| date=21 May 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=21 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family said that they would be making donations to several charities. The travel company also agreed to demolish the bungalow where the children had died and to erect a playground in its place in their memory. It was later discovered that two of the hotel staff who had been convicted over the children's deaths at the Greek trial in 2010, electrician Christos Louvros and hotel manager Georgios Chrysikopoulos, had been found working at hotels used by Thomas Cook. The BBC reported that Fankhauser said he felt "physically sick" on learning this and that Chrysikopoulos had subsequently been sacked from his post in Crete. Thomas Cook announced that it had stopped sending holidaymakers to the hotel where the children had died and where Louvros was still employed.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 21 May 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 21 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Thomas Cook give Corfu family 'financial gesture of goodwill' |url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-32835029| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 21 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the results of an independent review of Thomas Cook's crisis management procedures and the company's customer health and safety strategy were published. Written by [[Justin King (businessman)|Justin King]], a former chief executive of UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's, the review's report was critical of the way that the company had dealt with the children's family, saying that its responses had been "intermittent, sometimes ill-timed and often ill-judged. […] Decisions were often not taken in the thoughtful and caring way you would expect from a company such as Thomas Cook". Amongst its recommendations, the review concluded that the company should significantly increase health and safety resources, provide greater information to customers and staff about carbon monoxide risks and safety, and create a confidential whistle-blowing mechanism for staff and contractors to raise any concerns about health and safety.&lt;ref name="BBC News 2 November 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Thomas Cook gas deaths: Firm's contact with family 'often ill-judged'|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-34697804| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 2 November 2015| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 2 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company responded by saying that King's report made for "uncomfortable reading in parts" and that it aimed to implement its recommendations within 18 months.  Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said the review would "serve as a catalyst" for the changes the company was already making, adding that, "It took us nine years to correct the mistakes of the past and to do what everyone would have expected of us; treat the family with the respect and empathy they deserve. We had to learn from this tragedy and do things differently, and this remains our commitment".&lt;ref name="BBC News 2 November 2015"/&gt;

Analysing King's report, the BBC's business editor, [[Kamal Ahmed (journalist)|Kamal Ahmed]], said, "In an era when there is considerable suspicion about the motivation of businesses, the ability of a company to react to a crisis in a way that reveals it to be run by human beings rather than faceless chief executives is of paramount importance. Every company chief executive should read Justin King's report. And reflect on now many of the problems he has identified are also true of the businesses they run".&lt;ref name="BBC News 2 November 2015"/&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2007, [[Horbury Primary School]], which the children had both attended, marked the anniversary of their deaths by opening a memorial garden. Head teacher John Wright said: "The garden is a beautiful tribute to two children who added so much to the school and are remembered fondly by their friends and school employees".&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 February 2010"/&gt;

==The Dohring Company==
Dohring formed The Dohring Company in 1986, where he served as Chairman and CEO, with his wife originally serving as president. Customers for the company's market research services have included retail chains including [[Baskin-Robbins]] and [[House of Fabrics]], and entertainment firms including [[Capitol Records]], as well as automotive, financial services, and health care companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.THE_DOHRING_COMPANY_INC.fa3abe1107970c76.html|title = &lt;nowiki&gt;THE DOHRING COMPANY INC  | Company Profile from Hoovers&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date = |accessdate = |website = Hoovers.com|publisher = Hoovers - A D&amp;B Company|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, automotive surveys comprised up to 80% of the firm's business in 1995. At that time, the company was ranked 55th on the ''[[Advertising Age]]'' list of the nation's largest market research firms. It was 92nd on the ''[[Los Angeles Business Journal]]'' 's 1995 List of fastest growing private companies in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name="labj"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_n52_v17/ai_17945455 Black box approach to market research - The Dohring Co] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016063205/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_n52_v17/ai_17945455 |date=2007-10-16 }}, ''[[Los Angeles Business Journal]]'', Dec. 25, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopets==

Dohring formed [[Neopets]], Inc. after being introduced to the Neopets.com site by a mutual friend upon its December, 1999 launch by two British college students, [[Adam Powell (game designer)|Adam Powell]] and Donna Williams. According to [[Business Week|BusinessWeek]], Dohring bought the site immediately thereafter, and in April, 2000, he brought in his first paying customers for a concept that he trademarked as ''[[immersive advertising]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2001/tc20011212_9434.htm BW Online | December 12, 2001|Real Profits from an Imaginary World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Media Literacies: A Critical Introduction|last = Hoechsmann|first = Michael|publisher = Wiley|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Harvard Business School]] case study, Neopets, Inc. had reached profitability four months after launching operations, "largely due to the fact that it spends nothing for customer acquisition, relying strictly on word-of-mouth," and as of July 2001, the site was ranked #4 in "stickiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work | url=http://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cb/web/product_detail.seam;jsessionid=2A8F62DA2A867AAA8688BF0F1A826C9F?E=50134&amp;R=802100-PDF-ENG&amp;conversationId=616582 | work=Harvard Business Publishing | title=Neopets, Inc. | author=Thomas R. Eisenmann, Liz Kind | date=May 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after its creation, in December 2001, Neopets had attracted more than 20 million accounts, more than 80% of them under the age of 17. While the "tech bubble" was bursting and large percentages of new web sites were folding, Neopets was signing up 50,000 new accounts per day, with members spending an average of four hours or more per month on the site. [[Bloomberg Businessweek|Business Week]] cited Neopets as “one of the top three entertainment sites on the Web, according to [[Jupiter Media Metrix]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Lippe |url=http://adage.com/article/wtw99/neopets-doug-dohring/53602/|title=NeoPets: Doug Dohring|publisher=[[Advertising Age]] |date=October 8, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labusinessjournal.com/archive_article.asp?aID=95532498.7337863.876889.05241102.6627691.546&amp;aID2=67444 Login | labusinessjournal.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising Age listed Dohring and Neopets in their 2001 “Roster of Marketing 100s”, noting that in July 2001 the site was ranked the “stickiest” at-home web site by [[Nielsen Net Ratings|Nielsen/Net Ratings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adage.com/wtw99/article?article_id=53602&amp;amp;amp;search_phrase=%2BDohring%22%3C Advertising Age&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002 Neopets had 24 million accounts, and people spending more time on the site than at major services such as [[AOL|America Online]]. It was cited by Stacey Herron at Jupiter Media Metrix as “one of the most usage-intensive sites on the Web.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&amp;res=9C0DEEDB143EF932A15751C0A9649C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=As Children Adopt Pets, A Game Adopts Them | first=Marc | last=Weingarten | date=February 21, 2002 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/Who+let+the+NeoPets+out/2100-1023_3-844994.html?tag=item Who let the NeoPets out? | CNET News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dohring sold the Neopets site to [[Viacom]]'s [[MTV Network]] in June 2005 for $160 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111922611869563663|title = Viacom to Acquire Web Company Neopets|date = June 20, 2005|accessdate = October 9, 2014|website = Wall Street Journal|publisher = Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.|last = Flint|first = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, approximately 140 million Neopets had been created, and Neopets ranked among the top 10 stickiest Web sites, with advertising making up about 60% of the company's revenues and a line of plush toys sold through [[Target Corporation]] and other stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2005/06/21/viacoms_mtv_buys_neopets_for_160m/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Viacom's MTV buys Neopets for $160m | date=June 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Viacom to Acquire Web Company Neopets | date=June 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age of Learning, Inc. and ABCmouse.com==
After the sale of Neopets to Viacom in 2005, Dohring founded Age of Learning, Inc., and launched ABCMouse.com Early Learning Academy, “designed to teach basic reading, math, science and other subjects to children between the ages of two and six,” according to [[The Wall Street Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/11/15/from-neopets-to-teachers-pets/?KEYWORDS=neopets | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=From Neopets to Teachers' Pets | date=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Age of Learning expanded the ABCmouse curriculum through 2nd grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcmouse-com-early-learning-academy-110000362.html|title=ABCmouse.com Early Learning Academy Adds 2nd Grade Curriculum, Expanding the Leading Educational Resource for 3rd-Grade Readiness|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Neopets, which relied on advertising, ABCmouse.com charges a monthly fee of $7.95 per month or $79.95 per year, and is free to individual teachers, libraries, [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] programs, and other community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ageoflearning.com/initiatives.html|title = &lt;nowiki&gt;Age of Learning | Our Education Access Initiatives&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date = |accessdate = October 9, 2014|website = AgeofLearning.com|publisher = Age of Learning, Inc.|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dohring assembed an education advisory board that collaborates on the design of the ABCmouse curriculum and includes Kimberly Oliver Burnim, [[National Teacher of the Year]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kimberly-oliver-burnim/ | work=Huffington Post | title=Kimberly Oliver Burnim}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kevin O’Donnell, creator of [[PBS]] series, “[[Liberty's Kids|Liberty’s Kids]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337550/|title = Liberty's Kids|date = |accessdate = October 9, 2014|website = IMDB.com|publisher = Amazon.com|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Age of Learning launched ABCmouse for Schools, a solution aimed at school districts and groups rather than families or individual teachers. ABCmouse for Schools includes student management, professional development, curriculum alignment, and progress reporting tools in addition to the core ABCmouse curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eschoolnews.com/2016/07/11/abcmouse-launches-school-centered-platform-for-k-2/|title=ABCmouse launches school-centered platform for K-2|date=2016-07-11|website=eSchool News|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/06/28/age-of-learning-debuts-elementary-school-resources.aspx|title=Age of Learning Debuts Elementary School Resources -- THE Journal|website=THE Journal|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other business ventures==
Dohring was also a principal shareholder in [[Speedyclick.com]] circa 1999-2001, which according to a December 2005 [[Wired Magazine]] article, "he later sold for $50 million."&lt;ref name="wiredpets"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/neopets.html The Neopets Addiction], WIRED, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The $50 million deal included $3 million in cash and $47 million in ShopNow stock,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/1999/11/08/daily18.html|title = ShopNow buys SpeedyClick for $50M|date = 1999-11-11|accessdate = October 9, 2014|website = Puget Sound Business Journal|publisher = American City Business Journals|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (later renamed as "Network Commerce",&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2001/10/01/focus4.html | first=Brad | last=Broberg | title=Companies claim there's life after delisting | date=September 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deemed worthless in 2001).&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"/&gt;

==Personal life==
A [[California]] native, Dohring is the youngest son of a car dealer and a homemaker. He and his wife Laurie, both [[Scientology|Scientologists]], have been married since 1979.

{{Portal|Star Wars}}
'''General Grievous''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[antagonist]] in the [[Star Wars|''Star Wars'' franchise]]. He served as the Supreme Commander of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]' [[Battle droid|Droid Armies]] during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. He was trained in all [[lightsaber]] [[martial arts|combat forms]] by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Count Dooku]] to rival the [[Jedi]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. In [[Star Wars expanded universe|Legends]], Grievous was a Kaleesh warlord named '''Qymaen jai Sheelal''', who suffered great injuries in a ship crash and was then rebuilt as a cyborg.

The character was introduced in 2004 in the animated series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', before making his live-action debut in the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]''.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Concept and creation==

General Grievous was developed for ''Revenge of the Sith'' as a powerful new villain on the side of the Separatists. The initial instructions that director [[George Lucas]] gave the Art Department were very open-ended: "a droid general". From that vague direction, the artists developed a lot of explorations, some purely mechanical, some not, for Grievous' look. He was also created as a villain foreshadowing Anakin Skywalker's transformation into [[Darth Vader]]: the heavy breathing, the [[cyborg]] body and his seduction into an evil faction.

The initial design sketch for Grievous was refined and made into a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}-tall [[maquette]] sculpture. That was further refined when it was made into a realistic computer-generated model by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]. At the time, this was one of the most complicated models ever created by ILM, with many parts of differing physical qualities. Grievous is completely [[computer-generated imagery]] in the movie. On set, Duncan Young read the lines off-screen while Kyle Rowling wore a [[chroma key|bluescreen]] or a [[chroma key|greenscreen]] suit to act out the fights with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].

Also notable are the numerous contradictions between the expanded universe and both TV series. Grievous is depicted as having four fingers per arm in the ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' series whereas ''Star Wars: Clone Wars'' has the general depicted as having five. ''Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith'' and most other comics depicted him as having six fingers per arm. The original ''Clone Wars'' incarnation was fast, acrobatic and powerful but not as often in command when compared to the more recent ''The Clone Wars'' incarnation of the character. Furthermore, his asthmatic cough and hunchbacked stance are already present, despite having not gained them prior to his confrontation with Mace Windu. The general's back story has also been changed: supervising director Dave Filoni stated that Grievous opted for surgery in order to gain abilities that would allow him to rival a Jedi. This is reinforced by season one's tenth episode "Lair of Grievous" which suggested the general's transformation into a cyborg was a gradual process.

Comparisons have been drawn between the character's appearance and [[Jacob Epstein]]'s sculpture ''[[Rock Drill (Jacob Epstein)|Rock Drill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = I.B.Tauris | isbn = 1845112377

===Character overview===
General Grievous' [[asthma]]tic cough in ''Revenge of the Sith'' was intended to emphasize his organic nature as well as the flaws of having cyborg [[prosthesis|prosthetics]]. The Separatist Leader does, in fact, have a severe case of asthma.  Grievous had previously appeared in ''Clone Wars'' before many of his personality traits had been finalized. To reconcile the differences between the two presentations, [[Mace Windu]] uses [[the Force]] to crush Grievous' chest panel towards the end of the show's third season (Volume Two) as the general makes a desperate escape with Palpatine. Some of the audio effects for the coughing were taken from Lucas himself, who had had [[bronchitis]] during principal photography.&lt;ref name="DVDcom"&gt;''Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith'' DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, John Knoll and Roger Guyett, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrayal===
General Grievous has been voiced by four actors. In the ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' animated series, the character was voiced by [[John DiMaggio]] for Season Two's finale episode and by [[Richard McGonagle]] for Season Three. The character was voiced by [[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]] in the feature film ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', the animated series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and most of the video game appearances. David W. Collins voiced the character, albeit uncredited, in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron]]''.

[[Gary Oldman]] (a friend of producer [[Rick McCallum]]) agreed to submit a voice audition but his involvement never went beyond that. Several months later, actor [[John Rhys-Davies]] was widely reported to be the character's voice but this was revealed to be a prank.

==Appearances==
===Film===
====''Revenge of the Sith''====
In ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'', General Grievous holds [[Supreme Chancellor Palpatine]] hostage aboard his flagship, the ''[[Trade Federation Cruiser|Invisible Hand]]''. When the Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] launch a rescue operation, the latter kills Separatist Head of State [[Count Dooku]]. Grievous traps the fleeing Jedi and the Chancellor in a ray shield, and has them brought along with [[R2-D2]] to the ship's bridge. He confiscates Kenobi and Skywalker's lightsabers, cackling that he will add them to his vast collection. When R2-D2 creates a distraction, Obi-Wan and Anakin use the Force to retrieve their lightsabers and free themselves. A short battle ensues with the Jedi overcoming Grievous's [[MagnaGuards]] and [[Battle droid]]s before turning their attention to the General himself. Grievous escapes by using the [[electrostaff]] of a fallen MagnaGuard to shatter the bridge's glass and create a vacuum that pulls everything out towards space. He subsequently fires a grapple-hook to secure himself to the ship and scales its exterior en route to an escape pod. Grievous launches all of the other pods as well to prevent the Jedi and the Chancellor from escaping the doomed vessel.

Now taking Dooku's place as both the political and military leader of the Separatists, Grievous heads to the planet of [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]], where the council members of the Confederacy of Independent Systems are hiding; the Separatists have taken the residents of Utapau hostage. At his master Darth Sidious' (secretly Chancellor Palpatine) request, Grievous moves the council members to the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]] as the conclusion of the Clone Wars approaches.

Obi-Wan Kenobi later tracks Grievous to Utapau. When Kenobi destroys his MagnaGuards, Grievous duels the Jedi in single combat, splitting each of his mechanical arms in half to simultaneously use four lightsabers. The Republic's [[Clone trooper]]s then arrive to engage Grievous' Droid Army. Obi-Wan disarms Grievous with the Force and pursues him when the general retreats on his [[Wheel Bike (Star Wars)|wheelbike]], fleeing to the hanger where his starfighter is located. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat, where Obi-Wan manages to rip open Grievous's chest plates, revealing the parts where his organs are located. Enraged, Grievous tosses Kenobi off the platform, easily overpowering him. Using the Force and control, Kenobi manipulates his position, and catches hold of his edge. As Grievous charges at him with his electrostaff, the Jedi uses the force to summon the general's blaster. Before Grievous can deliver the final blow, however, Obi-Wan uses the blaster and fires at General Grievous several times at his organs underneath his exoskeleton, which he incinerates. The cyborg then bursts into flames and dies.

===Television===

====''Clone Wars''====
In ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', General Grievous's first public appearance is when he attacked several Jedi on Hypori. After killing Daakman Barrek, Grievous and his droids surrounded Tarr Seirr, Sha'a Gi, [[Aayla Secura]], K'Kruhk, [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]] and [[Shaak Ti]]. After stating he would grant the Jedi a "warrior's death", Grievous battled the six Jedi all by himself, killing Seirr, and injuring Secura, Ti, and K'kruhk. He managed to possess three lightsabers (one in each hand and the third using his left foot) to fight Mundi. As they fought, lightsabers blazing, [[clone troopers]] arrived to save the surviving Jedi from Grievous, though they left K'kruhk thinking he was dead.

Sometime later, Grievous searched for Chancellor Palpatine on [[Coruscant (Star Wars)|Coruscant]] and fought several Jedi that took Palpatine to a secret bunker aboard a maglev train. However, while the general's Magnaguards distracted the lead Jedi, Grievous reached the hardened bunker, killed two other Jedi and captured Palpatine. As Grievous was about to escape, [[Mace Windu]] force-crushed his chest plates, severely injuring him. Although many fans believed this to be the reason for his persisting cough heard in ''Revenge of the Sith'', Grievous was actually intended to have had the cough all along (evidenced by him having the cough from the beginning in the subsequent CGI series ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars''). The confusion arose due to the writers of ''Star Wars: Clone Wars'' having to produce the series before all of Grievous's final characterizations had been nailed down.

====''The Clone Wars''====
In the first season of the [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-animated]] series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', Grievous is the commander of the huge Separatist warship ''Malevolence'' armed with a pair of heavy ion cannons. He also clashes with Obi-Wan Kenobi aboard the ''Malevolence'' for the first time when he chases him aboard the warship's railway system. During the ensuing lightsaber duel, Grievous nearly gets the better of Kenobi, but the Jedi Master makes his escape at the last moment. Meanwhile, Anakin secretly sabotages the ''Malevolence''{{'s}} navigation computer, sending it crashing into a nearby moon. However, Grievous escapes on his starfighter and continues his campaign against the Republic. A few episodes later, Grievous discovers Anakin Skywalker and Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]] infiltrating his secret listening post and seeks out to search for them. He then engages Ashoka and her squad of clone troopers, defeating all the troopers and then engaging in a cat and mouse game with Tano. However, Tano and Skywalker still manage to destroy his listening post. Aware of Grievous's recent string of failures, Count Dooku arranges a test for his cyborg henchman – in the form of Jedi Master [[Kit Fisto]] and Jedi Knight Nahdar Vebb. In Grievous's personal castle on the third moon of Vassek, the two Jedi and a squad of clone troopers ambush Grievous and cut off his legs. Once repaired, Grievous duels and kills Vebb. On the outskirts of Grievous's castle, the general climbs up from the ledge and unleashes four lightsabers on Fisto. Using the fog to his advantage, Fisto successfully cuts off one of Grievous's hands and reclaims Vebb's lightsaber. Armed with two lightsabers, Fisto gains the upper hand over Grievous to which the general calls in his Magnaguards and Fisto flees. When Grievous reports to Dooku, his master informs Grievous that there is room for improvement.

During the second season, Grievous boards a Republic Cruiser with Jedi Master [[Eeth Koth]] on board. Grievous duels Koth and takes him prisoner. Kenobi, Skywalker and Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]] attempt to rescue Koth and capture the cyborg general, resulting in a confrontation between Grievous and Kenobi over the planet Saleucami which Grievous loses. Though the Jedi succeed in rescuing Koth, Grievous, helped by his droids, escapes once again.

In the third season, Grievous, [[Asajj Ventress]] and their armies attack the clone factories on the planet [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. During the battle, Grievous clashes with Obi-Wan again. However, their duel ends in stalemate and Grievous flees the planet with Ventress. Later on, Grievous commands a sabotage mission using infiltrator droids on the Galactic Senate, resulting in a deregulation of the banks.

During the fourth season, Grievous suffers a humiliating defeat when he attempts to invade [[Naboo]]. [[Jar Jar Binks]] (posing as Gungan Boss Lyonie) distracts Grievous in a series of negotiations long enough for the Gungan Army to shut down Grievous's invasion force. As Grievous pursues Jar Jar, he slaughters many Gungan Grand Army soldiers. At that moment, General Tarpals intervenes and engages Grievous in a duel. Although he is mortally wounded by the cyborg, Tarpals impales Grievous through his chest which allows the Gungan Army to bombard the wounded general with energized projectiles and capture him. However, he is freed in a prisoner exchange with Skywalker between Dooku and [[Padmé Amidala]]. Later, Grievous attacks Gallia's ship, engaging her in a lightsaber duel down a narrow hallway. The duel ends when Grievous kicks Gallia in the chest, sending her flying across the hallway. Grievous then captures Gallia. Shortly after, Gallia escapes Grievous's custody when a strike force led by Jedi Master [[Plo Koon]] boards his ship and frees the Jedi Master, prompting Grievous to flee once again. Grievous is later sent to the planet Dathomir under Dooku's orders to exterminate the Nightsisters. Immediately upon landing on the planet's surface, the general begins his rampage and his droid army turns Dathomir into a battlefield. However, Asajj Ventress turns the tide of the battle and fights her way to the general's shuttle where the cyborg emerges to confront her personally. As they duel, Grievous grows overconfident and begins to toy with Ventress until she surprises him by chopping off one of his arms and knocking him to the ground. Grievous then orders his troops to fire on Ventress, wounding her. As the general prepares to deliver the deathblow to his longtime rival, he is attacked by Nightsister [[zombie]]s and is forced to fight them off while Ventress flees. Under new orders from Dooku, Grievous turns his attention to Nightsister leader Mother Talzin and slaughters his way to her fortress where she narrowly escapes from the general's grasp by [[teleporting]] away. Grievous is later seen on Serenno listening to Dooku's fears about [[Savage Opress]].

In the fifth season's premiere episode, Grievous is mentioned by [[Hondo Ohnaka]] as having defeated Obi-Wan and won the battle for the system that Florrum is in. This battle is shown in the episode "Bound for Rescue" where Grievous attacks Obi-Wan's ship; the General slaughters a squadron of clones and duels Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan is no match for Grievous and is subsequently defeated, forcing him to abandon his ship. Later, Grievous goes to Florrum personally and announces that the system is under his control now, and that Dooku is having him punish Hondo for holding him for ransom. The droids destroy Hondo's stronghold and his belongings, and hold him prisoner, but Hondo is rescued when Ahsoka and a group of younglings free him and retreat off the planet. Grievous pursues them and fights Ahsoka. Although she has grown stronger since their last battle, Grievous still proves to be more than a match for her. The duel ends when Hondo picks up Ahsoka in the ''Slave I'' and takes off, leaving Grievous to stew in his anger. In the first episode of the droid arc "Secret Weapons", Grievous is mentioned in the opening credits, and the primary goal of the mission is to retrieve a module that will decode a transmission that Grievous made about an important Separatist attack.

Grievous was to undergo a design change in the seventh season to look more like his design in ''Revenge of the Sith''. Though the series was cancelled before this could happen, the unfinished animations of the Crystal Crisis arc showed this design. In this arc, Grievous is sent by Dooku to purchase a giant [[kyber crystal]] on Utapau, and while Grievous at first obtains the crystal, it is lost when Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi destroy it by overloading its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/video/star-wars-the-clone-wars-story-reel-a-death-on-utapau|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Story Reel: A Death on Utapau - Star Wars: The Clone Wars|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
Grievous made his first appearance in the comics in a short story in ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'' called "The Eyes of Revolution". This story reveals that he was once Kaleesh general '''Qymaen jai Sheelal''', a fierce warrior engaged in a brutal war with the rival planet Huk. Grievous has had many wives. One that he is currently married to is human Gravlyn. He boards a shuttle to take him to another battle, unaware that Dooku had planted an explosive device in it. He is mortally wounded in the resulting crash and what remains of his body is reconstructed with [[cybernetic]] limbs. Dooku then recruits him into the Separatist Army as his second-in-command.

In the third volume of ''[[Clone Wars Adventures]]'', it is revealed that Grievous attains his rank of Supreme Commander by dueling Ventress and Durge simultaneously. On board the Trenchant space station, Ventress and Durge are ordered by Dooku to search for an unknown intruder with the pair unaware of the Count's intentions. Armed with an electrostaff, Grievous appears from behind and electrocutes Durge and subsequently throws him across the hallway through a few trophies. Ventress jumps onto a chandelier and attempts to search for Grievous, but is instead knocked off by the Cyborg but is saved by Durge. The pair then confront the general face to face, with Ventress unleashing her lightsabers and Durge unleashing his full arsenal. Grievous is able to knock Ventress away, though Durge then sends the general flying across the room into a wall with a powerful punch to the face. Enraged, Grievous unleashes his lightsabers, swiftly defeating the pair. In the wake of the battle, Grievous is made the Supreme Commander of the Confederacy's military.

Grievous starred in his own comic called ''Star Wars: General Grievous'', in which he fights Jedi Master T'chooka D'oon and his Padawan Flyn. After Grievous kills D'oon, Kybo returns to the Jedi council with a plan to destroy Grievous once and for all. When the council rebukes his vengeful plan, Kybo decides to take this matter into own hands with disastrous results. Grievous also appears in the comics in ''Star Wars: Obsession'' issue number 4, in which he is on the world of Boz Pity where he kills two Jedi, Master Soon Bayts and Jedi Council member [[Adi Gallia]]. Though Grievous is crippled by Windu, Dooku is able to save him so he may fight another day.

Grievous appears as a major character in the four-part comic series, ''Son of Dathomir'', an unproduced story arc intended for ''Clone Wars'' season six. The cyborg general is sent by Dooku to hunt down the rogue Sith Lord Darth Maul, who has become a significant threat to Sidious's plans. Grievous is ordered to only wound Maul's forces, but not kill him; this is in order to draw out Mother Talzin, who is later revealed to be Maul's blood mother. Though he thinks it foolish to keep Maul alive, Grievous does as he is told. He takes a huge army of droids to Zanbar and attacks Maul's army of Death Watch warriors. Despite heavy casualties, Grievous' droids ultimately win the battle. During the battle, Grievous briefly fights Maul and wins, forcing him to flee. Later, Grievous and Dooku are lured into a trap by Maul and his minions, and are taken prisoner in order to draw out Sidious. However, Grievous soon escapes and rejoins Sidious, who orders Grievous to attack Dathomir again, where Maul and Talzin are planning using Dooku as a sacrifice to restore Talzin to full strength. Sidious fights Talzin while Grievous duels Maul again. Maul eventually overpowers Grievous and Force-pushes him through a wall. Grievous quickly reappears, however, and after Sidious and Dooku have subdued Talzin (who has thrown Maul out of the battle to save his life), Grievous stabs her through the chest with his lightsabers, killing her.

In the novel ''Labyrinth of Evil'', Grievous plans an invasion of Coruscant alongside Dooku and Sidious. He first appears in the novel watching his hated subordinate [[Nute Gunray]] flee from a pursuant Republic Strike Force. Grievous reluctantly saves Gunray by destroying the fighters. Grievous' invasion of the planet Belderone would also be thwarted by Skywalker and Kenobi due to a careless mistake on Gunray's part. Though Gunray resorts to lies, Grievous deduces that the Neimoidian is lying and threatens to kill him. Later on the bridge of the ''Invisible Hand'', Dooku watches as Grievous spars his elite Magnaguards. Though Grievous wins the fight, Dooku points out several flaws in the general's technique while realizing he is partly to blame for the general's inadequacies. Grievous soon launches his invasion on the Republic capital of Coruscant in an attempt to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, placing himself on the battlefield once again. During the invasion, Grievous battles Mace Windu while personally trying to capture Palpatine. Though Windu overwhelms Grievous in combat, the cyborg outwits the Jedi Guard and takes Palpatine hostage.

===Video games===
General Grievous has appeared in the video games ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (video game)|Revenge of the Sith]]'' video game.

Grievous next appears in the video game ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''. Following the establishment of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtroopers]] take Grievous' living head, and place it in his body, transforming him to a droid.  This war droid has a brief life in the Myyydril Caverns on [[Kashyyyk]] before being destroyed by an anonymous group of spacers. The combatants loot the droid's remains, taking its weaponry and anything else of value. The facemask ends up on the Invisible Market, where it is purchased for its artistic properties by a high-ranking Imperial admiral &amp;mdash; purported to be none other than [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]].&lt;ref name="Star Wars: Galaxies"&gt;''[[Star Wars: Galaxies]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Grievous also makes a very brief appearance in ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]'', when Delta Squad almost catches him boarding his starship to an "unknown" planet. Earlier, on Geonosis, after killing Sun Fac, a ship looking similar to Grievous' flies away. The squad notes the ship as not being Geonosian. Grievous makes his next appearance in ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|Lego Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', featured as a boss and an unlockable, playable character in free play mode. He is also playable in free play mode in ''[[Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]'' by accessing a save file of ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|Lego Star Wars]]''.

Grievous appears as a playable character in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Lightsaber Duels]]''. Grievous also appears as a playable character in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron]]''. Unlike ''Star Wars: Battlefront II'', in the DS version, he can use his four arms at the cost of force points instead of just two at the end of an attack.

Grievous is also a boss villain in several mini games of the online game ''Clone Wars Adventures''.

Grievous, as an evil pig, is a playable character in ''[[Angry Birds Star Wars II]]''.

In ''[[Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]'', General Grievous is featured as a boss in story mode and an unlockable, playable character in free play mode.

Grievous is also a collectible, playable character in the [[mobile game|mobile]] [[turn-based]] [[role-playing game]], ''[[Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes]]'', introduced weeks after the game was released.  He is described to be a vicious Separatist attacker with unavoidable attacks that cannot be countered, intimidates his enemies with decreased offense and debuffs and can force allies to taunt when his health is low.  

Grievous also appears as a playable Dark Side Squad leader in the mobile [[MOBA]] ''[[Star Wars: Force Arena]]''.

Grievous will be a playable character as part of an upcoming Clone Wars season for ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]'' beginning on October 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/9/17444782/star-wars-battlefront-ii-updates-clone-wars-anakin-skywalker-obi-wan-kenobi-solo-kessel-dlc |title=Star Wars Battlefront II updates will let players fight in the Clone Wars |last=Liptak |first=Andrew |date=9 June 2018 |access-date=10 June 2018 |work=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hood |first=Vic |title=The Clone Wars are coming to Star Wars Battlefront 2 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/clone-wars-coming-star-wars-battlefront-2/ |date=9 June 2018 |access-date=10 June 2018 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3244">'''George I Ghisi''' ({{lang-it|Giorgio Ghisi}}) (died 15 March 1311) was a [[Latinokratia|Latin]] feudal lord in medieval [[Greece]]. 

A son of [[Bartholomew I Ghisi]], through his first marriage to a daughter of [[Guy II of Dramelay]] he was [[Baron of Chalandritsa]] in the [[Principality of Achaea]]. In 1292, he was also named as [[castellan]] of [[Kalamata]].&lt;ref name="Bon"&gt;Bon (1969), pp. 234–235, 459&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, following a series of destructive raids in the Greek and Latin-held islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Aragon]]ese admiral [[Roger of Lauria]] led his fleet to anchor at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. Fearful lest the Aragonese seize possession of lands in Achaea, or repeat their plundering raids, and with Prince [[Florent of Hainaut]] absent in Italy, George assembled two hundred knights at [[Androusa]] and attacked the Aragonese. In a brief but bloody combat, the Achaeans were defeated and George captured, only to be ransomed for 8,000 ''[[hyperpyra]]'' shortly after when the Aragonese fleet sailed to [[Glarentsa]].&lt;ref&gt;Bon (1969), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1908), pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1303, when his father died, he inherited the lordship of the Aegean islands of [[Tinos]], [[Mykonos]], with fiefs on [[Serifos]] and [[Keos]].&lt;ref name="Bon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Setton"&gt;Setton (1975), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Through his second wife, [[Alice dalle Carceri]], he also became [[Triarchy of Negroponte|triarch of Negroponte]] ([[Euboea]]). He was killed in the [[Battle of the Cephissus]] against the [[Catalan Company]] in 1311. His wife Alice died in 1313.&lt;ref name="Bon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Setton"/&gt;

'''Georg August Friedrich Hermann Schulz'''&lt;ref name="Stettin_1893_1934"/&gt; (9 October 1893 – 25 September 1946), better known as '''Heinrich George''' ({{IPA-de|geˈɔɐ̯ gə|pronounced}}), was a German stage and film actor.

==Career==

===Weimar Republic===
George is noted for having spooked the young [[Bertolt Brecht]] in his first directing job, a production of [[Arnolt Bronnen]]'s ''Parricide'' (1922), when he refused to continue working with the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thomson | first = Peter | last2 = Sacks | first2 = Glendyr | title = The Cambridge Companion to Brecht | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1994 | edition = 2 | pages = 22–39  | isbn = 0-521-41446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played in [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) and
''[[Dreyfus (1930 film)|Dreyfus]]'' (1930).  In 1931, he starred in ''[[Berlin-Alexanderplatz (1931 film)|Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (1931).

George was an active member of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist party]] during the Weimar Republic.&lt;ref name="FilmReference.com"&gt;{{cite web |first=Josef |last=Škvorecký |title=JUD SÜSS |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Jo-Ko/Jud-S-ss.html |access-date=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked with theatre director  [[Erwin Piscator]] and playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]], both of whom identified with the political left.  George starred in the lead role of the film ''[[Berlin-Alexanderplatz (1931 film)|Berlin-Alexanderplatz]]'' (1931).

On 12 October 1932, he changed his legal name to his stage name ''George''.&lt;ref name="Stettin_1893_1934"&gt;{{cite web |title=Transscription of birth certificate of Georg August Friedrich Hermann Schulz, born 1893-10-09 |id=3600 |publisher=Civil registry, Stettin (Szczecin), Poland |language=German |location=Stettin |orig-year=1893-10-14 |date=1934-11-05 |url=http://www.szczecin.ap.gov.pl/media/arch/65/672/0/01/147/65_672_0_01_147_0266.jpg |access-date=2016-06-27}} (NB.

===Nazi era===

After the Nazi takeover, George was classified as a "non-desirable" actor at first because of his earlier political affiliations and was thus barred from working in cinematic productions. However, he was eventually able to reach an accommodation with the Nazi regime.  In 1937, George was designated as a ''[[State actor (Germany)|Staatsschauspieler]]'' (i.e. an actor of national importance) and in 1938 was appointed director of the [[Schiller Theater]] in Berlin.  George actively collaborated with the Nazis and agreed to star in Nazi propaganda films such as ''[[Hitlerjunge Quex (film)|Hitler Youth Quex]]'' (1933), ''[[Jud Süß (1940 film)|Jud Süß]]'' (1940), and ''[[Kolberg (film)|Kolberg]]'' (1945) as well as appearing in numerous newsreels.

George had a stocky build and a Berlin accent which made him readily recognizable to German audiences.  George's prestige as a leading actor of the day made him an "extraordinarily valuable catch for the Nazis."&lt;ref name="Fritzsche2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Fritzsche|title=Life and death in the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhKS43P5TiEC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=2 November 2011|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02793-0|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cooke and Silberman describe him as "the actor most closely tied with fascist fantasies of the autocratic and the populist leader".&lt;ref name="CookeSilberman2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooke|first1=Paul|last2=Silberman|first2=Marc|title=Screening war: perspectives on German suffering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1MdufwL9QgC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=30 July 2010|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-437-0|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==

Although Heinrich George had been a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] before the Nazi takeover, he was nonetheless interned as a Nazi collaborator at the [[NKVD special camp Nr. 7|Soviet concentration camp]] in [[Sachsenhausen (Oranienburg)|Sachsenhausen]] where he died in 1946.&lt;ref name="FuchsCosgrove2006"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Anne |last1=Fuchs |first2=Mary |last2=Cosgrove |first3=Georg |last3=Grote |title=German memory contests: the quest for identity in literature, film, and discourse since 1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDO8cAyRFl4C&amp;pg=PA199|accessdate=30 October 2011 |year=2006 |publisher=Camden House |isbn=978-1-57113-324-3 |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of his death was starvation, even though official reports stated that he died "after an [[appendectomy|appendix]] operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Neimi | first = Robert | title = History in the Media: Film and Television | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2006 | page = 6 | isbn = 978-1-57607-952-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Henry Dominic Miller''' (18 December 1968 – 2 May 2003) was a Welsh cameraman, producer, and director, and recipient of numerous awards, including five [[Emmy Award]]s. He was killed by a soldier from the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF).

&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller worked regularly with [[Saira Shah]] for several years, and they formed a business partnership to operate an independent production company called Frostbite Productions in 2001.

The soldier who shot him was identified as Captain Hib al-Heib, a Bedouin Arab in the IDF.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Military Police Corps (Israel)|Israeli Military Police]] investigation into Miller's death closed on 9 March 2005 with an announcement that the soldier suspected of firing the shot would not be indicted as they could not establish that his shot was responsible, though he would be disciplined for violating the rules of engagement and for changing his account of the incident.&lt;ref name=CPJ&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2006, the [[inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]] jury at [[St Pancras Coroner's Court]] in London returned a verdict of [[unlawful killing]], finding that Miller had been "murdered."&lt;ref name=Tryhorn/&gt; Forensic experts from [[London Metropolitan Police]] concluded that the bullets were consistent with those used by the IDF. After meetings with the Miller family, the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]], sent a formal request to his [[Attorney General of Israel|Israeli counterpart]] in June 2007 for prosecution proceedings to be enacted within six weeks against the soldier responsible for firing the shot.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; The requests were ignored by the Israeli government and prosecution proceedings have never been held.

== Early life and family ==

James Miller was born in [[Haverfordwest]], [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]] the younger son of Geoffrey Miller, an army officer who later rose to the rank of colonel, and his wife, Eileen, a headmistress. He grew up in the [[West Country]], but from ages six to eight lived in the [[Outer Hebrides]], where his father was posted. Raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], he maintained that faith for the whole of his life.&lt;ref name=obit-G/&gt; He was educated at [[Downside School|Downside]] and later at the [[London College of Communication|London College of Printing]], where within a few weeks his tutors promoted him to the postgraduate course in photo-journalism. He worked as a photographer before moving to television.&lt;ref name=obit-I&gt;{{cite news

==Career==

Miller started his working life as a freelance cameraman, and in 1995 joined the [[Frontline Television News|Frontline News]] collective as cameraman, producer, and director.&lt;ref name=obit-G /&gt; He reported from the [[Algerian Civil War|civil war in Algeria]] and from most of the world's major trouble spots from 1995 onwards, working for [[CNN]], and for all the leading news broadcasters in Britain.&lt;ref name=obit-I /&gt;

In 1999 he made his first film for [[Hardcash Productions]], ''Prime Suspects'', about a massacre in [[Kosovo]] for [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' programme. This film won the [[Royal Television Society]] (RTS) award for International Current Affairs in 1999.&lt;ref name=RTS-1999&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every film he made for Hardcash won major awards.&lt;ref name=obit-G /&gt; ''Prime Suspects'' was followed by ''Dying for the President'' about the [[Second Chechen War]] and ''[[Children of the Secret State]]'' about Korea, both also for ''Dispatches''.

Miller then formed a professional association with television reporter [[Saira Shah]], to make ''Beneath the Veil'', about the life of women in [[Taliban]]-run [[Afghanistan]]. This film, shown on ''Dispatches'' and CNN, repeated the success of ''Prime Suspects'' by again winning the RTS International Current Affairs award.&lt;ref name=RTS-2000-01&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and Shah's second film, ''Unholy War'', shot at the height of the [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Afghanistan war]] in 2001, won Miller his first Emmy as director and (together with ''Beneath the Veil'') also the prestigious [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] award.&lt;ref name=obit-G /&gt; Miller and Shah almost died of sub-zero temperatures while crossing the [[Hindu Kush]] during the making of this film.&lt;ref name=obit-G /&gt; Frostbite Films was the name of the independent film production company set up by Miller and Shah in 2001 after this experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Miller and Shah were working on a documentary for the American cable network [[HBO]] at the time of his death. The resulting film, ''[[Death in Gaza]]'', was released in 2004, and won three Emmys and one BAFTA TV award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After Miller's death, his friend [[Fergal Keane]] wrote: "James Miller was one of the finest journalistic talents I have ever known. Had he lived he would undoubtedly have come to be recognised as one of the greatest documentary makers of his generation.

==Death==

The documentary which Miller was making on the day of his death (''[[Death in Gaza]]'', released by [[HBO]] in 2004) depicts Miller and his colleagues leaving the home of a Palestinian family in the [[Rafah refugee camp]] after dark, carrying a [[white flag]]. They had walked about 20 metres from the veranda when the first shot rang out.&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite news|title=Silenced Witnesses |author=John Sweeney |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=30 October 2003 |accessdate=22 August 2007 |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article93639.ece |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329072712/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article93639.ece |archivedate=29 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For 13 seconds, there was silence broken only by Shah's cry: "We are British journalists." Then came the second shot, which killed Miller. He was shot in the front of his neck.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt; The soldiers who shot him were members of the [[Bedouin]] Desert Reconnaissance Battalion. According to a forensic expert, the fatal shot was fired from less than 200 metres away.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt; Immediately after the shooting, the IDF said that Miller had been shot in the back during [[crossfire]]. It later retracted the assertion that he had been shot in the back. According to witnesses there was no crossfire and none can be heard on the [[Associated Press Television News|APTN]] tape.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt;

An IDF spokesperson made the following statement after Miller's death: "The IDF expresses sorrow at the death of the cameraman who entered a combat zone. Cameramen who knowingly enter a combat zone endanger themselves as well as the troops, and clearly run the risk of being caught in the crossfire."&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalist killed covering Gaza clash: Cameraman was honored for Afghanistan documentaries|author=Kelley Wallace|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=3 May 2003|accessdate=22 August 2007|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/05/03/cameraman.killed/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; An IDF spokesperson described the circumstances of his death as occurring during "an operation taking place at night, in which the [Israeli] force was under fire and in which the force returned fire with light weapons."&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;

[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] spokesman, Captain Jacob Dallal said, "Our forces found a tunnel at the house in question, when an [[anti-tank missile]] was fired at them. They shot back at the source of the attack ... James Miller was apparently hit during that exchange. The Israeli military expresses sorrow at a civilian death, but it must be stressed that a cameraman who knowingly enters a combat zone, especially at night, endangers himself."&lt;ref name=Haaretz-2003-05-04&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; announcing that the soldier believed responsible for the shooting would not be indicted.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; The army said [[Military Police Corps (Israel)|Military Police]] had carefully investigated the incident but had been unable to establish the soldier's guilt.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; "The findings of the military police show that an Israel Defense Forces lieutenant, the commanding officer of the IDF force at the site, allegedly fired his weapon in breach of IDF [[Rules of engagement]]," a statement said.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; "However, it is not legally possible to link this shooting to the gunshot sustained by Mr. Miller."&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt; The army did say that the soldier would be disciplined for violating the rules of engagement and for changing his account of the incident. It did not elaborate.&lt;ref name=CPJ/&gt;

Miller's family expressed disappointment at the decision. His widow Sophy said, "Nothing can express our outrage that, waiting for two years and putting our faith in a system which has now failed to deliver, we still have prosecutors who suspect and continue to suspect a commanding officer and who will only bring disciplinary measures because of an initial flawed investigative process. The truth will come out and we hope the Israeli judicial system will mete out justice.

=== Legal action against Israeli government ===

On 2 May 2005, the second anniversary of Miller's death, his family initiated a [[lawsuit]] against the Israeli government. The family charge that the Israeli army did not act with reasonable caution when troops opened fire on Miller, who was holding a white flag. Miller's widow Sophy said the family was determined to find justice and put an end to the "culture of impunity" within the Israeli army. "It is our hope that as well as accountability for James' death a successful civil case will go some way towards changing this and in doing so may make Israeli soldiers think twice about shooting innocent civilians," she told The Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate = 26 August 2007
| location=London
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two years later, on 5 August 2007, the family's lawyer, [[Michael Sfard]], said, "The family demands justice, both criminal and civil. They deserve that the man who shot their loved one for no reason whatsoever should be indicted and get what he deserves. As he left a widow and two children, they deserve to be compensated by the State of Israel. This is something the political and military echelons have promised time and again, but they have not fulfilled their promise so far."&lt;ref name=Independent-2007-08-06 /&gt;

On 1 February 2009 it was reported that James Miller's family have accepted a £1.5 million payout from Israel. In a statement, the family did not confirm the amount paid but did say that it was "probably the closest we'll get to an admission of guilt on the part of the Israelis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/7863828.stm | work=BBC News | title=Shot Briton's family 'gets £1.5m' | date=1 February 2009 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coroner's inquest==

The [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] into Miller's death opened at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] [[Coroner]]'s Court in London on 3 April 2006.

Giving evidence at the inquest, Miller's wife Sophy named the Israeli soldier who shot her husband as First Lieutenant Haib from the Bedouin Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, who was commanding a unit at the time of the killing on 2 May 2003.&lt;ref name=BBC-2006-04-03&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate = 26 August 2007
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; She said that the IDF had given out misleading information from the moment her husband was shot, and that Lt. Haib had given six testimonies, all of which were conflicting.&lt;ref name=BBC-2006-04-03/&gt; Despite advice from the Israeli [[Military Advocate General]] that he be disciplined for breaching the rules of engagement, illegal use of weapons and misconduct during the investigation, he was acquitted by Brigadier General Guy Tzur, the head of the army's [[Southern Command (Israel)|Southern Command]].&lt;ref name=BBC-2006-04-03/&gt;

Footage of Miller's death was shown to an unnamed Israeli soldier who was quoted as saying that members of the IDF should not fire unless they felt they were under threat. He was quoted as saying: "There is no chance that it was an accident – the soldier could clearly see him, it was a perfect shot. I do not know what to say, it looks like murder, it looks like he wants to kill him."&lt;ref name=Times-2006-04-04 /&gt;

The court heard that an autopsy proved that Miller died from a "classic sniper's shot", and that the bullet was consistent with that used by the IDF.&lt;ref name=DT-2006-04-04&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Independent investigator Chris Cobb-Smith, who had previously served in the [[British Army]] and as an [[United Nations Special Commission|Iraq weapons inspector]], found there was no way the soldier fired by accident. He told the court, "This was calculated and cold-blooded murder, without a shadow of a doubt."&lt;ref name=BBC-2006-04-04&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; He added, "These shots were not fired by a soldier who was frightened, not fired by a soldier facing incoming fire – these were slow, deliberate, calculated and aimed shots ...

He should not have been firing anywhere near a lit building, anywhere near where he knew there were women, children or foreign journalists."&lt;ref name=Times-2006-04-04&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Edge, Miller's assistant producer, (who narrowly escaped being shot himself during the same incident) said Israeli soldiers put pressure on him to say that the shot came from Palestinians. He told the inquest: "They personally tried to get me to say the sentence 'James could have been shot by a Palestinian', which I refused to say."&lt;ref name=DT-2006-04-04/&gt;

On 6 April 2006, the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, finding that he had been "murdered".&lt;ref name=Tryhorn/&gt; Miller's family asked that the British government ensure his killer is prosecuted, accusing the Israeli authorities of "an abject failure to uphold the fundamental and unequivocal standards of international humanitarian and human rights law."&lt;ref name=Tryhorn/&gt;

==Request for prosecution==

In June 2007, [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]], the then outgoing [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], sent a request to his [[Attorney General of Israel|Israeli counterpart]] for legal proceedings to be enacted within six weeks to prosecute the soldier responsible for the killing.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt; The request included new analysis of audio evidence which confirmed that the shot that killed Miller was fired from an Israeli [[armored personnel carrier]].&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt;

Miller's sister, Anne Waddington, was interviewed by the BBC on the morning of 7 August 2007, the day the six-week deadline was due to expire. She said, "Unfortunately, we have had four and a half extremely painful years of experiencing the Israeli tactics, and they are the masters of delay – they have always played for time, and they have always failed to deliver." She added, "The Israelis put out a lot of false and misleading statements immediately after my brother was murdered, and they did try to suggest he was killed by a Palestinian in the back and as a result of crossfire, but they put out many, many lies and false stories, which of course have been shown not only on the APTN video footage of the actual murder, but also through eyewitness testimony and the additional evidence which was very, very clear at the time." Asked whether she used the word "murder" very deliberately, she replied, "Yes I do, and of course the jury in the inquest last year found, very unusually, that it wasn't just unlawful killing, it was actually murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 2007, the Israeli Attorney General, [[Menachem Mazuz]], requested more information on the new analysis.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt; After being informed of his response, Miller's family issued a statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are very pleased that General {{sic}} Mazuz has replied within the time limit set out in Lord Goldsmith's letter. This information has for the most part been in the possession of the Israeli investigators for more than four years.
We will look on with interest to see whether Israel will seek to undermine the expertise of the Metropolitan Police's acoustic examination, or perhaps this will be the first significant step towards Israel pursuing justice.&lt;ref name=CK-2007-08-08&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the request of Miller's family, Lord Goldsmith agreed to ask the UK Crown Prosecution Service to advise "on whether there is enough evidence for a prosecution in the UK under the [[Geneva Conventions]] Act in which case the UK government could request extradition."&lt;ref name=CK-2007-08-08/&gt; Eventually, the Israeli government agreed to pay the Miller family ₤1.75 million, if the British government agreed to close the case, and not demand the [[extradition]] of the Israeli soldiers involved in his killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frenkel |first=Sheera |title=Israel to pay ₤1.75m to family of James Miller in deal over killers |journal=The Times |issue=23 April |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3797726.ece |accessdate=13 December 2008 | location=London | date=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janani Suraksha Yojana''' ('''JSY''') ({{lang-hi|जननी सुरक्षा योजना|translation=Mother Security Scheme}}) is an Indian Government scheme proposed by the [[Government of India]]. It was launched on 12 April 2005 by the [[Prime Minister of India]] on the birth anniversary of [[Kasturba Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrhm.maharashtra.gov.in/schjsy.htm Janani Suraksha Yojana - NRHM | Government of Maharashtra]&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to decrease the neo-natal and maternal [[deaths]] happening in the country by promoting [[institutional]] delivery of babies. This is a safe motherhood intervention under the [[National Rural Health Mission]] (NRHM).&lt;ref name="NHRM"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Health Mission, Government of India|url=http://nrhm.gov.in/nrhm-components/rmnch-a/maternal-health/janani-suraksha-yojana/background.html|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a 100% centrally sponsored scheme it integrates cash assistance with delivery and post-delivery care. The success of the scheme would 
be determined by the increase in institutional delivery among the poor families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ayushmanbharat.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/JSR.pdf Janani Suraksha Yojana| Features &amp; Frequently Asked Questions &amp; Answers]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Delaney had a lifelong history of helping others,&lt;ref name="CFHOF"/&gt; and once paid for the funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service.&lt;ref name="Deriso"/&gt; On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]],&lt;ref name="Althaus 139"/&gt; went with friends to Critter's Creek, an amusement center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work.&lt;ref name="Deriso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CFHOF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Althaus 139"&gt;Althaus, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The water hole, which covered two [[acres]] and was six feet deep,&lt;ref name="Deriso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reilly"&gt;{{cite web | title=No ordinary Joe | last=Reilly | first=Rick | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/rick_reilly/news/2003/07/01/reilly0707/ | work=Sports Illustrated | date=2003-07-03 | accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was not intended for swimming but to add to the park's [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref name="Deriso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Althaus 140"&gt;Althaus, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his inability to swim,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', July 1, 1983, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children.&lt;ref name="Vernellis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sangamino"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiefs should pause to honor a hero |last=Sangamino |first=Pat |url=http://www.kfoxtv.com/sh/sports/columnist/stories/columnists-89126020010726-140730.html |work=[[KFOX-TV]] ([[El Paso, Texas]]) |date=2001-07-26 |accessdate=2008-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202174753/http://www.kfoxtv.com/sh/sports/columnist/stories/columnists-89126020010726-140730.html |archivedate=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One child managed to get out of the water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child.&lt;ref name="Deriso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CFHOF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Althaus 140"/&gt; The amusement park has since been closed to the public.&lt;ref name="Deriso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CFHOF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Althaus 139" /&gt;

'''Joseph Amberg''' (1892 – September 30, 1935) was a New York mobster who, with his brothers [[Hyman Amberg|Hyman]] and [[Louis Amberg|Louis "Pretty" Amberg]], was involved in labor racketeering and other criminal activities. During the 1920s and 1930s the brothers competed with rivals such as [[Jacob Shapiro|Jacob "Gurrah" Shapiro]], [[Louis Buchalter|Louis "Lepke" Buchalter]], [[Abe Reles|Abe "Kid Twist" Reles]] and the [[Shapiro Brothers]]. On September 30, 1935, Amberg was murdered alongside associate [[Morris Kessler]].

'''Kandanisseri Vattomparambil Velappan Ayyappan''' (9 July 1923 – 2 June 2010) or '''V. V. Ayyappan''', better known by his [[nom de plume]] '''Kovilan''', was a [[Malayalam language]] novelist and freedom fighter from [[Kerala state]], [[South India]]. He is considered as one of the most prolific writers of contemporary Indian literature.&lt;ref name="hindu_feb05"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/17/stories/2005021704391300.htm|title=Nirmal Verma, Kovilan elected Sahitya Academy Fellows |date=17 February 2005|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, he had authored 11 novels, 10 collections of short stories, three essays and a play. Though the settings of his stories varied from military camps in frozen [[Himalayas]] to obscure village in [[Thrissur]], he brought to bear a universal dimension on them transcending the limitations of space and time. Though initially he was branded as a writer of military stories, Kovilan soon proved that he looked at life with its varied dimensions. His works like ''Thottangal'', ''A Minus B'' and ''Ezhamedangal'' reflected the existential dilemmas of human beings instead of depicting mere external situations and realities in a linear mode. But Kovilan received the highest critical appreciation for his later work ''Thattakam'', a powerful and poignant portrayal of generations of people in his ancestral hamlet.

He won the [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1972 and 1977 and the [[Sahitya Akademi Award|Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1998. He was also a recipient of the [[Kerala]] state government's highest literary honour [[Ezhuthachan Puraskaram]] in recognition of his outstanding contribution to [[Malayalam literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/29/stories/2007012908920500.htm|title=Ezhuthachan Puraskaram presented to writer Kovilan|date=29 January 2007|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a Fellow of the [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi]] since 1997 and [[Sahitya Akademi]] since 2005.&lt;ref name="hindu_feb05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hindu_may05"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/05/03/stories/2005050307200400.htm|title=A moment of honour for writer-patriarch Kovilan |date=3 May 2005|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early years===
Kovilan was born in Kandanassery in [[Guruvayur]], [[Thrissur]] to Vattomparambil Shanku Velappan and Kotakkattil Kunjandi Kali. He did his early education at the Kandanisseri Excelsior School and Nenmini Higher Elementary School. He then joined the Sahitya Deepika Sanskrit College at Pavaratty at the age of 13. He had the good fortune to attend classes by the scholars like [[K. P. Narayana Pisharody]], P. C. Vasudevan Elayathu, [[M. P. Sankunni Nair]], [[Cherukadu]] and Srikrishna Sharma. Even as a student, he had shown interest in writing poems and stories. As a budding writer, poetry was Kovilan's primary passion. But life and time of his adolescence – the oppressive colonial and feudal rule, the casteist social milieu, widespread rural poverty that climaxed in stark famine during the war years, the agony of fracturing familial and social bonds and the inner urge to rebel maturing into politically conscious militancy – compelled him to switch over to fiction as a wider arena of self-expression.

A staunch follower of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], Kovilan left the Sanskrit College to participate in the [[Quit India Movement]]. That marked the end of his formal academic education. By the time he quit, he had written at least three novels.

===Military life===
He joined the [[Royal Indian Navy]] in 1943 and was trained in Anti-submarine Detecting Operations. He served in Bengal sea, [[Burma]] and Singapore. He quit following the [[Royal Indian Navy mutiny]] of 1946 and returned home. While back in Kerala, Kovilan maintained a close friendship with [[Vaikom Muhammed Basheer]], [[Joseph Mundassery]] and C. J. Thomas. He also took part in the trade union movements. In 1948 he passed [[SSLC]] and worked for a while as a [[stenographer]] for Joseph Mundassery. In 1948, he joined the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals]] as Radio Mechanic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=The Hindu
|accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also specialised in electronics. For five years he lived in the [[Himalayas]]. While in army, he came in contact with soldier-turned-writers [[Parappurath]] and [[Nandanar]]. He also worked as [[National Cadet Corps (India)|National Cadet Corps]] training officer at the [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]]. He retired from the [[Indian Army]] in 1968 as [[Havildar]] Major and settled down at Pullanikunnu at Kandanassery.

===Death===
Kovilan died on 2 June 2010 in [[Kunnamkulam]], aged 86.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/english/news.php?id=92577|title=Noted novelist Kovilan passes away|date=2 June 2010|publisher=[[Mathrubhumi]]|accessdate=2 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606105022/http://www.mathrubhumi.com/english/news.php?id=92577|archivedate=6 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was suffering from some respiratory problems. His wife Sarada predeceased him in 1999. They had three children: Vijaya, Ajithan and Amitha. His grand daughters are Dr. Arya Ajith Vattamparambil who works at [[Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre|Amrita Medical College]], [[Ernakulam]] and Pournima Jayaprakash who is practising law in [[Attingal]].

==Writings==
Kovilan, who led a simple life, is considered as one of the most prolific writers of contemporary [[Indian literature]]. His works stand apart by originality in their themes, sharp characterisation and style. In all, he had authored 11 novels, 10 collections of short stories, three essays and a play.

Kovilan has written 4 novels—''A Minus B'' (1958), ''Ezhamedangal'' (Army Wives, 1965), ''Thazhvarakal'' (The Valleys, 1969) and ''Himalayam''—with military experiences as their background. ''A Minus B'' was originally published in a weekly. However, not satisfied with the output, Kovilan dismantled and rewrote the novel. ''A Minus B'' brought Malayalam novel to new heights. This was the first Malayalam novel with characters from every part of India. In its portrayal of life in a military barrack, it doesn't have a central character or a conventional beginning or end. The novel was translated into English by N. Kunji and was published by [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi]], [[Thrissur]]. ''Ezhamedangal'', ''Thazhvarakal'' and ''Himalayam'' can be considered as a trilogy. Set against the impending [[Sino-Indian War]] the characters in these novels encounter the ontological questions of life and death in their own way with an apocalyptic urgency. The archetypal image of dancing Siva, synchronised in line and space with the deluging war, is invoked in ''Himalayam'' through a complex architecture and a distilled poetic diction. The cosmic dimensions of this trilogy still elude the literary pundits.

''Thottangal'' (Incantations, 1970), the first post-service novel of the writer, narrates the delirious memories of an old woman in the night of her death whose life was shipwrecked turning the dreams of her childhood into nightmares. Bharathan, the protagonist in ''Bharathan'', published during the prevalence of the [[Emergency (India)|Emergency]], is a historical metaphor that incises the sociopolitical realities of post-independent India. Bharathan is implicated, persecuted an tried in a mock court of establishment and sentenced to the destined death. The novelist cruelly reveals that the wages of innocence in our pseudo society is nothing lesser than its elimination.

His most popular novel was ''Thattakam'' (The Terrain, 1995). A grand narrative of epic dimension it is the saga of a land and its people, its mythical genesis and long sojourn into a civil society. The novel unfolds itself through umpteen anecdotes sprouting from [[legend]]s, [[oracle]]s, [[revelation]]s, [[fantasy|fantasies]] and historical events themselves. The narrative invents its own time and space that allows free passage of countless generations across the past, the present and the future. The novel won him national recognition with the [[Sahitya Akademi Award|Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1998. It was described in the fellowship citation as "a saga of a land and its people, its mythical genesis and long sojourn to reach a civil society. The novel unfolds itself through innumerable anecdotes sprouting from legends, oracles, revelations, fantasies and historical events. Its structure closely follows the magic of loosely connected episodes being integrated into a meta-narrative, reminiscent of the great Indian epics. The narrative invents its own time and space that allows free passage of countless generations across the past, the present and the future. In this mission, Kovilan develops a linguistic symphony that blends the dialects and language of myriad social strata. Thattakam will certainly leave its reader spellbound to muse over the super-human imagination and artistic stamina that its author is endowed with."

Kovilan's first collection of short stories was ''Oru Palam Manayola'' (A Measure of Red Arsenic). This book was published in the year 1957. The story ''Tharavadu'' (Ancestral Home) is included in this collection. Kovilan's other collections of short stories include ''Ee Jeevitham Ananthamanu'' (1957), ''Orikkal Manushyanayirunnu'' (1960), ''Oru Kashanam Asthi'' (1961), ''Vendam Kadi'' (1969), ''Thervazhchakal'' (1971), ''Pitham'' (1971), ''Shakunam'' (1974), ''Adyathe Kathakal'' (1978), ''Sujatha'' (1979), ''Theranjedutha Kathakal'' (1980) and ''Kovilante Kathakal'' (1985). A tele-serial based on his novel ''Thottangal'' was beamed on [[Doordarshan]]. Some of his short stories also have been adapted for tele-screen.

===Style and recurring themes===
Ever since Kovilan's stories started getting published in the periodicals of the 1950s, critics have marked him as 'unique and original' not only for the power of language and deftness for characterisation but also for choice of themes and intense experiences they sought to convey. Right from his debutant novel ''Thakarnna Hridayangal'' written at the age of 19 he was obsessively vigilant nit to emulate any models, set not only by others but by himself also. While many established Malayalam writers often betrayed their limitations because they hardly had any experience of living outside their immediate environs, Kovilan had hands-on experiences on riddles and dilemmas of human life as much of his youth in military camps as a radio mechanic, far away from home and hearth. Kovilan's characters depicted, subtly, how human dignity and freedom are hallowed out through regimentation, by powers that be in independent India also just as in the [[Colonial India|colonial regime]]. They, however, do not accept their destiny, unquestioned. Kovilan keeps this element of resistance and rebellion in his characters burning. Kovilan's stories that shed light on the lives in and out of military barracks marked a remarkable change in the way stories had been told in [[Malayalam literature]]. Kovilan has written four novels—''A Minus B'', ''Ezhamedangal'', ''Thazhvarakal'' and ''Himalayam''—with military experiences as their background. Apart from the pan-Indian lives and terrains that he introduced, through writings, he restructured the narrative concepts, hitherto familiar to Malayalam fiction. Kovilan jettisoned the idea of linear narrative woven around a [[protagonist]]. He experimented with the new technique of so many characters revealing themselves at so many junctures simultaneously in a cobweb-like narrative pattern.

Kovilan's visions are reflected in his works, right from the choice of the subject to the use of the language and imagery. Even when he shared the concerns of the [[Purogamana Kala Sahitya Sangham|progressive writers movement]] of the state, his sensibilities were radically different. When many of his peers were passionately experimenting with modernist trends in fiction writing, drawing inspiration from popular English and European writers, Kovilan sought his roots and soul, the traditions, culture and language of the common people, the soulful tales and tunes of the community that he lived in, and the countless characters that he encountered in his speckled life. Poverty and hunger had been the primary concerns of the writer. His quest for human dignity and art of telling complex stories in a stunningly simple language were remarkable. Writer and social critic [[Sukumar Azhikode]] once said that the gap between life and literature was very little in Kovilan's works.

Kovilan was a staunch votary of the labour class during his lifetime. Kovilan was always in the forefront in opposing tendencies against democracy. He was as one of the early leaders of the progressive literary movement. Kovilan was a storyteller who embraced leftist humanism and possessed an impressively high degree of social perspective. Kovilan's works had immensely contributed to transforming a community bogged down by conservatism to one that was progressive and socialist in outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/article427903.ece|title=A staunch votary of labour class|date=3 June 2010|work=The New Indian Express|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1977 article titled ''Modernism in the Novel'', Kovilan talked about one of his most important concerns as a writer: "To put a live human being on the post-mortem table in his fundamental state, without his clothes or make-up, to open him up like a frog in the zoology lab, with his chest and abdomen nailed flat, and his heart pounding still, even after the studies – we have not had many such instances in our novels, to show the beats of human character in the raw like this... Hunger is a human being's primary craving... And the war pangs of hunger are the true nature of human beings. The ruckus that happens here in the pretext of ‘modernism' is enough to drown these pangs of hunger. This is not literature, but literary vulgarity." In another article written nearly a decade later, he said: "Dialogues will never become literature. A writer cannot realise the vagaries of human life merely through dialogues. But, human being! It is never a single being. More masquerades than a chameleon. Never-ending masks. As the masks fall off one by one, the story touches you more and more deeply."

Poet and critic [[K. Satchidanandan]] notes: {{cquote|He wrote pure prose, not poetic prose. In an era when prose writers revelled in poetic expressions, Kovilan wrote a prose that was plain and lean. Its beauty was raw and unadorned. Though Kovilan's works were initially categorised as ''Pattala Sahityam'' or soldier's writings, it was clear after the publication of ''Thattakam'' and ''Thottangal'' that they were more than that. Writers seek legends. Kovilan realised that there is a legend behind every man. He sought to document this. He explored the legends of his village. His stories bridged local and regional history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Kovilan a master of pure prose |work=The Hindu | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kovilan-a-master-of-pure-prose/article3622884.ece| date=10 July 2012| accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36789">As '''[[motorboat racing]]''' is a dangerous sport, many individuals (including drivers, crew members, officials and spectators) have been killed in crashes related to the sport, either in a race, in qualifying, in practice or a private testing session.  For example, in [[offshore powerboat racing]], one racer dies each year from accidents.&lt;ref name="sptimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/17/Floridian/Through_troubled_wate.shtml|title=Through troubled waters|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Art and video games}}

'''Machinima''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|ʃ|iː|n|ᵻ|m|ə|,_|-|ˈ|ʃ|ɪ|n|-}}) is the use of real-time [[computer graphics]] engines to create a cinematic production. Most often, [[video game]]s are used to generate the [[computer animation]].

Machinima-based artists, sometimes called '''machinimists''' or '''machinimators''', are often [[fan labor]]ers, by virtue of their re-use of copyrighted materials (see below). Machinima offers to provide an archive of gaming performance and access to the look and feel of software and hardware that may already have become unavailable or even obsolete; for game studies, "Machinima’s gestures grant access to gaming’s historical conditions of possibility and how machinima offers links to a comparative horizon that informs, changes, and fully participates in videogame culture."&lt;ref name="Krapp 2010 160"&gt;{{harvnb|Krapp|2010|loc=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of using graphics engines from [[video games]] arose from the animated software introductions of the 1980s [[demoscene]], [[Disney Interactive Studios]]' [[1992 in video gaming|1992 video game]] ''[[Stunt Island]]'', and 1990s recordings of gameplay in [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) video games, such as [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''. Originally, these recordings documented [[speedrun]]s—attempts to complete a level as quickly as possible—and [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer match]]es. The addition of storylines to these films created "''Quake'' movies". The more general term ''machinima'', a [[portmanteau]] of ''machine cinema'', arose when the concept spread beyond the [[Quake (series)|''Quake'' series]] to other games and software. After this generalization, machinima appeared in mainstream media, including television series and advertisements.

Machinima has advantages and disadvantages when compared to other styles of [[filmmaking]]. Its relative simplicity over [[traditional animation|traditional frame-based animation]] limits control and range of expression. Its real-time nature favors speed, cost saving, and flexibility over the higher quality of pre-rendered computer animation. Virtual acting is less expensive, dangerous, and physically restricted than [[live action]]. Machinima can be filmed by relying on in-game [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) or by controlling characters and cameras through [[digital puppetry]].  Scenes can be precisely scripted, and can be manipulated during [[post-production]] using [[video editing]] techniques. Editing, custom software, and creative [[cinematography]] may address technical limitations. Game companies have provided software for and have encouraged machinima, but the widespread use of [[digital asset]]s from copyrighted games has resulted in complex, unresolved legal issues.

Machinima productions can remain close to their gaming roots and feature stunts or other portrayals of gameplay. Popular genres include dance videos, comedy, and drama. Alternatively, some filmmakers attempt to stretch the boundaries of the rendering engines or to mask the original 3-D context. The [[Academy of Machinima Arts &amp; Sciences]] (AMAS), a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to promoting machinima, recognizes exemplary productions through Mackie awards given at its annual Machinima Film Festival. Some general film festivals accept machinima, and game companies, such as [[Epic Games]], [[Blizzard Entertainment]] and [[Jagex]], have sponsored contests involving it.

==History==

===Precedent===
1980s [[software cracking|software crackers]] added custom introductory credits sequences (intros) to programs whose copy protection they had removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Green|1995|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing computing power allowed for more complex intros, and the [[demoscene]] formed when focus shifted to the intros instead of the cracks.&lt;ref name="Marino 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal became to create the best 3-D demos in real-time with the least amount of software code.&lt;ref name="Marino 2004a, 5; Nitche 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Nitsche|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disk storage was too slow for this; graphics had to be calculated on the fly and without a pre-existing [[game engine]].&lt;ref name="Marino 2004a, 5; Nitche 2007" /&gt;

In [[Disney Interactive Studios]]' [[1992 in video gaming|1992 computer game]] ''[[Stunt Island]]'', users could stage, record, and play back stunts; as Nitsche stated, the game's goal was "not ... a high score but a spectacle."&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Nitsche|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released the following year, [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' included the ability to record gameplay as sequences of events that the game engine could later replay in real-time.&lt;ref name="Marino 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because events and not video frames were saved, the resulting [[game demo]] files were small and easily shared among players.&lt;ref name="Marino 3" /&gt; A culture of recording gameplay developed, as Henry Lowood of [[Stanford University]] called it, "a context for spectatorship.... The result was nothing less than a metamorphosis of the player into a performer."&lt;ref name="Lowood 2006 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important feature of ''Doom'' was that it allowed players to create their own [[mod (computer gaming)|modifications]], [[Level (computer and video games)|map]]s, and software for the game, thus expanding the concept of game authorship.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2005 11"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2005|loc=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In machinima, there is a dual register of gestures: the trained motions of the player determine the in-game images of expressive motion.&lt;ref name="Krapp 2011 93f"&gt;{{harvnb|Krapp|2011|loc=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel of the video game approach, in the media art field, [[Maurice Benayoun]]’s Virtual Reality artwork ''The Tunnel under the Atlantic'' (1995), often compared to video games, introduced a virtual film director, fully autonomous intelligent agent, to shoot and edit in real time a full video from the digging performance in the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Museum of Contemporary art in Montreal. The full movie, ''Inside the Tunnel under the Atlantic'',&lt;ref name="Benayoun 2011 44-49"&gt;{{harvnb|Benayoun|2011|loc=44-49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21h long, was followed in 1997 by ''Inside the Paris New-Delhi Tunnel'' (13h long). Only short excerpts where presented to the public. The complex behavior of the Tunnel’s virtual director makes it a significant precursor of later application to video games based machinimas.&lt;ref name="Benayoun 2011 50-54"&gt;{{harvnb|Benayoun|2011|loc=50-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Doom''{{'}}s 1996 successor, ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', offered new opportunities for both gameplay and customization,&lt;ref name="Lowood 2005 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2005|loc=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; while retaining the ability to record demos.&lt;ref name="Marino 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multiplayer game]]s became popular, almost a sport; demos of matches between teams of players ([[Clan (computer gaming)|clans]]) were recorded and studied.&lt;ref name="Kelland 28"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Marino]], executive director of the AMAS, stated that [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]]es, a type of multiplayer game, became more "cinematic".&lt;ref name="Marino 4" /&gt; At this point, however, they still documented gameplay without a narrative.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2006 33"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Quake'' movies===
[[File:Diary of a Camper.jpg|thumb|A scene from ''[[Diary of a Camper]]'', an early machinima production]]
On October 26, 1996, a well-known gaming clan, the [[United Ranger Films|Rangers]], surprised the ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' community with ''[[Diary of a Camper]]'', the first widely known machinima film.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2006 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This short, 100-second demo file contained the action and gore of many others, but in the context of a brief story,&lt;ref name="Lowood 2006 32" /&gt; rather than the usual deathmatch.&lt;ref name="Kelland 28" /&gt; An example of transformative or [[emergent gameplay]], this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2005|loc=13, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ranger demo emphasized this transformation by retaining specific gameplay references in its story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2005|loc=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Diary of a Camper]]'' inspired many other "''Quake'' movies," as these films were then called.&lt;ref name="Kelland 28" /&gt; A community of game modifiers (modders), artists, expert players, and film fans began to form around them.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2007" /&gt; The works were distributed and reviewed on websites such as The Cineplex, Psyk's Popcorn Jungle, and the Quake Movie Library (QML).&lt;ref name="Marino, 7" /&gt; Production was supported by dedicated demo-processing software, such as Uwe Girlich's Little Movie Processing Center (LMPC) and David "crt" Wright's [[non-linear editing system|non-linear editor]] Keygrip;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=28}}; {{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter became known as "[[Adobe Premiere Pro|Adobe Premiere]] for Quake demo files".&lt;ref name="Marino, 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the notable films were Clan Phantasm's ''Devil's Covenant'',&lt;ref name="Marino, 7" /&gt; the first [[feature length|feature-length]] ''Quake'' movie; Avatar and Wendigo's ''[[Blahbalicious]]'', which the QML awarded seven Quake Movie Oscars;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Machinima.com staff|2001|Ref=CITEREFMachinima.com2001}}; {{harvnb|Heaslip|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Clan Undead's ''[[Operation Bayshield]]'', which introduced simulated [[lip sync]]hronization&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{harvnb|Moss|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured customized [[digital asset]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in December 1997, id Software's ''[[Quake II]]'' improved support for user-created 3-D models. However, without compatible editing software, filmmakers continued to create works based on the original ''Quake''; these included the [[ILL Clan]]'s ''[[Apartment Huntin']]'' and the [[Quake done Quick]] group's ''[[Quake done Quick|Scourge Done Slick]]''.&lt;ref name="Marino 8"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Quake II'' demo editors became available in 1998; in particular, Keygrip 2.0 introduced "recamming", the ability to adjust camera locations after recording.&lt;ref name="Marino 8" /&gt; Paul Marino called the addition of this feature "a defining moment for [m]achinima".&lt;ref name="Marino 8" /&gt; With ''Quake II'' filming now feasible, [[Strange Company]]'s 1999 production ''Eschaton: Nightfall'' was the first work to feature entirely custom-made character models.&lt;ref name="Marino 9"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 1999 release of id's ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' posed a problem to the ''Quake'' movie community.&lt;ref name="Marino 10-11"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's demo file included information needed for [[computer network]]ing; however, to prevent cheating, id warned of legal action for dissemination of the file format.&lt;ref name="Marino 10-11" /&gt; Thus, it was impractical to enhance software to work with ''Quake III''.&lt;ref name="Marino 10-11" /&gt; Concurrently, the novelty of ''Quake'' movies was waning.&lt;ref name="Marino 11"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; New productions appeared less frequently, and, according to Marino, the community needed to "reinvent itself" to offset this development.&lt;ref name="Marino 11" /&gt;

In January 2000, [[Hugh Hancock]], the founder of Strange Company, launched a new website, [[machinima.com]].&lt;ref name="Marino 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new name surprised the community; a misspelled contraction of ''machine cinema'' (''machinema''), the term ''machinima'' was intended to dissociate in-game filming from a specific [[game engine|engine]].&lt;ref name="Marino 12" /&gt; The misspelling stuck because it also referenced [[anime]].&lt;ref name="Marino 12" /&gt; The new site featured tutorials, interviews, articles, and the exclusive release of Tritin Films' ''[[Quad God]]''.&lt;ref name="Marino 12" /&gt; The first film made with ''[[Quake III Arena]]'', ''Quad God'' was also the first to be distributed as recorded video frames, not game-specific instructions.&lt;ref name="Marino 12" /&gt; This change was initially controversial among machinima producers who preferred the smaller size of demo files.&lt;ref name="Kelland 30"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, demo files required a copy of the game to view.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2007" /&gt; The more accessible traditional video format broadened ''Quad God''{{'}}s viewership, and the work was distributed on CDs bundled with magazines.&lt;ref name="Kelland 30" /&gt; Thus, id's decision to protect ''Quake III''{{'}}s code inadvertently caused machinima creators to use more general solutions and thus widen their audience.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 184"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years, machinima films were almost exclusively distributed in common video file formats.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 184" /&gt;

[[File:Hugh Hancock.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hugh Hancock]], the founder of Strange Company and inventor of the term ''machinima'']]
Machinima began to receive mainstream notice.&lt;ref name="Marino 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] discussed it in a June 2000 article and praised Strange Company's machinima setting of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s sonnet "[[Ozymandias]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ebert|2000}}; {{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime Network]]'s 2001 Alternative Media Festival, the [[ILL Clan]]'s 2000 machinima film ''[[Hardly Workin']]'' won the Best Experimental and Best in SHO awards. [[Steven Spielberg]] used ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' to test special effects while working on his [[2001 in film|2001 film]] ''[[Artificial Intelligence: A.I.]]''&lt;ref name="Marino 14-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, interest spread to game developers. In July 2001, [[Epic Games]] announced that its upcoming game ''[[Unreal Tournament 2003]]'' would include Matinee, a machinima production software utility.&lt;ref name="Marino 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As involvement increased, filmmakers released fewer new productions to focus on quality.&lt;ref name="Marino 16" /&gt;

At the March 2002 [[Game Developers Conference]], five machinima makers—Anthony Bailey, Hugh Hancock, [[Katherine Anna Kang]], Paul Marino, and Matthew Ross—founded the AMAS,&lt;ref name="Marino 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting machinima.&lt;ref name="AMAS"&gt;{{harvnb|Academy of Machinima Arts &amp; Sciences|2007|Ref=CITEREFAMAS2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[QuakeCon]] in August, the new organization held the [[2002 Machinima Film Festival|first Machinima Film Festival]], which received mainstream media coverage. ''[[Anachronox: The Movie]]'', by Jake Hughes and Tom Hall, won three awards, including Best Picture.&lt;ref name="Marino 17" /&gt; The next year, "[[In the Waiting Line]]", directed by [[Tommy Pallotta]] and animated by Randy Cole, utilizing Fountainhead Entertainment's Machinimation tools, it became the first machinima music video to air on [[MTV]].&lt;ref name="Marino 18"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As graphics technology improved, machinima filmmakers used other video games and consumer-grade [[video editing software]].&lt;ref name="Marino 19"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[Bungie]]'s 2001 game ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', [[Rooster Teeth Productions]] created a popular comedy series ''[[Red vs. Blue|Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles]]''. The [[Red vs. Blue (season 2)|series' second season]] premiered at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Marino 23"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream appearances===
[[File:South Park machinima.jpg|thumb|A scene from a machinima portion of "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]"]]
Machinima has appeared on television, starting with [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]]'s series ''[[Portal (TV series)|Portal]]''.&lt;ref name="PC Zone 2004, 12"&gt;{{harvnb|''PC Zone'' staff|2004|loc=12|Ref=CITEREFPCZone2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[BBC]] series ''[[Time Commanders]]'', players re-enacted historic battles using [[Creative Assembly]]'s real-time game ''[[Rome: Total War]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland 60, 63"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=60, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV2]]'s ''[[Video Mods]]'' re-creates music videos using characters from video games such as ''[[The Sims 2]]'', ''[[BloodRayne]]'', and ''[[Tribes (series)|Tribes]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 66"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blizzard Entertainment]] helped to set part of "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]", an [[Emmy Award]]–winning 2006 episode of the comedy series ''[[South Park]]'', in its [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.&lt;ref name="Make Love, Not Warcraft"&gt;{{harvnb|Machinima.com staff|2006|Ref=CITEREFMachinima.com2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By purchasing broadcast rights to [[Douglas Gayeton]]'s machinima documentary ''[[Molotov Alva and His Search for the Creator]]'' in September 2007, [[HBO]] became the first television network to buy a work created completely in a [[virtual world]].&lt;ref name="Andrews, 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Andrews|2007|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, machinima.com signed fifteen experienced television comedy writers—including [[Patric Verrone]], [[Bill Oakley]], and [[Mike Rowe]]—to produce episodes for the site.&lt;ref name="Wallenstein 2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Wallenstein|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial use of machinima has increased.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 58-59"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rooster Teeth&lt;/ref&gt;[[Rooster Teeth]] sells [[DVD]]s of their ''Red vs. Blue'' series and, under sponsorship from [[Electronic Arts]], helped to promote ''[[The Sims 2]]'' by using the game to make a machinima series, ''[[The Strangerhood]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 58-59" /&gt; [[Volvo Cars]] sponsored the creation of a 2004 advertisement, ''[[Game: On]]'', the first film to combine machinima and [[live action]].&lt;ref name="Marino 2004b"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Electronic Arts commissioned Rooster Teeth to promote their ''[[Madden NFL 07]]'' video game.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockhouse TV uses  [[Moviestorm]]'s machinima software to produce its pre-school educational DVD series ''[[Jack and Holly]]''

Game developers have continued to increase support for machinima.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill 2007, 2"&gt;{{harvnb|McGraw–Hill|2007|loc=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products such as [[Lionhead Studios]]' 2005 [[business simulation game]] ''[[The Movies]]'', [[Linden Research]]'s virtual world ''[[Second Life]]'', and Bungie's 2007 first-person shooter ''[[Halo 3]]'' encourage the creation of user content by including machinima software tools.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill 2007, 2" /&gt; Using ''The Movies'', Alex Chan, a French resident with no previous filmmaking experience,&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 166"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; took four days to create ''[[The French Democracy]]'', a short political film about the [[2005 civil unrest in France]].&lt;ref name="Musgrove"&gt;{{harvnb|Musgrove|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party mods like ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' usually offer the ability to manipulate characters and take advantage of custom or migrated content, allowing for the creation of works like ''[[Counter-Strike For Kids]]'' that can be filmed using multiple games.

In a 2010 interview with [[PC Magazine]], [[Valve Corporation]] CEO and co-founder [[Gabe Newell]] said that they wanted to make a ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' feature film themselves, rather than hand it off to a big-name director like [[Sam Raimi]], and that their recent ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' "Meet The Team" machinima shorts were experiments in doing just that.&lt;ref name="Newell Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/08/26/valve-want-to-make-the-half-life-movie-themselves/|title=Valve want to make the Half-Life movie themselves|publisher=PC Magazine|date=2010-08-26|author=Jaz McDougall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Valve released their proprietary [[non-linear editing system|non-linear]] machinima software, [[Source Filmmaker]].

Machinima has also been used for music video clips. ''[[Second Life]]'' virtual artist Bryn Oh created a work for Australian performer Megan Bernard's song "Clean Up Your Life",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s07PgUhBr5M&amp;app=desktop|via=YouTube|date=December 31, 2015|title=Megan Bernard - Clean Up Your Life (HD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://windlightmagazine.tumblr.com/post/137150525367/bryn-oh-clean-up-your-life-by-megan-bernard | title=Bryn Oh: Clean up your life by Megan Bernard | work=Windlight Magazine | date=January 12, 2016 | accessdate=June 3, 2016 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brynoh.blogspot.com/2016/01/clean-up-your-life-by-megan-bernard.html |title=Clean up your life by Megan Bernard |date=January 8, 2016 |author=Bryn Oh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224151315/http://brynoh.blogspot.com/2016/01/clean-up-your-life-by-megan-bernard.html |archive-date=2016-02-24 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://kultivatemagazine.com/2016/01/12/bryn-oh-clean-up-your-life-by-megan-bernard/ http://echtvirtuell.blogspot.com/2016/01/bryn-oh-megan-bernard-clean-up-your-life.html--&gt;

==Production==

===Comparison to film techniques===
The AMAS defines machinima as "animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment".&lt;ref name="Marino 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other 3-D animation methods, creators can control every frame and nuance of their characters but, in turn, must consider issues such as [[key frame]]s and [[inbetweening]]. Machinima creators leave many rendering details to their host environments, but may thus inherit those environments' limitations.&lt;ref name="Kelland 19-20"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second Life Machinima film maker Ozymandius King provided a detailed account of the process by which the artists at MAGE Magazine produce their videos. "Organizing for a photo shoot is similar to organizing for a film production. Once you find the actors / models, you have to scout locations, find clothes and props for the models and type up a shooting script. The more organized you are the less time it takes to shoot the scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MAGE Magazine|url = http://0zymandius.wix.com/magemagazine#!MAGE-MAGAZINE-Interview-with-0zymandius-by-Ian-Thomson-Part-2/c112t/55f371e70cf20cc524a6a72d|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because game animations focus on dramatic rather than casual actions, the range of character emotions is often limited. However, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd state that a small range of emotions is often sufficient, as in successful Japanese anime television series.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 78-79"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered.&lt;ref name="Kelland 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models.&lt;ref name="Kelland 24" /&gt; In the 2001 animated film ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them to be treated as a single unit.&lt;ref name="Kelland 24" /&gt; Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism;&lt;ref name="Kelland 27"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, [[Paul Marino]] connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by [[Moore's law]].&lt;ref name="Marino 11"/&gt; For [[cut scene]]s in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken [[suspension of disbelief]] through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.&lt;ref name="Kelland 27" /&gt;

Like live action, machinima is recorded in real-time, and real people can act and control the camera.&lt;ref name="Kelland 22"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McMahan|2005|loc=36–37}}; {{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=347–348, 362}}; {{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as avoiding wide [[field of view|fields of view]], the overuse of [[slow motion]],&lt;ref name="McMahan 2005, 37"&gt;{{harvnb|McMahan|2005|loc=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and errors in [[continuity (fiction)|visual continuity]].&lt;ref name="Kelland, 142"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital [[special effects]] and [[set construction|set]]s, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme.&lt;ref name="Kelland 22" /&gt; Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, and the host environment may allow unrealistic physical constraints.&lt;ref name="Kelland 22" /&gt; [[University of Cambridge]] experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima to re-create a scene from the 1942 live-action film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2009, 114-115"&gt;{{harvnb|Nitsche|2009|loc=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to an unpredictable [[Dogme 95]] production.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2009, 114-115" /&gt;

[[File:ILL Clan presents Tra5hTa1k at Stanford.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[ILL Clan]] performs its machinima comedy talk show ''[[Tra5hTa1k with ILL Will]]'' in front of a live audience at [[Stanford University]] in 2005.]]
Berkeley sees machinima as "a strangely hybrid form, looking forwards and backwards, cutting edge and conservative at the same time".&lt;ref name="Berkeley 2006, 67"&gt;{{harvnb|Berkeley|2006|loc=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machinima is a digital medium based on 3-D computer games, but most works have a linear [[narrative structure]]. Some, such as ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' and ''[[The Strangerhood]]'', follow narrative conventions of television [[situational comedy]].&lt;ref name="Berkeley 2006, 67" /&gt; Nitsche agrees that pre-recorded ("reel") machinima tends to be linear and offers limited interactive storytelling; he sees more opportunities in machinima performed live and with audience interaction.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2005, 223-224"&gt;{{harvnb|Nitsche|2005|loc=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In creating their improvisational comedy series ''[[On the Campaign Trail with Larry &amp; Lenny Lumberjack]]'' and talk show ''Tra5hTa1k with ILL Will'', the [[ILL Clan]] blended real and virtual performance by creating the works on-stage and interacting with a live audience.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2007" /&gt; In another combination of real and virtual worlds, Chris Burke's talk show ''[[This Spartan Life]]'' takes place in ''[[Halo 2]]''{{'}}s open multiplayer environment.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2007" /&gt; There, others playing in earnest may attack the host or his interviewee.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2007" /&gt; Although other virtual theatrical performances have taken place in [[chat room]]s and [[MUD|multi-user dungeon]]s, machinima adds "cinematic camera work".&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2005, 214"&gt;{{harvnb|Nitsche|2005|loc=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, such virtual cinematic performances with live audience interaction were confined to research labs equipped with powerful computers.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2005, 224-225"&gt;{{harvnb|Nitsche|2005|loc=224-225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinima can be less expensive than other forms of filmmaking. Strange Company produced its feature-length machinima film ''[[BloodSpell]]'' for less than [[pound sterling|£]]10,000.&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before using machinima, [[Burnie Burns]] and [[Matt Hullum]] of Rooster Teeth Productions spent [[United States dollar|US$]]9,000 to produce a live-action independent film; in contrast, the four [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game consoles used to make ''Red vs. Blue'' in 2005 cost $600.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2005|loc=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low cost caused a product manager for Electronic Arts to compare machinima to the low-budget [[independent film]] ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', without the need for cameras and actors.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 2" /&gt; Because these are seen as low [[barriers to entry]], machinima has been called a "democratization of filmmaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2005|loc=2}}; {{harvnb|Matlack|Grover|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley weighs increased participation and a blurred line between producer and consumer against concerns that game copyrights limit commercialization and growth of machinima.&lt;ref name="Berkeley 2006, 68-70"&gt;{{harvnb|Berkeley|2006|loc=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparatively, machinimists using pre-made virtual platforms like ''[[Second Life]]'' have indicated that their productions can be made quite successfully with no cost at all. Creators like Dutch director Chantal Harvey, producer of the [[48 Hour Film Project]] Machinima sector, have created upwards of 200 films using the platform.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Harvey's advocacy of the genre has resulted in the involvement of film director [[Peter Greenaway]] who served as a juror for the Machinima category and gave a keynote speech during the event.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Character and camera control===
Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list four main methods of creating machinima.&lt;ref name="Kelland 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; From simple to advanced, these are: relying on the game's AI to control most actions, [[digital puppetry]], recamming, and precise scripting of actions.&lt;ref name="Kelland 80"/&gt; Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script.&lt;ref name="Kelland 82"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Rooster Teeth produced ''[[The Strangerhood]]'' using ''[[The Sims 2]]'', a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods.&lt;ref name="Kelland 82" /&gt; Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.&lt;ref name="Kelland 82" /&gt;

In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each crew member controls a character in real-time, as in a multiplayer game.&lt;ref name="Kelland 87"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director can use built-in camera controls, if available.&lt;ref name="Kelland 87" /&gt; Otherwise, video is captured from the perspectives of one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators.&lt;ref name="Kelland 87" /&gt; Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=87}}; {{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some games, such as the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]], (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2009, 113"&gt;{{harvnb|Nitsche|2009|loc=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies.&lt;ref name="Marino 2004, 351"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2004a|loc=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts ''[[This Spartan Life]]'' in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2007" /&gt; Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's [[improvisational comedy]] series ''On the Campaign Trail with Larry &amp; Lenny Lumberjack'' and Rooster Teeth Productions' ''Red vs. Blue''.&lt;ref name="Nitsche 2009, 114"&gt;{{harvnb|Nitsche|2009|loc=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames.&lt;ref name="Kelland 90"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings.&lt;ref name="Kelland 90-91"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.&lt;ref name="Kelland 91"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A technique common in [[cut scene]]s of video games, scripting consists of giving precise directions to the [[game engine]]. A filmmaker can work alone this way,&lt;ref name="Kelland 94"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; as J. Thaddeus "Mindcrime" Skubis did in creating the nearly four-hour ''[[The Seal of Nehahra]]'' (2000), the longest work of machinima at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Law|2000}}; {{harvnb|Skubis|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, perfecting scripts can be time-consuming.&lt;ref name="Kelland 94" /&gt; Unless what-you-see-is-what-you-get ([[WYSIWYG]]) editing is available, as in ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption]]'', changes may need to be verified in additional runs, and non-linear editing may be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=94}}; {{harvnb|Hancock|2000|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd compare scripting to [[stop motion|stop-motion]] animation.&lt;ref name="Kelland 94" /&gt; Another disadvantage is that, depending on the game, scripting capabilities may be limited or unavailable.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 129"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matinee, a machinima software tool included with ''[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]'', popularized scripting in machinima.&lt;ref name="Kelland 94" /&gt;

===Limitations and solutions===
When ''Diary of a Camper'' was created, no software tools existed to edit demo files into films.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2006 33" /&gt; Rangers clan member Eric "ArchV" Fowler wrote his own programs to reposition the camera and to splice footage from the ''Quake'' demo file.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=33}}; {{harvnb|Wu|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Quake'' movie editing software later appeared, but the use of conventional non-linear video editing software is now common.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 114"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Phil South inserted single, completely white frames into his work ''No Licence'' to enhance the visual impact of explosions.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 114" /&gt; In the [[post-production]] of ''[[Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles]]'', [[Rooster Teeth Productions]] added [[letterbox]]ing with [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] to hide the camera player's [[head-up display]].&lt;ref name="Moltenbrey"&gt;{{harvnb|Moltenbrey|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinima creators have used different methods to handle limited character expression. The most typical ways that amateur-style machinima gets around limitations of expression include taking advantage of speech bubbles seen above players' heads when speaking, relying on the visual matching between a character's voice and appearance, and finding methods available within the game itself. ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' and [[Source Filmmaker]] include the ability to manipulate characters and objects in real-time, though the former relies on community addons to take advantage of certain engine features, and the latter renders scenes using non-real-time effects. In the ''Halo'' video game series, helmets completely cover the characters' faces. To prevent confusion, Rooster Teeth's characters move slightly when speaking, a convention shared with anime.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 131"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some machinima creators use custom software.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 78"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Strange Company uses Take Over GL Face Skins to add more facial expressions to their characters filmed in BioWare's 2002 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 78" /&gt; Similarly, Atussa Simon used a "library of faces" for characters in ''The Battle of Xerxes''.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 79"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, some game companies may provide such software; examples include Epic Games' Impersonator for ''Unreal Tournament 2004'' and [[Valve Corporation]]'s Faceposer for [[Source (game engine)|Source]] games.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 78" /&gt; Another solution is to blend in non-machinima elements, as nGame did by inserting painted characters with more expressive faces into its 1999 film ''Berlin Assassins''.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 130"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be possible to point the camera elsewhere or employ other creative cinematography or acting.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 130" /&gt; For example, Tristan Pope combined creative character and camera positioning with video editing to suggest sexual actions in his controversial film ''Not Just Another Love Story''.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 188"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

New machinima filmmakers often want to use game-provided [[digital asset]]s,&lt;ref name="Kelland 96"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; but doing so raises legal issues. As [[derivative work]]s, their films could violate copyright or be controlled by the assets' copyright holder,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=98}}; {{harvnb|Varney|2007|loc=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an arrangement that can be complicated by separate publishing and licensing rights.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 98"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[software license agreement]] for ''[[The Movies]]'' stipulates that [[Activision]], the game's publisher, owns "any and all content within... Game Movies that was either supplied with the Program or otherwise made available... by Activision or its licensors..."&lt;ref name="Quoted in Varney, 2"&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Varney|2007|loc=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some game companies provide software to modify their own games, and machinima makers often cite [[fair use]] as a defense, but the issue has never been tested in court.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 98-99"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential problem with this defense is that many works, such as ''Red vs. Blue'', focus more on [[satire]], which is not as explicitly protected by fair use as [[parody]].&lt;ref name="Sunder 2006, 309"&gt;{{harvnb|Sunder|2006|loc=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley adds that, even if machinima artists use their own assets, their works could be ruled derivative if filmed in a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] engine.&lt;ref name="Berkeley 2006, 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Berkeley|2006|loc=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk inherent in a fair-use defense would cause most machinima artists simply to yield to a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] order.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 569"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMAS has attempted to negotiate solutions with video game companies, arguing that an [[open source software|open-source]] or reasonably priced alternative would emerge from an unfavorable situation.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 98-99" /&gt; Unlike ''The Movies'', some dedicated machinima software programs, such as Reallusion's [[iClone]], have licenses that avoid claiming ownership of users' films featuring bundled assets.&lt;ref name="Varney, 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Varney|2007|loc=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, companies want to retain creative control over their [[Intellectual property|intellectual properties]] and are wary of [[fan-made|fan-created]] works, like [[fan fiction]].&lt;ref name="Berkeley 2006, 69" /&gt; However, because machinima provides free marketing, they have avoided a response demanding strict copyright enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=569, 582}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Linden Lab was praised for changing license terms to allow users to retain ownership of works created in its virtual world ''Second Life''.&lt;ref name="Marcus 2008, 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Marcus|2008|loc=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rooster Teeth initially tried to release ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' unnoticed by ''Halo''{{'}}s owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project.&lt;ref name="Kelland 99; Konow 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=99}}; {{harvnb|Konow|2005|loc=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2,&lt;ref name="Kelland 99; Konow 2" /&gt; and allowed them to continue without paying licensing fees.&lt;ref name="Thompson 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2005|loc=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case in which developer control was asserted involved Blizzard Entertainment's action against Tristan Pope's ''Not Just Another Love Story''.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 190"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blizzard's community managers encouraged users to post game movies and screenshots, but viewers complained that Pope's suggestion of sexual actions through creative camera and character positioning was pornographic.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 188, 190"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=188, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the user license agreement, Blizzard closed discussion threads about the film and prohibited links to it.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 190" /&gt; Although Pope accepted Blizzard's right to some control, he remained concerned about censorship of material that already existed in-game in some form.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 190-191"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion ensued about boundaries between MMORPG player and developer control.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 190-191" /&gt; Lowood asserted that this controversy demonstrated that machinima could be a medium of negotiation for players.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 191"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsoft and Blizzard===
In August 2007, Microsoft issued its Game Content Usage Rules, a license intended to address the legal status of machinima based on its games, including the ''Halo'' series.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 569, 571"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=569, 571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft intended the rules to be "flexible",&lt;ref name="James 2007, 29"&gt;{{harvnb|James|2007|loc=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, because it was [[unilateral contract|unilateral]], the license was legally unable to reduce rights.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 570"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=570}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, machinima artists, such as [[Edgeworks Entertainment]], protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's [[fictional universe]]s (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|2007|loc=29–30}}; {{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, "If you do any of these things, you can expect to hear from Microsoft's lawyers who will tell you that you have to stop distributing your items right away."&lt;ref name="James 2007, 30"&gt;{{harvnb|James|2007|loc=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprised by the negative feedback,&lt;ref name="James 2007, 30" /&gt; Microsoft revised and reissued the license after discussion with Hugh Hancock and an attorney for the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 570" /&gt; The rules allow noncommercial use and distribution of works derived from Microsoft-owned game content, except audio effects and soundtracks.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 571"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license prohibits [[reverse engineering]] and material that is pornographic or otherwise "objectionable".&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 571" /&gt; On distribution, derivative works that elaborate on a game's [[fictional universe]] or story are automatically licensed to Microsoft and its business partners.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 571-572"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=571–572}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents legal problems if a fan and Microsoft independently conceive similar plots.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 571-572" /&gt;

A few weeks later, Blizzard Entertainment posted on WorldofWarcraft.com their "Letter to the Machinimators of the World", a license for noncommercial use of game content.&lt;ref name="Hayes, 572"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from Microsoft's declaration in that it addresses machinima specifically instead of general game-derived content, allows use of game audio if Blizzard can legally license it, requires derivative material to meet the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]'s Teen content rating guideline, defines noncommercial use differently, and does not address extensions of fictional universes.&lt;ref name="Hayes, 573-576"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=573–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayes states that, although licensees' benefits are limited, the licenses reduce reliance on fair use regarding machinima.&lt;ref name="Hayes, 576"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=576}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this recognition may reduce film festivals' concerns about copyright clearance; in an earlier analogous situation, festivals were concerned about [[documentary film]]s until best practices for them were developed.&lt;ref name="Hayes, 576-577"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=576–577}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hayes, Microsoft and Blizzard helped themselves through their licenses because fan creations provide free publicity and are unlikely to harm sales.&lt;ref name="Hayes, 577-579"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=577–579}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the companies had instead sued for copyright infringement, defendants could have claimed [[estoppel]] or [[implied license]] because machinima had been unaddressed for a long time.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 580"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these licenses secured their issuers' legal rights.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 580" /&gt; Even though other companies, such as [[Electronic Arts]], have encouraged machinima, they have avoided licensing it.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 583"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the involved legal complexity, they may prefer to under-enforce copyrights.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 583" /&gt; Hayes believes that this legal uncertainty is a suboptimal solution and that, though limited and "idiosyncratic", the Microsoft and Blizzard licenses move towards an ideal video gaming industry standard for handling derivative works.&lt;ref name="Hayes 2008, 585, 587"&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2008|loc=585, 587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semiotic mode==
Just as machinima can be the cause of legal dispute in copyright ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of [[intertextuality]] and raises the question of [[authorship]]. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.

This re-appropriation of established texts, resources, and artistic properties to tell a story or make a statement is an example of a semiotic phenomenon known as [[intertextuality]] or resemiosis.&lt;ref name="Nitsche article 2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nitsche|first=Michael|title=Claiming Its Space: Machinima|url=http://www.dichtung-digital.de/2007/Nitsche/nitsche.htm|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more common term for this phenomenon is “[[parody]]”, but not all of these intertextual productions are intended for humor or satire, as demonstrated by the ''Few Good G-Men'' video. Furthermore, the argument of how well-protected machinima is under the guise of parody or satire is still highly debated; a piece of machinima may be reliant upon a protected property, but may not necessarily be making a statement about that property.&lt;ref name="Dogan 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dogan|first=Stacey|title=Parody As Brand|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2170498|publisher=Stanford Public Law|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is more accurate to refer to it simply as resemiosis, because it takes an artistic work and presents it in a new way, form, or medium. This resemiosis can be manifested in a number of ways. The machinima-maker can be considered an author who restructures the story and/or the world that the chosen game engine is built around.&lt;ref name="Frølunde 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frølunde|first=Lisbeth|title=Animated war: Perspectives on resemiosis and authorship applied to two DIY film projects|url=http://rudar.ruc.dk/bitstream/1800/8566/1/AnimatedWar_author_sPrePrint.pdf|publisher=Roskilde University|accessdate=6 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HJsHSuXB?url=http://rudar.ruc.dk/bitstream/1800/8566/1/AnimatedWar_author_sPrePrint.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the popular web series ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'', most of the storyline takes place within the game engine of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and its subsequent sequels. ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' has an extensive storyline already, but ''Red vs. Blue'' only ever makes mention of this storyline once in the first episode.&lt;ref name="RvB Script"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burns|first=Burnie|title=Red vs. Blue Episode 1 Script|url=http://www.roostertooths.com/transcripts.php?eid=1|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even after over 200 episodes of the show being broadcast onto the Internet since 2003, the only real similarities that can be drawn between ''Red vs. Blue'' and the game-world it takes place in are the character models, props, vehicles, and settings. Yet [[Burnie Burns]] and the machinima team at [[Rooster Teeth]] created an extensive storyline of their own using these game resources.

The ability to re-appropriate a game engine to film a video demonstrates intertextuality because it is an obvious example of art being a product of creation-through-manipulation rather than creation per se. The art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] likened art to the "manipulation of a vocabulary"&lt;ref name="Hawthorn 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawthorn|first=Geoffrey|title=Plausible Worlds|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=9780521457767|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Td9uxJmLyEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this can be demonstrated in the creation of machinima. When using a game world to create a story, the author is influenced by the engine. For example, since so many video games are built around the concept of war, a significant portion of machinima films also take place in war-like environments.&lt;ref name="Frølunde 2012" /&gt;

Intertextuality is further demonstrated in machinima not only in the re-appropriation of content but in artistic and communicatory techniques. Machinima by definition is a form of [[puppetry]],&lt;ref name="Jacobs 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Tristan|title=The virtual puppet in the Machinima movement: discovering virtual puppetry in the 3D performance space of videogames|journal=South African Theatre Journal|date=11 November 2011|volume=25|issue=1|pages=35–44|doi=10.1080/10137548.2011.619719#preview}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus this new form of [[digital puppetry]] employs age-old techniques from the traditional artform.&lt;ref name="Frølunde 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frølunde|first=Lisbeth|title=Understanding Machinima: Applying a Dialogic Approach|url=http://worlds.ruc.dk/public_uploads/2011/02/Lisbeth.pdf|publisher=Roskilde University|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also, however, a form of [[filmmaking]], and must employ filmmaking techniques such as [[camera angles]] and proper lighting. Some machinima takes place in online environments with participants, actors, and "[[puppeteers]]" working together from thousands of miles apart. This means other techniques born from long-distance communication must also be employed. Thus, techniques and practices that would normally never be used in conjunction with one another in the creation of an artistic work end up being used intertextually in the creation of machinima.

Another way that machinima demonstrates intertextuality is in its tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' might do.&lt;ref name="Chandler 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandler|first=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London, England|isbn=978-0415363754|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3yKcMnQzE0C&amp;dq=semiotics+the+basics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the machinima series ''Freeman's Mind'', created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half Life]]'' as a player normally would and combining it with a [[voiceover]] (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an [[inner monologue]] of the normally voiceless protagonist [[Gordon Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.accursedfarms.com/movies/fm/ Freeman's Mind] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224057/http://www.accursedfarms.com/movies/fm/# |date=2013-12-02 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] character who makes frequent references to works and texts including [[science fiction]], [[horror films]], [[action movies]], [[American history]], and renowned [[novels]] such as [[Moby Dick]]. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.

==Common genres==
{{see also|List of machinima works}}
Nitsche and Lowood describe two methods of approaching machinima: starting from a video game and seeking a medium for expression or for documenting gameplay ("inside-out"), and starting outside a game and using it merely as animation tool ("outside-in").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nitsche|2007}}; {{harvnb|Lowood|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd similarly distinguish between works that retain noticeable connections to games, and those closer to traditional animation.&lt;ref name="Kelland 40"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belonging to the former category, gameplay and stunt machinima began in 1997 with ''Quake done Quick''.&lt;ref name="Kelland 40" /&gt; Although not the first [[speedrun]]ners, its creators used external software to manipulate camera positions after recording, which, according to Lowood, elevated speedrunning "from cyberathleticism to making movies".&lt;ref name="Lowood 2006 34"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stunt machinima remains popular. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd state that ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' stunt videos offer a new way to look at the game, and compare ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'' machinima creators to the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].&lt;ref name="Kelland 40 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=40, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built-in features for video editing and post-recording camera positioning in ''[[Halo 3]]'' were expected to facilitate gameplay-based machinima.&lt;ref name="Tuttle"&gt;{{harvnb|Tuttle|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; MMORPGs and other virtual worlds have been captured in [[documentary film]]s, such as ''Miss Galaxies 2004'', a beauty pageant that took place in the virtual world of ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage was distributed in the cover disc of the August 2004 issue of ''[[PC Gamer]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland 43" /&gt; [[Douglas Gayeton]]'s ''[[Molotov Alva and His Search for the Creator]]'' documents the title character's interactions in ''Second Life''.&lt;ref name="Andrews, 1" /&gt;

Gaming-related comedy offers another possible entry point for new machinima producers.&lt;ref name="Kelland 40" /&gt; Presented as five-minute sketches, many machinima comedies are analogous to Internet [[Flash animation]]s.&lt;ref name="Kelland 40" /&gt; After Clan Undead's 1997 work ''[[Operation Bayshield]]'' built on the earliest ''Quake'' movies by introducing narrative conventions of [[linear medium|linear media]]&lt;ref name="Lowood 2006, 37"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2006|loc=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sketch comedy]] reminiscent of the television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'',&lt;ref name="Wilonsky, 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilonsky|2002|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New-York-based [[ILL Clan]] further developed the genre in machinima through works including ''[[Apartment Huntin']]'' and ''[[Hardly Workin']]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland 46"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red vs. Blue: The Blood Gulch Chronicles'' chronicles a futile civil war over five seasons and 100 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=46}}; {{harvnb|Lankshear|Knobel|2007|loc=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marino wrote that although the series' humor was rooted in video games, strong writing and characters caused the series to "transcend the typical gamer".&lt;ref name="Marino 19"/&gt; An example of a comedy film that targets a more general audience is Strange Company's ''Tum Raider'', produced for the [[BBC]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="Kelland 46-47"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinima has been used in music videos, of which the first documented example is Ken Thain's 2002 "Rebel vs. Thug", made in collaboration with [[Chuck D]].&lt;ref name="Kelland, 66"/&gt; For this, Thain used Quake2Max, a [[mod (computer gaming)|modification]] of ''[[Quake II]]'' that provided [[cel-shaded animation]].&lt;ref name="Hanson 2004, 62"&gt;{{harvnb|Hanson|2004|loc=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Tommy Pallotta]] directed "In the Waiting Line" for the British group [[Zero 7]].&lt;ref name="Kelland, 66-67"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''Computer Graphics World'', "It probably would have been quicker to do the film in a 3D animated program. But now, we can reuse the assets in an improvisational way."&lt;ref name="Robertson 2003, 11"&gt;{{harvnb|Robertson|2003|loc=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes of the game ''[[Postal 2]]'' can be seen in the music video of [[the Black Eyed Peas]] single "[[Where Is the Love?]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcgames.gwn.com/news/story.php/id/2010/Postal_2_Features_In_Music_Video.html |title=Postal 2 Features In Music Video |accessdate=2011-06-16 |date=2003-07-17 |publisher=Gameworld Industries |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930062040/http://pcgames.gwn.com/news/story.php/id/2010/Postal_2_Features_In_Music_Video.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In television, MTV features video game characters on its show ''[[Video Mods]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 66" /&gt; Among ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' players, dance and music videos became popular after dancing animations were discovered in the game.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 187-188"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others use machinima in drama; these works may or may not retain signs of their video game provenance.&lt;ref name="Kelland 50-52"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' is often used for science fiction and ''Battlefield 1942'' for war, but some artists subvert their chosen game's setting or completely detach their work from it.&lt;ref name="Kelland 50-51"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[Strange Company]] used ''[[Quake II]]'' in ''Eschaton: Nightfall'', a horror film based on the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (although Quake I was also based on the Lovecraft lore).&lt;ref name="Kelland 52"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A later example is Damien Valentine's series ''[[Consanguinity (Buffyverse)|Consanguinity]]'', made using [[BioWare]]'s 2002 computer game ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and based on the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland 52" /&gt; Another genre consists of experimental works that attempt to push the boundaries of game engines.&lt;ref name="Kelland 54"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example, Fountainhead's ''[[Anna (2003 film)|Anna]]'', is a short film that focuses on the cycle of life and is reminiscent of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.&lt;ref name="Kelland 54" /&gt; Other productions go farther and completely eschew a 3-D appearance.&lt;ref name="Kelland 54" /&gt; Friedrich Kirschner's ''The Tournament'' and ''The Journey'' deliberately appear hand-drawn, and Dead on Que's ''Fake Science'' resembles two-dimensional Eastern European modernist animation from the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Kelland 54" /&gt;

Another derivative genre termed ''machinima verite'', from [[cinéma vérité]], seeks to add a documentary and additional realism to the machinima piece. L.M. Sabo's ''CATACLYSM'' achieves a machinima verite style through displaying and recapturing the machinima video with a low resolution black and white hand-held video camera to produce a [[shaky camera]] effect. Other element of cinéma vérité, such as longer takes, sweeping camera transitions, and [[jump cuts]] may be included to complete the effect.

Some have used machinima to make political statements, often from [[left-wing politics|left-wing perspectives]].&lt;ref name="Horwatt 2008, 12"&gt;{{harvnb|Horwatt|2008|loc=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Chan's take on the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], ''[[The French Democracy]]'', attained mainstream attention and inspired other machinima commentaries on American and British society.&lt;ref name="Lowood 2007, 167"&gt;{{harvnb|Lowood|2007|loc=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diderich 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Diderich|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horwatt deemed Thuyen Nguyen's 2006 ''An Unfair War'', a criticism of the [[Iraq War]], similar in its attempt "to speak for those who cannot".&lt;ref name="Horwatt 2008, 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Horwatt|2008|loc=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Garrison mimicked Chan's "political pseudo-documentary style" in his ''Virginia Tech Massacre'', a controversial ''[[Halo 3]]''–based re-enactment and explanation of [[Virginia Tech massacre|the eponymous real-life events]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horwatt|2008|loc=13}}; {{harvnb|Gish|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, ''[[War of Internet Addiction]]'' addressed [[internet censorship in China]] using ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/02/12/war-of-internet-addiction-wins-hearts-and-minds-in-china/ |work=The Wall Street Journal |title=‘War of Internet Addiction' Wins Hearts and Minds in China |first=Loretta |last=Chao |date=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the QML's Quake Movie Oscars, dedicated machinima awards did not reappear until the AMAS created the Mackies for its first Machinima Film Festival in 2002.&lt;ref name="Marino 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Marino|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual festival has become an important one for machinima creators.&lt;ref name="Kelland, 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho Chee Yue, a founder of the marketing company [[AKQA]], helped to organize the first festival for the Asia chapter of the AMAS in 2006.&lt;ref name="Machinimasia Festival in Singapore"&gt;{{harvnb|Association of Machinima Arts &amp; Sciences|n.d.|Ref=CITEREFMachinimasia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the AMAS supported the first machinima festival held in Europe.&lt;ref name="Harwood"&gt;{{harvnb|Harwood|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these smaller ceremonies, Hugh Hancock of [[Strange Company]] worked to add an award for machinima to the more general [[Bitfilm Festival]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="The Bitfilm Competitions, 3"&gt;{{harvnb|Bitfilm Festival|2008|loc=3|Ref=CITEREFBitfilm2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other general festivals that allow machinima include the [[Sundance Film Festival]], the [[Florida Film Festival]], and the [[New Media Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Kelland, 69" /&gt; The [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] opened a machinima category in 2004, but, citing the need for "a certain level of excellence", declined to award anything to the category's four entries that year.&lt;ref name="Osborne"&gt;{{harvnb|Osborne|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinima has been showcased in contests sponsored by game companies. [[Epic Games]]' popular [[Make Something Unreal (contest)|Make Something Unreal]] contest included machinima that impressed event organizer Jeff Morris because of "the quality of entries that really push the technology, that accomplish things that Epic never envisioned".&lt;ref name="Quoted in Kelland, 69"&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Kelland|Morris|Lloyd|2005|loc=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005, [[Blizzard Entertainment]] and [[Xfire]], a gaming-focused [[instant messaging]] service, jointly sponsored a ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' machinima contest.&lt;ref name="Maragos"&gt;{{harvnb|Maragos|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marco Materazzi''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Ufficiale OMRI]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-it|ˈmarko mateˈrattsi}}; born 19 August 1973) is an [[Italians|Italian]] former professional [[Association football|footballer]] and [[Association football manager|manager]].

Early in his career, Materazzi played with various Italian teams in [[Serie B]] and [[Serie C]], and with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Premier League]]. He spent two periods with [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] (1995–98 and 1999–2001) and signed for [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] in 2001 for €10&amp;nbsp;million. At club level, he won a number of major honors with Inter, including five [[Serie A]] league titles in a row from 2006 to 2010, one [[UEFA Champions League]], one [[FIFA Club World Cup]], four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] four times.&lt;ref&gt;The Matrix – Marco Materazzi: {{cite web|url=http://lazymanscalcio.tumblr.com/post/18215957095/the-matrix |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203063129/http://lazymanscalcio.tumblr.com/post/18215957095/the-matrix |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materazzi earned 41 caps for Italy from his debut in 2001 until 2008, playing in two World Cups and two European Championships. He was one of the key players in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]] against France, as he scored Italy's goal and later, in extra time, he received a headbutt from [[Zinedine Zidane]], who was punished with a red card.&lt;ref name="World Cup"/&gt; Italy then went on to win the World Cup in a penalty shoot-out, during which Materazzi scored again.

A controversial and provocative figure in football, he was known for his very physical and aggressive style of play as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]], as well as his tight marking and strong, harsh tackling, which led him to receive more than 60 yellow cards and 25 red cards throughout his playing career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.serpentsofmadonnina.com/2011/7/18/3211758/marco-materazzi-a-bandieria-among-bandierie|title=Marco Materazzi: A Bandieria Among Bandierie|publisher=Serpents of Madonnina|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his temper, and his commitment to rash, heavy challenges, he has been involved in several altercations with other players during matches,&lt;ref name="Materazzi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cazullo|first1=Aldo|title=Materazzi|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/luglio/11/Materazzi_co_9_060711008.shtml|website=www.corriere.it|publisher=Il Corriere della Sera|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing comparisons with retired defender [[Pasquale Bruno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Emanuele Gamba|title="O' animale resto sempre io una volta aspettai Lerda..."|trans-title="I'm still the animal once I waited for Lerda..."|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/b/sezioni/sport/calcio/serie_a/brunotunnel/brunotunnel/brunotunnel.html|publisher=La Repubblica|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Italian|date=3 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' placed Materazzi at number 45 in their list of the 50 hardest football players in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 50 Hardest Footballers |url=http://www.empireonline.com/forum/printable.asp?m=1554851 |accessdate=14 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019002225/http://www.empireonline.com/forum/printable.asp?m=1554851 |archivedate=19 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Materazzi began his footballing career with the [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and then the [[F.C. Messina Peloro|Messina Peloro]] youth teams from 1990 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alpha59.it/news/50/la-carriera-di-marco-materazzi.html|title=LA CARRIERA DI MARCO MATERAZZI|date=3 March 2018|publisher=alpha59.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his early career in the lower divisions of Italian football, with amateur side Tor di Quinto (1991–92), [[Serie C]]2 team [[S.C. Marsala 1912|Marsala]] (1993–94), and Serie C1 [[A.S.D. Trapani Calcio|Trapani]] (1994–95), where he narrowly missed a historic promotion to [[Serie B]] after losing a promotion playoff to [[S.S. Gualdo|Gualdo]]. [[Serie B]] squad [[Perugia Calcio]] signed Materazzi for the first time in 1995,&lt;ref name="Early life"/&gt; but he spent a part of the 1996–97 season in Serie C with [[Carpi F.C. 1909|Carpi]].

He then spent 1998–99 with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.toffeeweb.com/players/profiles/Materazzi.php|title=Marco Materazzi central defender|publisher=ToffeeWeb.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was sent off three times in just 27 games, and scored twice, against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the league&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-barmby-sparks-everton-deluge-1071633.html|title=Barmby sparks Everton deluge|publisher=[[The Independent]]|author=Neil Bramwell|location=London|date=17 February 1999|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dacourt-drives-everton-through-1200301.html|title=Dacourt drives Everton through|publisher=The Independent|author=Phill Shaw|location=London|date=23 September 1998|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazzetta/&gt;

He then returned to Perugia in 1999 and scored 12 goals, including 7 from penalties in the [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01 season]], breaking [[Daniel Passarella]]'s Serie A record of most goals by a defender in one season.&lt;ref name=gazzetta/&gt;

==International career==
===Debut and 2002 World Cup===
Materazzi made his debut for the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] on 25 April 2001, in a 1–0 friendly match victory against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/1294939.stm|title=Italy edge out South Africa|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 April 2001|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made two appearances in the qualifying campaign against Georgia and Hungary. In the final tournament of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], Materazzi was used as a reserve player to back up Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro. He made only one appearance by coming on as a substitute for Nesta in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group G|2–1 loss]] to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the group stage but soon in the 90th minute Materazzi played a floating ball over the top from just over half way to [[Filippo Inzaghi|Inzaghi]] but everyone missed the ball and it rolled in the back of the net but the goal was disallowed after referee [[Graham Poll]] claimed that Inzaghi had grabbed an opponent's shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/09/worldcupfootball2002.sport23|title=Italy are offline|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Simon Kuper|date=9 June 2002|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materazzi was later criticised for his defending on both of Croatia's goals during the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/italy_v_croatia/default.stm|title=Croatia punish Italy|publisher=BBC|date=8 June 2002|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/mondiali2002/itacrpag/itacrpag/itacrpag.html|title=Male Materazzi e Maldini, Non brilla Totti, bene Vieri|trans-title=Materazzi and Maldini bad, Totti does not shine, Vieri good|publisher=Reppublica.it|language=Italian|author=Massimo Vincenzi|date=8 June 2002|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UEFA Euro 2004===
Despite a long suspension with Inter,&lt;ref name="Suspension"/&gt; Materazzi was still called up by manager [[Giovanni Trapattoni]] for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldsoccer.com/news/trapattoni-names-italy-squad-for-euro-2004-55531|title=Trapattoni names Italy squad for EURO 2004|publisher=World Soccer|date=19 May 2004|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was on the bench for Italy's first two games but started in the final [[UEFA Euro 2004 Group C#Italy vs Bulgaria|group game]] against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in place of the suspended [[Fabio Cannavaro]], as Italy came from behind to win 2–1; in the first half, Materazzi was judged to have allegedly fouled [[Dimitar Berbatov]] in the area, conceding a penalty, which [[Martin Petrov]] subsequently converted. Despite the win, Italy were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/3787525.stm|title=Italy 2–1 Bulgaria|publisher=BBC|date=23 June 2004|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the match went to extra-time, Materazzi and Zidane were involved in a confrontation in the 110th minute, where Materazzi verbally insulted Zinedine Zidane alongside tugging his shirt while Zidane attempted to walk away, which ended with [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final#Zidane sending off|Zidane head-butting]] Materazzi and receiving a red card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/mar/11/world-cup-moments-zinedine-zidane-head-butt|title=World Cup stunning moments: Zinedine Zidane's head-butt|publisher=The Guardian|author=Ian McCourt|date=25 March 2018|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game then continued to penalties.

Additionally, Materazzi claimed that after he had grabbed Zidane's jersey, Zidane sarcastically said to him ''"If you want my shirt, I will give to you afterwards"''.

'''Miss Baker''' (1957 – November 29, 1984) was a [[squirrel monkey]] who in 1959 became, along with [[rhesus macaque]] Miss Able, one of the first two animals launched into space by the United States and safely returned.&lt;ref name="findGrave"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/10621868|publisher=[[Find a Grave]]|title=Miss Baker|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous animal flights==

Previous United States efforts at [[monkeys in space|launching monkeys to space]] had met with the animals' demise from suffocation or parachute failure, and [[Soviet Union]] efforts had fared little better, to the chagrin of [[animal rights activists]].&lt;ref name="v2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/v2.htm|title=V2|publisher=Astronautix|accessdate=September 14, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906120723/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/v2.htm|archivedate=September 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The Soviet Union had recovered two dogs, the first mammals to be recovered from suborbital space flight, from an altitude of {{convert|101|km|ft|sp=us}} on July 22, 1951 and subsequently recovered more dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Challenge to Apollo: The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945–1974|author=Asif. A. Siddiqi|year=2000|publisher=NASA|page=95|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4408pt1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States had flown monkeys and mice by [[Aerobee (rocket)|Aerobee rocket]] to heights below the [[Kármán line|edge of space]] beginning in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://history.nasa.gov/printFriendly/animals.html | title=Animals in Space | publisher=NASA | accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-flight ==
The squirrel monkey who was to become known as Miss Baker was purchased along with 25 other squirrel monkeys at a pet shop in Miami, Florida, and brought to the Naval Aviation Medical School in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. Fourteen of the candidates tolerated confinement for periods up to 24 hours, electrodes all over their bodies, and monitoring at all hours. Miss Baker "stood out from the rest because of her intelligence and loving, docile manner", relayed Colin Burgess and Chris Dubbs in their 2007 book ‘Animals In Space: From Research Rockets to the Space Shuttle.’ For this, and her apparent pleasure at being handled with tender loving care, she earned the nickname TLC.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

With experiments imminent, the Army named their monkey "Alpha," and the Navy followed with "Bravo," names taken directly from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet|phonetic alphabet]]. Before flight, though, the names changed to the first letters of the antiquated [[Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet]].&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

== The flight ==
[[File:Miss Baker in her bio-pack.jpg|thumb|Miss Baker awaits launch.]]
[[File:Jupiter AM-18 pre-launch.jpg|thumb|Jupiter AM-18 stands ready for its 2:39&amp;nbsp;am launch at [[Cape Canaveral]] launch complex 26B.]]

Miss Baker wore a helmet lined with rubber and chamois leather plus a jacket for launch, in addition to a respiration meter affixed to her nose with model cement, and she was fitted into a snug capsule of shoebox size, 9¾ × 12½ × 6¾ inches (24.8 × 31.8 × 17.1&amp;nbsp;cm) insulated with rubber and fiberglass. Life support was an oxygen bottle with a pressure valve, and [[lithium hydroxide]] to absorb exhaled [[carbon dioxide]] and moisture.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

On May 28, 1959, at 2:39&amp;nbsp;am, a [[Jupiter-C|Jupiter rocket]] lifted Miss Baker and Miss Able to an altitude of {{convert|300|mi|km}} through an acceleration of 38 [[standard gravity|gs]] for a 16-minute flight which also included 9 minutes of weightlessness.&lt;ref name="findGrave"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/28/newsid_3725000/3725961.stm|title=1959: Monkeys survive space mission|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beischer1962"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beischer, DE |author2=Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space.

Able and Baker were not alone on the flight. They were accompanied by ''[[Neurospora]]''; samples of human blood; ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''; onions; [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]] and [[maize|corn]] seeds; ''[[Drosophila]]'' pupae; [[yeast]]; and [[sea urchin]] eggs and sperm.&lt;ref name="Beischer1962"/&gt;

Able died four days after the flight from a highly unusual cardiac fibrillation in reaction to anesthesia to remove electrodes. "This is the type of anesthetic death every surgeon fears," said Colonel Robert Hullinghorst, deputy at Ft. Knox where the surgery took place, "We don't know exactly why it occurs." An autopsy found no problems that may have contributed to her death.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt; Able is stuffed and on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]].&lt;ref name="50yrs"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA marks 50th anniversary of monkeys Able and Miss Baker in space|url=http://blog.al.com/space-news/2009/05/nasa_marks_50th_anniversary_of.html|date=May 28, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2011|publisher=The Huntsville Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="77party"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bQgdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_Z0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=big%20george%20miss%20baker%20pensacola&amp;pg=5885%2C6514718|title=Space Monkey Marks Birthday|work=Tuscaloosa News|date=June 30, 1977|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birthday party for Miss Baker.jpg|thumb|Miss Baker's birthdays were marked by balloons and some of her favorite foods.]]

Owing to their successful return from space to the USS Kiowa (ATF-72) and their crew, Able and Baker appeared on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]], June 15, 1959.&lt;ref name="findGrave"/&gt;

In 1962, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] caretakers held a marriage ceremony to wed Miss Baker to Big George.&lt;ref name="Windham"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hozNwPLWFEIC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=miss%20baker%20big%20george%20pensacola%20wedding&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q=miss%20baker%20big%20george%20pensacola%20wedding&amp;f=false | title=Alabama, One Big Front Porch | publisher=NewSouth Books | author=Windham, Kathryn Tucker | year=2007 | pages=168| isbn=9781588382191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Baker lived at the Naval Aerospace Medical Center in Pensacola, Florida until 1971.&lt;ref name="25Tuscaloosa"&gt;{{cite news|title=Little Miss Baker Back in Spotlight|work=Tuscaloosa News|date=May 28, 1982|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3iQdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S6UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=miss%20baker%20monkey&amp;pg=6678%2C6793325|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Miss Baker moved to the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], where she entertained museum visitors and drew 100–150 letters a day from schoolchildren.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USSRC20"&gt;{{cite book |title=20th Anniversary U.S. Space and Rocket Center |date=March 17, 1990 |publisher=USSRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 birthday celebrations brought balloons, camera flashes, and the regular fare of cottage cheese for Miss Baker and Big George.&lt;ref name="77party"/&gt;

Big George predeceased Miss Baker on January 8, 1979, and three months later, Norman, from the [[Yerkes National Primate Research Center]], became her second mate in a ceremony presided over by Alabama District Court judge Dan McCoy. Miss Baker refused to wear her white wedding train for the event, tearing it off after a few seconds.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xSdHVIpsrKkC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=miss%20baker%20monkey%20norman&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q=miss%20baker%20monkey%20norman&amp;f=false |title=Animals in Space: From Research Rockets to the Space Shuttle |author=Burgess, Colin |pages=134–141|isbn=9780387496788 |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WedNorm"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wAUvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9jIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=miss%20baker%20monkey%20norman%20died&amp;pg=6633%2C1780576 |title=Monkeys Wed at Huntsville |date=April 11, 1979 |work=Rome (Georgia, U.S.) News-Tribune |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, center director Ed Buckbee said, "Baker delights visitors every day with her energy and antics with her husband Norman."&lt;ref name="25Tuscaloosa"/&gt; Her birthday was celebrated within a few weeks of the actual day, on the anniversary of her flight, May 28 each year.&lt;ref name="25Tuscaloosa"/&gt;

In celebration of the 25th anniversary of her spaceflight, Baker was treated to a [[rubber duck]] and, her favorite, strawberry [[gelatin]] with bananas, along with well-wishes from thousands of people.&lt;ref name="25Tuscaloosa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="silver"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iZUpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tccEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=miss%20baker%20monkey&amp;pg=1422%2C7469094 |work=(Florence/Sheffield/Tuscumbia/Muscle Shoals) Times Daily|title=Miss Baker A-OK|date=May 29, 1984|accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miss Baker's Gravestone bw.JPG|thumb|Miss Baker's gravestone frequently has one or more bananas on top.]]

'''''Monster Rancher 4''''' (known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Monster Farm 4'''''|モンスターファーム4|Monsutā Fāmu Fō}}) is a [[Pet-raising simulation|monster breeding and management game]] that was released by [[Tecmo]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2003.

==Gameplay==

Like the previous installments, this game involves the raising, breeding, and fighting of monsters.  Monsters are created via a "Saucer Stone" regeneration system.  Players must go to a Shrine, where they swap the Monster Rancher 4 disc with a CD, DVD, or another game disc.  A monster is then generated from the data contained on that disc.  Once a player regenerates a monster, they can raise it on a ranch, and train it to compete in battles. The limit for monsters depend on the size of their ranch but the maximum is 5 monsters.

The user's character (default: Phayne) stows away on a ship after being kicked out of the Elives School.  He then meets a once famous FIMBA breeder, TeeTee.  He is later offered a job running his own ranch.  The original trainer assistant, Yuri, catches up with Phayne.  When the Official Cup E is won, Yuri quits, and Cesare's (the shrine priest) daughter, Rio, becomes the trainer assistant.  Rio is also revealed to be able to talk to monsters (reason explained later) and that is why she is shy and hated.  The main character will begin using training gadgets, which run off geonyte (an energy found in spirit trees).  The trainer's first monster will grow lonely.  Eventually, three monsters will be permitted on the ranch.  Rio will discover a cave (the Togle Caves) and Phayne will travel down it.  On the first trip, he will discoveer a Life Tablet (a tablet which allows for a blueprint for a life training gadget).  On the second trip, he and Rio will discover a saucer stone fragment, a Gaia Stone.  Rio touches it and sees a terrifying image.  When the breeder returns home, Pollocck informs them that there is a geonyte shortage.  Phayne will travel into the cave once more, and at the end, they will find King Shiden, a raiden, who is the cause of the shortage.  After defeating him, raidens will be unlocked, and breeder rank D will be achieved.

After winning the Official Cup D, Phayne is given a boat.  The boat allows him to travel to other places.  He will travel to Ryuwn, the capital, and will apply for Ryuwn registration.  This is unavailable.  Phayne reunites with old school friends, Gram and Phylia, and meets her ailing grandma, Mauro.  Phayne is sent on a mission to find healing mushrooms in the Togle Caves.  After defeating Blobster, he receives the mushrooms.  He returns them, and is then sent on a  mission by Karnab (President of FIMBA) to find "junk."  You then find another Gaia Stone Fragment, and Rio sees another terrifying vision.  After going back, he faces a Mogi, and receives the "junk."  He is then granted access to FIMBA battles, and is given a Breeder Rank C.

After winning the Official Grade C, Phayne hears news of missing explorers in the Kalaragi Jungle, and travels to rescue them.  You then face Don Mudlone, a Gaboo (reference to MR2), and, after defeating him, find out about monster "alterations."  Karnab asks you to come to FIMBA for a surprise (rank B) and you are told to go to Torble to find out about the alterations.  You go to Torble to meet another school friend, Wit.  He takes you to the University, where TeeTee is revealed to be his assistant.  The next week, in Torble, you are granted access to the Torble (IMA) battles.  You meet another friend, Deihl, and find him to be cruel to his monsters.  Rio punches him in the face.  Phayne declares that he will defeat him.  You then revisit Wit.  He gives you a magic training medal, a medal that enhances the effects of training.  You win the Ofiicial Grade B, and decide to go to Vizley to get a teacher to speak to Deihl.

You go to Vizley and it is revealed why Phayne was expelled, but Mrs. Casa, Phayne's old teacher, refuses to speak to Deihl.  You are granted Breeder Rank A for beating Deihl.  You go to The Official Rank A defeat Wit.  The trophy is made from a third Gaia Stone, and Rio once again sees a clearer, more terrifying vision.  After a series of events, Phayne travels to the Promiass Ruins.  On the first two trips, you see two inscriptions about a "Dark Age" from long ago.  On a third trip, you face an all-knowing monster who knows why Rio can talk to monsters and what the vision means.  After defeating him, the main character discovers that Rio was sealed in a saucer stone in the Dark Age, and that she led the battle against the "Dark Lord," Xevion.  The vision was of the Dark Age.  Upon returning home, Cesare confronts Rio, and the two reach an understanding, and Rio accepts him as her father, though that is biologically incorrect.  Phayne is granted S Rank, and discovers that the Tome of Black Arts, a book containing arts for monster strengthening, was stolen from the school library.  After a chain of events, Phayne goes to the Kawrea Volcano.  Rio finds the final piece of the Gaia Stone, and finally remembers herself from long ago.  On their final journey, Rio, Phayne, and Teetee discover what happened that got Phayne expelled.  In the heart of the volcano, Rio, Phayne, Wit, Teetee, and the monsters team up to beat Xevion.  He blocks the exit.  The four Gaia Stones join together and revive a Phoenix from long ago, Suzaku.  She flies them out, and gives them a Fire Feather, which is used to revive a Phoenix.  Elongated Passageways are opened in the adventure places, thus ending the storyline.

==Monsters==
Some breeds are new to this game.  There are 34 main types of monsters, but two different monsters can be combined together to create subspecies, thus making 328 different species available.

==Raising Monsters==
Players can house up to 5 monsters on their ranch at a time, thus allowing monster-to-monster friendships, tag-team, and group battles.  Monsters that have been raised together for a long time will have a high affinity level, which describes how well the monsters get along with each other.  Having high affinity is important for effective teamwork in battles.

===Training===
This game implements the use of training gadgets, which allow the player to customize their monsters' stats. The player can acquire these gadgets as they progress through the game.  They come in many different varieties and training levels.  The higher level of training they are, the more space they will take up on the ranch, so the player has to choose wisely on which gadgets to use.

===Proper Care===
In addition to training their monster for battle, the player also has to raise it properly and make sure it has a balanced diet.  The player must not be too strict with their monster, or it may become stressed and try to run away.  They must also try not to spoil their monster too much, or it may become spoiled and not take its training or battling seriously.  To avoid being too strict or too lenient with the monster, scold it and praise it according to how well, or how badly it did on its training, and make sure to feed it a balanced diet of foods, instead of only feeding it what it likes, or only feeding it a certain type of food.

===Retirement===
After the monsters reach a certain age, they can not be raised any further, and they cannot participate in any more battles.  To avoid having all of the monsters retired at the same time, it is best to raise monsters of different ages.

==Monster Battles==
After raising training, and feeding their monsters, the player may compete them in competitions.  Players compete in competitions to increase their battle rank, and to earn money and fame.  Once the player has increased their rank, they may compete in higher-ranked competitions.  Winning competitions is important if the player wants to become a highly acclaimed breeder.

===Battle System===
The monsters fight using skills that they have acquired through training.  They can use their skills with Guts, indicated by a meter on the battle screen.  If there aren't enough 
Guts to use a certain skill, then the player has to wait until the Guts meter builds up again as the battle goes on.  The battle will last until the life of one of the monsters is depleted, or until time runs out.

===Counter-attacking===
One of the features of the battle system is using counter-attacks, which can substantially affect the outcome of battle.  To use a counter-attack, hold down the L2 button and press a skill button.  The skill button chosen must be the same skill that the opponent uses.  If executed properly and with perfect timing, then the monster will successfully counter the opponent's attack, both saving itself from damage, and inflicting damage on its opponent.

==Adventure Mode==
One of the features of Monster Rancher 4 is exploring different lands for rare items and to discover special monster breeds.  The player's team of monsters accompanies them on these journeys, battling stray monsters and the "Boss" monster of each area.  These battles can help raise the monsters' experience.  At the beginning of the game, the player can only visit a limited number of areas, but as they progress through the game, they will be able to visit more advanced and dangerous areas.  Some areas have special rare monster breeds that cannot be found anywhere else, and once the player finds these rare monsters, they will be able to regenerate them and raise them on their ranch. The four different lands you can eventually explore are the togle caves, the kalaragi jungle, the promiass ruins, and the volcano.

* '''Togle Cave''' - Unlock At Rank D (Monster Rank E)
* '''Kalaragi Jungle''' - Unlock At Rank C (Monster Rank D(1F-5F) Rank C(6F,7F)
* '''Promiass Ruins''' - Unlock At Rank S (Monster Rank B(1F-XF) Rank A(YF-8F))
* '''Kawrea Volcano''' - Unlock At Rank S (After Defeat Turtle at Promiass Ruins 8F)(Monster Rank A)

After Complete the games through. Load game and wait until pass 2 weeks. Dr.Karnab will tell you that he discover the secret way from all Adventure mode. After that, you can go to adventure and meet '''Rank S Monster''' by right click (+ Mode)

'''Nancy Elizabeth Benoit''' (née '''Toffoloni''', formerly '''Daus''' and '''Sullivan'''; May 17, 1964 – June 22, 2007) was an American [[professional wrestling]] [[Manager (professional wrestling)|valet]] and [[model (person)|model]]. She was best known for her appearances with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]] in the mid-1990s under the [[ring name]] '''Woman'''.&lt;ref name=Schramm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/06/25/4290333.html|title=Looking back on the career of "Woman"|author=Chris Schramm|publisher=[[Québecor Média]]|work=[[Canoe.ca]]|accessdate=January 17, 2015|date=June 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daytona/&gt;

==Early life==
After graduating [[DeLand High School]], Nancy got a job answering phones at [[State Farm Insurance]].&lt;ref name=daytona&gt;{{cite web|author=Cal Massey and Jeff Wilen|url= http://www.news-journalonline.com/NewsJournalOnline/News/Local/newWEST01062707.htm|title=Slain wife of wrestler a Deland High School graduate|publisher=Daytona Beach News Journal Online|accessdate=June 27, 2007|date=June 27, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630001752/http://www.news-journalonline.com/NewsJournalOnline/News/Local/newWEST01062707.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[George Napolitano]] needed a beautiful young girl for the cover of the June 1984 edition of the pro-wrestling magazine ''Wrestling All Stars'', fellow photographer Bill Otten suggested the 20-year-old Nancy Toffoloni Daus for the role.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; Nancy, who had worked as a model,&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; often sat alongside her then-husband Jim. She had also been selling programs at the Orlando shows and appeared as Para in the old "Apartment Wrestling" features. It was on this shoot where she met [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], who eventually wanted her to be a part of his wrestling entourage. After months of convincing, Nancy finally became an on-air valet, taking the ring name "Fallen Angel". 

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1984–1989)===
She made her in-ring debut on June 30, 1984 in Miami, Florida for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|Florida Championship Wrestling]].

She became a part of Kevin Sullivan's [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] of [[kayfabe]] "Satanists", which also included wrestlers [[Winona Littleheart|The Lock]], [[Luna Vachon]], [[Mark Lewin|The Purple Haze]], and [[Oliver Humperdink|Sir Oliver Humperdink]].&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; Nancy and Kevin Sullivan traveled throughout the United States using the "Satanist" gimmick for promotions such as Angelo Savoldi's ICW and [[Southwest Championship Wrestling]]. The two married in 1985.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt;

===World Championship Wrestling (1989–1990)===
She first appeared in WCW as a "fan" of [[Rick Steiner]] named Robin Green, wearing a Steiner T-shirt and large glasses. She would sit in the audience and would interact with Steiner whenever he appeared. She eventually turned on him, aligning herself with Kevin Sullivan and adopting the name Woman and became the manager of Doom ([[Butch Reed]] and [[Ron Simmons]]). After leaving Doom, she aligned herself with [[Ric Flair]] and the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]].

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993–1996)===
In late 1993, Sullivan and Nancy joined the [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]-based promotion [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], where Nancy reverted to the ring name "Woman".&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; In December 1993, Sullivan and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]] won the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship|ECW Tag Team Championship]]. They held the championship until March 1994, when they were defeated by [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]].

After Sullivan left ECW in spring 1994, Woman began managing [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]]. The Sandman's character was estranged from his wife and valet, [[Lori Fullington|Peaches]], who had left him after The Sandman accidentally struck her during a match while temporarily blinded. Woman drove a wedge between The Sandman and Peaches, convincing him that Peaches was cheating on him with [[Tommy Cairo]]. In keeping with The Sandman's character, Woman would open his beers and light his cigarettes prior to matches. She began carrying a [[Shinai|Singapore cane]] with which she would strike The Sandman's opponents.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thom Loverro|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0dlOLyCj6YC&amp;pg=PA60|date=22 May 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-6156-9|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonMcCoy2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven Johnson|author2=Heath McCoy|author3=Irv Muchnick|title=Benoit: Wrestling with the Horror That Destroyed a Family and Crippled a Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0rLnIRWqjUC&amp;pg=PT48|date=1 November 2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-315-3|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''When Worlds Collide'' on May 14, 1994, Woman and The Sandman lost to Cairo and Peaches in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Kendo Stick match|Singapore Cane match]], after which Peaches caned The Sandman in the groin until Woman threw salt in her eyes, enabling The Sandman to regroup and cane Cairo and Peaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott E. Williams|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EQtAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52|date=13 December 2013|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-61321-582-1|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1994, The Sandman began feuding with [[Tommy Dreamer]] after he kissed Woman. The feud culminated in an [["I Quit" match]] on October 1, 1994, during which The Sandman was seemingly blinded when Dreamer pushed a lit cigarette into his eye and then caned him in the face. Following the bout, Woman announced that she was leaving The Sandman as he was now "useless". After Tommy Cairo mocked The Sandman, a guilt-stricken Dreamer challenged him to a match at [[November to Remember#1994|November to Remember]] on November 5, 1994. At the same event, Peaches attempted to reconcile with The Sandman. Woman interrupted the reconciliation, caning Peaches and threatening The Sandman. After Dreamer came to the ring to stop Woman, The Sandman revealed that he was not in fact blinded and attacked Dreamer, with his estrangement from Woman a ploy to pit Dreamer and Cairo against one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thom Loverro|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrGwTebNiUIC&amp;pg=PA66|date=22 May 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-6156-9|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1995, Woman again left The Sandman, aligning herself with [[Shane Douglas]]. At [[Hostile City Showdown#1995|Hostile City Showdown]] on April 15, 1995, she helped The Sandman defeat Douglas for his [[List of ECW World Heavyweight Champions|second]] [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] by striking him in the knee with a Singapore cane, revealing the turn to have been another ruse.

Following The Sandman's victory, Woman began carrying the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to ringside. Throughout mid-1995, she helped The Sandman defend his championship in a series of bouts with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]]. In September 1995, she began also managing The Sandman's ally, [[ECW World Television Championship|ECW World Television Champion]] [[2 Cold Scorpio]]. In late 1995, The Sandman began feuding with [[Mikey Whipwreck]], during which a controversial [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storyline]] began in which Woman became visibly [[sexual arousal|aroused]] while watching The Sandman cane Whipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott E. Williams|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4EQtAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89|date=13 December 2013|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-61321-582-1|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sandman's reign lasted until October 28, 1995, when he lost to Whipwreck in a [[ladder match]] after [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Stunning Steve Austin]] prevented Woman from interfering.

On October 28, 1995, 2 Cold Scorpio defeated [[Rocco Rock]] in a singles bout to win the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]], then selected The Sandman as his partner. The Sandman regained the ECW World Heavyweight Championship in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|three-way dance]] with Whipwreck and Austin at [[December to Dismember (1995)|December to Dismember]] on December 9, 1995, giving Woman control of all three championships.

On December 29, 1995 at [[Holiday Hell#1995|Holiday Hell]], Mikey Whipwreck defeated 2 Cold Scorpio in a singles match with the ECW World Tag Team Championship on the line. The Sandman's third reign as ECW World Heavyweight Champion lasted until January 27, 1996, when he lost to [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. On the January 27, 1996 episode of ''[[ECW Hardcore TV]]'', Woman announced that she was returning to World Championship Wrestling, parting ways with The Sandman and 2 Cold Scorpio.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996–1997)===
Woman made her return to WCW on the January 22, 1996 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' as one of many women who stood in the aisle and waved as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]] came to the ring. On the February 5 episode of ''Nitro'' she turned on Savage during his match with [[Chris Benoit]] and rejoined Flair, [[Arn Anderson]], [[Brian Pillman]], and Benoit in the then-current incarnation of the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]]. [[Miss Elizabeth]] also managed the [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]].

In 1996, Pillman had left the Horsemen, but they added [[Steve McMichael]] and his wife [[Debra Marshall|Debra]] in June,&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; which didn't sit well with Woman. In her next [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]], the two bickered, not getting along in general. The Four Horsemen were often given interview time on ''Nitro'' and when it came time for Debra to speak on the [[Microphone|mic]], she'd often go into a [[Monologue|soliloquy]] regarding Woman's [[Human physical appearance|looks]] and [[Fashion|fashion sense]] — usually when the two weren't within the vicinity of each other. Despite the heavy tension, the two managers never had a physical altercation.

At the same time, she started an on-screen relationship with Benoit, who at the time was involved in a feud with her real-life husband, Kevin Sullivan.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; On December 7, on ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'', during a post-match interview with Sullivan, a [[Home movies|home movie]] of the couple canoodling in a [[kitchen]] was played in front of him. Woman taunted Sullivan by saying, "You can't find me" and "I'm my own woman," while Benoit added: "You consider yourself the master of human [[chess]]. Well, my [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]] just took your [[Queen (chess)|queen]]". After the video, Sullivan stood there speechless, and his manager [[Jimmy Hart]] led him off stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/19961209.htm|title=This Week In WCW (12/07/96 – 12/09/96)|publisher=ddtdigest.com|accessdate=June 27, 2007|date=June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feud between Benoit and Sullivan saw Woman clashing with Sullivan's then-valet [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacquelyn]] at ringside. In one match, the two ladies were strapped together, took shots at each other, and used the strap connecting them as a weapon against the men.

Eventually, the Benoit-Nancy on-screen relationship developed into a real-life [[affair]] off-screen. Because of this, it is often joked that 'Kevin Sullivan booked his own divorce.'&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt;&lt;ref name=daytona/&gt; The two were indeed divorced in 1997. What's more, Sullivan lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Retirement match|retirement match]] to Benoit. His intent had been to retire from in-ring action and focus on [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booking]].&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt;

Nancy's final WCW appearance (and professional wrestling appearance as Woman) took place on May 26, 1997 on ''Monday Nitro'' as she accompanied Benoit to the ring for a confrontation with Jimmy Hart regarding the whereabouts of Sullivan, who wasn't in the arena.&lt;ref name=finalshow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/19970526.htm|title=This Week In WCW (05/24/97 – 05/26/97)|publisher=ddtdigest.com|accessdate=June 27, 2007|date=June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following week's show, Benoit came alone to ringside without her by his side. After managing him for a little over half a year, no reason was given for Woman's sudden disappearance, and she was never mentioned on WCW programming again.&lt;ref name=womangone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/19970602.htm|title=This Week In WCW (05/31/97 – 06/02/97)|publisher=ddtdigest.com|accessdate=June 27, 2007|date=June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Before her marriage to [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] in 1985, Nancy had previously been married to and divorced from Jim Daus.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt;

In early 1997, while Nancy was married to Sullivan, she was having an extramarital affair with Chris Benoit. Nancy and Benoit became engaged later in 1997 after her divorce from Sullivan, although Benoit referred to Nancy as only his fiancée even after they were married.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; She managed her husband's career from their home in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].

She gave birth to their son Daniel Christopher Benoit on February 25, 2000.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; Nancy married Chris Benoit on November 23, 2000.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; However, in May 2003, she filed for divorce, citing the marriage as "irrevocably broken" and alleging "cruel treatment."&lt;ref name=daytona/&gt;&lt;ref name=divorce&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/06/25/wrestler.dead.ap/index.html?cnn=yes |title=WWE star killed family, self |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=June 26, 2007 |date=June 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524052903/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/06/25/wrestler.dead.ap/index.html?cnn=yes |archivedate=May 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/0626_benoit_dismiss.pdf|format=PDF|title=Released divorce papers and restraining order|accessdate=June 27, 2007|publisher=TMZ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She dropped the suit in August 2003, as well as a restraining order filed on her husband.&lt;ref name="daytona"/&gt;&lt;ref name="divorce"/&gt;

In December 2005, Nancy had back and neck fusion surgery with [[Lloyd Youngblood]], the same surgeon who had previously done a 3–hour neck operation on Nancy's husband Chris on June 28, 2001.&lt;ref name=onlinewow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/w/woman.html|title=Woman's Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=July 9, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525124023/www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/w/woman.html|archivedate=May 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nancy's death in 2007, ''[[Hustler]]'' published nude photographs of Nancy from a shoot taken when Nancy was 20 years old. The length of time between the events caused controversy, causing critics to claim that Hustler owner [[Larry Flynt]] was attempting to capitalize on the event. The family of Nancy Benoit took legal action against Hustler. The appellate court ruled that, "The photographs published by [Flynt] neither relate to the incident of public concern conceptually [the murders] nor correspond with the time period during which Benoit was rendered, against her will, the subject of public scrutiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Bill Mears|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/02/justice/georgia-hustler-lawsuit/index.html?iref=obnetwork |title=Family of slain wrestler loses privacy appeal over nude pictures |publisher=CNN |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474978076409 |title=Nancy Benoit, Hustler Photos |author= |date=March 10, 2010 |work= |publisher=News.gather.com |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=20&amp;num=17946 |title=Nancy Benoit Nude Photos: Online Hustler Spread of WWE Star Chris Benoit's Wife |author=National Ledger |date=December 27, 2007 |work= |publisher=National Ledger |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307115054/http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=20&amp;num=17946 |archivedate=March 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Maternity Hospital''', Holles Street, [[Dublin]], popularly known as '''Holles Street Hospital''', is the largest [[maternity hospital]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Established through charitable donations in 1894, the hospital delivers over 10,000 babies per year. It is the national referral centre for complicated pregnancies, premature and sick infants. The main hospital building at Holles Street dates to the 1930s, but the complex has seen little substantial expansion in the last half-century, while the number of births it handles has increased by 50 per cent in the last two decades.&lt;ref name=holles&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thejournal.ie/holles-street-hospital-move-st-vincents-926761-May2013/ | title=National Maternity Hospital to leave Holles St in €150m move | publisher=TheJournal.ie | date=27 May 2013 | accessdate=2013-06-18 | author=Reilly, Gavan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital is located at the eastern corner of [[Merrion Square]], at its junction with Holles Street and Lower Mount Street.

==History==
In 1903 the Hospital received a Royal Charter, as had the other maternity hospitals in Dublin. Holles Street was the first hospital to benefit from the [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake]] which funded extensive redevelopment in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;'Dublin since 1922' By Tim Carey, Hachette Ireland, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 Antrim House on Merrion Square, was demolished to enable the development of the Hospital. Also in the 1930s the governance was altered specifying the Archbishop of Dublin (or a representative) as Chair of the board; the Lord Mayor of Dublin; and two City Councillors. The Minister of Health nominates two other members of the board.

In 1998  Holles Street set up the ''Domino'' (Domiciliary Care In and Out of Hospital) and Home birth scheme through its team of community midwives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eumom.ie/pregnancy/birth/preparing-for-birth/the-domino-scheme-explained|title=The Domino Scheme Explained|website=eumom.ie|access-date=28 April 2017|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NMH Foundation==
The National Maternity Hospital Foundation is a charity which raises funds for a number of projects in the Holles St. Hospital, with special emphasis on the neo-natal intensive care unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nmhfoundation.ie/about/our-mission|title=Our Mission|publisher=National Maternity Hospital Foundation|access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fun runs, Golf Classics and Fashion Shows are examples of some of the events used fund raising.

==Linen Guild==
The Linen Guild was established in 1912.  It is a charity to help mothers and babies in extreme poverty in Dublin. Its aim in the early years was to ensure no baby left hospital without a [[layette]] of night clothes, woollen jacket, nappies and a Foxford woollen blanket. Today its aim is to raise funds, for those mothers in need of financial assistance. (see also [[Maternity package]].)

==People associated with Holles Street==
[[Elizabeth O'Farrell]] a member of [[Cumann na mBan]], carried the white flag delivering the surrender in the [[Easter Rising|Easter Rising of 1916]]. She became a midwife, training and working in Holles Street. The annual award for academic excellence in midwifery is named in her honour.

The hospital is the setting for the 'Oxen of the Sun' episode of [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922).

==Controversy over involvement of the Catholic Church==
In May 2013 it was announced that the hospital would relocate to the site of [[St. Vincent's University Hospital]], Elm Park, a hospital founded in 1834 on by Mother Mary Aikenhead, foundress of the order [[Religious Sisters of Charity]].&lt;ref name=holles/&gt;

The new hospital is projected to cost €300 million, and be paid for by the Irish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/peter-boylan-new-maternity-hospital-should-not-be-given-to-sisters-of-charity-1.3055744|title=Peter Boylan: New maternity hospital should not be given to Sisters of Charity|first=Peter|last=Boylan|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to give the ownership of the hospital to its founders, the Sisters of Charity (an order of [[Roman Catholic]] [[nun]]s) caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/20/sisters-of-charity-abuse-maternity-hospital-irish-state|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 April 2017|first=Emer|last=O'Toole|title=The Sisters of Charity presided over abuse.

The master of the National Maternity Hospital, Rhona Mahony stated that the hospital would be independent and "the nuns will not be running this hospital, it will not be under Catholic ethos. It will be completely independent",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/national-maternity-hospital-will-be-completely-independent-mahony-1.3055036|date=20 April 2017|title=National Maternity Hospital ‘will be completely independent’ - Mahony|first=Vivienne|last=Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/rhona-mahony-new-hospital-will-revolutionise-healthcare-for-women-and-children-1.3061805|title=Rhona Mahony: New hospital will revolutionise healthcare for women and children

The [[Bishop of Elphin]], [[Kevin Doran]] said that the Religious Sisters of Charity would have to obey the rules of the [[Roman Catholic church]] if they become owners of the National Maternity Hospital, and to follow teachings on "the value of human life and the dignity and the ultimate destiny of the human person".&lt;ref name="sunday-times-2017-03-23" /&gt;

On 29 May 2017, in response to  weeks of pressure and public outrage, the Sisters of Charity announced that they were ending their role in St Vincent's Healthcare Group and would not be involved in the ownership or management of the new hospital; the two sisters on the board resigned.&lt;ref name=Graun&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/29/sisters-of-charity-nuns-give-up-role-in-dublin-maternity-hospital |title=Sisters of Charity give up role in Dublin maternity hospital |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 May 2017  |author= Henry McDonald  |accessdate= 29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deputies or Wikalah''' was a social, religious and economic institution that was active from [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]'s time to end of the [[Minor Occultation]] until 941 CE. Wikalah was responsible for the made relation between imams and Shia and collect religious taxes.
==Terminology==
The meaning of word wikalah that mean of ours is wikalah in Arabic means to let someone perform duties on behalf of someone especially when someone cannot accomplish his duties by himself.
In the other hands, wikalah in terms of jurisprudence is someone choose someone else as his agent who that someone has the right to interfere in Decision making and approving a Duty or to be the second person who can interfere in His affairs.
After the above definition, it can be seen that the wikalah are used when a person is unable to perform his duties by himself for reasons such as position and necessities and Imamas could not communicate with Shia by direct and usual ways.&lt;ref name="al-islam"/&gt;  
==History==
The Shia Imams frequently had to deal with persecution and sometimes resorted to the practice of taqiyya, a form of religious dissimulation, for protection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Illahi |first1=Mahboob |title=Doctrine of Terror: Saudi Salafi Religion |publisher=FriesenPress (October 2, 2018) |isbn=978-1525526466 |page=176-177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6w9xDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Doctrine+of+Terror:+Saudi+Salafi+Religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbkpz5ruLeAhVGKuwKHfN1DDsQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Doctrine%20of%20Terror%3A%20Saudi%20Salafi%20Religion&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
According to the critical situation of the Imams in this era,Imams was looking for a way to make connection with shia.Often deputies were acting Secretly from the Abbasid Caliphs and in some cases, they did not know that they were deputies of the Imams and work for them. &lt;ref name="Jassim M."&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hussain |first1=Jassim M. |title=The Occultation of the Twelfth Imam (A Historical Background) |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (October 12, 2014) |isbn=978-1502797506 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7LNoAEACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Occultation+of+the+Twelfth+Imam+(A+Historical+Background)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ9InQkeDeAhWHmbQKHVFwBpoQ6AEIJzAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Formation===
The network of agents (Wikalah) was established in  the time of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] and during the time was being Organized as far as it reached to the peak of its efficiency in the time of [[Hasan al-Askari]]&lt;ref name="q"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Robson |first=J. |title=Isnād |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/isnad-SIM_3665?s.num=0&amp;s.q=Isn%C4%81d&amp;s.f.s2_parent_title=Encyclopaedia+of+Islam%2C+Second+Edition |editor1-last=Bearman |editor1-first=P. |editor2-last=Bianquis |editor2-first=Th. |editor3-last=Bosworth |editor3-first=C.E. |editor4-last=van Donzel |editor4-first=E. |editor5-first=W.P. |editor5-last=Heinrichs |date=13 April 2010 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition=Second |publisher=Brill Online.

Hussain and [[Abdulaziz Sachedina]], deputies were responsible for managing the society.&lt;ref name="q"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jassim M."/&gt; Jassim M. Hussain said: "Gradually the leadership of the Wikalah became the only authority which could determine and prove the legitimacy of the new Imam."

For example, the ninth Imam, al‑Jawad said to the head of his deputies about installing Al-Hadi as next Imam. &lt;ref name="Jassim M."/&gt;    
===Minor occultation===
{{main|The Four Deputies}}
The Four Deputies or Gates ({{lang-ar|أبواب}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] (2011). [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bab-door-gate-entrance BĀB (1)]&lt;/ref&gt;, in [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]], were the four individuals who served as messengers between the community and the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|twelfth and final Imam]], upon his going into the [[Minor Occultation]]. The deputies are also referred to with the Arabic terms Safir (emissary), Na'ib (deputy)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Fitzpatrick|editor1-first=Coeli|editor2-last=Walker|editor2-first=Adam Hani|title=Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God [2 volumes]|date=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610691789|page=644|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Wakil (advocate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi|title=Divine Guide in Early Shi'ism, The: The Sources of Esotericism in Islam|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791494790|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Essence of Islam|date=2012|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788180698323|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelver tradition holds that four deputies acted in succession to one another from 873–941 CE:

# [[Uthman ibn Sa’id al-Asadi]] († 873-80)
# [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Uthman|Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Uthman ibn Sa’id al-Asadi]] († 917)
# [[Abul Qasim Husayn ibn Ruh al-Nawbakhti]] († 938)
# [[Abul Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri]] († 941)

The [[Major Occultation]] began following the death of the last deputy and, according the Shia doctrine, will continue until the return of the [[Mahdi]].
==Duties==
Wikalah were responsible to made the relation between imams and Shia and collect religious taxes ([[Khums]], [[Zakat]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hussain |first1=Jassim M. |title=The Occultation of the Twelfth Imam (A Historical Background) |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (December 6, 2013) |isbn=978-1494350987 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Occultation_of_the_Twelfth_Imam.html?id=ilfYAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sachedina |first1=Abdulaziz Abdulhussein |title=Islamic Messianism: The Idea of the Mahdi in Twelver Shi'ism |publisher=SUNY Press; 1st edition (June 1, 1981) |isbn=978-0873954587 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Islamic_Messianism.html?id=csmpQgAACAAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description}}&lt;/ref&gt; But next to it were responsible to guide the Shia and delivered letters containing religious questions.

'''Orrgo''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
Orrgo first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' vol. 1 #90 and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Orrgo appears in ''[[Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/articles/frank-barbiere-and-brent-schoonover-talk-about-shi/1100-152826/|title=Frank Barbiere &amp; Brent Schoonover Talk About S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Dirty Little Secret and the HOWLING COMMANDOS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Orrgo is a 25–30&amp;nbsp;ft. [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] "space god", who arrived on Earth and has tried to conquer it many times in the past. He arrived on Earth to display his superior powers over the humans. With his abilities, Orrgo took over the world quickly. With the human race under his mental domination, Orrgo went back to the circus where it first arrived and went to sleep. A circus gorilla named Jojo realized that it was the reason that it was not being fed. Jojo escaped from its cage and killed Orrgo. The human race was then freed from Orrgo's control as the rest of Orrgo's kind left thinking that the humans have defeated Orrgo.&lt;ref&gt;''Strange Tales'' #90&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Headmen]] later stole the God from Beyond from the museum and used it to summon Orrgo.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' Vol. 2 #5&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Headmen]] and [[MODOK]] summoned Orrgo using the God from Beyond statue. [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] fought Orrgo only to be defeated by him. Orrgo then went on to attack the city. After making volcanoes erupt, cities levitate, and populated areas burst into flames, Orrgo took control of the minds of Earth's population. The Headmen, MODOK, and the Defenders were not affected because they came in contact with the God from Beyond.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' Vol. 2 #9&lt;/ref&gt; When the Defenders attacked the Headmen's base, they ordered Orrgo to summon a supervillain army to fight them. While [[Doctor Strange]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Namor]], and [[Silver Surfer]] were busy fighting the villains, Hellcat, Nighthawk, and Valkyrie enter the base of the Headmen as Nighthawk seized the God from Beyond. With the God from Beyond in their possession, the Defenders ordered Orrgo to undo the damage that it caused. With the damage undone and the supervillains teleported back to where they came from, Doctor Strange stated that they could banish all evil from Earth. Hellcat broke the God from Beyond stating that it would be a violation of the free will to do such a thing. Upon being freed, Orrgo thought for itself again and threatened to devastate the planet. Hellcat reminded Orrgo that his race has always been defeated by the humans and asked if he really wanted to fight them. Orrgo decides to leave Earth and return when the humans are extinct.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' Vol. 2 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Through unknown means, Orrgo was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and placed in the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] Monster Force.&lt;ref&gt;''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Orrgo appears as a member of [[S.T.A.K.E.]], a S.H.I.E.L.D. division dealing with the supernatural. His commander is [[Dum Dum Dugan]], who lives on in a highly advanced Life Model Decoy body.{{issue|date=January 2016}}

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Orrgo appears as a member of S.T.A.K.E.'s Howling Commandos. Due to Orrgo's enormous size, he is not a field member of the team, but is used as technological support and communications. He enjoys chaotic events. Despite the very nature of many of his teammates, Orggo does not believe in the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Howling Commandos Of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #1–3 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, Orrgo was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed that Orrgo ended up in Pleasant Hill after Dr. Paul Kraye caught him going through his files. He alerted Maria Hill claiming that Orrgo went rogue and Orrgo was imprisoned at Pleasant Hill, where he was turned into a dog by Kobik. This led the Life Model Decoy of Dum Dum Dugan into finding Pleasant Hill and leading the Howling Commandos there in order to rescue Orrgo. Orrgo is rescued as the group is transported back to S.T.A.K.E. HQ by Kobik. Once back at S.T.A.K.E. HQ, Orrgo detects that Paul Kraye has released all the inmates there.&lt;ref&gt;''Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

Orrgo was with the Howling Commandos at the time when they help [[Old Man Logan]] rescue [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] from [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].&lt;ref&gt;''Old Man Logan'' Vol. 2 #14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|Monsters Unleashed]]'' storyline, Orrgo is among the monsters that helped to fight the Leviathon Tide.&lt;ref&gt;''Monsters Unleashed'' Vol. 2 #3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
Aside from his superhuman strength, Orrgo has great mental powers that seem to alter reality. He also possesses powerful lungs as he was able to blow people off their feet. He also seems to have some manner of freezing abilities.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Adventures===
In the ''[[Marvel Adventures]]'' continuity, Orrgo is shown to be roughly the size of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and continually boasts that he has "amazing mental powers". Immediately after a battle with the [[Fantastic Four]], Orrgo gains diplomatic immunity and shows up to judge a beauty contest where he proceeds to get into an argument with Ben over their terms of 'beauty'. Eventually [[Invisible Woman|Sue]] discovers through one of the contestants, Chili Storm, that the security team are actually agents of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and are looking to steal Orrgo's technology. The Four aid Orrgo in battling the agents before being stopped by Orrgo's powers. Orrgo then orders the agents to get jobs at a fast food restaurant, which [[Human Torch|Johnny]] calls cruel. Afterwards, Chili chooses to go out with Orrgo which he considers his revenge on Ben from an earlier fight.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four'' #35&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==

=== Video games ===
Orrgo appears as a boss and recruitable character in the mobile game ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]'' during the limited ''Monsters Unleashed!'' event, voiced by Scott Montiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voices.com/people/scottm#feedbacks|title=Scott Montiel|last=Voices.com|work=Voices.com|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Allen Warner praised his "goofy, crazy, over-the-top attitude and power set that make[s] him a great fit for the game, and perfect for an event that features a [[Devil Dinosaur|red dinosaur]] fighting a [[Fin Fang Foom|dragon from outer space]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/games/60727/monsters-unleashed-upon-marvel-avengers-academy/|title=Monsters Unleashed Upon 'Marvel Avengers Academy'|last=Snyder|first=Justin|date=2017-03-02|website=Marvel.com|publisher=|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pokémon Colosseum'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|ポケモンコロシアム||Pokemon Koroshiamu}}}} is a [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Genius Sonority]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and distributed by [[Nintendo]] as part of the ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' series. It was released for the [[GameCube]] on November 21, 2003, in Japan; March 22, 2004, in North America; and May 14, 2004, in Europe.

The game also features several battle modes for [[single-player video game|single-player]] and [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gameplay.

The game is set in the desertous region of Orre. The [[player character|player]] protagonist is Wes, a former member of [[Pokémon crime syndicates#Team Snagem|Team Snagem]]. Throughout the game, the player rescues "Shadow Pokémon"—Pokémon who have had their hearts darkened by [[Pokémon crime syndicates#Team Cipher|Team Cipher]], an antagonistic organization—via snagging. Rui, a [[non-player character]], serves as Wes's sidekick and identifies Shadow Pokémon.

''Pokémon Colosseum'' was exhibited at [[History of the Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2003]]. North American pre-orders were packaged with a bonus disc that allows the player to download the Pokémon [[Jirachi]]. Upon release, the game was generally well-received, with praise directed at its graphics and music. It was a commercial success, with 1.15 million copies sold in the United States and 656,270 in Japan.

This battle against the opponent's [[Trapinch]] and [[Numel]] is conducted on Mt. Battle, a common setting for battles.]]
''Pokémon Colosseum'' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] game viewed from a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective.&lt;ref name="racking"/&gt; The player, controlling a [[Pokémon Trainer]] named Wes (default name), moves through various towns and other locations (traversed using a type of one-wheeled motorcycle), battling enemy Trainers and completing quests. Items are purchased at "Pokémon Mart" locations using the game's currency, "Pokémon Dollars" ([[File:Pokébuck sign.png]]). When a battle starts, the screen switches to a [[time-keeping systems in games|turn-based]] interface where the player's and enemies' Pokémon fight. Most battles are of the "double battle" format, which means two Pokémon on each side at one time. However, each Trainer can carry up to six Pokémon at one time, so once a Pokémon is defeated, his or her Trainer must switch out another one unless no more are left. Battles are also conducted at "Colosseums" in several cities.&lt;ref name="update"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colloseum Update|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/490/490107p1.html|publisher=IGN|date=February 4, 2004|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most ''[[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]]'' games, ''Colosseum'' does not feature [[random encounter]]s. The player begins the game with two Pokémon. More are obtained throughout the game by "Snagging" them from other Trainers using [[Poké Ball]]s of various strengths. Only specifically designated "Shadow Pokémon", whose hearts have been artificially closed, can be Snagged.&lt;ref name="racking"/&gt; Pokémon can be traded between ''Colosseum'' and the [[Game Boy Advance]] games [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'', ''Sapphire'']], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'', ''LeafGreen'']], or ''[[Pokémon Emerald|Emerald]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

Each of the player's Shadow Pokémon has a purple gauge that is drained by battling and coming to like the player. Once a Pokémon's gauge is empty, the player may "Purify" the Pokémon by bringing him or her to [[Celebi (Pokémon)|Celebi]]'s shrine in Agate Village, or by using a rare "Time Flute" item. Purifying Shadow Pokémon is desirable because while in that status, they will often disobey the player, they cannot gain [[experience point]]s, and their moves are at first restricted to "Shadow Rush".&lt;ref name="gamespy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokémon Colosseum|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/pokemon-colosseum/502636p1.html|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=March 29, 2004|last=Vassar|first=Darryl|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Shadow Pokémon will sporadically enter "Hyper Mode" state during battle, causing them to disobey the player character or attack themselves until the condition is alleviated by selecting the "Call" battle command.&lt;ref name="update"/&gt;

Aside from the story mode, ''Colosseum'' also features several non-canonical battle modes. In the "Quick Battle" mode, the player can battle either CPU trainers or friends, using Pokémon obtained in the story mode or randomly assigned ones. Battles in this mode do not result in gain of experience points or money. In the [[single-player video game|single-player]] battle mode, the player competes at Colosseums—stadiums used throughout the game for Pokémon battles—and earns "Poké Coupons", another currency which can be used to buy rare items. In the "Gang Battle" mode, up to four players can compete in a tournament. The first can use Pokémon obtained in the story mode, or from the Game Boy Advance games. Players two through four, however, can only use Pokémon from the Game Boy Advance games.&lt;ref name="racking"/&gt;

===Setting===
''Pokémon Colosseum'' is set in the Orre region. Orre is a mostly desertous region in which no wild Pokémon can be found (although the sequel, ''Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness'', adds wild Pokémon spots to the region). Orre consists of many cities, towns, and Colosseums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokémon Colosseum Preview|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/strategy/pokemoncolosseum/news.html?sid=6091502&amp;mode=previews|publisher=GameSpot|last=Torres|first=Ricardo|date=March 15, 2004|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
The game's [[player character|player]] protagonist is by default named {{nihongo|Wes|レオ|Reo|Leo}}, but as with most ''Pokémon'' games, the player can change his name. Wes's [[Gameplay of Pokémon#Starter Pokémon|Starter Pokémon]] are [[Espeon and Umbreon]], two cat Pokémon who start at higher levels than most Starter Pokémon.&lt;ref name="gamezone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum - GC - Review|url=http://gamecube.gamezone.com/reviews/item/pokemon_colosseum_gc_review|publisher=GameZone|date=March 23, 2004|accessdate=June 16, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69wEmReG5?url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/pokemon_colosseum_gc_review|archivedate=August 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|Team Snagem|スナッチ団|Sunatchi-dan|Snatch Gang}}, a [[Pokémon crime syndicates|criminal organization]] that uses the "Snag machine" technology to capture the Pokémon of Trainers, serves as an antagonistic entity in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Colosseum|developer=[[Genius Sonority]]|year=2004|quote='''Newscaster:''' TEAM SNAGEM is a gang of POKéMON abductors who have already been marked for arrest.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shortly after the game's start, {{nihongo|Team Cipher|シャドー団|Shadō-dan|Shadow Gang}} is revealed to be the main antagonistic force, having partnered with Snagem to obtain Pokémon from Trainers, corrupting them, and distributing them throughout Cipher and other places such as Pyrite Town. Wes is a former employee of Team Snagem. The organization also employs many grunt workers, as well as four administrators: [[disco]]-loving {{nihongo|Miror B.|ミラーボ|Mirābo|Mirorbo}}, the explosively-tempered bodybuilder, {{nihongo|Dakim|ダキム|Dakimu}}, the queen of the Under, {{nihongo|Venus|ヴィーナス|Vīnasu}}, and the strategist of a  scientist, {{nihongo|Ein|ボルグ|Borugu|Borg}}.&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/strategy/pokemoncolosseum/review.html|date=March 22, 2004|last=Davis|first=Ryan|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
The game begins with a [[cold open]] in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Colosseum|developer=Genius Sonority|year=2004|quote='''Newscaster:''' The HIDEOUT was discovered only as a result of the explosion. By the time police arrived, the ruined building had already been abandoned.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a dilapidated train engine in the middle of the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Colosseum|developer=Genius Sonority|year=2004|quote='''Willie:''' Yo! Wait! Wait up! Hey, my name's WILLIE. After I got a good look at you, well, I got this urge to battle you. It's like I'm compelled to. Any way I look at it, it's obvious that you're no ordinary Joe. So what do you say? Let's you and me have a quick battle!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the [[oasis]]-esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Colosseum|developer=Genius Sonority|year=2004|quote='''Trudly:''' Yeah, you say that, but this... It won't stop squirming. Makes it tough to hold on.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Colosseum|developer=Genius Sonority|year=2004|quote='''Rui:''' Phew! Thank goodness! I'm saved! ...Where is this? Where did those two bring me?}}&lt;/ref&gt; a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Colosseum|developer=Genius Sonority|year=2004|quote='''Es Cade:''' Ah, you must be travelers! Welcome to PHENAC CITY! I am ES CADE, the MAYOR.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Colosseum|developer=Genius Sonority|year=2004|quote='''Rui:''' I saw a peculiar POKéMON... No, that's not quite right. What I saw was a POKéMON that gave off a black aura. It was like a fighting machine! And, that POKéMON could attack people! / '''Es Cade:''' O-o-o-oh, my! POKéMON like a fighting machine? And it attacks people?! Now, if that were true, that would be truly frightening. However, it is a little hard to believe.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon Colosseum|developer=Genius Sonority|year=2004|quote='''Grunt:''' But he's no ordinary member. He's a SNAGGER. He's the best in TEAM SNAGEM at Snagging POKéMON without fail!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.

As the game progresses, Wes becomes a target of a powerful organization known as Team Cipher. After leaving Phenac, he visits Pyrite Town, where Rui was kidnapped. In Pyrite, Shadow Pokémon are openly offered to winners of the town's Colosseum tournament. The local police force is powerless to stop the practice, so Duking, an influential man in Pyrite, asks Wes to enter the tournament and investigate. Wes enters the Colosseum challenge and defeats four trainers to win. Inside a nearby building, a Cipher [[Peon]] is about to present the Shadow Pokémon prize, but another one recognizes Wes. The pair then battle their way through the building and a maze-like cave set in the rock behind. Eventually, they face and defeat Miror B., one of four Cipher Admins. Afterwards, Wes returns a Pokémon Miror B. stole from Duking. A team of kids working in Duking's house introduce themselves as members of an anti-Cipher news network, known as the Kids Grid, who pledge their help to Wes and Rui.

Their next stop is Agate Village, a forested village in the mountains. As Rui introduces Wes to her grandfather Eagun, another villager runs into the room, telling them that the Relic Stone—a shrine protected by [[Celebi (Pokémon)|Celebi]]—is under attack. Wes, following Eagun to the center of the tree, fights off four Cipher agents before the Relic Stone is safe. After resting, Wes is given access to the Relic Stone, the only place where he can purify Shadow Pokémon. After receiving an e-mail from Duking about Mt. battle being under attack by Cipher, Rui asks Eagun where it is and the two headed over there.

Upon reaching Mt. Battle, people inform Wes and Rui that Cipher has already taken over the first section of the mountain. After battling nine other Trainers, Wes battles the Cipher administrator Dakim. Dakim owns a Shadow [[Entei]], who is one of the trio of legendary beasts. After defeating Dakim, Wes heads to The Under, which is an underground city located underneath Pyrite Town, and under the control of Cipher.&lt;ref name="theunder"/&gt; More members of the Kids Grid are here. They tell the player of Venus, another Cipher administrator, who has influence over The Under. After Wes confronts Venus, the owner of the second legendary beast [[Suicune]], she flees. Next, Wes and Rui head to the Shadow Pokémon Lab, where Pokémon are transformed into Shadow Pokémon. After defeating numerous Cipher [[peon]]s, Wes faces Ein, the final Cipher administrator and the owner of the final legendary beast [[Raikou]].

Wes and Rui then go to Realgam Tower. All four administrators are there and ready to face Wes again. After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum at the top of the building. There, he is greeted by a large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to be interrupted by Es Cade. Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice attempts to escape by helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon [[Ho-Oh]] swoops in and blasts it out of the sky. Evice and Nascour are sent to jail.

==Development and release==
''Pokémon Colosseum'' was developed by the Japanese game developer [[Genius Sonority]], and published by [[Nintendo]].&lt;ref name="release"/&gt; Just as [[Nintendo 64]] predecessors ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]'' had served as home console counterparts to the [[Pokémon#Generations|first- and second-generation]] handheld titles, ''Colosseum'' had a similar role for the third generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Got Shadow Pokémon?|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/pokemon/pokecol/pokecolprev.html|publisher=RPGamer|last=Harwood|first=Justin|accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new concept for ''Pokémon Colosseum'' was influenced by RPGs such as ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and ''[[Persona 2 (disambiguation)|Persona 2]]'' over the ''Pokémon'' mold.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; When asked in an interview with [[Prima Games]] why the gameplay of ''Colosseum'' did not mirror that of the handheld ''Pokémon'' games, ''Pokémon'' director [[Junichi Masuda]] explained: "How players communicate with each other has been key to the ''Pokémon'' games – it is the backbone of all ''Pokémon'' game designs. I feel that the handheld systems work better than the home-based consoles. It's certainly possible to come up with concepts for home-based consoles, but we might then have to change the core of the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pokédex: Collector's Edition|year=2004|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|last=Mylonas|first=Eric|page=222|isbn=0-7615-4761-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PhoenixDowntown.jpg|left|thumb|The city of [[Phoenix, Arizona]] was primarily used as the basis for the Orre region.]]
The transition to 3D also brought new graphical changes. Wes was designed to look "hazy" and about 17 years old.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:「新しいことをしよう」でスペシャリストたちがぞくぞく集結|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0311/soft/interv01.html|publisher=Nintendo.co.jp|accessdate=February 10, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genius Sonority ported most of the models and animations of first- and second-generation Pokémon from ''Stadium'' and ''Stadium 2''.&lt;ref name="gamespy"/&gt; Genius Sonority based most of Orre on the real-life city of [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. As a whole, the graphics were influenced more by [[manga]] than by established ''Pokémon'' convention.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

A preview for the game was hosted at [[History of the Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokémon Colosseum E3 2003 Preshow Report|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/strategy/pokemoncolosseum/news.html?sid=6027654&amp;mode=previews|last=Calvert|first=Justin|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 13, 2003|accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of development, ''Colosseum'' received a rating of "E" (Everyone) from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]], "All Ages" from [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization]], and "3+" from [[Pan European Game Information]]. The game was released on November 21, 2003 in Japan; March 22, 2004 in North America, and May 14, 2004 in Europe.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum for GameCube|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/strategy/pokemoncolosseum/similar.html?mode=versions|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nintendo also published supplementary media to unlock additional content. Pre-ordered copies of the game came with a bonus disc that contains trailers for the game and the film ''[[Pokémon: Jirachi Wish Maker]]''. The North American disc also contains the exclusive Pokémon [[Jirachi]] that can be downloaded to the player's copy of ''Ruby'' or ''Sapphire''. The Japanese release contains a downloadable Celebi instead and requires a completed save file of Pokémon Colosseum. The disc also updates the software in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' to remove a "berry glitch" discovered in 2003. Despite public anticipation the Bonus Disc was not released in PAL territories, prompting Nintendo to issue an official apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jirachi|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/491/491109p1.html|last=Harris|first=Craig|publisher=IGN|authorlink=Craig Harris|date=February 9, 2004|accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a Jirachi was later included in the PAL version of the game [[Pokémon Channel]].

''Pokémon Colosseum'' was generally well-received upon release, with respective scores of 73/100 and 73.46% from aggregators [[Metacritic]] and [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name="gamerankings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum for GameCube|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gamecube/914973-pokemon-colosseum/index.html|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/pokemon-colosseum|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allgame]] staff writer Scott Alan Marriott gave the game three and a half stars out of five, although he did not review the game with more depth.&lt;ref name="allgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokémon Colosseum|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=43549|publisher=[[Allgame]]|last=Marriott|first=Scott Alan|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics praised ''Colosseum'' as the first true 3D role-playing installment in the ''Pokémon'' series. Gamers Hell reviewer John K. called it "certainly a step in the right direction to a good 3D ''Pokémon'' game", although he felt that the limited number of Pokémon and lack of a true [[overworld]] detracted from the experience.&lt;ref name="gamershell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum Review|url=http://www.gamershell.com/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum/review.html|publisher=Gamers Hell|author=John K.|accessdate=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] staff writer Craig Harris said that the adaptation of the ''Pokémon'' RPG formula to the 3D zeitgeist "does a decent enough job" and is "a bit more linear and straightforward".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/500/500909p1.html|last=Harris|first=Craig|authorlink=Craig Harris|date=March 22, 2004|accessdate=April 1, 2010|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new 3D graphics received mixed remarks. Harris called the game "[g]raphically ... a mixed bag", praising the visual style of the game's Pokémon but criticizing the "poorly modeled and animated, angular" style of the Trainers.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] reviewer Ryan Davis offered a similar opinion, concluding that "[t]he visual style ... has gone off the deep end".&lt;ref name="gamespot"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' writer Star Dingo called the graphics as a whole "insanely cute" but criticized the lack of animations showing two Pokémon attacking in tandem.&lt;ref name="gamepro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum|last=Dingo|first=Star|date=April 22, 2004|publisher=''[[GamePro]]''|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/35148/pok-mon-colosseum/|accessdate=June 16, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/35148/pok-mon-colosseum/&amp;date=2011-12-01+05:22:42|archivedate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameZone's review took a more positive stance, saying that "[a]nimations are brief but impressive; each attack move is more elaborate and more extravagant on the 'Cube."&lt;ref name="gamezone"/&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' thought similarly, commending the "amazing level of detail".&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|title=Pokémon Colosseum|page=119|date=May 2004|issue=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameZone compared the overall town design and environments to those of the landmark ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.&lt;ref name="gamezone"/&gt; Dingo complained that "there are some characters to talk to and chests to find, but no 'overworld' with free-roaming monsters to capture."&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt; John K. stated that "[t]he towns are made with enough detail, but sometimes a bit dull."&lt;ref name="gamershell"/&gt;

Harris denounced the game's usage of old Pokémon battle cries, a recurring complaint of the series.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Dingo called the music as a whole "a bit too low-tech and synthetic".&lt;ref name="gamepro"/&gt; GameZone, in contrast, stated that the sound effects evoke nostalgia for [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']], and that the music tracks "have more depth than any of the songs from the previous {{sic|Poke|mon}} games."&lt;ref name="gamezone"/&gt; John K. said that the music is neither annoying nor entertaining.&lt;ref name="gamershell"/&gt; [[Retronauts]] described ''Colosseum'' as "terrible", citing the reuse of graphics from the ''Pokémon Stadium'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retronauts|url=http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/podcast.the1upnetwork.com/flat/Retronauts/R030611.mp3|publisher=[[1UP Shows and Podcasts]]|accessdate=March 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E9wUJBlg?url=http://podcast.the1upnetwork.com/flat/Retronauts/R030611.mp3|archivedate=February 3, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
''Pokémon Colosseum'' spawned a high-profile tournament in the United Kingdom entitled "Pokémon Colosseum Battlemaster 2004". The first round of battles was held at [[Toys "R" Us]] locations, with later battles taking place in [[movie theater]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokémon Colosseum Battlemaster 2004 competition!|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=103463|publisher=Computer and Video Games|date=April 19, 2004|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across Europe, the game was bundled with GameCube consoles shortly after its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Pokémon Colosseum GC bundle for Europe!|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=102340|publisher=Computer and Video Games|date=March 11, 2004|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special editions of this set also included a copy of ''[[Pokémon Box: Ruby and Sapphire]]''
—a game that allows players to organize and store up to 1,500 Pokémon from their games—as well as a memory card and a Game Boy Advance–GameCube link cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon Colosseum and Box Pak|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/506/506548p1.html|publisher=IGN|date=April 14, 2004|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[manga]] adaptation of ''Colosseum''{{'}}s plot was printed in 2004 issues of the Japanese magazine ''[[CoroCoro Comic]]'' and titled {{nihongo|''Pokémon Colosseum Snatcher Leo''|ポケモンコロシアムスナッチャーズレオ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|script-title=ja:スペシャルコミック: スナッチャー・レオ|journal=[[CoroCoro Comic]]|language=Japanese|date=January 2004|page=26&lt;!-- http://oouchisuigun.vow.ne.jp/reo.html --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was followed by a 2005 sequel entitled ''[[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]''. Set in Orre five years after ''Colosseum'', it features a new protagonist snagging Shadow Pokémon from Team Cipher. Shadow [[Lugia]] is the game's mascot, and serves as an antagonist whom the player can snag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/rpg/pokemongc/review.html|publisher=GameSpot|date=October 10, 2005|last=Mueller|first=Greg|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game alludes to Wes, Rui, and The Under, though they do not appear.&lt;ref name="theunder"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness|developer=Genius Sonority|year=2005|quote='''Old man:''' There once was a town ruled by CIPHER beneath the cliff here.

They went and buried THE UNDER to prevent people from getting to the abandoned town site. It's sad to see my hometown go like that.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Keith Dibble''' (born January 24, 1964) is an American former [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[pitcher]] and television analyst. Between 1988 and 1995, Dibble played for the [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. He was a two-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] who recorded 89 [[Save (baseball)|saves]] during his career. Since retiring as a player, Dibble has held several roles in sports television broadcasting.

==Personal life==
Dibble was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. He attended St. Thomas School, a [[parochial school]], and is a graduate of [[Southington High School]] in [[Southington, Connecticut]].  Dibble's father, Walt Dibble, was a longtime radio news director at [[WDRC-FM|WDRC]] and later [[WTIC (AM)|WTIC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].

==Playing career==

===Cincinnati Reds===
Dibble was drafted by the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in the first round of the 1983 amateur draft, and he made his debut with the Reds on June 29, 1988.

On June 4, 1989, Dibble struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning of a 5–3 win over the [[San Diego Padres]]. Dibble is one of 41 pitchers in Major League history to accomplish the [[Pitchers who struck out three batters on nine pitches|nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning]], a feat known as an immaculate inning.

He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] in [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1990]] and [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1991]], and was the [[1990 National League Championship Series|1990 NLCS]] [[Most Valuable Player]] (along with fellow "[[Nasty Boys (Cincinnati Reds)|Nasty Boy]]" [[Randy Myers]]). In 1990, Dibble and the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the [[1990 World Series|World Series]] by beating the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in four consecutive games.

Dibble recorded his 500th career strikeout in fewer innings—368—than any other pitcher in modern baseball history up to that point (a record that is currently held by [[Craig Kimbrel]]).

====Temper====
During his career Dibble was known for his temper. During a game in July 1989, he hit [[1989 New York Mets season|Mets]] second basemen [[Tim Teufel]] in the back with a pitch; Teufel then [[charging the mound|charged]] Dibble, causing a benches clearing brawl. After saving a game in April 1991 despite giving up two runs in relief, Dibble threw a baseball 400 feet into the center-field seats at Cincinnati, inadvertently striking a woman.&lt;ref name=4May1991port&gt;{{cite news|title=National League suspends Dibble for 4 games for firing ball into stands|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hkRGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P9EMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2876,369254|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=[[Portsmouth Daily Times]]|date=4 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt4May1991&gt;{{cite news|title=A New Suspension for Reds' Dibble|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/04/sports/baseball-a-new-suspension-for-reds-dibble.html|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=4 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truebaseballstories"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shannon|first=Mike|title=Tales from the Dugout: The Greatest True Baseball Stories Ever Told|year=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-8092-2950-1|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y17fnEHFIcsC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=rob+dibble+temper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jtWuseI7dN&amp;sig=FKTLECwOrf_nNGQC6vsZHQHIUv4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p0T4S7-TLoKdlgedntnECg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rob%20dibble%20temper&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved in a brawl in 1991 with [[1991 Houston Astros season|Astros]] shortstop [[Eric Yelding]].&lt;ref name=nyt4May1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name="spartanburg"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dibble, Yielding suspended|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19910418&amp;id=OuoeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NM4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5474,749743|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal|date=April 18, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1991 season, he threw a baseball into the back of [[1991 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] outfielder [[Doug Dascenzo]] as he ran down the first base line and was subsequently ejected from the game.&lt;ref name="nytimes_july261991"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vescey|first=Peter|title=Sports of The Times; Rob Dibble: The Pitcher Most Likely|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-rob-dibble-the-pitcher-most-likely.html|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 26, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dibble also was involved in a brawl with manager [[Lou Piniella]] in the Reds clubhouse after a game in 1992.&lt;ref name="la_times1992"&gt;{{cite news|title=Piniella, Dibble Brawl in Clubhouse|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-18/sports/sp-723_1_major-league|accessdate=22 May 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 18, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Dibble required surgery to his pitching arm in 1994, and missed the entire season as a result. Dibble signed with the [[1995 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] and also played with the [[1995 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]]. He signed with the [[1995 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] at the end of the 1995 season, but voluntarily retired from the team the following March after a rough spring. Weeks later, he opted to make a comeback, signing a minor league contract on April 14, 1996 with the [[1996 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]],&lt;ref name="sunsentinel_apr171996"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=David|title=Marlins Taking A Chance On Dibble|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-04-17/sports/9604160589_1_dibble-marlins-reliever-matt-mantei|accessdate=6 March 2018|newspaper=Sun-Sentinel|date=April 17, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Dibble would ultimately see no game action with the Marlins or their minor league affiliates.

==Broadcasting career==
[[File:Rob Dibble 2009.jpg|thumb|Dibble with the Nationals in 2009.]]
In 1998, Dibble joined [[ESPN]] as a [[baseball]] analyst, working mostly on [[Dan Patrick]]'s radio show. He worked on ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'' as a co-host until 2008, when he left to join FOX on their Saturday baseball program as an analyst. Dibble also spends time as a co-host/analyst of First Pitch on [[XM]] Channel 175/Sirius channel 210. He formerly hosted ''The Show'' (on the same channel) with [[Jody McDonald]]. Dibble served as co-analyst (with [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]]) for [[FOXSports.com]] on a weekly video segment entitled "Around the Bases." Dibble also is a co-host with former Major League player [[Denny Hocking]] on Fox Sports Radio Sunday night programming. In 2009, Dibble signed a three-year contract to replace [[Don Sutton]] as the color voice of the [[Washington Nationals]] on [[MASN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/06/on-masn-dibble-wont-be-so-nasty/ Dibble not so 'nasty']. Washington Times (2009-04-06). Retrieved on 2011-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

While broadcasting a game in August 2010, Dibble drew negative attention for focusing on a group of female spectators in the Nationals crowd, and questioning their focus on the game.&lt;ref name="washpostWomen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Dan|title=Rob Dibble amazed by women at baseball game |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dcsportsbog/2010/08/rob_dibble_amazed_by_women_at.html|work=D.C.

This is your profession. You chose to be a baseball player. You can't have the cavalry come in and save your butt every time you feel a little stiff shoulder, sore elbow."&lt;ref name=espnwaiver /&gt;&lt;ref name=steinbergStrass&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Dan Steinberg|last=Steinberg|first=Dan|title=Rob Dibble to Stephen Strasburg: "Suck it up"|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dcsportsbog/2010/08/rob_dibble_to_stephen_strasbur.html|work=D.C.

Sports Bog – [[The Washington Post|WashingtonPost.com]]|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Dibble said in an interview on [[FoxSports.com]] that the reason for his dismissal was because of an email Strasburg's father sent to the [[Ted Lerner|Lerner Family]], the owners of the Nationals.&lt;ref name=usatoday7Apr2011&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Paul|title=Rob Dibble thinks Stephen Strasburg's dad cost him his job|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2011/04/rob-dibble-think-stephen-strasburgs-dad-cost-him-his-job/1|accessdate=15 April 2011|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dibble also continued to express his belief that Strasburg should have pitched through his pain.&lt;ref name=msnbc7Apr&gt;{{cite web|last=Calcaterra|first=Craig|title=Rob Dibble still thinks Stephen Strasburg should have "sucked it up|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/07/rob-dibble-still-thinks-steven-strasburg-should-have-sucked-it-up/|work=[[msnbc]]|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wpKilgore15Apr&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilgore|first=Adam|title=Stan Kasten: Rob Dibble’s account of his firing ‘fictional’ and ‘sad’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/post/stan-kasten-rob-dibbles-account-of-his-firing-fictional-and-sad/2011/04/08/AFGySm3C_blog.html|work=Nationals Journal – [[The Washington Post|WashingtonPost.com]] blog|accessdate=15 April 2011|date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strasburg denied the claim about his father's e-mail, and [[Stan Kasten]], the president of the Nationals,  called Dibble's account "fictional" and "sad".&lt;ref name=wpKilgore15Apr /&gt;&lt;ref name=short_9Apr&gt;{{cite web|last=Short|first=D.J.|title=We have a war of words between Stan Kasten and Rob Dibble|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/09/we-have-a-war-of-words-between-stan-kasten-and-rob-dibble/|work=[[msnbc]]|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 31, 2011, Dibble became a member of Mike North's talk radio show.

'''Tasa Konević Apostolović''' ({{lang-sr|Таса Коневић Апостоловић}}{{Cref2|a}}; d. 1916) was an Orthodox priest and Macedonian Serb Chetnik from [[Krapa, Republic of Macedonia|Krapa]] in [[Poreče]]. He was the son of a local Serb chief, Kone Apostolović, who was the leader of the Prilep Serbs at the end of the 19th century, and one of the richest in the village. Priest Tasa was the protector of Serbdom in Poreče and led the local guerrilla organization. He participated in the [[Ilinden Uprising]] (July–August 1903), orchestrated by the Bulgarian-organized [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO), with a Serb band. After the [[Kokošinje slaughters]] (July–October 1904) and IMRO attacks on Macedonian Serbs, he organized the village self-defense units and joined [[Gligor Sokolović]] and his neighbour [[Trenko Rujanović]], of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]]. Tasa defended and administrated the village throughout the [[Macedonian Struggle]]. An important event was the attack on Krapa by combined bands of the IMRO, which ended in a fight on [[Kurt's Stone]] won by the Serbian bands. Tasa was murdered in 1916, in the [[Derviš fields massacre]] when the occupying Bulgarian Army executed 104 Serb leaders from Poreče.&lt;ref&gt;Trbić 1996, pp. 82–92&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''transient ischemic attack''' ('''TIA''') is a brief episode of neurological dysfunction caused by loss of blood flow ([[ischemia]]) in the [[Brain ischemia#Focal brain ischemia|brain]], [[spinal cord]], or [[Ocular ischemic syndrome|retina]], without tissue death ([[infarct]]ion).&lt;ref name="Easton09"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easton|first1=JD|last2=Saver|first2=JL|last3=Albers|first3=GW|last4=Alberts|first4=MJ|last5=Chaturvedi|first5=S|last6=Feldmann|first6=E|last7=Hatsukami|first7=TS|last8=Higashida|first8=RT|last9=Johnston|first9=SC|date=June 2009|title=Definition and evaluation of transient ischemic attack: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Stroke Council; Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia; Council on Cardiovascular Radiology and Intervention; Council on Cardiovascular Nursing; and the Interdisciplinary Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease.

Both are caused by a disruption in [[cerebral blood flow|blood flow to the brain, or cerebral blood flow]] (CBF). The definition of TIA was classically based on duration of neurological symptoms. The current widely-accepted definition is called "tissue-based" because it is based on imaging, not time. The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) now define TIA as a brief episode of neurological dysfunction with a [[Blood vessel|vascular]] cause, with clinical symptoms typically lasting less than one hour, and without evidence of [[infarction]] on [[Radiological imaging|imaging]].&lt;ref name="Easton09" /&gt;

TIA causes the same [[Symptoms of stroke|symptoms associated with stroke]], such as paralysis, weakness, or numbness on one side of the body. Symptoms occur on the opposite side of the body from the affected hemisphere of the brain ([[contralateral]] [[hemiparesis]] or [[Numbness|hemianesthesia]]). A TIA may cause sudden dimming or loss of vision ([[amaurosis fugax]]), difficulty speaking or understanding language ([[aphasia]]), slurred speech ([[dysarthria]]), and confusion ([[altered mental status]]).

TIA and ischemic stroke share a common cause. Both result from a disruption in blood flow to the [[central nervous system]]. In ischemic stroke, symptoms generally persist beyond 7 days. In TIA, symptoms typically resolve within 1 hour. The occurrence of a TIA is a risk factor for eventually having a stroke.&lt;ref name="Easton09" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferro |first=J. M. |title=Diagnosis of transient ischemic attack by the nonneurologist. A validation study |year=1996 |journal=Stroke |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=2225–9 |pmid=8969785 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.27.12.2225 |first2=I. |last2=Falcão  |last3=Rodrigues |first3=G. |last4=Canhao |first4=P. |last5=Melo |first5=T.P. |last6=Oliveira |first6=V. |last7=Pinto |first7=A.N. |last8=Crespo |first8=M. |last9=Salgado |first9=A.V.  |display-authors=etal |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8969785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are associated with increased risk of death or disability. Recognition that a TIA has occurred is an opportunity to start treatment, including medications and lifestyle changes, to prevent a stroke.

While a TIA must by definition be associated with symptoms, a stroke may be symptomatic or silent. In [[silent stroke]], also known as silent cerebral infarct (SCI), there is permanent infarction present on imaging, but there are no immediately observable symptoms. An SCI often occurs before or after a TIA or major stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coutts |first=S. B. |title=Silent ischemia in minor stroke and TIA patients identified on MR imaging |journal=[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]] |year=2005 |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=513–7 |pmid=16116107 |doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000169031.39264.ff |first2=M.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of TIA are widely variable and can mimic other neurologic conditions, making the clinical context and physical exam crucial in ruling in or out the diagnosis. The most common presenting symptoms of TIA are focal neurologic deficits, which can include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Panuganti KK, Chan J. Transient Ischemic Attack. [Updated 2017 Oct 6]. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): ''StatPearls Publishing''; 2017 Jun-. Available from: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459143/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amaurosis fugax]] (painless, temporary loss of vision)
* One-sided facial droop
* One-sided motor weakness
* [[Diplopia]] (double vision)
* [[Vertigo|Problems with balance and spatial orientation]]
A detailed neurologic exam, including a thorough cranial nerve exam, is important to identify these findings and to differentiate them from mimickers of TIA. Symptoms such as unilateral weakness, amaurosis fugax, and double vision have higher odds of representing TIA compared to memory loss, headache, and blurred vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Amort M, Fluri F, Schäfer J ''et al.'' | year = 2011 | title = Transient ischemic attack versus transient ischemic attack mimics: frequency, clinical characteristics and outcome | url = | journal = Cerebrovasc Dis | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 57–64 | doi=10.1159/000327034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a table of symptoms at presentation, and what percentage of the time they are seen in TIAs versus conditions that mimic TIA. In general, [[Focal neurologic signs|focal deficits]] make TIA more likely, but the absence of focal findings do not exclude the diagnosis and further evaluation may be warranted if clinical suspicion for TIA is high (see “Diagnosis” section below).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simmons B, Cirignano B, Gadegbeku A | date = Sep 2012 | title = Transient Ischemic Attack: Part I.

Symptoms of TIAs can last on the order of minutes to 1–2 hours, but occasionally may last for a longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/AboutStroke/TypesofStroke/TIA/Transient-Ischemic-Attack-TIA_UCM_492003_SubHomePage.jsp#|title=Transient Ischemic Attack|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Easton JD, Saver JL, Albers GW ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Definition and evaluation of transient ischemic attack | doi=10.1161/strokeaha.108.192218 | journal = Stroke | volume = 40 | issue = 6| pages = 2276–2293 | pmid=19423857}}&lt;/ref&gt; TIAs used to be defined as ischemic events in the brain that last less than 24 hours, but given the variation in duration of symptoms, this definition holds less significance.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A pooled study of 808 patients with TIAs from 10 hospitals showed that 60% lasted less than 1 hour, 71% lasted less than 2 hours, and 14% lasted greater than 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shah SH, Saver JL, Kidwell CS, Albers GW, Rothwell PM, Ay H, Koroshetz WJ, Inatomi Y, Uchino M, Demchuk AM, Coutts SB, Purroy F, Alvarez-Sabin JS, Sander D, Sander K, Restrepo L, Wityk RJ, Marx JJ, Easton JD | year = 2007 | title = A multicenter pooled, patient-level data analysis of diffusion-weighted MRI in TIA patients | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 38 | issue = | page = 463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, patients with symptoms that last more than one hour are more likely to have permanent neurologic damage, making prompt diagnosis and treatment important to maximize recovery.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Causes and pathogenesis ==
There are three major mechanisms of ischemia in the brain: [[embolism]] traveling to the brain, in situ thrombotic occlusion in the [[Circle of Willis|intracranial vessels]] supplying the parenchyma of the brain, and [[stenosis]] of vessels leading to poor perfusion secondary to flow-limiting diameter.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Globally, the vessel most commonly affected is the [[middle cerebral artery]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Embolisms can originate from multiple parts of the body. The most common underlying pathology leading to TIA and stroke is a cardiac condition called [[atrial fibrillation]], where poor coordination of contraction leads to a formation of a clot in the atrial chamber that can become dislodged and travel to a [[Cerebral arteries|cerebral artery]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Unlike in [[stroke]], the blood flow can become restored prior to [[infarction]] which leads to the resolution of neurologic symptoms.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Another common culprit of TIA is an [[Atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]] located in the [[common carotid artery]], typically by the bifurcation between the internal and external carotids, that becomes an embolism to the brain vasculature similar to the clot in the prior example.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; A portion of the plaque can become dislodged and lead to embolic pathology in the cerebral vessels.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Smith WS, Johnston S, Hemphill J, III. Cerebrovascular Diseases. In: Kasper D, Fauci A, Hauser S, Longo D, Jameson J, Loscalzo J. eds. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19e New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In-situ [[thrombosis]], an obstruction that forms directly in the cerebral vasculature unlike the remote embolism previously mentioned, is another vascular occurrence with possible presentation as TIA.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Also, [[Carotid artery stenosis|carotid stenosis]] secondary to atherosclerosis narrowing the diameter of the lumen and thus limiting blood flow is another common cause of TIA.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Individuals with carotid stenosis may present with TIA symptoms, thus labeled symptomatic, while others may not experience symptoms and be asymptomatic.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Risk factors===
Risk factors associated with TIA are categorized as modifiable or non-modifiable. Non-modifiable risk factors include age greater than 55, sex, family history, genetics, and race/ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Modifiable risk factors include cigarette [[smoking]], [[hypertension]] (elevated blood pressure), [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hyperlipidemia]], level of [[carotid artery stenosis]] (asymptomatic or symptomatic) and activity level.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Kim JS, Caplan LR, Wong KS: Intracranial Atherosclerosis: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Treatment. Front Neurol Neurosci. Basel, Karger, 2016; 40: 58-71  (DOI:10.1159/000448302).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Boehme AK, Esenwa C, Elkind MSV. Stroke Risk Factors, Genetics, and Prevention. Stroke Compendium Circulation Research. 2017;120 (3):472-495. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.308398&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The modifiable risk factors are commonly targeted in treatment options to attempt to minimize risk of TIA and stroke.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of TIA involves a combination of asking the patient questions about their symptoms and medical history, physical exam, and head imaging. History taking includes defining the symptoms and looking for mimicking symptoms as described above. Bystanders can be very helpful in describing the symptoms and giving details about when they started and how long they lasted. The time course (onset, duration, and resolution), precipitating events, and risk factors are particularly important. Finally, a thorough review of symptoms is necessary to rule in or out other items on the differential diagnosis of TIA. These include, but are not limited to:

After taking the patient’s history, a thorough neurologic exam is needed to identify focal neurologic deficits, paying attention to the cranial nerve, motor, sensory, and coordination components of the exam. After the history and physical exam, clinicians may move on to laboratory workup and imaging.

'''Laboratory workup'''

Laboratory tests should focus on ruling out metabolic conditions that may mimic TIA (e.g. hypoglycemia causing altered mental status), in addition to further evaluating a patient’s risk factors for ischemic events. All patients should receive a complete blood count with platelet count, blood glucose, basic metabolic panel, [[prothrombin time]]/[[International Normalized Ratio|international normalized ratio]], and [[activated partial thromboplastin time]] as part of their initial workup.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adams HP Jr, del Zoppo G, Alberts MJ ''et al.'' | year = 2007 | title = "Guidelines for the early management of adults with ischemic stroke " a guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Stroke Council, Clinical Cardiology Council, Cardiovascular Radiology and Intervention Council, and the Atherosclerotic Peripheral Vascular Disease and Quality of Care Outcomes in Research Interdisciplinary Working Groups: the American Academy of Neurology affirms the value of this guideline as an educational tool for neurologists [published corrections appear in ''Stroke''. 2007;38(9) e96, and ''Stroke''. 2007;38(6) e38] | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 38 | issue = 5| pages = 1655–1711 | doi=10.1161/strokeaha.107.181486}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests help with screening for bleeding or [[Hypercoagulability|hypercoagulable]] conditions. An electrocardiogram is necessary to rule out abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation, that can predispose patients to clot formation and embolic events.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Other lab tests, such as a full hypercoagulable state workup or serum drug screening, should be considered based on the clinical situation and factors, such as age of the patient and family history.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A fasting lipid panel is also appropriate to thoroughly evaluate the patient’s risk for atherosclerotic disease and ischemic events in the future.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to guidelines from the [[American Heart Association]] and [[American Stroke Association]] Stroke Council, patients with TIA should have head imaging “within 24 hours of symptom onset, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion sequences”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; MRI is a better imaging modality for TIA than computed tomography (CT), as it is better able to pick up both new and old ischemic lesions than CT. CT, however, is more widely available and can be used particularly to rule out intracranial hemorrhage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Diffusion sequences can help further localize the area of ischemia and can serve as prognostic indicators.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Presence of ischemic lesions on [[Diffusion-weighted imaging|diffusion weighted imaging]] has been correlated with a higher risk of stroke after a TIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Redgrave JN, Coutts SB, Schulz UG, Briley D, Rothwell PM | year = 2007 | title = Systematic review of associations between the presence of acute ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging and clinical predictors of early stroke risk after transient ischemic attack | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 1482–1488 | doi=10.1161/strokeaha.106.477380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vessels in the head and neck may also be evaluated to look for [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] lesions that may benefit from interventions, such as [[carotid endarterectomy]]. The vasculature can be evaluated through the following imaging modalities: [[magnetic resonance angiography]] (MRA), [[CT angiography]] (CTA), and [[carotid ultrasonography]]/transcranial doppler ultrasonography.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Carotid ultrasonography is often used to screen for carotid artery stenosis, as it is more readily available, is noninvasive, and does not expose the person being evaluated to radiation. However, all of the above imaging methods have variable [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivities and specificities]], making it important to supplement one of the imaging methods with another to help confirm the diagnosis (for example: screen for the disease with ultrasonography, and confirm with CTA).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/carotid-artery-stenosis-screening|title=Final Recommendation Statement: Carotid Artery Stenosis: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirming a diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis is important because the treatment for this condition, [[carotid endarterectomy]], can pose significant risk to the patient, including heart attacks and strokes after the procedure.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For this reason, the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) "recommends against screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the general adult population".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This recommendation is for asymptomatic patients, so it does not necessarily apply to patients with TIAs as these may in fact be a symptom of underlying carotid artery disease (see "Causes and Pathogenesis" above). Therefore, patients who have had a TIA may opt to have a discussion with their clinician about the risks and benefits of screening for carotid artery stenosis, including the risks of surgical treatment of this condition.

Cardiac imaging can be performed if head and neck imaging do not reveal a vascular cause for the patient’s TIA (such as atherosclerosis of the carotid artery or other major vessels of the head and neck). Echocardiography can be performed to identify [[patent foramen ovale]] (PFO), valvular stenosis, and atherosclerosis of the aortic arch that could be sources of clots causing TIAs, with [[transesophageal echocardiography]] being more sensitive than [[transthoracic echocardiography]] in identifying these lesions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring can be considered to rule out arrhythmias like paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that may lead to clot formation and TIAs, however this should be considered if other causes of TIA have not been found.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Prevention ==
Although there is a lack of robust studies demonstrating the efficacy of lifestyle changes in preventing TIA, many medical professionals recommend them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Transient-ischaemic-attack/Pages/Prevention.aspx |title=Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) - Prevention - NHS Choices |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=2014-10-15 |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* Avoiding [[smoking]]
* Cutting down on fats to help reduce the amount of plaque build up
* Eating a healthy diet including plenty of fruits and vegetables
* Limiting [[sodium]] in the diet, thereby reducing blood pressure
* Exercising regularly
* Moderating intake of [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[stimulants]], [[sympathomimetic drug|sympathomimetics]], etc.
* Maintaining a healthy weight
In addition, it is important to control any underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of stroke or TIA, including:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Hypertension
* High cholesterol
* Diabetes mellitus
* Atrial fibrillation

== Treatment ==
By definition, TIAs are transient, self-resolving, and do not cause permanent impairment. However, they are associated with an increased risk of subsequent ischemic strokes, which can be permanently disabling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohan|first=Keerthi M.|last2=Wolfe|first2=Charles D.

The optimal regimen depends on the underlying cause of the TIA.

=== Antiplatelet medications ===
An [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]], such as [[aspirin]], is started for secondary prevention of stroke after most TIAs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kernan|first=Walter N.|last2=Ovbiagele|first2=Bruce|last3=Black|first3=Henry R.|last4=Bravata|first4=Dawn M.|last5=Chimowitz|first5=Marc I.|last6=Ezekowitz|first6=Michael D.|last7=Fang|first7=Margaret C.|last8=Fisher|first8=Marc|last9=Furie|first9=Karen L.|date=2014-01-01|title=Guidelines for the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association|url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/early/2014/04/30/STR.0000000000000024|journal=Stroke|language=en|pages=STR.0000000000000024|doi=10.1161/STR.0000000000000024|issn=0039-2499|pmid=24788967|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is TIAs due to blood clots originating from the heart, in which case [[anticoagulant]]s are generally recommended.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After TIA or minor stroke, aspirin therapy has been shown to reduce the short-term risk of recurrent stroke by 60-70%, and the long-term risk of stroke by 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothwell|first=Peter M|last2=Algra|first2=Ale|last3=Chen|first3=Zhengming|last4=Diener|first4=Hans-Christoph|last5=Norrving|first5=Bo|last6=Mehta|first6=Ziyah|date=2016-07-23|title=Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: time-course analysis of randomised trials|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616304688|journal=The Lancet|volume=388|issue=10042|pages=365–375|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30468-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical therapy may include aspirin alone, a combination of aspirin plus extended-release [[dipyridamole]], or [[clopidogrel]] alone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clopidogrel and aspirin have similar efficacies and side effect profiles. Clopidogrel is more expensive and has a slightly decreased risk of GI bleed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is some evidence that giving both aspirin and clopidogrel within 24 hours of a TIA or minor stroke is more effective than aspirin alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yongjun|last2=Wang|first2=Yilong|last3=Zhao|first3=Xingquan|last4=Liu|first4=Liping|last5=Wang|first5=David|last6=Wang|first6=Chunxue|last7=Wang|first7=Chen|last8=Li|first8=Hao|last9=Meng|first9=Xia|date=2013-07-04|title=Clopidogrel with Aspirin in Acute Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1215340|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=369|issue=1|pages=11–19|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1215340|issn=0028-4793|pmid=23803136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yilong|last2=Pan|first2=Yuesong|last3=Zhao|first3=Xingquan|last4=Li|first4=Hao|last5=Wang|first5=David|last6=Johnston|first6=S.

=== Anticoagulant medications ===
Anticoagulants may be started if the TIA is thought to be attributable to atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm that may cause the formation of blood clots that can travel to the brain, resulting in TIAs or ischemic strokes. Atrial fibrillation increases stroke risk by five times, and is thought to cause 10-12% of all ischemic strokes in the US.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=López-López|first=José A.|last2=Sterne|first2=Jonathan A.

Sometimes, [[myocardial infarction]] (“heart attack”) may lead to the formation of a blood clot in one of the chambers of the heart. If this is thought to be the cause of the TIA, people may be temporarily treated with warfarin or other anticoagulant to decrease the risk of future stroke.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Blood pressure control ===
Blood pressure control may be indicated after TIA to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. About 70% of patients with recent ischemic stroke are found to have hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 90 mmHg.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Until the first half of the 2010s, blood pressure goals have generally been SBP &lt; 140 mmHg and DBP &lt; 90 mmHg.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, newer studies suggest that a goal of SBP &lt;130 mmHg may confer even greater benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reboussin|first=David M.|last2=Allen|first2=Norrina B.|last3=Griswold|first3=Michael E.|last4=Guallar|first4=Eliseo|last5=Hong|first5=Yuling|last6=Lackland|first6=Daniel T.|last7=Miller|first7=Edgar (Pete) R.|last8=Polonsky|first8=Tamar|last9=Thompson-Paul|first9=Angela M.|date=2017-11-13|title=Systematic Review for the 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109717415178|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2017.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katsanos|first=Aristeidis H.|last2=Filippatou|first2=Angeliki|last3=Manios|first3=Efstathios|last4=Deftereos|first4=Spyridon|last5=Parissis|first5=John|last6=Frogoudaki|first6=Alexandra|last7=Vrettou|first7=Agathi-Rosa|last8=Ikonomidis|first8=Ignatios|last9=Pikilidou|first9=Maria|date=2017-01-01|title=Blood Pressure Reduction and Secondary Stroke PreventionNovelty and Significance: A Systematic Review and Metaregression Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials|url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/69/1/171|journal=Hypertension|language=en|volume=69|issue=1|pages=171–179|doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.116.08485|issn=0194-911X|pmid=27802419}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blood pressure control is often achieved using [[diuretic]]s or a combination of diuretics and [[ACE inhibitor|angiotensin converter enzyme inhibitors]], although the optimal treatment regimen depends on the individual.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Cholesterol control ===
There is inconsistent evidence regarding the effect of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-cholesterol]] levels on stroke risk after TIA. Elevated cholesterol may increase ischemic stroke risk while decreasing the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002091.pub2/abstract|title=Interventions in the management of serum lipids for preventing stroke recurrence.

=== Diabetes control ===
Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of ischemic stroke by 1.5-3.7 times, and may account for at least 8% of first ischemic strokes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While intensive glucose control can prevent certain complications of diabetes such as kidney damage and retinal damage, there has previously been little evidence that it decreases the risk of stroke or death.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castilla-Guerra|first=Luis|last2=Fernandez-Moreno|first2=María del Carmen|last3=Leon-Jimenez|first3=David|last4=Carmona-Nimo|first4=Eduardo|date=2017-09-20|title=Antidiabetic drugs and stroke risk.

=== Surgery ===
If the TIA affects an area that is supplied by the [[carotid artery|carotid arteries]], a [[Carotid ultrasonography|carotid ultrasound]] scan may demonstrate [[stenosis]], or narrowing, of the carotid artery.  For people with extra-cranial carotid stenosis, if 70-99% of the carotid artery is clogged, [[carotid endarterectomy]] can decrease the 5-year risk of ischemic stroke by approximately half.&lt;ref name="Orrapin"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orrapin|first=Saritphat|last2=Rerkasem|first2=Kittipan|date=7 June 2017|title=Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=6|pages=CD001081|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001081.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28590505}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those with extra-cranial stenosis between 50-69%, carotid endarterectomy decreases the 5-year risk of ischemic stroke by about 16%.&lt;ref name="Orrapin" /&gt; For those with extra-cranial stenosis less than 50%, carotid endarterectomy does not reduce stroke risk and may, in some cases, increase it.&lt;ref name="Orrapin" /&gt; The efficacy of carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting in reducing stroke risk in patients with intra-cranial carotid artery stenosis is currently unknown.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In carotid endarterectomy, a surgeon makes an incision in the neck, opens up the carotid artery, and removes the plaque occluding the blood vessel. The artery may then be repaired by adding a graft from another vessel in the body, or a woven patch. In patients who undergo carotid endarterectomy after a TIA or minor stroke, the 30 day risk of death or stroke is 7%.&lt;ref name="Orrapin" /&gt;

[[Carotid stenting|Carotid artery stenting]] is a less invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy for patients with extra-cranial carotid artery stenosis. In this procedure, the surgeon makes a small cut in the groin and threads a small flexible tube, called a [[catheter]], into the patient’s carotid artery. A balloon is inflated at the site of stenosis, opening up the clogged artery to allow for increased blood flow to the brain. To keep the vessel open, a small wire mesh coil, called a stent, may be inflated along with the balloon. The stent remains in place, and the balloon is removed.

In patients over age 70, carotid endarterectomy is associated with fewer postoperative deaths or strokes than carotid artery stenting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonati|first=Leo H.|last2=Lyrer|first2=Philippe|last3=Ederle|first3=Jörg|last4=Featherstone|first4=Roland|last5=Brown|first5=Martin M.|date=2012-09-12|title=Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty and stenting for carotid artery stenosis|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=9|pages=CD000515|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000515.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=22972047}}&lt;/ref&gt; In younger patients, there is no significant difference in outcomes between carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  People who undergo carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting for stroke prevention are medically managed with antiplatelets, statins, and other interventions as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Lifestyle modification ===
Lifestyle changes have not been shown to reduce the risk of stroke after TIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Maggie|last2=Pringle|first2=Jan|last3=Kerr|first3=Susan|last4=Booth|first4=Joanne|last5=Govan|first5=Lindsay|last6=Roberts|first6=Nicola J.|date=2015|title=Multimodal secondary prevention behavioral interventions for TIA and stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=PLOS One|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120902|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120902|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4368743|pmid=25793643}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no studies have looked at the optimal diet for secondary prevention of stroke, some observational studies have shown that a [[mediterranean diet]] can reduce stroke risk in patients without cerebrovascular disease.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and limited in red meats and sweets. Vitamin supplementation has not been found to be useful in secondary stroke prevention.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Prognosis ==
People diagnosed with TIA are sometimes said{{By whom|date=June 2018}} to have had a warning for an approaching [[stroke]]. In TIA, the short duration of impaired blood flow does not cause permanent ischemic damage to the brain. In ischemic stroke, the time period of blood supply impairment is of longer duration and the neurons in that area of the brain die, causing permanent neurological damage. One-third of people with TIA later have recurrent TIAs and one-third go on to suffer an ischemic stroke.  Other sources cite that 10% of TIAs will develop a stroke within 90 days, half of which will occur in the first two days following the TIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stroke.org/site/PageServer?pagename=tia |title=What is TIA? |publisher=Stroke.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of a stroke occurring after a TIA can be predicted using the [[ABCD² score]]. One limitation of the [[ABCD² score]] is that it does not reliably predict the level of carotid artery stenosis, which is a major cause of stroke in TIA patients. The patient's age is the most reliable risk factor in predicting any level of carotid stenosis in transient ischemic attack.&lt;ref&gt;Mannu, G. S., Kyu, M. M., Bettencourt-Silva, J. H., Loke, Y. K., Clark, A. B., Metcalf, A. K., Potter, J. F. and Myint, P. K.

Int J Clin Pract, 69: 948–956. {{DOI|10.1111/ijcp.12637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
With the difficulty in diagnosing a TIA due to its nonspecific symptoms of neurologic dysfunction at presentation and a differential including many mimics, the exact incidence of the disease is unclear. It is currently estimated to have an incidence of approximately 200,000 to 500,000 cases per year in the US according to the [[American Heart Association]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Easton JD, Saver JL, Albers GW, Alberts MJ, Chaturvedi S, Feldmann E, Hatsukami TS, Higashida RT, Johnston SC, Kidwell CS, Lutsep HL, Miller E, Sacco RL | date = Jun 2009 | title = Definition and evaluation of transient ischemic attack | pmid = 19423857 | journal = Stroke | volume = 40 | issue = 6| pages = 2276–93 | doi=10.1161/strokeaha.108.192218}}&lt;/ref&gt; TIA incidence trends similarly to [[stroke]], such that incidence varies with age, gender, and different race/ethnicity populations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramirez Lucas, Kim-Tenser May A., Sanossian Nerses, Cen Steven, Wen Ge, He Shuhan, Mack William J., Towfighi Amytis | year = 2016 | title = Trends in Transient Ischemic Attack Hospitalizations in the United States | url = | journal = Journal of the American Heart Association | volume = 5 | issue = | page = e004026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Associated risk factors include age greater than or equal to 60, blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 systolic or 90 diastolic, and comorbid diseases, such as [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[atherosclerosis]], and [[atrial fibrillation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5426">A '''trion''' is a localized excitation which consists of three charged [[quasiparticle]]s. A negative trion consists of two [[electron]]s and one [[Electron hole|hole]] and a positive trion consists of two holes and one electron. The trion itself is a [[quasiparticle]] and is somewhat similar to an [[exciton]], which is a complex of one electron and one hole. The trion has a ground [[singlet state]] ([[Spin (physics)|spin]] ''s'' = 1/2) and an excited [[Spin triplet|triplet]] state (''s'' = 3/2). Here singlet and triplet [[Degenerate energy levels|degeneracies]] originate not from the whole system but from the two identical particles in it. The half-integer spin value distinguishes trions from excitons in many phenomena; for example, energy states of trions, but not excitons, are split in an applied magnetic field. Trion states were predicted theoretically and then observed experimentally in various optically excited [[semiconductor]]s, especially in [[quantum dot]]s and quantum well structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0WiYWnC4BEC&amp;pg=PA140|pages=140|title=Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons and biexcitons: and coherent nonlinear optics with excitons|author=S.

Despite numerous reports of experimental trion observations in different semiconductor heterostructures, there are serious concerns on the exact physical nature of the detected complexes. The originally foreseen 'true' trion particle has a delocalized wavefunction (at least at the scales of several Bohr radii) while recent studies reveal significant binding from charged impurities in real semiconductor quantum wells.&lt;ref&gt;

}}'''William Henry Joseph Brogan''' (1900-1983) was an Australian rugby league player of the 1920s and 1930s. He was a [[New South Wales rugby league team|state]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|national]] representative.

Bill Brogan was born at [[West Wyalong, New South Wales]],  in 1900. He joined [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] in 1929, and after a stirling season, he was selected on the [[1929/30 Kangaroo Tour]] and played in all three tests against England. Brogan is listed on the ''Australian Players Register'' as Kangaroo No.151.&lt;ref&gt;ARL Annual Report 2005, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; Brogan spent five years at Wests between 1929-1933 and won a premiership with them in [[1930 NSWRFL season|1930]]. Bill Brogan also made 11 appearances for [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]]. He retired from Sydney football in 1933 to captain-coach Warialda and Moree Rugby Leagues clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 1995 edition.

[[File:William Ramsay Smith.jpg|thumb|right]]

Dr '''William Ramsay Smith''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]}} (27 November 1859 – 28 September 1937)&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; was a Scottish physician, educator, naturalist, [[anthropologist]] and civil servant, who was active in [[Australia]] later in his career.
It was during his time in Australia that Smith misappropriated the text of 'Legendary Tales of the Australian Abotigines' from the original indigenous author David Unaipon (b.28thSeptember 1872).ref. Legendary Tales ofthe Australian Aborigines, David Unaipon, Ed.  Stephen Muecke and Adam Shoemaker: The Miegunyah Press:2006.© The David Unaipon Estate 2001.

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[King Edward, Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]], the son of William Smith (a farm servant, and later stationmaster) and his wife Mary ''née'' MacDonald (domestic servant). They lived on the estate of Cairnbanno House near [[New Deer]]. He attended the nearby Cairnbanno Public School (which taught using the [[Madras School]] system - all pupils also teaching). Winning a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] scholarship, from 1877 he studied arts at [[Edinburgh University]] and then attended [[Moray House Training College]] to train as a teacher for two years.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;

 |title=Smith, William Ramsay (1859–1937)
 |id2=smith-william-ramsay-8493
 |accessdate=4 August 2013
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At 20 years of age Smith was appointed headmaster of [[Invergordon]] Public School, in [[Easter Ross]], but, due to an interest in [[physiology]], he returned to Edinburgh University to study arts and science. He then won an entrance scholarship for Medicine of £100 a year for three years. On completing his medical course in 1885 Smith was appointed assistant-professor of natural history, senior demonstrator of zoology at Edinburgh University. He graduated [[BSc]] (natural sciences) in 1888.

In 1889 'Illustrations of Zoology' was published which he had prepared in collaboration with J. S. Norwell. He graduated [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB]] [[ChM]] in 1892. For two years Smith was demonstrator of anatomy at Edinburgh, and served as examiner at the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]]. During this period he lived at 4 Grange Loan in the south of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In 1896 he travelled to Australia at the request of the [[Government of South Australia]] to fill a [[pathology]] position at the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]]. Smith was expelled from the [[British Medical Association]] and banned from the association for life in 1897 after internal conflict with Hospital staff, but having been exonerated by a Tribunal, in 1899 he was appointed city [[Coroner]] and permanent head of the department of health at [[Adelaide]].

In 1901 during the [[South African War]] Smith was surgeon captain, [[Imperial Bushmen's Corps]] and officer in charge of plague administration at [[Cape Town]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Smith was suspended from coronial duties in 1903 after 18 charges were laid against him of the misuse of human remains, specifically the removal of heads and the collection of skeletons for medical research.&lt;ref&gt;James R and James H. 2001.

found that Smith's actions had been "indiscreet" and he was dismissed from his position as coroner. However, he was later reinstated and continued his practice of illicitly collecting human remains.

In 1904 Smith graduated [[DSc]] from the [[University of Adelaide]], and published ''A Manual for Coroners''. In his spare time made a special study of the [[Australian aborigine]]s. Smith was the author of ''The Aborigines of Australia'', which was printed in volume three of the Official 'Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia' (1910).

In 1906 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[William Turner (anatomist)|Sir William Turner]], [[Daniel John Cunningham]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]] and [[Cargill Gilston Knott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 he published 'Medical Jurisprudence from the Judicial Standpoint', for which he received the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from Edinburgh University.

In 1915 was in charge of the Australian General Hospital, Australian Imperial Force, [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis, Egypt]].  There, he clashed with principal matron Bell over which of them should manage the nursing staff. An Inquiry resulted in both being recalled to Australia.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

On his return to Adelaide, Smith resumed his duties at the board of health and contributed to the 'Australian Encyclopaedia', including a large part of the article on Aborigines. Following a trip to the [[Southern Ocean|South Seas]] Smith published ''In Southern Seas'' (1924); the second half of this book mostly relates to the Australian aborigines.

Smith retired in 1929 and published a book ''Myths of the Australian Aboriginals'' (1930), a collection of narratives as told by aboriginal people. It has subsequently emerged that the volume was plagiarised, and was almost entirely written by the Aboriginal polymath and scientist [[David Unaipon]], who had sold the text to finance his own work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/messageclub/duknow/stories/s888637.htm Who is David Unaipon?] Didj "u" Know at abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt; Authorship of the book has now been restored to Uniapon and it has been republished under his name.&lt;ref&gt;David Unaipon. 2006. ''Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines''. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press. {{ISBN|0-522-85246-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has also been accused of sales of Aboriginal artefacts for profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/awaye/stories/2009/2489556.htm On the shore of a strange land: David Unaipon], 7 March 2009 at abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropological collection===
Ramsay Smith was responsible for the bulk of [[Edinburgh University]]'s physical anthropology collection, some 500 to 600 individuals.

From Ramsay Smith's writings, it is clear that he was aware of indigenous funerary customs.&lt;blockquote&gt;"After death no reference is made to the deceased, nor is his name mentioned. Relations by the same name find a substitute. A mother would not give [me] a lock of her child’s hair because she has been taught that if the child dies, its spirit will find no rest if that lock of hair survives."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
As desecration of human remains was illegal, he used his position as Adelaide’s coroner to illicitly dissect and collect human remains, many being individuals of unusual pathologies or disease, most of which he presented to Edinburgh University. His writings indicate that he also robbed graves and it is believed he had once destroyed five graves to obtain one good specimen. Witnesses also record that he practiced his marksmanship with a [[Lee-Enfield|.303 rifle]] on corpses at the mortuary of Adelaide hospital. While he did not receive payment for the remains, he was rewarded for his "donations" with Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (upon the proposal of [[Sir William Turner]], [[Daniel John Cunningham]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]] and [[Cargill Gilston Knott]])&lt;ref name="Waterston2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and an Honorary Fellowship of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]]. He was an honorary member of the [[Association of Military Surgeons of the United States]].

At his death in 1937, 182 skulls were found in his Adelaide home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meanjin.com.au/editions/volume-68-number-4-2009/article/the-return-of-the-bones/ The Return of the Bones] Meanjin quarterly Volume 68, Number 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to numerous books, Ramsay Smith also published pamphlets and contributed largely to scientific journals and ''[[Chambers Encyclopaedia]]''. He was interested in literature, philosophy and music, was an excellent public servant, and earned a reputation as an authority on the Australian aborigine.

==Death==
Smith spent his final years quietly among his books at [[Belair, South Australia]], where he died on 28 September 1937. Smith had married Margaret, daughter of James Mackenzie, on 1 June 1889, who predeceased him. Four daughters and a son survived him.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;
