'''''A Vedic Word Concordance''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|Vaidika-Padānukrama-Koṣa}}'' ) is a multi-volume [[Concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of the corpus of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] texts. It has been under preparation from 1930 and was published in 1935-1965 under the guidance of {{IAST|Viśvabandhu Śāstrī}} (d. 1973), with an introduction in Sanskrit and English. It aims to be "a universal vocabulary register" of "Vedic works, with complete textual reference and critical [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] bearing on [[phonology]], [[Vedic accent|accent]], etymo-morphology, grammar, [[Vedic meter|metre]], text-criticism, and [[Proto-Indo-Iranian|Ur-Aryan]] philology".

==Contents==
The work covers 123,000 word-bases and 5,000,000 word forms found in about 400 Vedic and [[Vedanga]] texts, including [[Vedas|Samhitas]], [[Brahmanas]], [[Aranyakas]] and [[Upanishads]] (even very late ones). The Vedanga section does not cover all the published Shrauta or Grihya texts, however, while the Upanishad section also includes the [[Bhagavad Gita]].

The concordance extends to about  11,000 pages, published in 16 parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jamison |first= Stephanie W.|author2= [[Michael Witzel|Witzel, Michael]]|editor= Sharma, Arvind|title= The Study of Hinduism |year= 2003|publisher= University of S.

:Section: Samhitas (6 parts), 1942-63.
:Section II: Brahmanas and Aranyakas (2 parts), 1935,36
:Section III: Upanishads (2 parts), 1945
:Section IV: Vedangas (4 parts), 1958-61
:Index (2 parts), 1964-65.

A revised and enlarged edition was published 1973-1976.

==History of development==
[[Acharya Vishva Bandhu|Vishva Bandhu Shastri]] continued the work of Vishveshvaranand and Nityanand, who had published word indices to the four Vedic Samhitas in 1908-1910, leading the ''Vishveshvaranand Institute'' from 1924 until his death in 1973.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title = Education in Hoshiarpur |url = http://hoshiarpur.nic.in/html/education.htm| publisher = Hoshiarpur District Administration|accessdate = 2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[partition of India]], the institute moved to its present premises at Sadhu Ashram, [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Punjab, India]]. Most of the approximately 6000 Sanskrit manuscripts formerly located at the Dayanand College of Lahore were clandestinely brought to Hoshiarpur at the time. Since 1965, the institute has been incorporated in the [[Panjab University, Chandigarh]] as the ''Vishveshvaranand Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies'' (VISIS).&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Based on the ''Vedic Word Concordance'', the institute currently compiles a ''Dictionary of Vedic Interpretation'', of which the first volume, running up to the lemma ''Agni'', has been completed.

'''Adolf Behne''' (13 July 1885 – 22 August 1948) was a critic, [[art history|art historian]], architectural writer, and artistic activist. He was one of the leaders of the Avant Garde in the [[Weimar Republic]].

Behne was born in [[Magdeburg]] and studied [[architecture]] briefly, then the history of art in [[Berlin]]. He joined the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] and was a guiding light of the [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] in 1918. In a 1913 critique of [[Bruno Taut]], Behne helped coin the term "[[Expressionist architecture]]", and soon became one of the leading promoters of [[expressionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Behne 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; He was close to the members of the [[Magdeburg]] artist collective 'The ball' and demanded the creation of a new closeness between art and architecture. He was influenced by the writings of [[Jakob von Uexküll]].&lt;ref&gt;Behne 1914/1915.&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught at the [[University of Berlin]] until 1933. Between 1945 and 1948 he was a professor at the National University for Fine Arts, (Staatlichen Hochschule für Bildende Kunst Berlin) and belonged to the architect group [[Der Ring]].

As an architect he rarely had his projects executed. However, between 1932 and 1936 he built the reception building of the main station in [[Düsseldorf]].

He died in Berlin. His hometown of Magdeburg named a street after him (Behneweg).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56050">The '''Adverse Childhood Experiences Study''' ('''ACE Study''') is a research study conducted by the American [[health maintenance organization]] [[Kaiser Permanente]]  and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref name="ACE Study"/&gt;  Participants were recruited to the study between 1995 and 1997 and have been in long-term follow up for health outcomes. The study has demonstrated an association of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) (aka [[childhood trauma]]) with health and social problems across the lifespan. The study is frequently cited as a notable landmark in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] research,&lt;ref name=Brooks2012/&gt; and has produced many scientific articles and conference and workshop presentations that examine ACEs.&lt;ref name="ACE Study"/&gt;

== Background ==

In the 1980s, the dropout rate of participants at [[Kaiser Permanente]]'s [[obesity]] clinic in [[San Diego]], [[California]], was about 50%; despite all of the dropouts successfully [[weight loss|losing weight]] under the program.&lt;ref name="Stevens October 2012"/&gt; Vincent Felitti, head of Kaiser Permanente’s Department of Preventive Medicine in San Diego, conducted interviews with people who had left the program, and discovered that a majority of 286 people he interviewed had experienced [[child sexual abuse|childhood sexual abuse]]. The interview findings suggested to Felitti that weight gain might be a coping mechanism for [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[fear]].&lt;ref name="Stevens October 2012"/&gt;

Felitti and Robert Anda from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) went on to survey childhood trauma experiences of over 17,000 Kaiser Permanente patient volunteers.&lt;ref name="Stevens October 2012"/&gt; The 17,337 participants were volunteers from approximately 26,000 consecutive Kaiser Permanente members. About half were female; 74.8% were white; the average age was 57; 75.2% had attended college; all had jobs and good health care, because they were members of the Kaiser [[health maintenance organization]].&lt;ref name=Prevalence/&gt;  Participants were asked about different types of [[childhood trauma]] that had been identified in earlier research literature:&lt;ref name=Anda200304/&gt;
* [[Physical abuse]] 
* [[Child sexual abuse|Sexual abuse]] 
* [[Emotional abuse]] 
* Physical [[neglect]]
* Emotional [[neglect]] 
* Exposure to [[domestic violence]]
* Household [[substance abuse]] 
* Household [[mental illness]] 
* Parental [[Marital separation|separation]] or [[divorce]] 
* [[Imprisonment|Incarcerated]] household member

== Findings ==

[[File:The ACE Pyramid.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Pyramid with horizontal layers representing, in ascending order, Adverse Childhood Experiences; Social, Emotional, and Cognitive Impairment; Adoption of Health-risk Behaviors; Disease, Disability, and Social Problems; and Early Death. A vertical arrow represents the course of life beginning at the base and moving upward. Smaller arrows depict gaps in scientific knowledge about the links between Adverse Childhood Experiences and latter risk factors.|The ACE Pyramid represents the conceptual framework for the ACE Study, which has uncovered how adverse childhood experiences are strongly related to various risk factors for disease throughout the lifespan, according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref name="ACE Pyramid"/&gt;&lt;ref name=About/&gt;]]

According to the United States' [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]], the ACE study found that:

* Adverse childhood experiences are common. For example, 28% of study participants reported physical abuse and 21% reported sexual abuse. Many also reported experiencing a divorce or parental separation, or having a parent with a mental and/or [[substance use disorder]].&lt;ref name=SAMHSA/&gt;
* Adverse childhood experiences often occur together. Almost 40% of the original sample reported two or more ACEs and 12.5% experienced four or more. Because ACEs occur in clusters, many subsequent studies have examined the cumulative effects of ACEs rather than the individual effects of each.&lt;ref name=SAMHSA/&gt;
* Adverse childhood experiences have a [[dose{{ndash}}response relationship|dose–response relationship]] with many health problems. As researchers followed participants over time, they discovered that a person's cumulative ACEs score has a strong, graded relationship to numerous health, [[social problem|social]], and behavioral problems throughout their lifespan, including substance use disorders. Furthermore, many problems related to ACEs tend to be [[comorbid]], or co-occurring.&lt;ref name=SAMHSA/&gt;

About two-thirds of individuals reported at least one adverse childhood experience; 87% of individuals who reported one ACE reported at least one additional ACE.&lt;ref name=Anda200304/&gt; The number of ACEs was strongly associated with adulthood high-risk health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, promiscuity, and severe obesity, and correlated with ill-health including depression, [[heart disease]], [[cancer]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic lung disease]] and shortened lifespan.&lt;ref name=Anda200304/&gt;&lt;ref name=Felitti1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middlebrooks2008/&gt; Compared to an ACE score of zero, having four adverse childhood experiences was associated with a seven-fold (700%) increase in [[alcoholism]], a doubling of risk of being diagnosed with cancer, and a four-fold increase in [[emphysema]]; an ACE score above six was associated with a 30-fold (3000%) increase in attempted suicide.&lt;ref name=Brooks2012/&gt;

The ACE study's results suggest that maltreatment and [[dysfunctional family|household dysfunction]] in childhood contribute to health problems decades later. These include [[chronic condition|chronic]] diseases—such as heart disease, cancer, [[stroke]], and [[diabetes]]—that are the most common causes of death and [[disability]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=WorldHealth/&gt; The study's findings, while relating to a specific population within the United States, might reasonably be assumed to reflect similar trends in other parts of the world, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=WorldHealth/&gt; The study was initially published in the ''[[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(98)00017-8/abstract|title=Adverse Childhood Experiences|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=14|issue=4|pages=245–258|doi=10.1016/S0749-3797(98)00017-8|year=1998|last1=Felitti|first1=Vincent J.|last2=Anda|first2=Robert F.|last3=Nordenberg|first3=Dale|last4=Williamson|first4=David F.|last5=Spitz|first5=Alison M.|last6=Edwards|first6=Valerie|last7=Koss|first7=Mary P.|last8=Marks|first8=James S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent surveys ==

The ACE Study has produced more than 50 articles that look at the prevalence and consequences of ACEs.&lt;ref name=Publications/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=February 2017}} It has been influential in several areas. Subsequent studies have confirmed the high frequency of adverse childhood experiences, or found even higher incidences in urban or youth populations.

The original study questions have been used to develop a 10-item [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] questionnaire.&lt;ref name="Bynum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anda 2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=Finding Your ACE Score |url=http://www.acestudy.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/ACE_Calculator-English.127143712.pdf |website=Acestudy.org |author=Anda, Robert |date=2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401151358/http://www.acestudy.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/ACE_Calculator-English.127143712.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous subsequent surveys have confirmed that adverse childhood experiences are frequent.

== Neurobiology of stress ==

{{see also|Social stress|Stress in early childhood}}
Cognitive and neuroscience researchers have examined possible mechanisms that might explain the negative consequences of adverse childhood experiences on adult health.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Adverse childhood experiences can alter the structural [[Human development (biology)|development]] of neural networks and the [[biochemistry]] of [[neuroendocrine system]]s&lt;ref name=Anda2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Danese2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Teicher/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolassa/&gt; and may have long-term effects on the body, including speeding up the processes of disease and aging and compromising immune systems.&lt;ref name=Sorrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moffitt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogosch2011/&gt;

''[[Allostatic load]]'' refers to the adaptive processes that maintain homeostasis during times of [[toxic stress]] through the production of mediators such as adrenalin, cortisol and other chemical messengers. According to researcher [[Bruce S. McEwen]], who coined the term: {{quote|These mediators of the stress response promote adaptation in the aftermath of acute stress, but they also contribute to allostatic overload, the wear and tear on the body and brain that result from being 'stressed out.' This conceptual framework has created a need to know how to improve the efficiency of the adaptive response to stressors while minimizing overactivity of the same systems, since such overactivity results in many of the common diseases of modern life. This framework has also helped to demystify the biology of stress by emphasizing the protective as well as the damaging effects of the body's attempts to cope with the challenges known as stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McEwen |first=Bruce S. |title=Stressed or stressed out: What is the difference? |journal=Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience |date=2005 |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=315–318 |pmid=16151535 |issn=1180-4882 |pmc=1197275}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additionally, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] transmission may occur due to stress during pregnancy or during interactions between mother and newborns. Maternal stress, depression, and exposure to partner violence have all been shown to have epigenetic effects on infants.&lt;ref name=Kolassa/&gt;

== Implementing practices ==

As knowledge about the prevalence and consequences of adverse childhood experiences increases, trauma-informed and resilience-building practices based on the research is being implemented in communities, education, public health departments, social services, faith-based organizations and criminal justice. A few states are considering legislation.

=== Communities ===
As knowledge about the prevalence and consequences of ACEs increases, more communities seek to integrate trauma-informed and resilience-building practices into their agencies and systems. Tarpon Springs, Florida, became the first trauma-informed community in 2011.&lt;ref name="Stevens_CP"&gt;Stevens [http://www.acesconnection.com/blog/community-projects/ "Community Projects"], ACEs Connection, 25 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tarpon"&gt;Saenger [http://peace4tarpon.org/ "PEACE4TARPON Trauma Informed Community Initiative"], 30 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma-informed initiatives in Tarpon Springs include trauma-awareness training for the local housing authority, changes in programs for ex-offenders, and new approaches to educating students with learning difficulties.&lt;ref name="Tarpon ACE"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/02/13/tarpon-springs-may-be-first-trauma-informed-city-in-u-s/ "Tarpon Springs, FL, may be first trauma-informed city in U.S."], ''ACEs Too High'', 13 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Research with American Indian tribal communities has demonstrated that social support and cultural involvement can ameliorate the effects of ACEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brockie|first=Teresa N.|last2=Elm|first2=Jessica H.

===Education===
ACEs exposure is widespread in the US, one study from the National Survey of Children’s Health reported that approximately 68% of children 0–17 years old had experienced one or more ACEs.&lt;ref name= "Blodgett &amp; Langigan, 2018"/&gt; The impact of ACEs on children can manifest in difficulties focusing, self regulating, trusting others, and can lead to negative cognitive effects. One study found that a child with 4 or more ACEs was 32 times more likely to be labeled with a behavioral or cognitive problem than a child with no ACEs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plumb |first1=J.L. |last2=Bush |first2=K.A. |last3=Kersevich |first3=S.E. |title=Trauma-Sensitive Schools: An Evidence Based Approach |journal=School Social Work Jounral |date=2016 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=37–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by the Area Health Education Center of Washington State University found that students with at least three ACEs are three times as likely to experience academic failure, six times as likely to have behavioral problems, and five times as likely to have attendance problems.&lt;ref name="Spokane"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/02/28/spokane-wa-students-child-trauma-prompts-search-for-prevention/ "Spokane, WA, students’ trauma prompts search for solutions"], ''ACEs Too High'', 28 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The trauma-informed school movement aims to train teachers and staff to help children self-regulate, and to help families that are having problems that result in children's normal response to trauma. It also seeks to provide behavioral consequences that will not re-traumatize a child.&lt;ref name="Mass Wash Schools"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/05/31/massachusetts-washington-state-lead-u-s-trauma-sensitive-school-movement/ "Massachusetts, Washington State lead U.S. trauma-sensitive school movement"], ''ACEs Too High'', 31 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma-informed education refers to the specific use of knowledge about trauma and its expression to modify support for children to improve their developmental success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blodgett |first1=C. |title=A Review of Community Efforts to Mitigate and Prevent Adverse Childhood Experiences and Trauma |journal=Washington State University Health Education Center: Spokane, WA |date=2013 |url=http://www.civiccanopy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/A-Review-of-Community-Efforts-to-Mitigate-and-Prevent-ACEs-Blodgett-Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) describes a trauma-informed school system as a place where school community members work to provide trauma awareness, knowledge and skills to respond to potentially negative outcomes following traumatic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=National Child Traumatic Stress Network, Schools Committee. |title=Creating, Supporting, and Sustaining Trauma-Informed Schools: A System Framework. |date=2017 |url=https://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/resources//creating_supporting_sustaining_trauma_informed_schools_a_systems_framework.pdf |location=Los Angeles, CA and Durham, NC: National Center for Child Traumatic Stress}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCTSN published a study that discussed the ARC (attachment, regulation and competency) model, which other researchers have based their subsequent studies of trauma-informed education practices off of.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorado |first1=J.S. |last2=Martinez |first2=M. |last3=McArthur |first3=L.E. |last4=Leibovitz |first4=T. |title=Healthy Environments and Response to Trauma in Schools (HEARTS): A Whole-School, Multi-Level, Prevention and Intervention Program for Creating Trauma-Informed Safe and Supportive Schools. |journal=School Mental Health |date=2016 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=163–176 |doi=10.1007/s12310-016-9177-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trauma-sensitive or trauma-informed schooling has become increasingly popular in Washington, Massachusetts, and California in the last 10 years.&lt;ref name="Blodgett &amp; Langigan, 2018" /&gt;

One study details how several San Francisco schools provided trauma-informed support based on the ARC model to students, adults in the system, and the school system as a whole through universal learning strategies, plans and techniques for children with trauma, and by providing trauma-informed therapy to those children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At El Dorado, an elementary school in this study in San Francisco, trauma-informed practices were associated with a suspension reduction of 89%.&lt;ref name="El Dorado"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2014/01/28/hearts-el-dorado-elementary/ "San Francisco’s El Dorado Elementary uses trauma-informed &amp; restorative practices; suspensions drop 89%"], ''ACEs Too High'', 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln High School in Walla Walla, Washington, adapted a trauma-informed approached to discipline and reduced its suspensions by 85%.&lt;ref name="Stevens April 2012"/&gt; Rather than standard punishment, students are taught to recognize their reaction to stress and learn to control it. Spokane, Washington, schools conducted a research study that demonstrated that academic risk was correlated with students’ experiences of traumatic events known to their teachers.&lt;ref name=Spokane /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spokane2"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2013/08/20/spokaneschools/ "There’s no such thing as a bad kid in these Spokane, WA, trauma-informed elementary schools"], ''ACEs Too High'', 20 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The same school district has begun a study to test the impact of trauma-informed intervention programs, in an attempt to reduce the impact of toxic stress.

In Brockton, Massachusetts, a community-wide meeting led to a trauma-informed approach being adopted by the Brockton School District.&lt;ref name="Mass Wash Schools"/&gt; So far, all of the district's elementary schools have implemented trauma-informed improvement plans, and there are plans to do the same in the middle school and high school. About one-fifth of the district teachers have participated in a course on teaching traumatized students. Police alert schools when they have arrested someone or visited at a student's address. Massachusetts state legislation has sought to require all schools to develop plans to create "safe and supportive schools".&lt;ref name="Mass Wash Schools"/&gt;

===Social services===
Social service providers—including welfare systems, housing authorities, homeless shelters, and [[domestic violence]] centers – are adopting trauma-informed approaches that help to prevent ACEs or minimize their impact. Utilizing tools that screen for trauma can help a social service worker direct their clients to interventions that meet their specific needs.&lt;ref name="Common Ground"&gt;Meister [http://jbcc.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/galleries/common_ground_july_2012.pdf#page=9/ "Addressing Child Traumatic Stress in Child Welfare"], ''Common Ground'', July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma-informed practices can also help social service providers look at how trauma impacts the whole family.&lt;ref name="FIT"&gt;Family-Informed Trauma Treatment Center [http://fittcenter.umaryland.edu/ 15 July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma-informed approaches can improve child welfare services by 1) openly discussing trauma and 2) addressing parental trauma.{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref name="Starve"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/07/30/starve-the-beast-says-these-cities-but-dont-cut-people-off/ "‘Starve the beast,’ say these cities – but don’t cut people off; reduce need for services instead"], ''ACEs Too High'', 30 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The New Hampshire Division for Children Youth and Families (DCYF) is taking a trauma-informed approach to their foster care services by educating staff about childhood trauma, screening children entering foster care for trauma, using trauma-informed language to mitigate further traumatization, mentoring birth parents and involving them in collaborative parenting, and training foster parents to be trauma-informed.&lt;ref name="Common Ground" /&gt;

In Albany, New York the HEARTS Initiative has led to local organizations developing trauma-informed practice.&lt;ref name="Starve" /&gt; Senior Hope Inc., an organization serving adults over the age of 50, began implementing the 10-question ACE survey and talking with their clients about childhood trauma. The LaSalle School, which serves orphaned and abandoned boys, began looking at delinquent boys in from a trauma-informed perspective and began administering the ACE questionnaire to their clients.

Housing authorities are also becoming trauma-informed. Supportive housing can sometimes recreate control and power dynamics associated with clients’ early trauma.&lt;ref name="Bebout"&gt;Bebout [http://homeless.samhsa.gov/resource/waiting-on-the-welcome-mat-how-to-be-at-home-with-trauma-informed-care-50308.aspx "Waiting on the welcome mat: How to be at home with trauma-informed care"], ''camh Cross Currents'', Winter 2010/2011&lt;/ref&gt; This can be reduced through trauma-informed practices, such as training staff to be respectful of clients' space by scheduling appointments and not letting themselves into clients' private spaces, and also understanding that an aggressive response may be trauma-related coping strategies.&lt;ref name="Bebout" /&gt; The housing authority in Tarpon Springs provided trauma-awareness training to staff so they could better understand and react to their clients' stress and anger resulting from poor employment, health, and housing.&lt;ref name="Tarpon ACE" /&gt;

A survey of 200 homeless individuals in California and New York demonstrated that more than 50% had experienced at least four ACEs.&lt;ref name="ACEs 360"&gt;ACEs 360 [http://www.iowaaces360.org/new-york.html "‘ACEs 360-New York"], ''ACEs 360 Iowa'', Retrieved 15 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In Petaluma, California, the Committee on the Shelterless (COTS) uses a trauma-informed approach called Restorative Integral Support (RIS) to reduce intergenerational homelessness.&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;Larkin et al. [http://www.posttraumawellness.net/files/6113/5941/5120/RIS_COTS_PublishedCPTW.pdf "‘Mobilizing resilience and recovery in response to adverse childhood experiences (ACE) among homeless people: A Restorative Integral Support (RIS) case study"], ''Prevention Summit'', Retrieved 15 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; RIS increases awareness of and knowledge about ACEs, and calls on staff to be compassionate and focus on the whole person.  COTS now consider themselves ACE-informed and focus on resiliency and recovery.

===Health care services===
Screening for or talking about ACEs with parents and children can help to foster healthy physical and psychological development and can help doctors understand the circumstances that children and their parents are facing. By screening for ACEs in children, pediatric doctors and nurses can better understand behavioral problems. Some doctors have questioned whether some behaviors resulting in [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) diagnoses are in fact reactions to trauma. Children who have experienced four or more ACEs are three times as likely to take ADHD medication when compared with children with less than four ACEs.&lt;ref name="ADHD"&gt;Ruiz [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/how-childhood-trauma-could-be-mistaken-for-adhd/373328/ "How Childhood Trauma Could Be Mistaken for ADHD"], ''The Atlantic'', 7 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Screening parents for their ACEs allows doctors to provide the appropriate support to parents who have experienced trauma, helping them to build resilience, foster attachment with their children, and prevent a family cycle of ACEs.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2014/07/29/to-prevent-childhood-trauma-pediatricians-screen-children-and-their-parentsand-sometimes-just-parents/ "To prevent childhood trauma, pediatricians screen children and their parents…and sometimes, just parents…for childhood trauma"], ''ACEs Too High'', 29 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrimaryHealth"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics [http://www.cssp.org/reform/strengthening-families/messaging-at-the-intersection/Messaging-at-the-Intersections_Primary-Health.pdf "Promoting Children’s Health and Resiliency: A Strengthening Families Approach"], ''Center for the Study of Social Policy''&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma-informed pediatric care also allows doctors to develop a more trusting relationship with parents, opening the lines of communication.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;Gottlieb [http://www.mcpap.com/pdf/TraumaInformedCare.pdf "Toxic Stress and Trauma-Informed Pediatric Care"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905070027/http://www.mcpap.com/pdf/TraumaInformedCare.pdf |date=2014-09-05 }}, ''Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project''&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Montefiore Medical Center]] ACEs screenings will soon be implemented in 22 pediatric clinics. In a pilot program, any child with one parent who has an ACE score of four or higher is offered enrollment and receive a variety of services. For families enrolled in the program parents report fewer ER visits and children have healthier emotional and social development, compared with those not enrolled.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Montefiore Medical Group"&gt;Montefiore Medical Group [http://www.cham.org/programs/healthy-steps "Healthy Steps Program"], ''Montefiore Medical Group''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health===

Most American doctors as of 2015 do not use ACE surveys to assess patients.  Objections to doing so include that there are no [[randomized controlled trial]]s that show that such surveys can be used to actually improve health outcomes, there are no standard protocols for how to use the information gathered, and that revisiting negative childhood experiences could be emotionally traumatic.&lt;ref name="fear"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/03/377569539/even-some-doctors-fear-these-10-questions | title=10 Questions Some Doctors Are Afraid to Ask}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other obstacles to adoption include that the technique is not taught in medical schools, is not billable, and the nature of the conversation makes some doctors personally uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="fear" /&gt;

Some public health centers see ACEs as an important way (especially for mothers and children)&lt;ref name="Hellerstedt"&gt;Hellerstedt [http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ceed/projects/projectforbabies/Spring2013HealthyGenerations.pdf "Adverse Childhood Experience: Public Health Surveillance Measures"], ''Healthy Generations'', Spring 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to target health interventions for individuals during sensitive periods of development early in their life, or even in utero.&lt;ref name="Hellerstedt" /&gt; For example, Jefferson Country Public Health clinic in Port Townsend, Washington, now screens pregnant women, their partners, parents of children with special needs, and parents involved with CPS for ACEs.&lt;ref name="Public Health"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/03/23/public-health-clinic-adds-child-trauma-to-smoking-alcohol-hiv-screening/ "Public health clinic adds child trauma to smoking, alcohol, HIV screening"], ''ACEs Too High'', 23 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to patient counseling, the clinic treats ACEs like other health risks such as smoking or alcohol consumption.

===Resilience and Resources===

{{Refimprove section|date=August 2017}}

Resilience is not a trait that people either have or do not have. It involves behaviors, thoughts and actions that can be learned and developed in anyone.  According to the American Psychological Association (2017), resilience is the ability to adapt in the face of adversity, tragedy, threats or significant stress — such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems or workplace and financial stressors.  Resilience refers to bouncing back from difficult experiences in life.  There is nothing extraordinary about resilience.  People often demonstrate resilience in times of adversity.  However, being resilient does not mean that a person will not experience difficulty or distress, as emotional pain is common for people when they suffer from a major adversity or trauma.  In fact, the path to resilience often involves considerable emotional pain [70].

Resilience and access to other resources are protective factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brockie|first=Teresa N.|last2=Elm|first2=Jessica H.

Having resilience can benefit children who have been exposed to trauma and have a higher A.C.E score. Children who can learn to develop it, can use resilience to build themselves up after trauma. A child who has not developed resilience will have a harder time coping with the challenges that can come in adult life. People and children who are resilient, embrace the thinking that adverse experiences do not define who they are. They also can think about past events in their lives that were traumatic, and, try to reframe them in a way that is constructive. They are able to find strength in their struggle and ultimately can overcome the challenges and adversity that was faced in childhood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elm|first=Jessica H. L.|last2=Lewis|first2=Jordan P.|last3=Walters|first3=Karina L.|last4=Self|first4=Jen M.|date=2016-06-02|title='I'm in this world for a reason': Resilience and recovery among American Indian and Alaska Native two-spirit women|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|language=en|volume=20|issue=3–4|pages=352–371|doi=10.1080/10894160.2016.1152813|pmid=27254761|issn=1089-4160}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In childhood, resiliency can come from having a caring adult in a child's life. Resiliency can also come from having meaningful moments such as an academic achievement or getting praise from teachers or mentors. 
	In adulthood, resilience is the concept of self-care. If you are taking care of yourself and taking the necessary time to reflect and build on your experiences, then you will have a higher capacity for taking care of others. Adults can also use this skill to counteract some of the trauma they have experienced. Self-care can mean a variety of things. One example of self-care, is knowing when you are beginning to feel burned out and then taking a step back to rest and recuperate yourself. Another component of self-care is practicing mindfulness or engaging in some form of meditation. If you are able to take the time to reflect upon your experiences, then you will be able to build a greater level of resiliency moving forward. All of these strategies put together can help to build resilience and counteract some of the childhood trauma that was experienced. With these strategies children can begin to heal after experiencing adverse childhood experiences. 
	This aspect of resiliency is so important because it enables people to find hope in their traumatic past. When first looking at the A.C.E. study and the different correlations that come with having 4 or more traumas, it is easy to feel defeated. It is even possible for this information to encourage people to have unhealthy coping behaviors. Introducing resilience and the data that supports its positive outcome in regards to trauma, allows for a light at the end of a tunnel. It gives people the opportunity to be [[proactive]] instead of reactive when it comes to addressing the traumas in their past.

===Criminal justice===
Since research suggests that incarcerated individuals are much more likely to have been exposed to violence and suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD),&lt;ref name="Corrections"&gt;Miller &amp; Najavits [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3402099/  "Creating trauma-informed correctional care: a balance of goals and environment"], ''European Journal of Psychotraumatology'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a trauma-informed approach may better help to address some of these criminogenic risk factors and can create a less traumatizing criminal justice experience.{{according to whom|date=December 2015}} Programs, like Seeking Safety, are often used to help individuals in the criminal justice system learn how to better cope with trauma, PTSD, and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="Seeking Safety"&gt;Seeking Safety [http://www.seekingsafety.org/  "Seeking Safety: A Model to Improve Coping Skills"], ''Seeking Safety''&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile courts better help deter children from crime and delinquency when they understand the trauma many of these children have experienced.&lt;ref name="Juvenile Courts"&gt;Buffington et al. [http://www.ncjfcj.org/sites/default/files/trauma%20bulletin_1.pdf  "Ten Things Every Juvenile Court Judge Should Know About Trauma and Delinquency"], ''NCJFCJ'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal justice system itself can also retraumatize individuals.&lt;ref name="Hawaii"&gt;National Association of State Mental Health Program Director [http://www.nasmhpd.org/docs/NCTIC/7014_hawaiian_trauma_brief_2013.pdf "Creating A Place Of Healing and Forgiveness: The Trauma-Informed Care Initiative at the Women’s Community Correctional Center of Hawaii"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720114107/http://www.nasmhpd.org/docs/NCTIC/7014_hawaiian_trauma_brief_2013.pdf |date=2014-07-20 }}, ''NASMHPD'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This can be prevented by creating safer facilities where correctional and police officers are properly trained to keep incidents from escalating.&lt;ref name="Corrections" /&gt; Partnerships between police and mental health providers can also reduce the possible traumatizing effects of police intervention and help provide families with the proper mental health and social services.&lt;ref name="Law Enforcement"&gt;The National Child Traumatic Stress Network [http://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/assets/pdfs/SS_brief_law_enforcement.pdf "Creating A Trauma-Informed Law Enforcement System"], ''NCTSN'', April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Women’s Community Correctional Center of Hawaii began a Trauma-Informed Care Initiative that aims to train all employees to be aware and sensitive to trauma, to screen all women in their facility for trauma, to assess those who have experienced trauma, and begin providing trauma-informed mental health care to those women identified.&lt;ref name="Hawaii" /&gt;

===Faith-based organizations===
{{Primary sources|section |date=August 2018|reason=Sources used are connected to orgs named; independent, published sources needed}}

Some faith-based organizations offer spiritual services in response to traumas identified by ACE surveys.  For example, the founder of ACE Overcomers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aceovercomers.com/about-us.html | title=About Us |website=aceovercomers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined the epidemiology of ACEs, the neurobiology of toxic stress and principles of the Christian [[Bible]] into a workbook and 12-week course used by [[clergy]] in several states.&lt;ref name="pastor"&gt;Stevens [http://acestoohigh.com/2012/03/13/ex-pastor-marries-science-bible-studies-to-heal-wounds-of-childhood-trauma/ "Ex-pastor marries science, Bible studies to heal wounds of childhood trauma"], ''ACEs Connection'', 13 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Linda D.|last2=Carroll|first2=Paul|last3=Hamilton|first3=W.

===Legislation===
Vermont has passed a bill, Act 43(H.508), an act relating to building resilience for individuals experiencing adverse childhood experiences which acknowledges the life span effects of ACEs on health outcomes, seeks wide use of ACE screening by health providers and aims to educate medical and health school students about ACEs.&lt;ref&gt;http://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/ACTS/ACT043/ACT043%20As%20Enacted.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/ACTS/ACT043/ACT043%20As%20Enacted.pdf|title=No. 43.

This bill aims to create "safe and supportive schools" through services and initiatives focused on physical, social, and emotional safety.&lt;ref name="Mass"&gt;Prewitt [http://www.acesconnection.com/blog/model-safe-and-supportive-schools-provisions-included-in-new-gun-violence-reduction-law "Massachusetts "Safe and Supportive Schools" provisions signed into law, boosts trauma-informed school movement"], ''ACEs Too High'', 13 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2787">The '''Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science''' is a cross-disciplinary organization founded in 2009 within [[Stony Brook University]]'s School of Journalism, in [[Stony Brook, New York]].

Its current director is Laura Lindenfield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/?cat=6 Staff and Leadership Archive], Center for Communicating Science&lt;/ref&gt;  Its goal is to help scientists learn to communicate more effectively with the public, including policymakers, students, funders and the media. It was inspired by [[Alan Alda]], the actor, writer and science advocate, in whose honor it was renamed in 2013, and is supported by [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=sbpress&gt;{{cite web|title=It was a SM*A*S*H of Science|url=http://sbpress.com/2010/10/it-was-a-s-mash-of-science/|work=October 1, 2010|publisher=[[Stony Brook Press]]|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center offers courses in communication that have been taken by more than 200 graduate students in the sciences and health professions at Stony Brook. It also conducts workshops at universities, laboratories and science meetings around the country. Many of its workshops use improvisational theater exercises to help scientists connect more directly with listeners and respond more spontaneously to their needs.&lt;ref name="Actor Is Honored for Using Improv to Help Scientists Communicate"&gt;{{cite news |last=Basken |first=Paul |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Alan-Alda-the-Actor-Is/138673/ |title=Actor Is Honored for Using Improv to Help Scientists Communicate |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2015-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Alda and the Center issued the "Flame Challenge",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flamechallenge.org/|title=Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science™|work=flamechallenge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking scientists to come up with the best explanation for a [[flame]] for an intended audience of 11-year-olds.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Alda seeking curious 11-year-old scientists|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46609095/ns/technology_and_science-science|work=Mar 2, 2012|publisher=MSNBC.com|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='npr-totn'&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/2012/03/23/149231680/alan-alda-asks-scientists-what-is-a-flame | title = Alan Alda Asks Scientists "What Is A Flame?" | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | date = 2012-03-23 | work = [[Science Friday]] | publisher = [[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5071">'''Alliesthesia''' ({{GreekFont|αλλoς}} (allós) - other, and {{GreekFont|αἴσθησις}} (aísthēsis) - sensation, perception ; ''French'' : ''alliesthésie'', ''German'' : ''Alliästhesie'') is a [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] [[phenomenon]] (not to be confused with the [[pathology|pathologic]] [[symptom]] of [[allesthesia]]) that describes the dependent relationship between the internal state of an organism and the perceived pleasure or displeasure of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabanac|first=Michel|date=1971-09-17|title=Physiological Role of Pleasure|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/173/4002/1103|journal=Science|language=en|volume=173|issue=4002|pages=1103–1107|doi=10.1126/science.173.4002.1103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5098954}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The internal state of an organism is in constant change, and any stimulus that can help to correct an error or need will be pleasantly perceived. For example, food will be more pleasant when hungry compared to when an organism is [[satiety|satiated]]. The sensation aroused therefore depends not only on the quality or on the intensity of the stimulus, but also on the internal state of the organism as sensed by internal [[Sensory receptor|receptors]]. The relationship between the [[Perception|perceptual system]] and [[physiology]] is [[subjectivity|subjective]] and studied by [[psychophysics]][[Subjectivity|.]]

== Forms of alliesthesia ==

* ''thermal'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of the thermic perception (heat and cold), which contributes fundamentally to [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[thermoregulation]]. It is an aspect of [[thermal comfort]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkinson|first=Thomas|last2=de Dear|first2=Richard|date=2014-12-15|title=Thermal pleasure in built environments: physiology of alliesthesia|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09613218.2015.989662|journal=Building Research &amp; Information|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=288–301|doi=10.1080/09613218.2015.989662|issn=0961-3218}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* ''olfactory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[olfaction]] (sense of [[Olfaction|smell]])
* ''gustatory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[taste]] - see [[taste|primary tastes]] (sweet, salty, bitter, acid, [[umami]] and "[[calcium]])"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tordoff | first1 = MG | year = 2008 | title = Gene discovery and the genetic basis of calcium consumption | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 94 | issue = | pages = 649–659 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.04.004 | pmid=18499198 | pmc=2574908}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* olfacto-gustatory alliesthesia or '''alimentary alliesthesia''': alliesthesia of tastes/flavors pertaining to [[food intake]]
* ''visual''/optic alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[Visual perception|vision]]
* ''auditory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of the [[Hearing (sense)|sense of hearing]]

Each of these forms of alliesthesia exists in two opposite tendencies:
* ''negative'' alliesthesia: shift of sensation from pleasure to displeasure.
* ''positive'' alliesthesia: shift of sensation from displeasure to pleasure.

== Evidence ==

The phenomenon of ''alliesthesia'' was first described by the French physiologist [[Michel Cabanac]]. The first scientific publication from 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Minaire | first2 = Y | last3 = Adair | first3 = ER | year = 1968 | title = Influence of internal factors on the pleasantness of a gustative sweet sensation | url = | journal = Communic Behav Biol Part A | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 77–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was succeeded by over 40 publications in international journals, for example: 1970 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Duclaux | first2 = R | year = 1970 | title = Specificity of internal signals in producing satiety for taste stimuli | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 227 | issue = | pages = 966–7 | doi=10.1038/227966a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1971 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabanac|first=Michel|date=1971-09-17|title=Physiological Role of Pleasure|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/173/4002/1103|journal=Science|language=en|volume=173|issue=4002|pages=1103–1107|doi=10.1126/science.173.4002.1103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5098954}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term ''alliesthesia'' was first mentioned in the annex of ''Physiological Role of Pleasure'' and was further elaborated in collaboration with the coauthor [[Stylianos Nicolaïdis]]. Originally, alliesthesia was demonstrated in [[experiment]]s with human subjects, and later confirmed in rats (''[[Rattus norvegicus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Lafrance | first2 = L | year = 1990 | title = Postingestive alliesthesia: the rat tells the same story. | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003193849090123L | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 539–43 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(90)90123-L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applied ecology''' is a subfield within [[ecology]], which considers the [[applied science|application]] of the science of ecology to real-world (usually management) questions.  It is an integrated treatment of the ecological, social, and biotechnological aspects of natural resource conservation and management.  It is also called ecological or environmental technology.  Applied ecology typically focuses on geomorphology, soils, and plant communities as the underpinnings for vegetation and wildlife (both game and non-game) management.

Aspects of applied ecology include:

'''''Birds of the World: Recommended English Names''''' is a [[paperback]] book, written by [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]] and [[Minturn Wright]] on behalf of the [[International Ornithologists' Union]]. The book is an attempt to produce a standardized set of [[Common name|English names]] for all bird species, and it is the product of a project set in motion at the 1990 International Ornithological Congress. It is supplemented by a website, the '''IOC World Bird List''', giving updates to the published material.

An 11-page introduction deals with a number of issues which relate to the naming of birds. This is followed by a systematic list, from pages 12 to 211, and a 46-page index. The [[Family (biology)|family]] sequence is that of the third edition of the ''[[Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World]]''.  The book's cover is illustrated with a photo of a [[helmet vanga]], a bird [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] to [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name = "BotW"&gt;Gill, Frank, and Minturn Wright, ''Birds of the World: Recommended English Names''; Princeton University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|back cover}}

==Background==
Since the pioneering work of [[Linnaeus]], species of organisms have had recognized [[scientific names]] in Latin, Greek, or a modernized derivative of one or both of those languages.  In most groups of organisms, the scientific names are sufficient, enjoying widespread use among academics and amateurs alike.  By contrast, non-scientific (vernacular) names for birds are extensively used in scientific communication as well as in the large community of amateur enthusiasts.&lt;ref name = "MarOrni"&gt;Burger, Alan E., "Birds of the World: Recommended English Names", ''Marine Ornithology'' 35:86 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, vernacular names change frequently and often vary from place to place.&lt;ref name = "BotW"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Consequently, there is a need to have a degree of consistency in the vernacular names used around the world.&lt;ref name = "MarOrni" /&gt;

In the late 19th century, the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] (AOU) made an attempt to standardize the English names of birds; its effort covered the United States and Canada.  This work's most recent edition, the seventh, covers North America as far south as Panama, but this omits some 80% of the world's species and is still sometimes controversial.  A number of authors have come up with lists of birds of the world, but none had as its primary goal the standardization of names.  As a result, the field of English names of birds was left "a swirling sea of polylexy and polysemy, where one bird may have many names and one name may apply to many birds."&lt;ref name="BNJ"&gt;Wright, Rick, [http://birdaz.com/blog/2006/08/28/gill-and-wright-birds-of-the-world-recommended-english-names/ Gill and Wright, Birds of the World: Recommended English Names] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614045954/http://birdaz.com/blog/2006/08/28/gill-and-wright-birds-of-the-world-recommended-english-names/ |date=June 14, 2010 }}, Birding New Jersey, Aug. 28, 2006; accessed 2012.03.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, the [[International Ornithological Congress]] (IOC) sought to reach consensus in standardized vernacular names for commonly used languages.  Standardized names were published for French&lt;ref&gt;Devillers, P. &amp; Ouellet, H. 1993. ''Noms français des oiseaux du monde avec les équivalents latins et anglais''. Sainte-Foy, Quebec, and Chabaud, Bayonne, France: Éditions MultiMondes. 452 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993 and Spanish&lt;ref&gt;Bernis, F. 1995. ''Diccionario de nombres vernaculos de aves''. Madrid: Editorial Gredos. 232 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995.&lt;!--Swedish: 2015: see https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/02/24/out-of-fear-of-racism-sweden-changes-the-names-of-bird-species/ --&gt;  English names proved particularly challenging: the task took more than fifteen years.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  Even so, the authors acknowledged that reaching complete global consensus on names and spelling is unlikely, and they presented this work as a first phase of an ongoing process.&lt;ref name = "MarOrni" /&gt;

The English names project began in 1990, when the IOC appointed a committee of prominent ornithologists, chaired by [[Burt Monroe|Burt L. Monroe, Jr.]], to consider the issue.  The work "proved to be more difficult and time-consuming" than expected.  Monroe's death brought the project to a halt.  Not until 1994 was the project revived, by Gill and Walter Bock.  Gill invited Wright to become recording secretary and organizer of the process; the two were named co-chairs of the revitalized committee.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Authors and committee==

The standardization effort was undertaken by a committee of the IOC (the Standing Committee on English Names&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|11}}), with regional subcommittees.&lt;ref name = "MarOrni"/&gt;  The Standing Committee was co-chaired by [[Frank Gill (ornithologist)|Frank Gill]], a professional ornithologist with worldwide research interests and experience, and Minturn Wright, a lawyer and international birder with an interest in nomenclature; these two were the authors of the book and supervised the overall task.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|back cover}}  G. Stuart Keith, [[Christopher Perrins]], Nigel Redman, [[Robert S. Ridgely]], Stephen M. Russell, Peter G. Ryan, and [[Richard Schodde]] served as regional chairs.  David B. Donsker was taxonomic editor.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

Twenty-eight committee members worked to formulate the rules and apply them to the task: Per Alström, Mark Beaman, Aldo Berutti, Clive Barlow, David Bishop, Murray Bruce, Paul Coopmans, W. Richard J. Dean, Brian Gill, Simon Harrap, Steven Hilty, Steve N. G. Howell, Tim Inskipp, Michael Irwin, [[Kenn Kaufman]], G. Stuart Keith, Ben King, David Parkin, [[Christopher Perrins]], [[H. Douglas Pratt]], Nigel Redman, Peter G. Ryan, [[Robert Ridgely (ornithologist)|Robert S. Ridgley]], Phillip Round, Stephen M. Russell, [[Richard Schodde]], Donald Turner, and [[Harrison B. Tordoff]].  The committee members received abundant assistance from others as well.  As the authors noted, the compilation of the list was an all-volunteer effort.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

==Criteria==

As part of the name standardization, it was also necessary to develop a set of rules for spelling, capitalization, the use of derivative names, and the like.  While the rules occupy several pages of the book, they may be briefly summarized:&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|5–9}}

*Official English names of species are capitalized (as was already the practice among ornithologists)
*Patronyms (names of people) are used in the possessive form, e.g., "[[Ross's gull|Ross's Gull]]"
*Names used do not include diacriticals or inflection marks &lt;!--(Ñöńè ǒf ťħîş șţüff)--&gt;
*Compromises are made between British and American spellings
*Users are encouraged to spell and use pronunciation marks according to their preference
*Geographical names may be the noun or adjective form, but must be consistent for the location, e.g., ''Canada'' (as in "[[Canada goose|Canada Goose]]" and "[[Canada warbler|Canada Warbler]]"), not ''Canadian'', but ''African'' (as in "[[African piculet|African Piculet]]" or "[[African wood owl|African Wood Owl]]"), not ''Africa''
*Compound words adhere to a set of rules designed to be consistent in their balancing of readability and the relationships of the words
*Hyphens are minimized, but for compound group names, hyphens are used only to connect two names that are themselves bird species or families, e.g., "[[Horned owl|Eagle-Owl]]", "[[Old World babbler|Wren-Babbler]]", or when the combined name would be difficult to read, e.g., "[[Silky-flycatcher]]"

The committee began consideration of each species's name with reference to existing usage: if a name was in long-standing or widespread usage, it was not changed simply to correct a perceived inaccuracy.  Names using such widespread words as "warbler" for multiple groups of unrelated species were let stand.  Local names, however, were dropped in favor of already-established formal names.  Names that were seen as offensive to a "substantial" group of people were changed.  Many old geographical names were also updated.  A strong preference for English words in names was expressed, although long-standing terms from other languages were generally left standing.  The most important criterion was that each species was to have only one English name throughout the world, which was to be different from all other names.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The result, published in 2006, was a 199-page list of species,&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|12–211}} arranged taxonomically,&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|2}} and a 46-page index,&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|213–259}} giving both English and scientific names, primarily of genera and families.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|10}}  The taxonomy generally follows the lines set out in the third edition of Howard and Moore's ''Checklist of Birds of the World''.&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|2}}   A compact disk bundled with the book contains spreadsheet files that list all 10,068 species and provide additional information on their ranges.&lt;ref name = "BNJ" /&gt;

==Reception==

As the authors acknowledged, "Passions about bird names run high."&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  Reviews of the book were generally favorable.&lt;ref name = "BNJ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bauers, Sandy, "To decide bird names, authors had to wrestle with loons", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', September 10, 2006: "a Solomonlike endeavor".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audubon.org/bird/pdf/ScienceNewsletterFall2006.pdf Speaking Out], ''Audubon Science News'', Fall 2006, p.5: “developed by leading ornithologists worldwide and endorsed by members of the preeminent International Ornithological Congress”.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheke, A., Birds of the World: Recommended English Names.

''British Birds'' 101:264-268 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ted Floyd, editor of ''Birding'' magazine, called the book "[a] very valuable resource."&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Ted, [https://www.amazon.com/Birds-World-Recommended-English-Names/dp/0691128278 Book Description: Birds of the World: Recommended English Names], on Amazon.com, July 31, 2006; accessed 2013.01.31.&lt;/ref&gt;
S.N.G. Howell called the work a "handy little book" and "a good starting point [which] deserves serious consideration by persons interested in communicating" about birds, although the review mentions the inconsistency between this list and the AOU's names.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, S.N.G., [http://www.worldbirdnames.org/history/reviews/a-review-by-steve-howell/  Birds of the World: Recommended English Names] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413105313/http://www.worldbirdnames.org/history/reviews/a-review-by-steve-howell/ |date=April 13, 2013 }}; ''Western Birds'' 37:239-240 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
Rick Wright, while acknowledging that "[c]onsistency is a slippery goal," called the list "a spectacularly useful resource for anyone who writes, reads, or thinks about birds outside of his or her own region" and concluded that "the committee and the editors are to be congratulated for producing a useful and useable (sic) work."&lt;ref name = "BNJ" /&gt;

However, the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] (AOU) castigated the authors for not using the AOU's guidelines and policies, particularly in the treatment of hyphens. The AOU argued that "hyphens in compound group names indicate relationships and separate the members of the groups from less closely related forms," stating as examples that the hyphen in "[[Whistling duck|Whistling-Duck]]s" distinguishes this bird from other ducks and the hyphen in "[[Storm petrel|Storm-Petrel]]s" separates it from other petrels in the family [[Procellariidae]].&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Classification and Nomenclature of Birds (North and Middle America) policy on English names of birds, [http://www.aou.org/auk/content/124/1472.pdf], ''The Auk'' 124(4):1472 (2007): "The AOU Committee has unanimously rejected the proposal to adopt the IOC guidelines and spelling rules for English names of North American birds. We will continue to follow the guidelines and policies outlined in the 6th and 7th editions of the Check-list of North American Birds."&lt;/ref&gt;
The authors felt the need to respond.&lt;ref&gt;Frank B. Gill, Stephen M. Russell, and Minturn T. Wright III, "[http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/auk.2008.21008.3 Hyphenated Bird Names: A Response To The American Ornithologists' Union's Rejection Of International Ornithological Congress Guidelines]" ''The Auk'', 125(4):986–986, October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  They pointed out that hyphens are not used in this fashion in fields such as [[herpetology]] and suggested that "well-intentioned hyphenation practices misrepresent [[phylogenetic]] relationships too often to be helpful." They repeated their recommendation that hyphens should be used "sparingly," and urged their fellow ornithologists to "work together to simplify the use of hyphens as one small step towards improved standardization of English bird names."&lt;ref&gt;Frank B. Gill, Minturn T. Wright, III, Sally B. Conyne, Robert Kirk, "[http://www.worldbirdnames.org/On%20hyphens%20and%20phylogeny%20WJO%202009.pdf On hyphens and phylogeny] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025091500/http://www.worldbirdnames.org/On%20hyphens%20and%20phylogeny%20WJO%202009.pdf |date=October 25, 2012 }}"; ''The Wilson Journal of Ornithology'' 121(3):652(4), September 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Capitalization presented another dispute, and still has not reached a uniform resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Harbison, [http://www.audubon.org/news/case-history Case History: The long and torturous tale of how a style guide came to be.] ''Audubon'', June 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and legacy==
The book sold well, but it quickly became apparent that revisions would be needed, particularly as new species were described.  Although the authors stressed that their work was "a first edition",&lt;ref name = "BotW" /&gt;{{rp|11}} in 2009&lt;!--still working on this date--&gt;, the IOC decided not to supplement the book with a revised print edition.  Instead, the list of English names is now published electronically on the ''IOC World Bird List'' website.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, F., &amp; D. Donsker (Eds.), ''IOC World Bird Names'' (v. 3.3). Available at http://www.worldbirdnames.org; accessed 2013.01.31.&lt;/ref&gt;  A page on the website tabulates the spread of the list.&lt;ref&gt;IOC World Bird List, [http://www.worldbirdnames.org/the-project/reactions/ Adoptions &amp; Applications]; accessed 2013.01.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5847">The '''British Biophysical Society''' is a [[scientific society]] that exists to encourage and disseminate developments in the application of physical and chemical concepts to biological systems. It was founded in 1960 following a report from a Working Party on Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry initiated by the Council of the then [[Faraday Society]] of London.

==History==
The first full meeting of the Working Party on Biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry was held on 4 February 1960. The party included D D Eley, L H Gray, A F Huxley, J C Kendrew, C F A Pantin, R D Preston, J T Randall, F J W Roughton and P M B Walker.

The first meeting of the British Biophysical Society was held at [[King's College (London)]] and was organised by Prof J T Randall.  The birth of the BBS can be said to date from this inaugural meeting held on 19 and 20 December 1960.  The meeting took the form of two symposia on Comparative Studies of Muscular Contraction and on the Structure of [[Ribonucleic Acid]], together with sessions for contributed papers.  Minutes of the Steering Committee held on December 8 record that there had already been 183 applications to join the Society and 177 to attend the meeting.  By the end of 1960, the membership totaled 224.  At the King's College meeting W T Astbury and A V Hill were elected Honorary members.

==The Early Years==
The first Steering Committee of the BBS, Dr J C Kendrew became the first Honorary Secretary and Prof [[Dan Eley|D D Eley]] Meetings Secretary, and the Committee elected Prof J T Randall as its first Chairman and Dr P B M Walker as Honorary Treasurer.  Other committee members were [[Sydney Brenner|S Brenner]], J A V Butler, [[Andrew Huxley|A F Huxley]], [[Richard Keynes|R D Keynes]], R D Preston, J W S Pringle, F J W Roughton and J T Weiss.

From its inception the British Biophysical Society embraced a wide range of topics in Biology. The first major scientific meeting of the British Biophysical Society at King’s College, London (on The Structure of Globular Proteins and The Function of Proteins) and a report on proceedings written by Professor [[Herbert Gutfreund|Freddie (Herbert) Gutfreund]] (one of the Society’s founder members), appeared in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://britishbiophysics.org.uk/index.php?id%3Dabout |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203120340/http://britishbiophysics.org.uk/index.php?id=about |archivedate=2011-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BBS Today==


The BBS has about 700 members in its newsgroup, and ~ 220 paying members. It is affiliated to EBSA [2] and IUPAb [3] The BBS committee meets three times a year, organizing and sponsoring both specialist and a more general meeting biennially, in the years that EBSA does not have its congress.

BBS also supports travel bursaries for younger scientists, and is the adhering society to IUPAB ([[Tony North]] was general Secretary of IUPAB for ~ 12 years, and a founding member of BBS) and EBSA (since its inception through the initial activities of [[Peter M. Bayley|Peter Bayley]], former editor of Eur. Biophys. J), and is working with the Biophysical Chemistry group of the Royal Chemical Society, and the Biological Physics group of the [[Institute of Physics]]. In 2007, BBS was the national society organizing the 6th EBSA/BBS congress at [[Imperial College, London]], with [[Mike Ferenczi]] (London) [4] as the local organizer and [[Anthony Watts (biophysicist)|Tony Watts]] (Oxford) [5] as scientific chair, attracting over 1350 participants and ~800 posters. In 2010, the 50th Anniversary Symposium of the British Biophysical Society was held at [[Robinson College, Cambridge]] [6],and further biennial meetings have been in [[Durham, England|Durham]] in 2012 and [[Warwick]] in 2014.

In 2017, BBS and the Biological Physics Group of the Institute of Physics, will jointly organize the IUPAB/EBSA/BBS/IoP Biophysics Congress in Edinburgh, with [[Anthony Watts (biophysicist)|Tony Watts]] as Chair and [[Andrew Turberfield]] as co-chair of the congress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13461">'''Plant callus''' (plural ''calluses'' or ''calli'') is a growing [[mass]] of unorganized plant [[parenchyma]] cells. In living plants, callus cells are those cells that cover a plant wound. In biological research and biotechnology callus formation is induced from plant tissue samples (explants) after surface sterilization and plating onto tissue culture medium [[in vitro]] (in a closed culture vessel such as a [[Petri dish]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/~sd21/tisscult/what.htm What is Plant Tissue Culture?]&lt;/ref&gt;    The culture medium is supplemented with [[Plant hormone|plant growth regulators]], such as [[auxin]]s, [[cytokinin]]s, and [[gibberellin]]s, to initiate callus formation or [[Somatic Embryogenesis|somatic embryogenesis]].  Callus initiation has been described for all major groups of land plants. [[Image:Callus1.jpg|thumb| ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' parenchyma cells in culture]]

== Morphology ==
Specific [[auxin]] to [[cytokinin]] ratios in plant tissue culture medium give rise to an unorganized growing and dividing mass of callus cells. Callus cultures are often broadly classified as being either compact or friable. Friable calluses fall apart easily, and can be used to generate cell suspension cultures.  Callus can directly undergo direct [[organogenesis]] and/or [[embryogenesis]] where the cells will form an entirely new plant. This process is known as callus culture

== Callus cells deaths ==
Callus can brown and die during culture, but the causes for callus browning are not well understood.  In ''[[Jatropha curcas]]'' callus cells, small organized callus cells became disorganized and varied in size after browning occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=He|first=Yang |author2=Guo, Xiulian |author3=Lu, Ran |author4=Niu, Bei |author5=Pasapula, Vijaya |author6=Hou, Pei |author7=Cai, Feng |author8=Xu, Ying |author9=Chen, Fang|title=Changes in morphology and biochemical indices in browning callus derived from Jatropha curcas hypocotyls|journal=Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (PCTOC)|volume=98|issue=1|pages=11–17|doi=10.1007/s11240-009-9533-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Browning (chemical process)|Browning]] has also been associated with oxidation and [[Natural phenol|phenolic]] compounds in both explant tissues and explant secretions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dan|first=Yinghui |author2=Armstrong, Charles L. |author3=Dong, Jimmy |author4=Feng, Xiaorong |author5=Fry, Joyce E. |author6=Keithly, Greg E. |author7=Martinell, Brian J. |author8=Roberts, Gail A. |author9=Smith, Lori A. |author10=Tan, Lalaine J. |author11=Duncan, David R. |title=Lipoic acid—an unique plant transformation enhancer|journal=In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology - Plant|volume=45|issue=6|pages=630–638|doi=10.1007/s11627-009-9227-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rice, presumably, a condition which is favorable for scutellar callus induction induces necrosis too.&lt;ref name="pazuki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pazuki |first=Arman |last2=Sohani |first2=Mehdi |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2013 |title= Phenotypic evaluation of scutellum-derived calluses in ‘Indica’ rice cultivars |url= http://aas.bf.uni-lj.si/september2013/08Pazuki.pdf |format=PDF |journal= Acta Agriculturae Slovenica |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=239–247 |doi=10.2478/acas-2013-0020 |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Callus cells are not necessarily genetically homogeneous because a callus is often made from structural tissue, not individual cells.{{clarify|reason=why would cells derived from "structural tissue" be any less "genetically homogenous" than a population of cells derived from a single cell?|date=August 2016}} Nevertheless, callus cells are often considered similar enough for standard scientific analysis to be performed as if on a single subject. For example, an experiment may have half a callus undergo a treatment as the [[experimental group]], while the other half undergoes a similar but non-active treatment as the [[control group]].

Plant calluses derived from many different cell types can differentiate into a whole plant, a process called regeneration, through addition of plant hormones to the culture medium.  This ability is known as [[totipotency]].  Regeneration of a whole plant from a single cell allows [[transgenesis|transgenics]] researchers to obtain whole plants which have a copy of the transgene in every cell.  Regeneration of a whole plant that has some genetically transformed cells and some untransformed cells yields a [[chimera (plant)|chimera]].  In general, chimeras are not useful for genetic research or agricultural applications.

Genes can be inserted into callus cells using biolistic bombardment, also known as a [[gene gun]], or ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''.  Cells that receive the gene of interest can then be recovered into whole plants using a combination of [[plant hormone]]s.  The whole plants that are recovered can be used to experimentally determine gene function(s), or to enhance crop plant traits for modern agriculture.

Callus is of particular use in [[micropropagation]] where it can be used to grow genetically identical copies of plants with desirable characteristics.

The '''Brazilian Center for Research in Physics''' ({{lang-pt|Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas}}, '''CBPF''') is a physics research center in the [[Urca, Rio de Janeiro|Urca]] neighborhood of [[Rio de Janeiro]] sponsored by the Brazilian [[National Council for Scientific and Technological Development]] (CNPq), linked to the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Brazil)|Ministry of Science and Technology]]. CBPF was founded in 1949 from a joint effort of [[Cesar Lattes]], [[José Leite Lopes]], and [[Jayme Tiomno]]. Throughout its existence, CBPF became an internationally renowned research institution, organizing several international meetings and hosting many renowned physicists, like [[Richard Feynman]] and [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]. It was also the starting point of important Brazilian institutions, like the [[Instituto Nacional de Matemática Pura e Aplicada|National Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics]] (IMPA), the [[National Laboratory for Scientific Computation]] (LNCC) and the [[National Laboratory of Synchrotron Light]] (LNLS). Since its creation, CBPF has been one of the most important Physics research institutions in Brazil, and its graduate program ranks among the best in the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7442">'''Chronic toxicity''', the development of adverse effects as a result of long term exposure to a contaminant or other stressor, is an important aspect of [[aquatic toxicology]].&lt;ref name="Rand"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of aquatic toxicology: Effects, Environmental Fate, and Risk Assessment |last1=Rand |first1=G.M. |year=1995 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn= 978-1560320913|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse effects associated with chronic toxicity can be directly lethal but are more commonly sublethal, including changes in growth, reproduction, or behavior. Chronic toxicity is in contrast to [[acute toxicity]], which occurs over a shorter period of time to higher concentrations. Various toxicity tests can be performed to assess the chronic toxicity of different contaminants, and usually last at least 10% of an organism’s lifespan.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of ecotoxicology |last1=Newman |first1=M.C. |year=2010 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn= 978-1-4200-6704-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of aquatic chronic toxicity tests can be used to determine water quality guidelines and regulations for protection of aquatic organisms.

==Chronic toxicity definition==
Chronic toxicity is the development of adverse effects as the result of long term exposure to a toxicant or other stressor. It can manifest as direct lethality but more commonly refers to sublethal endpoints such as decreased growth, reduced reproduction, or behavioral changes such as impacted swimming performance.

==Common aquatic chronic toxicity tests== 
Chronic toxicity tests are performed to determine the long term toxicity potential of toxicants or other stressors, commonly to aquatic organisms. Examples of common aquatic chronic toxicity test organisms, durations, and endpoints include: 
*Fathead minnow, ''[[Pimephales promelas]]'', larval survival and growth
*Daphnia, ''[[Daphnia magna]]'', 21-d survival and reproduction
*Green algae, ''[[Raphidocelis subcapitata]]'', 72-h growth
*Amphipod, ''[[Hyalella azteca]]'', 42-d survival, growth, and reproduction

==Application of chronic toxicity test results==
Results from chronic toxicity tests can be used to calculate values that can be used for determining water quality standards. These include:

===[[NOEC]]/[[LOEC]]===
The no observed effects concentration (NOEC) is determined as the highest tested concentration that shows no statistically significant difference from the control. The lowest observed effects concentration (LOEC) is the lowest concentration of those tested that produced a statistically significant difference from the control. NOECs and LOECs can be derived from both acute and chronic tests and are used by agencies to set water quality standards.

===[[Maximum Overdrive toxicant concentration|MATC]]/CV===
The maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) is calculated as the geometric mean of the NOEC and LOEC. MATC is sometimes called the chronic value (CV) and defined as “the concentration (threshold) at which chronic effects are first observed”.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Ecotoxicology, second edition |last1=Hoffman |first1=D.J. |last2=Rattner |first2=B.A. |last3=Burton |first3=G.A. Jr. |last4=Cairns |first4=J. |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PEC/[[Predicted no-effect concentration|PNEC]]===
The predicted no effects concentration (PNEC) is calculated from toxicity tests to determine the concentration that is not thought to cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name="Duffus"&gt;{{cite book |title=Concepts in Toxicology|last1=Duffus |first1=J.H. |last2=Templeton |first2=D.M. |last3=Nordberg |first3=M. |year=2009 |publisher=RSC Publishing |isbn = 978-0-85404-157-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determination of aquatic PNEC values requires toxicity test results from freshwater fish (e.g. ‘‘Pimephales promelas’’, freshwater invertebrates (e.g. ‘‘Daphnia magna’’), and freshwater algae (e.g. ‘‘Raphidocelis subcapitata’’)
The probable effects concentration (PEC), the concentration predicted to be in the environment, is compared with the PNEC in risk assessment. The PEC takes into account both acute and chronic exposures to toxicants.

===ACR/AF===
The [[acute to chronic ratio]] (ACR) allows for an estimation of chronic toxicity using acute toxicity data. It is calculated by dividing the LC50 by the MATC. The inverse of this (MATC/LC50) is termed the application factor (AF). AFs can be used when chronic toxicity data is not known for a specific species.

==Challenges with chronic toxicity testing== 
The chronic toxicity of toxicants is useful information to know in determining water quality guidelines, but this information is not always easily obtained. Chronic toxicity tests can be costly and difficult, due to challenges in keeping control organisms alive, maintaining water quality, retaining constant chemical exposures, and the sheer time required for tests.  Because of this, acute toxicity tests are more commonly employed, and ACRs and AFs are used to estimate chronic toxicity of toxicants to organisms.

==Factors that influence toxicity==
There are many factors that can increase or decrease the toxicity of toxicants or stressors, making interpretation of test results difficult. These can be chemical, biological, or toxicological.

===Chemical factors===
Water chemistry plays an important role in the toxicity of certain toxicants. This includes pH, salinity, water hardness, conductivity, temperature, and amounts of dissolved organic carbon [[(DOC)]]
For instance, the toxicity of copper is decreased with increasing amounts of DOC, as described by the [[biotic ligand model]] (BLM).&lt;ref name="Di Toro"&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 = Di Toro | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Allen | first2 = H.E. | last3 = Bergman | first3 = H.L. |last4 = Meyer | first4 = J.S. |last5 = Paquin |first5 = P.R. |last6 = Santore |first6 = R.C. | title = Biotic Ligand Model of the acute toxicity of metals I. Technical basis | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 20 | issue = 10 | pages = 2383–2396 | date = 2001 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620201034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Chronic toxicity will vary with differences in organisms, including species, size, and age. Certain species are more susceptible to toxic effects, as shown in species sensitivity distributions [[(SSDs)]]. Certain life stages are more susceptible to adverse effects, which is why [[early life stage]] (ELS) toxicity tests are performed for certain aquatic species. In addition, other physical factors, like organism size, can lead to differences in response to toxicants.

==Examples for use in water quality guidelines==
Water quality guidelines are determined based on the results of both acute and chronic toxicity tests. Criteria maximum concentrations (CMCs) are obtained from acute toxicity tests, whereas criteria continuous concentrations (CCCs) are obtained from chronic toxicity tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/standards/handbook/chapter03.cfm “Water Quality Standards Handbook - Chapter 3: Water Quality Criteria (40 CFR 131.11)” U.S. EPA, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; They are values determined by the U.S. EPA to be protective of aquatic organisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1930">'''Computational chemical methods in [[solid-state physics]]''' follow the same approach as they do for molecules, but with two differences. First, the translational symmetry of the solid has to be utilised, and second, it is possible to use completely delocalised basis functions such as [[plane waves]] as an alternative to the molecular atom-centered [[basis set (chemistry)|basis functions]].  The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a [[band structure]], which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the [[Brillouin zone]]. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies, therefore they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.

Calculations can use the [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] method, some [[post-Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] methods, particularly [[Møller&amp;ndash;Plesset perturbation theory]] to second order (MP2) and [[density functional theory]] (DFT).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5563">'''Deep social mind''' is a concept in evolutionary psychology; it refers to the distinctively human capacity to 'read' (that is, to infer) the mental states of others while reciprocally enabling those others to read one's own mental states at the same time. The term 'deep social mind' was first coined in 1999 by Andrew Whiten, professor of Evolutionary and Developmental Psychology at [[St. Andrews University]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In [[Michael Corballis|M. Corballis]] and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with closely related terms such as '[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]' and '[[intersubjectivity]]', it is now well-established among scholars investigating the evolutionary emergence of human sociality, cognition and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, C. and C. Power (2012). [http://www.chrisknight.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Knight-Power-Social-Conditions1.pdf Social conditions for the evolutionary emergence of language.] In M. Tallerman and K. Gibson (eds), ''Handbook of Language Evolution.'' Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 346-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindreading in apes and humans==

It is widely agreed that the brain is social in both human and nonhuman primates.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. I. M. 1998. The social brain hypothesis. ''[[Evolutionary Anthropology (journal)|Evolutionary Anthropology]]'' 6: 178-91.&lt;/ref&gt; But, according to Andrew Whiten, human sociality goes much further than [[ape sociality]]. Ape social intelligence is overwhelmingly '[[Machiavellian]]' in the sense of scheming, self-interested and egotistically calculating.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. and R. W. Byrne 1988. The manipulation of attention in primate tactical deception. In R. Byrne and A. Whiten (eds), ''Machiavellian Intelligence: Social expertise and the evolution of intellect in monkeys, apes, and humans.'' Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence is that while an ape may be motivated to 'read' (that is, to infer) the mental states of others around it, it has little motive to reciprocate. Instead of making its own mental states transparent to potential rivals, it seeks to block others from 'reading' its own mind. For example, one way to infer what another primate might be thinking is to detect which way its head is pointed, so as to reconstruct what it might be looking at. In the case of [[gorillas]] and [[chimpanzees]], adult apes have evolved eyes which give away very little information concerning direction of gaze. Their [[eyes]] are dark-on-dark: the iris is dark brown or even black and the same applies to the [[sclera]] and surrounding skin. Looking at the eyes, therefore, it is not easy to detect direction of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]]. In the human case, the eyes are very different, the dark iris standing out against a white surrounding sclera. This feature, combined with the relatively large size of the [[human eye]] and its horizontally elongated shape, assists neighbouring conspecifics to detect direction of gaze and, on that basis, engage in mind-reading.&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi, H., and S. Kohshima (2001). ‘Unique Morphology of the Human Eye and Its Adaptive Meaning: Comparative Studies on External Morphology of the Primate Eye.’ ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', 40 (5): 419-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 'Deep Social Mind' theory, this means that humans have become cognitively adapted to [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] and [[intersubjectivity]]: as a species, we are well-adapted to read the minds of trusted others while at the same time assisting those others in reading our own minds. One consequence of this is [[self-awareness]] or 'egocentric perspective reversal': I read your mind as you are reading mine. Therefore, between us, we can gain an awareness of our own minds as if from the outside: my mental states as these are reflected in yours and yours as they are reflected in mine. In that sense, if this argument is accepted, our minds mutually interpenetrate. 'Mind' in the human sense is not locked inside this or that skull but instead is relational, stretching between us.&lt;ref&gt;Whiten, A. 1999. The evolution of deep social mind in humans. In M. Corballis and S. E. G. Lea (eds), ''The Descent of Mind. Psychological perspectives on hominid evolution.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 173-193.&lt;/ref&gt; According to evolutionary psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], a [[human child]] normally achieves egocentric perspective reversal — viewing its own mental states as if from the standpoint of others — at around one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello (2000). [http://www.unt.edu/rss/class/mike/5640/articles/culturecogdevelopment.pdf Culture and Cognitive Development.] ''[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]]'', 9: 2, pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15176">'''Ecohydrology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶκος}}, ''oikos'', "house(hold)"; {{lang|grc|ὕδωρ}}, ''hydōr'', "water"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an interdisciplinary field studying the interactions between water and ecosystems.  These interactions may take place within water bodies, such as rivers and lakes, or on land, in forests, deserts, and other terrestrial ecosystems.  Areas of research in ecohydrology include transpiration and plant water use, adaption of organisms to their water environment, influence of vegetation on stream flow and function, and feedbacks between ecological processes and the hydrological cycle.

==Key concepts==
The [[hydrologic cycle]] describes the continuous movement of water on, [[Moisture recycling|above]], and below the surface on the earth. This flow is altered by ecosystems at numerous points.  Transpiration from plants provides the majority of flow of water to the atmosphere.  Water is influenced by vegetative cover as it flows over the land surface, while river channels can be shaped by the vegetation within them.

Ecohydrologists study both terrestrial and aquatic systems. In terrestrial ecosystems (such as forests, deserts, and savannas), the interactions among vegetation, the land surface, the [[vadose zone]], and the groundwater are the main focus.  In aquatic ecosystems (such as rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands), emphasis is placed on how water chemistry, geomorphology, and hydrology affect their structure and function.

===Principles===
The principles of Ecohydrology are expressed in three sequential components:
#Hydrological: The quantification of the hydrological cycle of a basin, should be a template for functional integration of hydrological and biological processes. 
#Ecological: The integrated processes at river basin scale can be steered in such a way as to enhance the basin’s [[carrying capacity]] and its [[ecosystem services]]. 
#Ecological engineering: The regulation of hydrological and ecological processes, based on an integrative system approach, is thus a new tool for Integrated Water Basin Management.

Their expression as testable hypotheses (Zalewski et al., 1997) may be seen as:
*H1: Hydrological processes generally regulate biota 
*H2: Biota can be shaped as a tool to regulate hydrological processes 
*H3: These two types of regulations (H1&amp;H2) can be integrated with hydro-technical infrastructure to achieve sustainable water and ecosystem services

===Vegetation and water stress===
A fundamental concept in ecohydrology is that plant physiology is directly linked to water availability.  Where there is ample water, as in rainforests, plant growth is more dependent on nutrient availability.  However, in semi-arid areas, like African savannas, vegetation type and distribution relate directly to the amount of water that plants can extract from the soil. When insufficient soil water is available, a water-stressed condition occurs.  Plants under water stress decrease both their transpiration and photosynthesis through a number of responses, including closing their stomata.  This decrease in the Canopy forest, canopy water flux and carbon dioxide flux can influence surrounding climate and weather.

Insufficient soil moisture produces stress in plants, and water availability is one of the two most important factors (temperature being the other) that determine species distribution. High winds, low atmospheric relative humidity, low carbon dioxide, high temperature, and high [[irradiance]] all exacerbate soil moisture insufficiency. Soil moisture availability is also reduced at low soil temperature. One of the earliest responses to insufficient moisture supply is a reduction in [[turgor pressure]]; cell expansion and growth are immediately inhibited, and [[Suberin|unsuberized]] shoots soon wilt.

The concept of water deficit, as developed by Stocker in the 1920s,&lt;ref name="stock1"&gt;Stocker, O. 1928. Des Wasserhaushalt ägyptischer Wüsten- und Salzpflanzen. Bot. Abhandlungen (Jena) 13:200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stock2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stocker | first1 = O | year = 1929a | title = Das Wasserdefizit von Gefässpflanzen in verschiedenen Klimazonen | url = | journal = Planta | volume = 7 | issue = 2–3| pages = 382–387 | doi=10.1007/bf01916035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stock3"&gt;Stocker, O. 1929b.

''Erdészeti Kisérletek (Sopron)'' 31:63-–76; 104-114.&lt;/ref&gt; is a useful index of the balance in the plant between uptake and loss of water. Slight water deficits are normal and do not impair the functioning of the plant,&lt;ref name="hen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henckel | first1 = P.A. | year = 1964 | title = Physiology of plants under drought | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 363–386 | doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.15.060164.002051}}&lt;/ref&gt; while greater deficits disrupt normal plant processes.

An increase in moisture stress in the rooting medium as small as 5 atmospheres affects growth, transpiration, and internal water balance in seedlings, much more so in Norway spruce than in [[birch]], [[aspen]], or [[Scots pine]].&lt;ref name="jarvis"&gt;Jarvis, P.G.; Jarvis, M.S. 1963. The water relations of tree seedlings. I. Growth and water use in relation to soil potential. II. Transpiration in relation to soil water potential. ''Physiol. Plantarum'' 16:215–235; 236–253.&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease in net assimilation rate is greater in the spruce than in the other species, and, of those species, only the spruce shows no increase in water use efficiency as the soil becomes drier. The two conifers show larger differences in water potential between leaf and substrate than do the hardwoods.&lt;ref name="jarvis" /&gt; Transpiration rate decrease less in Norway spruce than in the other three species as soil water stress increases up to 5 atmospheres in controlled environments. In field conditions, Norway spruce needles lose three times as much water from the fully turgid state as do birch and aspen leaves, and twice as much as Scots pine, before apparent closure of [[stoma]]ta (although there is some difficulty in determining the exact point of closure).&lt;ref name="sch"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = G.W. | last2 = Childers | first2 = N.F. | year = 1941 | title = Influence of soil moisture on photosynthesis, repiration and transpiration of apple leaves | url = | journal = Plant Physiol | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 565–583 | doi=10.1104/pp.16.3.565| pmid = 16653720 | pmc = 437931 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assimilation may therefore continue longer in spruce than in pine when plant water stresses are high, though spruce will probably be the first to “run out of water”.

===Soil moisture dynamics===
[[Soil moisture]] is a general term describing the amount of water present in the [[vadose zone]], or unsaturated portion of soil below ground.  Since plants depend on this water to carry out critical biological processes, soil moisture is integral to the study of ecohydrology.  Soil moisture is generally described as [[water content]], &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, or [[saturation (chemistry)|saturation]], &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  These terms are related by [[porosity]], &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, through the equation &lt;math&gt;\theta = nS&lt;/math&gt;.  The changes in soil moisture over time are known as soil moisture dynamics.

Recent global studies using water stable isotopes show that not all soil moisture is equally available for groundwater recharge or for plant transpiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Good|first=Stephen P.|last2=Noone|first2=David|last3=Bowen|first3=Gabriel|date=2015-07-10|title=Hydrologic connectivity constrains partitioning of global terrestrial water fluxes|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6244/175|journal=Science|language=en|volume=349|issue=6244|pages=175–177|doi=10.1126/science.aaa5931|issn=0036-8075|pmid=26160944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evaristo|first=Jaivime|last2=Jasechko|first2=Scott|last3=McDonnell|first3=Jeffrey J.|title=Global separation of plant transpiration from groundwater and streamflow|journal=Nature|volume=525|issue=7567|pages=91–94|doi=10.1038/nature14983|pmid=26333467|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal and spatial considerations===
Ecohydrological theory also places importance on considerations of temporal (time) and spatial (space) relationships.  Hydrology, in particular the timing of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] events, can be a critical factor in the way an ecosystem evolves over time.  For instance, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] landscapes experience dry summers and wet winters.  If the vegetation has a summer growing season, it often experiences water stress, even though the total precipitation throughout the year may be moderate.  Ecosystems in these regions have typically evolved to support high water demand grasses in the winter, when water availability is high, and [[drought]]-adapted trees in the summer, when it is low.

Ecohydrology also concerns itself with the hydrological factors behind the spatial distribution of plants.  The optimal spacing and spatial organization of plants is at least partially determined by water availability.  In ecosystems with low soil moisture, trees are typically located further apart than they would be in well-watered areas.

== Basic equations and models ==

===Water balance at a point===
A fundamental equation in ecohydrology is the [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] at a point in the landscape.  A water balance states that the amount water entering the soil must be equal to the amount of water leaving the soil plus the change in the amount of water stored in the soil.  The water balance has four main components: [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of precipitation into the soil, [[evapotranspiration]], leakage of water into deeper portions of the soil not accessible to the plant, and [[surface runoff|runoff]] from the ground surface.  It is described by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;nZ_{r} \frac{ds(t)}{dt}=R(t) - I(t) - Q[s(t),t]- E[s(t)] - L[s(t)] &lt;/math&gt;

The terms on the left hand side of the equation describe the total amount of water contained in the rooting zone.  This water, accessible to vegetation, has a volume equal to the porosity of the soil (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) multiplied by its [[water content|saturation]] (&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;) and the depth of the plant's roots (&lt;math&gt;Z_{r}&lt;/math&gt;).  The [[differential equation]] &lt;math&gt;ds(t)/dt&lt;/math&gt; describes how the soil saturation changes over time.  The terms on the right hand side describe the rates of rainfall (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;), interception (&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;), runoff (&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;), evapotranspiration (&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;), and leakage (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;).  These are typically given in millimeters per day (mm/d).  Runoff, evaporation, and leakage are all highly dependent on the soil saturation at a given time.

In order to solve the equation, the rate of evapotranspiration as a function of soil moisture must be known.  The model generally used to describe it states that above a certain saturation, evaporation will only be dependent on climate factors such as available sunlight.  Once below this point, [[soil moisture]] imposes controls on evapotranspiration, and it decreases until the soil reaches the point where the vegetation can no longer extract any more water.  This soil level is generally referred to as the "[[permanent wilting point]]". This term is confusing because many plant species do not actually "[[wilting|wilt]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9197">'''Electrical safety''' is a system of organizational measures and technical means to prevent harmful and dangerous effects on workers from electric current, electric arc, electromagnetic field and static electricity.

== History ==
The electrical safety develops with the technical progress. In 1989  [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3075.pdf Controlling electrical hazard]&lt;/ref&gt; promulgated a much-needed regulation in the General Industry Regulations. Several standards are defined for control of hazardous energy, or lockout/tagout. In 1995 OSHA was successful in promulgation of regulations for utility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://brainfiller.com/2009/07/28/how-did-we-get-here-the-history-of-electrical-safety/ Brainfilter.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1994 were established '''Electrical Safety Foundation International''' non-profit organization dedicated exclusively to promoting electrical safety at home and in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esfi.org/about-us ESFI]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Standard 29 CFR 1910.269 - for electric power generation, transmission, and distribution, contained comprehensive regulations and addressed control of hazardous energy sources for power plant locations
Standards are compared with those of [[IEEE]] and [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]]([[National Fire Protection Association]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2013/01-arc-flash-history/ The history of electrical safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lightning and Earthing protection ==
Lightning and Earthing protection systems are essential for the protection of [[human]]s, [[structure]]s,protecting [[building]]s from mechanical destruction caused by lightning effects and the associated risk of fire, [[Transmission line]]s, and electrical equipment from electric shock and [[Overcurrent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electrical-knowhow.com/2014/01/types-of-lightning-protection-systems.html http://www.electrical-knowhow.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological Effects of Electricity ==
Electrical shocks on humans can lead to permanent disabilities or death. Size, frequency and duration of the electrical current affect the damage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-3/physiological-effects-electricity/ Physiological Effects of Electricity]&lt;/ref&gt; The effects from electric shock can be: stopping the heart beating properly, preventing the person from breathing, causing muscle spasms. The skin features also affect the consequences of electric shock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/electricity/injuries.htm Electrical injuries]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">'''Environment statistics''' is the application of [[statistics|statistical methods]] to [[environmental science]]. It covers procedures for dealing with questions concerning both the natural environment in its undisturbed state and the interaction of humanity with the environment. Thus weather, climate, air and water quality are included, as are studies of plant and animal populations.

The [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/FDES/FDES-2015-supporting-tools/FDES.pdf United Nations Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics (FDES)] defines the scope of environment statistics as follows:
The scope of environment statistics covers biophysical aspects of the environment and those aspects of the socio-economic system that directly influence and interact with the environment.
The scope of environment, social and economic statistics overlap. It is not easy – or necessary – to draw a clear line dividing these areas. Social and economic statistics that describe processes or activities with a direct impact on, or direct interaction with, the environment are used widely in environment statistics. They are within the scope of the FDES.

Sources of data for environmental statistics are varied and include: surveys related to human populations and the environment, records from agencies managing environmental resources, maps and images, equipment used to examine the environment, and research studies around the world.  A primary component of the data is direct observation, although most environmental statistics use a variety of sources.&lt;ref name="Manly"/&gt;

Environmental statistics covers a number of types of study:&lt;ref name="Manly"/&gt;
*Baseline studies to document the present state of an environment to provide background in case of unknown changes in the future;
*Targeted studies to describe the likely impact of changes being planned or of accidental occurrences; 
*Regular monitoring to attempt to detect changes in the environment.

      <comment>Suggestions for simplification, avoiding redundancy. Expertization is often done by individual experts, not just committees. Future tense isn't necessary when describing procedures. An "other mark" isn't really an alternative to a "mark". Cheers!</comment>

'''Expertization''' is the process of [[authentication]] of an object, usually of a sort that is [[collecting|collected]], by an individual [[expert|authority]] or a committee of authorities. The expert, or expert committee, examines the collectible and issues a certificate typically including:

* A statement of:
** Whether or not the item is authentic
** Identification of any damage to the item
** Identification of any repairs to the item
** Identification of any forgery or faked parts of the item
* A photo of the item

Some experts apply a mark or signature to the item attesting its genuineness.

Expertization is particularly common with valuable [[philatelic]] items, some of which are so often forged that they may be unsaleable without it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16471">A '''fusion gene''' is a hybrid gene formed from two previously separate genes. It can occur as a result of: [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]], [[Deletion (genetics)|interstitial deletion]], or [[chromosomal inversion]].

[[File:Gene Fusion Types.png|thumb|A schematic showing the ways a fusion gene can occur at a chromosomal level.]]

==History==
The first fusion gene&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |first2=B |first3=F}}&lt;/ref&gt; was described in cancer cells in the early 1980s. The finding was based on the discovery in 1960 by Peter Nowell and David Hungerford in Philadelphia of a small abnormal marker [[chromosome]] in patients with [[chronic myeloid leukemia]]—the first consistent chromosome abnormality detected in a human malignancy, later designated the [[Philadelphia chromosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=PC |last1=Nowell |first2=DA |last2=Hungerford |year=1960 |title=A minute chromosome in chronic granulocytic leukemia |journal=Science | doi = 10.1126/science.132.3438.1488 |pmid=17739576 | volume=132 | issue=3438 | pages=1488–1501 [1497] | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1985/A1985ABM0800002.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode=  1960Sci...132.1488.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, [[Janet Rowley]] in Chicago showed that the Philadelphia chromosome had originated through a translocation between chromosomes [[Chromosome 9 (human)|9]] and [[chromosome 22 (human)|22]], and not through a simple deletion of chromosome 22 as was previously thought. Several investigators in the early 1980s showed that the Philadelphia [[chromosome translocation]] led to the formation of a new BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, composed of the 3' part of the ABL1 gene in the breakpoint on chromosome 9 and the 5' part of a gene called BCR in the breakpoint in chromosome 22. In 1985 it was clearly established that the fusion gene on chromosome 22 produced an abnormal [[Fusion protein|chimeric]] BCR/ABL1 protein with the capacity to induce chronic myeloid leukemia.

At present, scientists have identified 21,404 gene fusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mitelman F|author2=Johansson B|author3=Mertens F|title=Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer|url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These genes have been found in practically all main subtypes of human neoplasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |first2=B |first3=F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of these fusion genes play a prominent role in being a diagnostic and prognostic marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John|last1=Prensner |first2=Arul |last2=Chinnaiya |year=2009 |title= Oncogenic gene fusions in epithelial carcinomas |journal= Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2008.11.008 |pmid=19233641 | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=82–91 | pmc=2676581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oncogenes==
It has been known for 30 years that the corresponding gene fusion plays an important role in tumorgenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Edwards  |year=2009 |title= Fusion genes and chromosome translocations in the common epithelial cancers |journal= Journal of Pathology | doi =10.1002/path.2632 |pmid=19921709  | volume=220  |issue=2  | pages=244–254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fusion genes can contribute to tumor formation because fusion genes can produce much more active abnormal protein than non-fusion genes. Often, fusion genes are [[oncogene]]s that cause [[cancer]]; these include [[Philadelphia chromosome|BCR-ABL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=PC |last1=Nowell |first2=DA |last2=Hungerford |year=1960 |title=A minute chromosome in chronic granulocytic leukemia |journal=Science | doi = 10.1126/science.132.3438.1488 |pmid=17739576 | volume=132 | issue=3438 | pages=1488–1501 [1497] | url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1985/A1985ABM0800002.pdf | format=PDF|bibcode=  1960Sci...132.1488.}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEL-AML1 ([[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia|ALL]] with t(12 ; 21)), AML1-ETO ([[M2 AML]] with t(8 ; 21)), and [[TMPRSS2]]-[[ERG (gene)|ERG]] with an interstitial deletion on [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome&amp;nbsp;21]], often occurring in prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16254181 |year=2005 |last1=Tomlins |first1=SA |last2=Rhodes |last3=Perner |last4=Dhanasekaran |last5=Mehra |last6=Sun |last7=Varambally |last8=Cao |last9=Tchinda |title=Recurrent fusion of TMPRSS2 and ETS transcription factor genes in prostate cancer |volume=310 |issue=5748 |pages=644–8 |doi=10.1126/science.1117679 |journal=Science |first2=DR |first3=S |first4=SM |first5=R |first6=XW |first7=S |first8=X |first9=J|last10=Kuefer |first10=R |last11=Lee |first11=C |last12=Montie |first12=J. E. |last13=Shah |first13=R. B. |last14=Pienta |first14=K. J. |last15=Rubin |first15=M. A. |last16=Chinnaiyan |first16=A. M. |display-authors=8 |bibcode=2005Sci...310..644T }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the case of TMPRSS2-ERG, by disrupting androgen receptor (AR) signaling and inhibiting AR expression by oncogenic ETS transcription factor, the fusion product regulates the prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Jindan |last1= Yu | first2=Jianjun |last2= Yu|year=2010|title= An Integrated Network of Androgen Receptor, Polycomb, and TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer Progression Cancer Cell |journal= Cancer Cell| doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.03.018 | volume=17 | issue=5| pages=443–454| pmid=20478527 | pmc=2874722}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most fusion genes are found from [[Hematological malignancy|hematological cancer]]s, [[sarcoma]]s, and [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17361217 |year=2007 |last1=Mitelman |first1=F |last2=Johansson |last3=Mertens |title=The impact of translocations and gene fusions on cancer causation |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=233–45 |doi=10.1038/nrc2091 |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer |first2=B |first3=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17425505 |year=2006 |last1=Teixeira |first1=MR |title=Recurrent fusion oncogenes in carcinomas |volume=12 |issue=3–4 |pages=257–71 |journal=Critical Reviews in Oncogenesis |doi=10.1615/critrevoncog.v12.i3-4.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[BCAM-AKT2]] is a fusion gene that is specific and unique to high-grade [[serous ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/deciphering-the-cancer-transcriptome/5729/ Deciphering the Cancer Transcriptome. 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oncogenic fusion genes may lead to a gene product with a new or different function from the two fusion partners. Alternatively, a proto-oncogene is fused to a strong [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]], and thereby the oncogenic function is set to function by an [[Downregulation and upregulation|upregulation]] caused by the strong promoter of the upstream fusion partner. The latter is common in [[lymphoma]]s, where oncogenes are juxtaposed to the promoters of the [[immunoglobulin]] genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12946230 |year=2003 |last1=Vega |first1=F |last2=Medeiros |title=Chromosomal translocations involved in non-Hodgkin lymphomas |volume=127 |issue=9 |pages=1148–60 |journal=Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine |first2=LJ |doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2003)127&lt;1148:CTIINL&gt;2.0.CO;2|doi-broken-date=2018-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oncogenic [[fusion transcript]]s may also be caused by [[trans-splicing]] or [[Conjoined gene|read-through]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21261984 |year=2011 |last1=Nacu |first1=S |last2=Yuan |last3=Kan |last4=Bhatt |last5=Rivers |last6=Stinson |last7=Peters |last8=Modrusan |last9=Jung |title=Deep RNA sequencing analysis of readthrough gene fusions in human prostate adenocarcinoma and reference samples |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=11 |journal=BMC Med. Genom.|first2=W |first3=Z |first4=D |first5=CS |first6=J |first7=BA |first8=Z |first9=K |last10=Seshagiri |first10=Somasekar |last11=Wu |first11=Thomas D |doi=10.1186/1755-8794-4-11 |pmc=3041646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since chromosomal translocations play such a significant role in neoplasia, a specialized database of chromosomal aberrations and gene fusions in cancer has been created.  This database is called Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mitelman F|author2=Johansson B|author3=Mertens F|title=Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer|url=http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostics==
Presence of certain chromosomal aberrations and their resulting fusion genes is commonly used within cancer diagnostics in order to set a precise diagnosis. Chromosome [[Cytogenetics|banding analysis]], [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|fluorescence ''in situ'' hybridization]] (FISH), and [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR) are common methods employed at diagnostic laboratories. These methods all have their distinct shortcomings due to the very complex nature of cancer [[genome]]s. Recent developments such as [[DNA sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19136943 |year=2009 |last1=Maher |first1=CA |last2=Kumar-Sinha |last3=Cao |last4=Kalyana-Sundaram |last5=Han |last6=Jing |last7=Sam |last8=Barrette |last9=Palanisamy |title=Transcriptome Sequencing to Detect Gene Fusions in Cancer |volume=458 |issue=7234 |pages=97–101 |doi=10.1038/nature07638 |journal=Nature |first2=C |first3=X |first4=S |first5=B |first6=X |first7=L |first8=T |first9=N |last10=Chinnaiyan |first10=Arul M. |pmc=2725402|display-authors=8 |bibcode=2009Natur.458...97M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and custom [[DNA microarray]]s bear promise of introduction of more efficient methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19152679 |year=2009 |last1=Skotheim |first1=RI |last2=Thomassen |last3=Eken |last4=Lind |last5=Micci |last6=Ribeiro |last7=Cerveira |last8=Teixeira |last9=Heim |title=A universal assay for detection of oncogenic fusion transcripts by oligo microarray analysis |volume=8 |pages=5 |doi=10.1186/1476-4598-8-5 |journal=Molecular Cancer |first2=GO |first3=M |first4=GE |first5=F |first6=FR |first7=N |first8=MR |first9=S |last10=Rognes |first10=Torbjørn |last11=Lothe |first11=Ragnhild A |pmc=2633275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Gene fusion plays a key role in the evolution of gene architecture. We can observe its effect if gene fusion occurs in coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Pascal |last1= Durrens  | first2= Macha |last3= Sherman  |first3= David  |last2= Nikolski |year=2008|title= Fusion and Fission of Genes Define a Metric between Fungal Genomes |journal= PLoS Comput Biol| volume=4 | issue=10| pages=443–454|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000200|pmid= 18949021  |pmc= 2557144  |bibcode= 2008PLSCB...4E0200D  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duplication, sequence divergence, and recombination are the major contributors at work in gene evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Eichler |last1= EE |year=2001|title= Recent duplication, domain accretion and the dynamic mutation of the human genome |journal= Trends in Genetics |volume=17| issue=11| pages=661–669|doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(01)02492-1 |pmid= 11672867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events can probably produce new genes from already existing parts. When gene fusion happens in non-coding sequence region, it can lead to the misregulation of the expression of a gene now under the control of the [[cis-regulatory element|cis-regulatory]] sequence of another gene. If it happens in coding sequences, gene fusion cause the assembly of a new gene, then it allows the appearance of new functions by adding peptide modules into multi domain protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Pascal |last1= Durrens  | first2= Macha |last3= Sherman  |first3= David  |last2= Nikolski |year=2008|title= Fusion and Fission of Genes Define a Metric between Fungal Genomes |journal= PLoS Comput Biol| volume=4 | issue=10| pages=443–454|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000200|pmid= 18949021  |pmc= 2557144  |bibcode= 2008PLSCB...4E0200D  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The detecting methods to inventory gene fusion events on a large biological scale can provide insights about the multi modular architecture of proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Enright |last1= AJ | first2= Ouzounis |last2= CA |year=2001|title= Functional associations of proteins in entire genomes by means of exhaustive detection of gene fusions |journal= Genome Biology | volume=2| issue=9| pages=341–347|pmid=11820254|doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-9-research0034 | pmc=65099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Yanai |last1= I | first2= DeLisi |last3= Delisi |first3= C. |last2= C |year=2001|title= Genes linked by fusion events are generally of the same functional category: a systematic analysis of 30 microbial genomes |journal= Proc.

==Detection==
In recent years, next generation sequencing technology has already become available to screen known and novel gene fusion events on a genome wide scale. However, the precondition for large scale detection is a paired-end sequencing of the cell's [[transcriptome]]. The direction of fusion gene detection is mainly towards data analysis and visualization. Some researchers already developed a new tool called Transcriptome Viewer (TViewer) to directly visualize detected gene fusions on the transcript level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Jochen |last1= Supper | first2=Claudia |last2= Gugenmus |year=2013 |title= Detecting and visualizing gene fusions. Methods |journal= Methods| doi =10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.09.013 |pmid= 23036331 | volume=59 | issue=1| pages=24–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research applications==
Biologists may also deliberately create fusion genes for research purposes. The fusion of [[reporter gene]]s to the regulatory elements of genes of interest allows researches to study gene expression. Reporter gene fusions can be used to measure activity levels of gene regulators, identify the regulatory sites of genes (including the signals required), identify various genes that are regulated in response to the same stimulus, and artificially control the expression of desired genes in particular cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al.]|first1=Leland H. Hartwell ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1705">The '''highly accelerated stress test''' (HAST) method was first proposed by Jeffrey E. Gunn, Sushil K. Malik, and Purabi M. Mazumdar of IBM. 

The acceleration factor for elevated humidity is empirically derived to be

:&lt;math&gt;AF_\text{H} = e^{\text{const} \cdot (RH_\text{s}^n - RH_\text{o}^n)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''RH''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the stressed humidity, ''RH''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the operating-environment humidity, and ''n'' is an empirically derived constant (usually 1 &lt; ''n'' &lt; 5).

The acceleration factor for elevated temperature is derived to be

:&lt;math&gt;AF_T = e^{(E_\text{a}/k)(1/T_\text{o} - 1/T_\text{s})},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the activation energy for the temperature-induced failure (most often 0.7&amp;nbsp;eV for electronics), ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[operating temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the stressed temperature.

Therefore the total acceleration factor for unbiased HAST testing is

:&lt;math&gt;AF_\text{HAST} = AF_\text{H} \cdot AF_T =
 e^{\text{const} \cdot (RH_\text{s}^n - RH_\text{o}^n)}
 e^{(E_\text{a}/k)(1/T_\text{o} - 1/T_\text{s})}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Liturgics''' is the [[academic discipline]] dedicated to the study of [[liturgy]] (public worship rites, rituals, and practices). Liturgics scholars typically specialize in a single approach drawn from another scholarly field.  The most common sub-disciplines are: [[history]] or [[church history]], [[theology]], and [[anthropology]]. Although liturgics scholars using these approaches apply the principles of their respective disciplines to their research, all liturgics scholars focus their work in the [[ritual]] behaviors of the members of faith communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3199">The [[murine]] '''local lymph node assay''' (LLNA) is an ''[[in vivo]]'' test for [[skin sensitisation]].

LLNA has largely superseded the [[guinea pig maximisation test]] and the [[Buehler test]]. It is considered more scientific and less cruel (lower number of animals; less suffering) and has found broad scientific and regulatory acceptance.

The principle underlying the LLNA is that skin sensitizers induce growth of [[lymphocytes]] in the [[lymph nodes]] draining the site of application. Lymphocyte [[cell proliferation|proliferation]] can be measured by [[radiolabeling]] (quantifying tritiaded [[thymidine]]), [[bioluminescence]] (quantifying [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] content in lymphocytes) or [[immunoassay]] ([[ELISA]] utilizing an [[antibody]] specific for [[BrdU]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=Michael J. Derelanko | editor2=Carol S. Auletta | title=Handbook of Toxicology | edition=3rd | year=2014 | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-1-4398-9014-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test material is applied to the ears of mice. Optionally, a tracer substance such as 3H-Methyl-[[thymidine]] or [[BrdU]] is injected intraperitoneally for lymphocyte incorporation. The animals are euthanized and their lymph node cells are removed and analyzed. The ratio of tracer incorporation in lymph nodes from dosed animals is compared to control animals, giving a stimulation index (SI). When the stimulation index exceeds 3 (SI &gt; 3), a relevant sensitizing potential is assumed. In contrast to the classical guinea pig tests, the LLNA provides a quantitative measurement of sensitizing potency of a tested chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution=Hair Preparations | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_571.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LLNA may not be appropriate for certain metallic compounds, surfactants, high-molecular-weight proteins, strong dermal irritants, and materials that do not sufficiently adhere to the ear for an acceptable period of time during treatment. There is no absolute conformity in the sensitizing potential of a substance in mouse, guinea pig and human.

== Regulatory ==
The [[OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals]] guideline No. 429 of 23 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-429-skin-sensitisation_9789264071100-en&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[REACH Regulation]], Annex VII, paragraph 8.3 states "The Murine Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) is the first-choice method for ''in vivo'' testing. Only in exceptional circumstances should another test be used. Justification for the use of another test shall be provided."

According to European Guideline OECD 406 Skin Sensitization, the LLNA or the MEST ([[Mouse ear swelling test]]) can be used as a first stage in the assessment of skin sensitization potential. If a positive result is seen in either assay, a test substance may be designated as a potential sensitizer, and it may not be necessary to conduct a further guinea pig test. However, if a negative result is seen in the LLNA or MEST, a guinea pig test (preferably a GPMT or BT) must be conducted.

The '''Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut zur Erforschung multireligiöser und multiethnischer Gesellschaften'') is located in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]]. It is one of 83 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft'').

==History==
The MPI for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity is the successor of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for German History]] previously established in 1917 in [[Berlin]]. Founded in 1956 as the [[Max Planck Institute for History]], the institute  was renamed to its current form based on the decision of the Senate of the [[Max Planck Society]] in March 2007.

==Research==
The Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity is one of the foremost centers for the multi-disciplinary study of diversity, in its multiple forms, in today’s globalizing world. As societies across the globe become ever more diverse, pressing new challenges emerge to the fore, motivating the study of questions such as the relationship between mobility and inequality; the interaction of globalization, religious diversity, and the secular state; the legal boundaries of cultural accommodation; global cities and super-diversity within them; new forms of membership and belonging; and the trans-bordering networking of ethnic and religious minorities. These thematic clusters provide a glimpse into the foundational queries that animate the rigorous scholarly investigation pursued by researchers at the Institute through a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including, but not limited to, anthropology, sociology, political science, and law.

==Departments==

===Ethics, Law and Politics===
The department, led by Ayelet Shachar, focuses on questions of citizenship, identity, and mobility are at the frontiers of scholarly research. Researchers at the department explore these developments and ask foundational questions, cutting across traditional disciplinary lines, with special emphasis placed on three interrelated themes: the relationship between diversity and equality in public law and private dispute resolution; the legal construction of borders and membership boundaries; and the intersection of states and markets in defining “who belongs“ within the political community, according to what criteria, and with what implications for shaping new disparities of mobility and opportunity at a time of profound and rapid migration and globalization pressures. The focus is on cutting-edge theoretical and legal puzzles; comparative approaches and international collaboration are strongly encouraged. 

===Religious Diversity===
The department, led by [[Peter van der Veer]], offers a research program developed within the ideographic tradition of [[anthropology]] and [[religious studies]] and thus allows for quite a variety of individual projects that try to answer questions that are not predetermined by theoretical models but developed in ethnographic or micro-sociological fieldwork. To contain this variety, a regional focus on South, South-East and East Asia has been chosen because of the importance of this region in terms of its share in the world’s population and with the assumption that comparisons can be fruitfully made across this region. This is because common civilizational histories as well as common histories of imperialism and cold war politics have transformed the religious traditions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] into "modern religions" in the Western sense. From the start, concerted efforts have been made to create collaborations with research institutions and researchers in the societies in which fieldwork projects are carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/religious-diversity/ |title=Religious diversity - Research focus |author=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-Cultural Diversity===
The department, led by Steven Vertovec, is devoted to comparative empirical investigation and theoretical development surrounding various modes and manifestations of migration-driven diversity and [[superdiversity]]. The categories of diversity most relevant to their research interests are race and ethnicity, religion, gender, class, migration channel and migration status. Moreover, they are particularly interested in the ways and processes by which patterns of migration-driven diversity are related to other modes of increasing social, cultural, economic and political differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/research-focus/ |title=Socio-cultural diversity - Research focus |author=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4271">'''Methodological individualism''' is the principle that subjective individual motivation explains social phenomena, rather than class or group dynamics which are (according to proponents of individualistic principles) illusory or artificial and therefore cannot truly explain market or social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

== In economics ==
In [[neoclassical economics]], people's behavior is explained in terms of rational choices as constrained by prices and incomes. The neoclassical economist accepts individuals' preferences as given. [[Gary Becker]] and [[George Stigler]] provide a forceful statement of this view:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|author2=Gary Becker|title=De gustibus non est disputandum|journal=American Economic Review|date=Mar 1977|volume=67|issue=2|page=76|jstor=1807222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:On the traditional view, an explanation of economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned at this point to whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? sociobiologists?). On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.

== Criticisms ==
Economist [[Mark Blaug]] has criticized over-reliance on methodological individualism in economics, saying that "it is helpful to note what methodological individualism strictly interpreted [...] would imply for economics. In effect, it would rule out all macroeconomic propositions that cannot be reduced to microeconomic ones [...] this amounts to saying goodbye to almost the whole of received macroeconomics. There must be something wrong with a methodological principle that has such devastating implications".&lt;ref name=Blaug&gt;{{cite book|last=Blaug|first=Mark|title=The Methodology of Economics: Or, How Economists Explain|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43678-8|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=July 2008}}
'''Methods engineering''' is a subspecialty of [[industrial engineering]] and [[manufacturing engineering]] concerned with human integration in industrial production processes.&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;Methods Engineering [https://archive.org/details/MethodsEngineering Reference book]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Alternatively it can be described as the design of the productive process in which a person is involved. The task of the Methods engineer is to decide where humans will be utilized in the process of converting [[raw material]]s to finished products and how workers can most effectively perform their assigned tasks.&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Work Design &amp; Measurement, IE Terminology, 2000 Revised Edition&lt;/ref&gt; The terms operation analysis, work design and simplification, and methods engineering and corporate re-engineering are frequently used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Niebel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Freivalds |first=Andris |first2=Benjamin |last2=Niebel |title=Methods, Standards, and Work Design |edition=Eleventh |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0072468246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowering costs and increasing reliability and productivity are the objectives of methods engineering. These objectives are met in a five step sequence as follows: Project selection,  data acquisition and presentation, data analysis, development of an ideal method based on the data analysis and, finally, presentation and implementation of the method.&lt;ref name="Niebel"/&gt;

== Methods engineering topics ==

=== Project selection ===
Methods engineers typically work on projects involving new product design, products with a high cost of production to profit ratio, and products associated with having poor quality issues. Different methods of project selection include the [[Pareto analysis]], fish diagrams, [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT chart]]s, and job/work site analysis guides.

=== Data acquisition and presentation ===
Data that needs to be collected are specification sheets for the product, design drawings, quantity and delivery requirements, and projections as to how the product will perform or has performed in the market. The Gantt process chart can assist in the analysis of the man to machine interaction and it can aid in establishing the optimum number of workers and machines subject to the financial constraints of the operation. A flow diagram is frequently employed to represent the manufacturing process associated with the product.

=== Data analysis ===
Data analysis enables the methods engineer to make decisions about several things, including: purpose of the operation, part design characteristics, specifications and tolerances of parts, materials, manufacturing process design, setup and tooling, working conditions, material handling, plant layout, and workplace design.&lt;ref name="Niebel"/&gt; Knowing the specifics (who, what, when, where, why, and how) of product manufacturing assists in the development of an optimum manufacturing method.

=== Ideal method development ===
Equations of synchronous and random servicing as well as line balancing are used to determine the ideal worker to machine ratio for the process or product chosen. Synchronous servicing is defined as the process where a machine is assigned to more than one operator, and the assigned operators and machine are occupied during the whole operating cycle. Random servicing of a facility, as the name indicates, is defined as a servicing process with a random time of occurrence and need of servicing variables. Line balancing equations determine the ideal number of workers needed on a production line to enable it to work at capacity.

=== Presentation and methods implementation ===
The industrial process or operation can be optimized using a variety of available methods. Each method design has its advantages and disadvantages. The best overall method is chosen using selection criteria and concepts involving [[value engineering]], [[cost-benefit analysis]], crossover charts, and economic analysis. The outcome of the selection process is then presented to the company for implementation at the plant. This last step involves "selling the idea" to the company brass, a skill the methods engineer must develop in addition to the normal engineering qualifications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15428">{{About|distributed applications|middleware in general|Middleware}}

'''Middleware''' in the context of [[distributed application]]s is [[software]] that provides services beyond those provided by the [[operating system]] to enable the various components of a distributed system to communicate and manage data. Middleware supports and simplifies complex [[distributed application]]s. It includes [[web server]]s, [[application server]]s, messaging and similar tools that support application development and delivery.  Middleware is especially integral to modern information technology based on [[XML]], [[SOAP]], [[Web service]]s, and [[service-oriented architecture]].

Middleware often enables [[interoperability]] between applications that run on different operating systems, by supplying services so the application can exchange data in a standards-based way. Middleware sits "in the middle" between [[application software]] that may be working on different [[operating system]]s. It is similar to the middle layer of a [[Multitier architecture|three-tier]] single system architecture, except that it is stretched across multiple systems or applications. Examples include [[Enterprise Application Integration|EAI]] software, telecommunications software, [[Transaction Processing System|transaction monitors]], and messaging-and-queueing software.

The distinction between operating system and middleware functionality is, to some extent, arbitrary. While core kernel functionality can only be provided by the operating system itself, some functionality previously provided by separately sold middleware is now integrated in operating systems. A typical example is the [[TCP/IP]] stack for telecommunications, nowadays included in virtually every operating system.

==Definitions==
Software that provides a link between separate software applications. Middleware is sometimes called plumbing because it connects two applications and passes data between them. Middleware allows data contained in one database to be accessed through another.  This definition would fit [[enterprise application integration]] and [[data integration]] software.

ObjectWeb defines middleware as: "The software layer that lies between the [[operating system]] and applications on each side of a distributed computing system in a network."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Sacha|last=Krakowiak|url=http://middleware.objectweb.org/|title=What's middleware?|accessdate=2005-05-06|publisher=ObjectWeb.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507151935/http://middleware.objectweb.org/|archivedate=2005-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== '''Origins''' ==
Middleware is a relatively new addition to the computing landscape. It gained popularity in the 1980s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems, although the term had been in use since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Nick|last=Gall|url=http://ironick.typepad.com/ironick/2005/07/update_on_the_o.html|title=Origin of the term ''''|date=July 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also facilitated [[distributed processing]], the connection of multiple applications to create a larger application, usually over a network.

==Use==
Middleware services provide a more functional set of [[application programming interface]]s to allow an application to:
*Locate transparently across the network, thus providing interaction with another service or application
*Filter data to make them friendly usable or public via [[Anonymization#Anonymity on the Internet|anonymization process]] for privacy protection (for example)
*Be independent from network services
*Be reliable and always available
*Add complementary attributes like [[semantics]]
when compared to the operating system and network services.

Middleware offers some unique technological advantages for business and industry.  For example, traditional database systems are usually deployed in closed environments where users access the system only via a [[restricted network]] or [[intranet]] (e.g., an enterprise’s internal network). With the phenomenal growth of the [[World Wide Web]], users can access virtually any database for which they have proper access rights from anywhere in the world.  Middleware addresses the problem of varying levels of [[interoperability]] among different database structures.  Middleware facilitates transparent access to legacy [[database management system]]s (DBMSs) or applications via a [[web server]] without regard to database-specific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Peng, C, Chen, S, Chung, J, Roy-Chowdhury, A, and Srinivasan, V. (1998). Accessing
existing business data from the World Wide Web. IBM Systems Journal, 37(1), 115-132.
Retrieved March 7, 2009, from ABI/INFORM Global database. (Document ID: 26217517)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses frequently use middleware applications to link information from departmental databases, such as payroll, sales, and accounting, or databases housed in multiple geographic locations.&lt;ref&gt;Bougettaya, A, Malik, Z,  Rezgui, A,  and Korff, L. (2006). A Scalable Middleware for Web
Databases. Journal of Database Management, 17(4), 20-39,41-46.  Retrieved March 7,
2009, from ABI/INFORM Global database. (Document ID: 1155773301).
&lt;/ref&gt;  In the highly competitive healthcare community, laboratories make extensive use of middleware applications for [[data mining]], [[laboratory information system]] (LIS) backup, and to combine systems during hospital mergers.  Middleware helps bridge the gap between separate LISs in a newly formed healthcare network following a hospital buyout.&lt;ref&gt;Bagwell, H. (2008). [http://www.devicelink.com/ivdt/archive/08/07/007.html Middleware: providing value beyond autoverification]. IVDT. Retrieved
March 3, 2009.

Middleware can help software developers avoid having to write [[application programming interface]]s (API) for every control program, by serving as an independent programming interface for their applications.
For [[Future Internet]] network operation through traffic monitoring in [[Network management|multi-domain scenarios]], using mediator tools (middleware) is a powerful help since they allow [[Telecommunications service provider|operators]], searchers and [[service providers]] to supervise [[Quality of service]] and analyse eventual failures in  [[telecommunication service]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Kai Oswald Seidler |url=http://www.fp7-moment.eu/ |title=MOMENT |publisher=Fp7-moment.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, e-commerce uses middleware to assist in handling rapid and secure transactions over many different types of computer environments.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, J. (1999). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx5/2/16523/00762786.pdf Middleware moves to the forefront]{{subscription}}. Technology News. Retrieved March 2,
2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, middleware has become a critical element across a broad range of industries, thanks to its ability to bring together resources across dissimilar networks or computing platforms.

In 2004 members of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) carried out a study of Middleware with respect to system integration in broadcast environments. This involved system design engineering experts from 10 major European broadcasters working over a 12-month period to understand the effect of predominantly software-based products to media production and broadcasting system design techniques. The resulting reports Tech 3300 and Tech 3300s were published and are freely available from the EBU web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3300.pdf |title=EBU middleware report Tech 3300 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3300s.pdf |title=EBU middleware reports Tech 3300s |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Message-oriented middleware===
[[Message-oriented middleware]] (MOM) &lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2004. [http://www.mendeley.com/download/public/1652511/4338215212/cce0f06f047faa57879a1fc36a8e8d6d754d2f6a/dl.pdf "Message-Oriented Middleware"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. In Middleware for Communications, ed. Qusay H Mahmoud, 1-28. Chichester, England: John Wiley and Sons. {{doi|10.1002/0470862084.ch1}}. {{ISBN|978-0-470-86206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is middleware where transactions or event notifications are delivered between disparate systems or components by way of messages, often via an [[enterprise messaging system]].  With MOM, messages sent to the client are collected and stored until they are acted upon, while the client continues with other processing.

; Enterprise messaging
: An [[enterprise messaging system]] is a type of middleware that facilitates message passing between disparate systems or components in standard formats, often using [[XML]], [[SOAP]] or [[web services]].  As part of an enterprise messaging system, [[message broker]] software may queue, duplicate, translate and deliver messages to disparate systems or components in a messaging system.

; Enterprise service bus
: [[Enterprise service bus]] (ESB) is defined by the [[Burton Group]] &lt;ref name="ms-on-esb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa475433(BTS.10).aspx|title=Microsoft on the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)|date=August 2005|quote=The ESB label simply implies that a product is some type of integration middleware product that supports both MOM and Web services protocols.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "some type of integration middleware product that supports both [[message-oriented middleware]] and [[Web services]]".

===Intelligent middleware===
&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cougaarsoftware.com/files/CSI_ActiveEdge.pdf Choosing the Right Middleware] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402121113/http://www.cougaarsoftware.com/files/CSI_ActiveEdge.pdf |date=2012-04-02 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;
Intelligent [[Middleware]] (IMW) provides [[real-time intelligence]] and event management through [[intelligent agents]]. The IMW manages the [[real-time processing]] of high volume sensor signals and turns these signals into intelligent and actionable business information. The actionable information is then delivered in end-user power dashboards to individual users or is pushed to systems within or outside the enterprise. It is able to support various heterogeneous types of hardware and software and provides an API for interfacing with external systems. It should have a highly scalable, [[distributed architecture]] which embeds intelligence throughout the network to transform raw data systematically into actionable and relevant knowledge. It can also be packaged with tools to view and manage operations and build advanced network applications most effectively.

==={{Anchor|EMBEDDED}}Content-centric middleware===
Content-centric middleware offers a simple ''provider-consumer'' abstraction through which applications can issue requests for uniquely identified content, without worrying about where or how it is obtained. Juno is one example, which allows applications to generate content requests associated with high-level delivery requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/tysong/files/PhD.pdf Juno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426045143/http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/tysong/files/PhD.pdf |date=2011-04-26 }}, Gareth Tyson, A Middleware Approach to Building Content-Centric Applications. PhD Thesis, Lancaster University (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The middleware then adapts the underlying delivery to access the content from sources that are best suited to matching the requirements. This is therefore similar to [[Publish/subscribe]] middleware, as well as the [[Content-centric networking]] paradigm.

; Remote procedure cal
: [[Remote procedure call]] middleware enables a client to use services running on remote systems.  The process can be [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]] or  [[Asynchrony (computer programming)|asynchronous]].
; Object request broker
: With [[object request broker]] middleware, it is possible for applications to send objects and request services in an object-oriented system.
; SQL-oriented data access
: [[:Category:SQL data access|SQL-oriented Data Access]] is middleware between applications and database servers.
; Embedded middleware
: Embedded middleware provides communication services and software/[[firmware]] integration interface that operates between embedded applications, the embedded operating system, and external applications.

==Vendors==
[[IBM]], [[Red Hat]], [[Oracle Corporation]] and [[Microsoft]] are some of the vendors that provide middleware software. Vendors such as [[Axway]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[TIBCO]], [[Informatica]], [[Objective Interface Systems]], [[Pervasive Software|Pervasive]], ScaleOut Software and [[webMethods]] were specifically founded to provide more niche middleware solutions.  Groups such as the [[Apache Software Foundation]], [[Opensaf|OpenSAF]], the [[ObjectWeb|ObjectWeb Consortium]] (now OW2) and OASIS' [[AMQP]] encourage the development of [[Open-source software|open source]] middleware.  Microsoft .NET "Framework" architecture is essentially "Middleware" with typical middleware functions distributed between the various products, with most inter-computer interaction by industry standards, open APIs or RAND software licence. [[Solace Corporation|Solace]] provides middleware in purpose-built hardware for implementations that may experience scale. [[StormMQ]] provides [[Message Oriented Middleware]] as a service.

'''Moment redistribution''' refers to the behavior of [[statically indeterminate]] structures that are not completely [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]], but have some reserve [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] capacity.  When one location first [[yield (engineering)|yields]], further application of load to the structure causes the [[bending moment]] to redistribute differently from what a purely elastic analysis would suggest.

When the load is applied to a beam, the beam has the property to resist it. When the beam is indeterminate, it forms sufficient number of hinges to make itself determinate. Hence in this process, few hinges are formed earlier and the rest are formed afterwards. Further increment in load does not increase the moment at the points where the plastic hinges are formed. The increased load increases the moment in the less stressed sections of the beam; hence due to this, further plastic hinges are formed. This  process of shift of application of moment in the beam is termed as moment redistribution in a beam.&lt;ref&gt;http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105105104/pdf/m15l38.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic fungi can be classified using three groups:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Lower fungi''' - adapted to marine habitats ([[Zoospore|zoosporic]] fungi, including mastigomycetes: [[oomycete]]s &amp; [[chytridiomycetes]])
* '''Higher fungi''' -filamentous, modified to planktonic lifestyle ([[hyphomycetes]], [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]], [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycetes]])
* '''Terrestrial fungi''' - contain appendages of marine fungi ([[trichomycetes]])
The majority of mycoplankton species are higher fungi, found in the [[Ascomycota]] and [[Basidiomycota]] phylums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to fossil records, fungi date back to the late [[Proterozoic]] era, 900-570 million years ago. It is hypothesized that mycoplankton evolved from terrestrial fungi, likely in the [[Paleozoic]] era (390 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marine Fungi: and Fungal-like Organisms|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RcF97cHppPsC|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 2012-08-31|isbn = 9783110264067|first = E.

'''Neutrino astronomy''' is the branch of astronomy that observes astronomical objects with [[neutrino detector]]s in special observatories. Neutrinos are created as a result of certain types of [[radioactive decay]], or [[nuclear reaction]]s such as those that take place in the [[Sun]], in [[nuclear reactor]]s, or when [[cosmic ray]]s hit atoms. Due to their weak interactions with matter, neutrinos offer a unique opportunity to observe processes that are inaccessible to [[telescope|optical telescope]]s.

==History==
[[Neutrino]]s were first recorded in 1956 by [[Clyde Cowan]] and [[Frederick Reines]] in [[Cowan-Reines neutrino experiment|an experiment]] employing a nearby nuclear reactor as a neutrino source.&lt;ref&gt;

This was followed by the first atmospheric neutrino detection in 1965 by two groups almost simultaneously. One was led by [[Frederick Reines]] who operated a liquid scintillator - the Case-Witwatersrand-Irvine or CWI detector - in the East Rand gold mine in South Africa at an 8.8&amp;nbsp;km water depth equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;

The first generation of undersea neutrino telescope projects began with the proposal by [[Moisey Markov]] in 1960 "...to install detectors deep in a lake or a sea and to determine the location of charged particles with the help of [[Cherenkov radiation]]."&lt;ref name="arxiv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The first underwater neutrino telescope began as the [[DUMAND]] project. DUMAND stands for Deep Underwater Muon and Neutrino Detector. The project began in 1976 and although it was eventually cancelled in 1995, it acted as a precursor to many of the following telescopes in the following decades.&lt;ref name="arxiv" /&gt;

The [[Baikal neutrino telescope|Baikal Neutrino Telescope]] is installed in the southern part of Lake Baikal in Russia. The detector is located at a depth of 1.1&amp;nbsp;km and began surveys in 1980. In 1993, it was the first to deploy three strings to reconstruct the muon trajectories as well as the first to record atmospheric neutrinos underwater.&lt;ref name="arxiv_a"&gt;

[[Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array|AMANDA]] (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array) used the 3&amp;nbsp;km thick ice layer at the South Pole and was located several hundred meters from the [[Amundsen-Scott station]]. Holes 60&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter were drilled with pressurized hot water in which strings with optical modules were deployed before the water refroze. The depth proved to be insufficient to be able to reconstruct the trajectory due to the scattering of light on air bubbles. A second group of 4 strings were added in 1995/96 to a depth of about 2000 m that was sufficient for track reconstruction. The AMANDA array was subsequently upgraded until January 2000 when it consisted of 19 strings with a total of 667 optical modules at a depth range between 1500 m and 2000 m. AMANDA would eventually be the predecessor to [[IceCube]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="arxiv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arxiv_a" /&gt;

===21st century===
After the decline of DUMAND the participating groups split into three branches to explore deep sea options in the Mediterranean Sea. [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] was anchored to the sea floor in the region off Toulon at the French Mediterranean coast. It consists of 12 strings, each carrying 25 "storeys" equipped with three optical modules, an electronic container, and calibration devices down to a maximum depth of 2475 m.&lt;ref name="arxiv_a" /&gt;

[[Neutrino Mediterranean Observatory|NEMO]] (NEutrino Mediterranean Observatory) was pursued by Italian groups to investigate the feasibility of a cubic-kilometer scale deep-sea detector. A suitable site at a depth of 3.5&amp;nbsp;km about 100&amp;nbsp;km off Capo Passero at the South-Eastern coast of Sicily has been identified. From 2007-2011 the first prototyping phase tested a "mini-tower" with 4 bars deployed for several weeks near Catania at a depth of 2&amp;nbsp;km. The second phase as well as plans to deploy the full-size prototype tower will be pursued in the KM3NeT framework.&lt;ref name="arxiv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arxiv_a" /&gt;

The [[NESTOR Project]] was installed in 2004 to a depth of 4&amp;nbsp;km and operated for one month until a failure of the cable to shore forced it to be terminated. The data taken still successfully demonstrated the detector's functionality and provided a measurement of the atmospheric muon flux. The proof of concept will be implemented in the KM3Net framework.&lt;ref name="arxiv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arxiv_a" /&gt;

The second generation of deep-sea neutrino telescope projects reach or even exceed the size originally conceived by the DUMAND pioneers. [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|IceCube]], located at the South Pole and incorporating its predecessor AMANDA, was completed in December 2010. It currently consists of 5160 digital optical modules installed on 86 strings at depths of 1450 to 2550 m in the Antarctic ice. The [[KM3NeT]] in the Mediterranean Sea and the [[Gigaton Volume Detector|GVD]] are in their preparatory/prototyping phase. IceCube instruments 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of ice. GVD is also planned to cover 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; but at a much higher energy threshold. KM3NeT is planned to cover several km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Both KM3NeT and GVD could be completed by 2017 and it is expected that all three will form a global neutrino observatory.&lt;ref name="arxiv_a" /&gt;

In July 2018, the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] announced that they have traced an extremely-high-energy [[neutrino]] that hit their Antarctica-based research station in September 2017 back to its point of origin in the [[blazar]] [[TXS 0506+056]] located 3.7 billion [[light-year|light-years]] away in the direction of the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. This is the first time that a [[neutrino detector]] has been used to locate an object in space and that a source of [[cosmic rays]] has been identified.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180712"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=It Came From a Black Hole, and Landed in Antarctica - For the first time, astronomers followed cosmic neutrinos into the fire-spitting heart of a supermassive blazar. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/science/space-neutrinos-blazar.html |date=12 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=13 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neutrino that struck Antarctica traced to galaxy 3.7bn light years away |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/12/neutrino-that-struck-antarctica-traced-to-galaxy-37bn-light-years-away |website=The Guardian |date=12 July 2018 |accessdate=12 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Source of cosmic 'ghost' particle revealed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44786125y |website=BBC |date=12 July 2018 |accessdate=12 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection methods==
{{Main|Neutrino detector}}
Since neutrinos interact only very rarely with matter, the enormous flux of [[solar neutrino]]s racing through the Earth is sufficient to produce only 1 interaction for 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; target atoms, and each interaction produces only a few photons or one transmuted atom. The observation of neutrino interactions requires a large detector mass, along with a sensitive amplification system.

Given the very weak signal, sources of background noise must be reduced as much as possible. The detectors must be shielded by a large shield mass, and so are constructed deep underground, or underwater. They record upward going muons in charged current muon neutrino interactions. Upward because no other known particle can traverse the entire Earth. The detector must be at least 1&amp;nbsp;km deep to suppress downward traveling muons, and are subject to an irreducible background of extraterrestric neutrinos interacting in the Earth's atmosphere. This background also provides a standard calibration source. Sources of radioactive isotopes must also be controlled as they produce energetic particles when they decay. The detectors consist of an array of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) housed in transparent pressure spheres which are suspended in a large volume of water or ice. The PMTs record the arrival time and amplitude of the [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by muons or particle cascades. The trajectory can then usually be reconstructed by triangulation if at least three "strings" are used to detect the events.

==Applications==
When astronomical bodies, such as the [[Sun]], are studied using light, only the surface of the object can be directly observed. Any light produced in the core of a star will interact with gas particles in the outer layers of the star, taking hundreds of thousands of years to make it to the surface, making it impossible to observe the core directly. Since neutrinos are also created in the cores of stars (as a result of [[stellar fusion]]), the core can be observed using neutrino astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jonathan H.|date=2016-11-15|title=Projections for Measuring the Size of the Solar Core with Neutrino-Electron Scattering|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.211101|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=117|issue=21|pages=211101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.211101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of neutrinos- such as neutrinos released by supernovae- have been detected.
There are currently goals to detect neutrinos from other sources, such as [[Active galactic nucleus|Active Galactic Nuclei]] (AGN), as well as [[Gamma-ray burst]]s and [[Starburst galaxy|Starburst galaxies]]. Neutrino astronomy may also indirectly detect dark matter.

Starting in 1963, then known as Openlands Project, '''Openlands''' is a [[non-profit]] that works with groups and individuals in northeastern [[Illinois]] to preserve open space, develop walking and biking trails, restore natural areas, and connect people to the outdoors.  It is a member of [[Chicago Wilderness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Wilderness members|url=http://www.chicagowilderness.org/?page=MemberDirectory|publisher=Chicago Wilderness|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 the Corporation for Open Lands (CorLands) was started as an affiliate of Openlands. In 1982 the Canal Corridor Association was formed by Openlands to create the first [[National Heritage Corridor]] along the old [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Openlands Project|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/932.html|publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Openlands Lakeshore Preserve in [[Fort Sheridan, Illinois|Fort Sheridan]] was created in 2011, encompassing ravines and bluffs along the shore of Lake Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravines, bluffs and art await|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/08/ravines-bluffs-and-art-aw_n_953761.html|publisher=Huffingtion Post|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the [[Hackmatack National Wildlife Refuge]] was officially started with a 12-acre donation from Openlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five years of Hackmatack NWR|url=https://www.fws.gov/midwest/news/BdayHackmatack.html|publisher=US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''postage stamp problem''' is a [[mathematical]] riddle that asks what is the smallest postage value which cannot be placed on an envelope, if the latter can hold only a limited number of stamps, and these may only have certain specified face values.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;Jeffrey Shallit (2001), [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.NT/0112257 ''The computational complexity of the local postage stamp problem'']. SIGACT News 33 (1) (March 2002), 90-94.  Accessed on 2009-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, suppose the envelope can hold only three stamps, and the available stamp values are 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, and 20 cents.  Then the solution is 13 cents; since any smaller value can be obtained with at most three stamps (e.g. 4 = 2 + 2, 8 = 5 + 2 + 1, etc.), but to get 13 cents one must use at least four stamps.

==Mathematical definition==
Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as follows: 
: Given an integer ''m'' and a set ''V'' of positive integers, find the smallest integer ''z'' that cannot be written as the sum ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ··· + ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of some number ''k'' ≤ ''m'' of (not necessarily distinct) elements of ''V''.

==Complexity==
This problem can be solved by [[brute force search]] or [[backtracking]] with maximum time proportional to |''V'' |&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, where |''V'' | is the number of distinct stamp values allowed.  Therefore, if the capacity of the envelope ''m'' is fixed, it is a [[polynomial time]] problem.  If the capacity ''m'' is arbitrary, the problem is known to be [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref name=arxiv/&gt;

'''Quantasomes''' are particles found in the [[thylakoid membrane]] of [[chloroplast]]s in which [[photosynthesis]] takes place. They are embedded in a paracrystalline array on the surface of thylakoid discs in chloroplasts. They are composed of lipids and proteins that include various photosynthetic pigments and redox carriers. For this reason they are considered to be photosynthetic units. They occur in 2 sizes: the smaller quantasome is thought to represent the site of photosystem I, the larger to represent the site of photosystem II.

Quantasomes were first identified by [[Roderic B. Park]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Smith-1977"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft796nb4n2&amp;chunk.id=d0e5234&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=0&amp;brand=eschol&amp;query=quantasome | title = Chapter 4 — Chloroplasts—Structure and Photosynthesis | work = The Molecular Biology of Plant Cells | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1977 | first = H. | last = Smith | lccn = 77-73503 | isbn = 0-520-03465-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Park-1962"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed039p424 | title = Advances in photosynthesis | first = Roderic B. | last = Park | date = August 1962 | journal = [[Journal of Chemical Education]] | volume = 39 | number = 8 | pages = 424 | doi = 10.1021/ed039p424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rabindra Chitravali''''' is a 2011 four-volume set of books by art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]] that contains paintings of [[Rabindranth Tagore]]. These include about 1700 paintings in the Rabindra Bhavana and [[Kala Bhavana]] collections of [[Visva-Bharati]], [[Santiniketan]]; and more than 300 paintings in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] and the collections at Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata; [[National Gallery of Modern Art]], New Delhi and Bangalore; and [[Indian Museum]], Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/rabindra_chitravali.html |title= Pratikshan :: Rabindra Chitravali |publisher=Pratikshanbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Tagore-paintings-glow-on-his-150th-birth-anniversary/Article1-541584.aspx |title=Tagore paintings glow on his 150th birth anniversary |publisher=''Hindustan Times'' |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421080810/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/India/Tagore-paintings-glow-on-his-150th-birth-anniversary/Article1-541584.aspx |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
R. Siva Kumar said that reproducing the works in print was important in making them accessible to the public, as "The ink used in the originals is not very durable. The paintings can’t be left in the open for long".&lt;ref name="hindustantimes1"/&gt;

In a review for the [[Royal Asiatic Society]], [[Cambridge Journals]], W. Andrew Robinson called the reproductions of "unparalleled quality" and said the four volumes cover almost all of Tagore's existing work, though some works are missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andrew-robinson.org/uploads/REVIEW_OF_PAINTINGS_OF_TAGORE.pdf Review of Book]by Andrew Robinson, Royal Asiatic Society {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224721/http://andrew-robinson.org/uploads/REVIEW_OF_PAINTINGS_OF_TAGORE.pdf# |date=17 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''semiotic square''', also known as the '''Greimas square''', is a tool used in structural analysis of the relationships between [[semiotic]] [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] through the opposition of concepts, such as feminine-masculine or beautiful-ugly, and of extending the relevant ontology.

The semiotic square, derived from Aristotle's logical [[square of opposition]], was developed by [[Algirdas J. Greimas]], a [[France|French]]-[[Lithuania]]n [[linguist]] and semiotician, who considered the semiotic square to be the elementary structure of meaning.

Greimas first presented the square in ''Semantique Structurale'' (1966), a book which was later published as ''Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method'' (1983).  He further developed the semiotic square with Francois Rastier in "The Interaction of Semiotic Constraints" (1968).

== Basic structure ==

The Greimas Square is a model based on relationships:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structure
! Relationship Type
! Relationship Elements
|-
| Complex
| Contrary
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Neutral
| Contrary
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Schema 1
| Contradiction
| S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Schema 2
| Contradiction
| S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Deixes 1
| Implication
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Deixes 2
| Implication
| ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

*S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = positive [[seme (semantics)|seme]]
*S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = negative seme
*S = complex axis (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
*~S = neutral axis (neither S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nor S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
# The Semiotic Square is formed by an initial binary relationship between two contrary signs. S&lt;sub&gt;1 &lt;/sub&gt;is considered to be the assertion/positive element and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the negation/negative element in the binary pair:
# The second binary relationship is now created on the ~S axis.  ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be the complex term, and ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the neutral term. This is where the principle of difference is brought into play: every element in a system is defined by its differences from the other elements. 
# In most modes of interpretation, the S-axis is a hyponym of the ~S-axis.  The ~S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; element combines aspects of S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is also contradictory to S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; . The ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; element contains aspects of neither S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nor S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; .
# Finally, the ~S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; element can be identified. Considered to be "always the most critical position and the one that remains open or empty the longest time, for its identification completes the process and in that sense constitutes the most creative act of the construction.".&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Fredric. 1987. "Foreword." ''On Meaning: Selected Writings.'' Algirdas Julien Greimas. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. pg. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

Starting from a given opposition of concepts S1 and S2, the semiotic square entails first the existence of two other concepts, namely ~S1 and ~S2, which are in the following relationships:

* S1 and S2: opposition
* S1 and ~S1, S2 and ~S2: contradiction
* S1 and ~S2, S2 and ~S1: complementarity

The semiotic square also produces, second, so-called meta-concepts, which are compound ones, the most important of which are:

* S1 and S2
* neither S1 nor S2

For example, from the pair of opposite concepts masculine-feminine, we get:

* S1: masculine
* S2: feminine
* ~S1: not-masculine
* ~S2: not-feminine
* S1 and S2: masculine and feminine, i.e. hermaphrodite, gender-fluid
* neither S1 nor S2: neither masculine nor feminine, agender

== Styles of interpretation ==

The Greimas Square is a tool used within the system of semiotics.
*As such, one form of interpretation is to look at each of the elements: S1, S2, ~S1, and ~S2 as either developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (bi-modal) or [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (tripartite) sign.
*In the Peircean system of semiotics, the [[interpretant]] becomes the representamen for another, interrelated sign. In this same way, each of the elements of the Semiotic Square (S1, S2, ~S1, and ~S2) can become an element in a new, interrelated square.
*Finally, Greimas suggests placing semiotic squares of associated meaning on top of one another to create a layered effect and another form of analysis and interpretation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The square is a map of logical possibilities. As such, it can be used as a heuristic device, and in fact, attempting to fill it in stimulates the imagination. The puzzle pieces, especially the neutral term, seldom fall conveniently into place … playing with the possibilities of the square is authorized since the theory of the square allows us to see all thinking as a game, with the logical relations as the rules and concepts current in a given language and culture as the pieces".&lt;ref&gt;Katilius-Boydstun, Marvin. 1990. “The Semiotics of A.J. Greimas: An Introduction,” Litanus: Lithuanian Quarterly Journal of Arts and Sciences. 36(3).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:SubsidedRoad.jpg|thumb|[[Mam Tor]] road destroyed by [[subsidence]] and [[shear stress|shear]], near [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]], [[Derbyshire]].]]
In [[engineering]], '''shear strength''' is the strength of a material or component against the type of [[Yield (engineering)|yield]] or [[structural failure]] when the material or component fails in [[Shearing (physics)|shear]]. A shear load is a [[force]] that tends to produce a sliding failure on a material along a plane that is parallel to the direction of the force. When a paper is cut with scissors, the paper fails in shear.

In [[structural engineering|structural]] and  [[mechanical engineering]], the shear strength of a component is important for designing the dimensions and materials to be used for the manufacture or construction of the component (e.g. [[beam (structure)|beams]], [[Plate (structures)|plates]], or [[Screw|bolts]]). In a [[reinforced concrete]] beam, the main purpose of [[Rebar#Stirrups|reinforcing bar (rebar) stirrups]] is to increase the shear strength.

For [[shear stress]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; applies
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac {\sigma_1 - \sigma_3}{2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is major principal stress and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_3&lt;/math&gt; is minor principal stress.

In general: ductile materials (e.g. aluminium) fail in shear, whereas brittle materials (e.g. cast iron) fail in tension. See [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]].

To calculate:

Given total force at failure (F) and the force-resisting area (e.g. the cross-section of a bolt loaded in shear), ultimate shear strength (&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;) is:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac {F}{A} = \frac {F}{\pi r_{bolt}^2} = \frac {4F}{\pi d_{bolt}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Comparison==

When values measured from physical samples are desired, a number of testing standards are available, covering different material categories and testing conditions. In the US, ASTM standards for measuring shear strength include ASTM B831, D732, D4255, D5379, and D7078. Internationally, ISO testing standards for shear strength include ISO 3597, 12579, and 14130.&lt;ref&gt;S. Grynko, "Material Properties Explained" (2012), {{ISBN|1-4700-7991-7}}, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheela na gigs''' are figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated [[vulva]]. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found all over [[Europe]]&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; on [[church (building)|churches]], [[castles]], and other buildings. The highest concentrations can be found in Ireland, Great Britain, France and Spain, sometimes together with male figures. Ireland has the greatest number of surviving sheela na gig carvings; McMahon and Roberts cite 101 examples in Ireland and 45 examples in Britain.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J. ''The Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts – An Illustrated Guide,'' Mercier Press Ltd. (2000) {{ISBN|978-1-85635-294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland.  There is a replica of the Round Tower sheela na gig in the County Museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

The carvings may have been used to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[grotesque]]s, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over [[Europe]]. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep [[Demon|evil spirits]] away (see [[apotropaic magic]]). They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

==Origin==
Scholars disagree about the origins of the figures. James Jerman and Anthony Weir believe that the sheela na gigs were first carved in France and Spain in the 11th century; the motif eventually reached Britain and then Ireland in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Jerman and Weir's work was a continuation of research begun by Jorgen Andersen, who wrote ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977), the first serious book on sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Eamonn Kelly, Keeper of Irish Antiquities at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin, draws attention to the distribution of sheela na gigs in Ireland to support Weir and Jerman's theory;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, Éamonn ''Sheela Na Gigs. Origins And Function,'' Country House (1996) {{ISBN|978-0-946172-51-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; almost all of the surviving ''in situ'' sheela na gigs are found in areas of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] conquest (12th century). The areas that remained "native Irish" have few sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt; Weir and Jerman also argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female [[lust]] as hideous and [[sin]]fully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian [[Fertility rite|fertility]] or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt; They note what they claim are differences in materials and styles of some sheela na gigs from their surrounding structures, and noting that some are turned on their side, to support the idea that they were incorporated from previous structures into [[early Christian]] buildings.

In addition, typical [[Continental Europe|continental]] exhibitionist figures differ from those of Irish sheela na gigs. There is a scarcity of male figures in Ireland and the UK, while the continental carvings are more likely to involve male figures. Continental figures also are represented in more contortionist postures.

[[File:Sheelanagigfethardwall.jpg|thumb|right|Sheela na gig on town wall in [[Fethard, County Tipperary]], [[Ireland]]]]

==Etymology==
The name was first published in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' 1840–44, as a local name for a carving once present on a church [[gable]] wall in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O'Donovan, an official of the [[Ordnance Survey]] of Ireland, referring to a figure on [[Kiltinan Castle]], County Tipperary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into [[Irish language|Irish]]. Alternative spellings of "Sheela" may sometimes be encountered; they include ''Sheila'', ''Síle'' and ''Síla''.&lt;ref name=McMahon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is derived from Irish, ''Síle na gcíoch'', meaning "Julia of the breasts".&lt;ref&gt;''OED Online'' 2003 – The Dictionary spells the name hyphenated, "Sheela-na-gig"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Seán-na-Gig" was coined by Jack Roberts for the [[phallus|ithyphallic]] male counterpart of the Sheela. While rare in Ireland, it is much more common on the continent.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Jørgen Andersen writes that the name is an Irish phrase, originally either ''Sighle na gCíoch'', meaning "the [[old hag]] of the breasts", or ''Síle ina Giob'', meaning "Sheila (from the Irish ''Síle,'' the Irish form of the Anglo-Norman name Cecile or Cecilia) on her hunkers".&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; [[Patrick S. Dinneen|Dinneen]] also gives ''Síle na gCíoċ'', stating it is "a stone fetish representing a woman, supposed to give fertility, gnly [= ''generally''] thought to have been introduced by the Normans."&lt;ref&gt;Dinneen, Patrick. ''Foclóir Gaeḋlge agus Béarla,'' Dublin: Irish Texts Society, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have questioned these interpretations;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; few sheela na gigs are shown with breasts, and expressed doubt about the linguistic connection between ''ina Giob'' and ''na Gig''. The phrase "sheela na gig" was said to be a term for a hag or old woman.&lt;ref name=Freitag&gt;Freitag, Barbara. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y03UDxXyOb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sheela-na-gigs: Unravelling an Enigma]'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-415-34552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Freitag]] devotes a chapter to the [[etymology]] of the name in her book, ''Sheela-Na-Gigs: Unravelling an Enigma.'' She documents references earlier than 1840, including a [[Royal Navy]] ship, ''Sheela Na Gig,'' and an 18th-century dance called the Sheela na gig. Irish slip jig, first published as "The Irish Pot Stick" (c.1758), appears as "Shilling a Gig" in Brysson's ''A Curious Collection of Favourite Tunes'' (1791) and "Sheela na Gigg" in Hime's ''48 Original Irish Dances'' (c.1795).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9710&amp;L=IRTRAD-L&amp;D=0&amp;P=89253 |title=IRTRAD archives |publisher=Listserv.heanet.ie |date=1997-10-22 |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest recorded references to the name,&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; but do not apply to the architectural figures. The Royal Navy's records indicate the name refers to an "Irish female sprite".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Freitag discovered that "gig" was a [[Northern England English|Northern English]] slang word for a woman's genitals. A similar word in modern Irish slang "Gigh" (pronounced {{IPA-ga|ɡʲiː|}}) also exists, further confusing the possible origin of the name.

Weir and Jerman use the name sheela for the figure because it had entered popular usage; they also call figures of both sexes "[[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They cite Andersen's second chapter as a good discussion of the name.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Andersen says there is no evidence that "sheela na gig" was ever a popular name for the figures when they were created. It arose during the mid-19th century "where popular understanding of the characteristics of a sheela were vague and people were wary of its apparent rudeness". An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H.C. Lawlor in an article in ''Man'' Vol. 31, Jan 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, "The term "sheela-na-gig" has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name." Andersen, Weir and Jerman, and Freitag all dismiss the name as being modern and somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt;

The oldest recorded name for one of the figures is "The Idol," which relates to the Binstead figure on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This name was mentioned by R. Worsley in his ''The History of the Isle of Wight'' (1781) and noted also by J. Albin in ''A New, Correct, and Much-improved History of the Isle of Wight'' (1795) (Andersen page 11). The name "The Idol" also was applied to a now lost figure in [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk, Ireland]] and was recorded as being in use around 1783.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;

==Hypotheses==
Much of the disagreement among scholars about these figures focuses on determining exactly what they are meant to represent, and no theory explains all the figures.

===Survival of a pagan goddess===
A popular hypothesis is that sheela na gigs represent a pagan goddess, but academics believe the situation was more complex, with multiple interpretations and roles for the female character as spiritual traditions changed over time.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; The goddess in question usually is identified as Celtic, the hag-like ''[[Cailleach]]'' figure of Irish and Scottish mythology. [[Margaret Murray]] proposed this, as did Anne Ross, who wrote in her essay, "The Divine Hag of the Pagan Celts", "I would like to suggest that in their earliest iconographic form they do in fact portray the territorial or war-goddess in her hag-like aspect..."

[[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' (1993) draws parallels between the sheela na gig and the ancient Irish myth of the goddess who granted kingship. She would appear as a lustful hag, and most men would refuse her advances, except for one man who accepted. When he slept with her, she was transformed into a beautiful maiden who would confer royalty onto him and bless his reign. There are additional variants of this common [[Northern European]] [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] (see "[[Loathly lady]]").&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade, editor (1993) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'', New York: Macmillan, for the University of Chicago {{ISBN|978-0-02897-135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen devotes a chapter to this theory, entitled "Pagan or Medieval." While suggesting possible pagan influences on Irish sheela na gigs, he firmly places them in a medieval context.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; He argues that pagan origins are less likely than influence from the continent during the medieval period: "What can be said against it, is that it is less easily proved and can be less easily illustrated than the possible continental, French origin for the motif discussed in earlier chapters...." (''The Witch on the Wall,'' p.&amp;nbsp;95).

Weir and Jerman explore the possible influence of the [[Baubo]] figurine on the motif, but they acknowledge that the link is tenuous. They write, "It makes for very interesting speculation, but the amount of evidence is not large".&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

Freitag explores possible Celtic pagan origins, but finds little to suggest a link "...in particular the notion of the divine hag being a portrayal of the Ur-Sheela has to be firmly dismissed as wayward conjecture." (''Sheela na gigs: Unravelling an Enigma,'' page 41). Although scholars have used evidence to reject the theory, it is popularly held.

===Fertility figure===
This hypothesis usually is combined with the "goddess" explanation for the figures discussed above. Barbara Freitag suggests that the figures were used in a fertility context and associates them with "birthing stones".&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; There is folkloric evidence of at least some of the sheela na gigs being used in this manner, with the figures being loaned out to women in labour.&lt;ref name=Freitag/&gt; Other figures have wedding traditions associated with them. According to Margaret Murray, the figure in [[Oxford]] at the church of [[St Michael at the North Gate]] has an associated tradition of being shown to brides on their wedding day.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret. "Female Fertility Figures," in ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute,'' Vol. LXIV (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; This theory does not cover all the figures: some are thin with their ribs showing and thin breasts, which do not signal fertility.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;O'Connor, James. ''Sheela na gig'', Fethard Historical Society,  1991&lt;/ref&gt; Others are plump and are shown in a sexual context with a partner (as  at [[Whittlesford]]). Theresa Oakley and Alex Woodcock recently discovered an exhibitionist couple at [[Devizes]], who seem to represent fertility. The faces of some figures are striated, indicating scarring or tattoos.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; Weir notes that a close examination of the figures reveals features that do not fit a fertility function.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt;

===Warning against lust===
Weir and Jerman suggested that the sheela na gigs served to warn against lust.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; They see the figures as a religious warning against sins of the flesh. Exhibitionist figures of all types—male, female, and bestial—are frequently found in the company of images of beasts devouring people and other hellish images. These images, they argue, were used as a means of religious instruction to a largely illiterate populace. As part of this interpretation, they explore a continental origin for the figures. Andersen first suggested this origin, and Weir and Jerman continued and expanded this line of inquiry. They argue that the motif migrated from the continent via the [[Pilgrimage#Christianity|pilgrim routes]] to and from [[Santiago de Compostella]]. (Freitag argues against this.) Pilgrim sculptors took notes of what they had seen on the route and ended up carving their own interpretations of the motifs. Eventually, the exhibitionist motif was carried to Ireland and Britain. This theory seems to accommodate many of the religious figures but relates less well to some of the secular ones. Images carved on castles would not seem to be serving a religious purpose. The figure at [[Haddon Hall]] appears on a stable (although this may have been moved from elsewhere). The theory does not cover all the figures.

===Protection against evil===
[[File:La Fontaine - Tales and Novels in verse - v2 p130.jpg|text-top|thumb|right|La Fontaine plate, illustrated by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] (1762)]]
Andersen&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt; and Weir and Jerman think the figures may also have been used as protection against evil.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; This would cover the use of the figures on structures such as castles. They served an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] function, designed to ward off evil. In Ireland, some of the figures were called "The [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]] Stones," which supported their theory. There is also some folkloric evidence of [[anasyrma]] being used by women lifting up their dresses to curse [[evil spirits]]. Andersen reproduces an 18th-century illustration by [[Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen|Charles Eisen]] from [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1764) showing a demon being repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt to display her genitals. Weir and Jerman relate a story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (23 September 1977) in which a potentially violent incident involving several men was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to them. But, they also doubt if the story was true. Weir and Jerman go on to suggest that the [[:wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] function seems to have been gradually ascribed to the figures over time. While this theory seems to fit most of the secular and some of the religious figures, it does not apply to all of them.

===Feminist reinterpretation of the image===
The rise of [[Feminist theory|feminist scholarship]] has reinterpreted the concept of the Sheela-na-gig especially in terms of the image as evil or embodiment of sin. Feminists have adopted the image as an icon with feminist authors viewing the sexuality of the Sheela na gig in a more positive light, an empowering figure. Reverence for female sexuality and [[vulva]]s can be seen in the art of [[Judy Chicago]]'s ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' by [[Eve Ensler]]. In ''Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder'', Luz Mar González-Arias argues that the creative re-imagining of this medieval female figure can "encourage contemporary women to stop perceiving their own corporeality as a heavy, awkward and shameful burden of guilt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arias|first1=Luz Mar González|title=Wide-open to Mirth and Wonder: Twentieth-Century Sheela-na-Gigs as Multiple Signifiers of the Female Body|date=2007|publisher=Cork University Press|location=Cork|pages=102–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish writer Molly Mullin's essay ''Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference'' makes the point that the image of the Sheela na gig has almost become emblematic of Irish feminism as a force for hope and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullin|first1=Molly|title=Representations of History, Irish Feminism, and the Politics of Difference|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1991|volume=17|issue=1|page=29–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Georgia Rhoades argues that for many contemporary feminists the gesture of the Sheela's unapologetic sexual display is "a message about her body, its power and significance—a gesture of rebellion against misogyny, rather than an endorsement of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhoades|first1=Georgia|title=Decoding the Sheela-na-gig|journal=Feminist Formations|date=2010|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, Ireland has the greatest number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe.&lt;ref name=Andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the interpretation of what is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs.&lt;ref name=Concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Maureen |title=The Sacred Whore: Sheela Goddess of the Celts |publisher=The Collins Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1903464526}}&lt;/ref&gt; With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.

==Parallels==
The ''Encyclopedia of Religion'',&lt;ref name=Eliade&gt;Eliade, Mercea ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' 1993; MacMillan Reference Books&lt;/ref&gt; in its article on [[yoni]], notes the similarity between the positioning of many sheela na gigs above doorways or windows and the wooden female figures carved over the doorways of chiefs' houses (''bai'') in the [[Palau]]an archipelago. Called ''[[dilukai]]'' (or ''dilugai''), they are typically shown with legs splayed, revealing a large, black, triangular pubic area; the hands rest upon the thighs. The writers of the encyclopedia article say:
{{quote|These female figures protect the villagers' health and ward off all evil spirits as well. They are constructed by ritual specialists according to strict rules, which if broken would result in the specialist's as well as the chief's death. It is not coincidental that each example of signs representing the female genitalia used as apotropaic devices are found on gates. The vulva is the primordial gate, the mysterious divide between nonlife and life.}}

[[File:Orion1 big.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Airglow made visible from aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]

'''Sky brightness''' refers to the [[visual perception]] of the [[sky]] and how it [[light scattering|scatters]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuses]] light. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at [[night]] is easily visible. If light sources (e.g. the [[moonlight|Moon]] and [[light pollution]]) were removed from the [[night sky]], it would appear absolutely dark. [[Silhouette]]s of objects against the sky itself would not be visible.

The sky's brightness varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause differs as well. During [[daytime]], when the [[Sun]] is above the horizon, the [[Rayleigh scattering|direct scattering]] of [[sunlight]] is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. During [[twilight]] (the duration after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]] until or since, respectively, the full darkness of night), the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required.

Twilight (both [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]) is divided into three 6° segments that mark the Sun's position below the horizon. At [[civil twilight]], the center of the Sun's disk appears to be between 1/4° and 6° below the horizon. At [[nautical twilight]], the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] is between –6° and –12°. At [[astronomical twilight]], the Sun is between –12° and –18°. When the Sun's depth is more than 18°, the sky generally attains its maximum darkness.

Sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include [[airglow]], indirect scattering of [[sunlight]], scattering of [[starlight]], and [[skyglow|light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Patat |url=http://www.eso.org/~fpatat/science/skybright/ |title=The Brightness of the Night Sky |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airglow==
When physicist [[Anders Ångström]] examined the spectrum of the [[aurora borealis]], he discovered that even on nights when the aurora was absent, its characteristic green line was still present. It was not until the 1920s that scientists were beginning to identify and understand the [[emission line]]s in aurorae and of the sky itself, and what was causing them. The green line Angstrom observed is in fact an emission line with a wavelength of 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, caused by the recombination of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

Airglow is the collective name of the various processes in the upper atmosphere that result in the emission of photons, with the driving force being primarily [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the Sun. Several emission lines are dominant: a green line from oxygen at 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, a yellow doublet from sodium at 589.0 and 589.6&amp;nbsp;nm, and red lines from oxygen at 630.0 and 636.4&amp;nbsp;nm.

The sodium emissions come from a thin [[sodium layer]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km thick at an altitude of 90–100&amp;nbsp;km, above the [[mesopause]] and in the D-layer of the [[ionosphere]]. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of [[sea salt]] and [[meteor]]itic dust.

In daytime, sodium and red oxygen emissions are dominant and roughly 1,000 times as bright as nighttime emissions because in daytime, the upper atmosphere is fully exposed to solar UV radiation. The effect is however not noticeable to the human eye, since the glare of [[Rayleigh scattering|directly scattered]] sunlight outshines and obscures it.

==Indirect scattering of sunlight==
[[Image:Illuminated-arimass.png|250px|thumb|Amount of air still illuminated after sunset, at the horizon. Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass]]
Indirectly scattered sunlight comes from two directions. From the atmosphere itself, and from outer space. In the first case, the sun has just set but still illuminates the upper atmosphere directly. Because the amount of scattered sunlight is proportional to the number of scatterers (i.e. air molecules) in the line of sight, the intensity of this light decreases rapidly as the sun drops further below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere.

When the sun's altitude is &lt; -6° 99% of the atmosphere in [[zenith]] is in the Earth's shadow and second order scattering takes over. At the horizon, however, 35% of the atmosphere along the line of sight is still directly illuminated, and continues to be until the sun reaches -12°. From -12° to -18° only the uppermost parts of the atmosphere along the horizon, directly above the spot where the sun is, is still illuminated. After that, all direct illumination ceases and astronomical darkness sets in.

A second source sunlight is the [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by reflection and scattering of sunlight on interplanetary dust. Zodiacal light varies quite a lot in intensity depending on the position of the earth, location of the observer, time of year, and composition and distribution of the reflecting dust.

==Scattered light from extraterrestrial sources==
Not only sunlight is scattered by the molecules in the air. Starlight and the diffuse light of the milky way are also scattered by the air, and it is found that stars up to V magnitude 16 contribute to the diffuse scattered starlight.

Other sources such as galaxies and nebulae don't contribute significantly.

The total brightness of all the stars was first measured by Burns in 1899, with a calculated result that the total brightness reaching earth was equivalent to that of 2,000 first-magnitude stars &lt;ref&gt;Burns, G. J., "The total amount of starlight and the brightness of the sky," ''The Observatory, Vol. 33'', p. 123-129, March 1910; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1910Obs....33..123B SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent measurements by others.&lt;ref&gt;Yntema, L., "On the Brightness of the Sky and Total Amount of Starlight," ''Publications of the Kapteyn Astronomical Laboratory Groningen, vol. 22'', pp.1-55 (1909); available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1909PGro...22....1Y SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light pollution==
{{Main|Light pollution}}
Light pollution is an ever-increasing source of sky brightness in [[Urban area|urbanized area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In densely populated areas that do not have stringent light pollution control, the entire night sky is regularly 5 to 50 times brighter than it would be if all lights were switched off, and very often the influence of light pollution is far greater than natural sources (including moonlight). With [[urbanization]] and light pollution, one third of humanity, and the majority of those in developed countries, cannot see the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution|title=Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2016-06-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twilight==
When the sun has just set, the brightness of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and nautical twilight.

After the sun has also set for these altitudes at the end of nautical twilight, the intensity of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.

When astronomical darkness has set in, the green 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen line is dominant, and atmospheric scattering of starlight occurs.

Differential refraction causes different parts of the spectrum to dominate, producing a [[Golden hour (photography)|golden hour]] and a [[blue hour]].

==Relative contributions==
The following table gives the relative and absolute contributions to night sky brightness at zenith on a perfectly dark night at middle latitudes without moonlight and in the absence of any [[light pollution]].

(The S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; unit is defined as the surface brightness of a star whose V-magnitude is 10 and whose light is smeared over one square degree, or 27.78 mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The total sky brightness in zenith is therefore ~220 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or 21.9 mag/arcsec² in the V-band. Note that the contributions from Airglow and Zodiacal light vary with the time of year, the solar cycle, and the observer's latitude roughly as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Airglow}/{\rm S}_{10} = 145+108(S-0.8)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the solar 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm flux in MJy, and various sinusoidally between 0.8 and 2.0 with the 11-year solar cycle, yielding an upper contribution of ~270 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; at solar maximum.

The intensity of zodiacal light depends on the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude and longitude]] of the point in the sky being observed relative to that of the sun. At ecliptic longitudes differing from the sun's by &gt; 90 degrees, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm ZodiacalLight}/{\rm S}_{10} = 140 - 90\sin(|\beta|)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''β'' is the ecliptic latitude and is smaller than 60°, when larger than 60 degrees the contribution is that given in the table. Along the ecliptic plane there are enhancements in the zodiacal light where it is much brighter near the sun and with a secondary maximum opposite the sun at 180 degrees longitude (the [[gegenschein]]).

In extreme cases natural zenith sky brightness can be as high as ~21.0 mag/arcsec², roughly twice as bright as nominal conditions.

'''Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop''' is a [[workshop]] for [[science fiction]] writers. Since its origin in 1985, it has been held in Raleigh, [[North Carolina]]; Bryn Mawr, [[Pennsylvania]]; and most recently in Little Switzerland, North Carolina.

Currently organized by Richard Butner, Sycamore Hill was started by [[John Kessel]] and [[Mark L. Van Name]]. It is an invitation-only workshop for established SF, fantasy, and slipstream writers. Attendees have included [[Kelly Link]], [[Carol Emshwiller]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Connie Willis]], [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[Jonathan Lethem]], [[James Patrick Kelly]], [[Robert Frazier (writer)|Robert Frazier]], [[Ted Chiang]], [[Benjamin Rosenbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/000278.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Don Webb (writer)|Don Webb]], among many others.

A collection of original stories from the 1994 workshop was published as the anthology ''Intersections: The Sycamore Hill Anthology'', edited by John Kessel, Mark L. Van Name and Richard Butner ([[Tor Books]], 1996). It includes works by Richard Butner, Carol Emshwiller, Karen Joy Fowler, Robert Frazier, Gregory Frost, Alexander Jablokov, James Patrick Kelly, John Kessel, Nancy Kress, Jonathan Lethem, Maureen F. McHugh, Michaela Roessner, Bruce Sterling, and Mark L. Van Name.

[[Orson Scott Card]] wrote about his experience at the Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop in the essay "On Sycamore Hill." Scholars such as Michael Collins identify Card's Sycamore Hill experience as marking a critical "turning point" in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward Other Worlds: Perspectives on John Milton, C.

'''''The Religion of the Future''''' is a book by the philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, he argues that humanity is in need of a religious revolution that dispenses with the concept of God and elements of the supernatural, a revolution that expands individual and collective human empowerment by fostering a condition he calls "deep freedom"—a life of creativity, risk, experiment, and meaningful personal connection—protected by structure-revising social and political structures of an [[empowered democracy]] hospitable to the context-breaking capacities inherent in human life.

==Overview==

===Background and objective===
Unger opens the book by describing the four incurable defects of human life: death, groundlessness, insatiability, and belittlement. The major world religious traditions, although having certain elements in common, have differed in how they have dealt with these four defects of human life. Unger describes three “moments” in the evolution of religious belief: a first moment, when human life was so precarious that the flaws of existence did not occupy a central place in human consciousness; a second moment, when humans had achieved some degree of freedom from dependence on nature, allowing high culture to emerge and address the basic flaws of existence, which were now at the center of human consciousness. A hallmark of this second moment of religious belief was the common feature of religion in assuring believers that everything is alright. For the third moment to occur, Unger argues that a religious revolution is needed, a thoroughly naturalistic development of religious belief which offers no assurance that everything is alright, but offers a heightened, intensified, and more meaningful life in the present, rather than at some indefinitely postponed future time. This “religion of the future” would offer a way of confronting life without illusions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=1-61}}

In the next three chapters, Unger will address each of the three major world religious traditions and explain their shortcomings as inspiration and sources for the religion of the future.

===Critique of religious tradition of "overcoming the world"===
The religious tradition of overcoming the world, chiefly represented by [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], is marked by a quest for serenity and benevolence. Unger contends that “overcoming the world” cannot serve as a starting point for a future religious revolution, because this tradition seeks a deliberate dimming of consciousness and vitality in its quest for serenity. The religion of the future, Unger contends, must turn toward the world, not away from it, and a religious tradition that denies time and distinction, and urges us to turn away from engagement with the world, cannot be a basis for the religious revolution Unger envisions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=62-89}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "humanizing the world"===
The tradition of humanizing the world (represented by [[Confucianism]]) is marked by a belief that humans can find their place in the world by embracing an ethic of roles and the ennoblement of our relations with each other through this ethic of roles. Unger contends that this tradition, too, is unsuited to be a starting point for the religion of the future because it gives too much weight and authority to social structures and roles that may match the dispositions only of the most virtuous, conformist members of society. The picture of human morality presented by the tradition of humanizing the world is ultimately unrealistic, Unger contends, and fails to address in a satisfactory manner the flaws in human existence.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=90-120}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "struggling with the world"===
According to Unger, the religious tradition that holds the most promise as a starting point for the religion of the future is the tradition of “struggling with the world,” the semitic salvific religions including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The tradition of “struggling with the world” also has a secular voice, in the form of the major doctrines of emancipation including [[liberalism]], [[socialism]] and [[democracy]]. The metaphysical vision of the various forms of “struggling with the world” include several points in common:
* There is one real world.
* Time is inclusively real.
* The new can happen.
* History is open.
* The self has unfathomable depth.
* The ordinary has more promise than the high-flown.

At the heart of the doctrine of the “struggle with the world,” both in its religious and secular variants, is a conception of the self as embodied spirit. Unger explains a key aspect of the nature of the embodied spirit is that it can always overflow and exceed its contexts: “There is more in us, in each of us individually and in all of us collectively--the human race--than there is or ever can be in them.” Unger explains how this context-transcending quality of human beings as embodied spirit is manifested in the context of the market economy, in areas of rigorous intellectual inquiry such as mathematics and physics, and in the confrontation of human beings with the enigmas of their experience in the context of religion. In each of these settings, Unger argues, we are not “ever entirely hostage to the social and conceptual worlds that have helped shape us. They may direct us over much of our lives, but they do not own us.”

This view of human nature as irrepressibly context-transcending is at the heart of what Unger finds useful for the religion of the future in the doctrine of the struggle with the world, and it is this element of the doctrine that he embraces as the starting point for his vision of a religion of the future. But he finds that all of its contemporary forms, the tradition of struggling with the world is radically defective.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=121-195}}

===Nature of the religious revolution represented by the religion of the future===
Unger argues that a new religious revolution would be thoroughly naturalistic and would pursue the task of enhancing life now, rather than promising salvation or reward in the indefinite future. Such a revolution would likely contain elements that resemble past religious revolutions such as visionary teaching and exemplary action, but would combined with elements unknown to the religious revolutions of the past. The religious revolution that Unger envisions would have the following qualities:
* It would not centralize prophetic power in a single individual and his decisive action in history.
* It would be concerned both with reshaping society as well as reorienting individual life.
* It would include a vision for the cumulative transformation of society that would not be reducible to a definite blueprint or formula.
* It would seek to remedy our condition of estrangement from the present moment, recognizing that time is our most precious possession, and that religion must help us transform our lives now, if only in fragmentary and inchoate form, no matter what changes are sought in the structure of society in historical time.
* It would reject the taboo on the religious criticism of religion.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=194-289}}

===Unger's conception of "deep freedom" and the social and political changes that would help bring it about===
Unger sets forth the structural changes in society that would be necessary to foster the emancipatory conditions of the religion of the future, to make society more open to experiment, fulfillment, connection, and surprise. At the heart of his political proposals in this chapter is the general concept of “structure-revising structure,” and the various ways that this can be embodied in political and social institutions. Unger’s vision for politics in this chapter includes “heating up” the political process, creating institutional mechanisms for breaking impasse between branches of government, and increasing mass mobilization of citizens so that all have a voice in the direction and operation of government.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=290-340}}

===Quality of human life under the religion of the future===
Unger speculates on the quality that life would have under the regime instituted by a future religious revolution. Individuals would become freer to innovate, experiment, take risks, and look for trouble. Connections between people would be deeper and more meaningful. Social mechanisms and safety nets would be in place that would allow and encourage this climate of experiment, risk, cooperation and love.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=341-444}}

==Reception==
Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Andrew B. Irvine wrote that “the book demands to be read not as a contribution to scholarly debate but as a direct intervention in the most important and urgent issues of today …  No review could cover all the angles from which this book deserves to be appreciated—and criticized.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=554}} Irvine contends that Unger’s argument  “dramatically ...simplifies the indefinitely complex data of religion, but it does so in the name of a single religious perspective.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine asks: “What would this book look like if it were more deeply comparative and/or interreligious in its thinking? It is comparative and interreligious, of course, but Unger’s exclusivistic affirmation of the ‘struggle with the world’ seems insufficiently informed.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine concludes his review by applauding ''The Religion of the Future'', stating that it “merits reading by philosophers, theologians, and activists, especially any who hold that a naturalistic metaphysics and praxis are vital to a flourishing human future. Its weaknesses are as instructive as its strengths.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=568}}

Bonaventure Chapman, writing in the Catholic publication ''Dominicana'', described ''The Religion of the Future'' as “a prophetic vision of any future religion,”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=11}} and stated that he considered the book, alongside [[Ronald Dworkin]]’s ''Religion Without God'', to be an example of “religious atheism,” that is, a “new attitude to God” that “presents a new horizon for Christianity.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}} While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a “maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}}

Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]'', Jeremy David Bendik-Keymer considered the book as the second part of the project that Unger began in ''[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]'' and concluded in ''[[The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time]]''. Bendik-Keymer summarizes Unger’s project in these works as one that “seeks a world in which we live in the present, free of repression of, or reactive attitudes towards, the existential limitations of being human and in which we act collectively to create the conditions for ongoing innovation and self-transformation” (internal citations omitted). Bendik-Keymer complains that Unger’s depiction of human beings is “belittling” and concludes that Unger “has simply missed the mark… Unger may think of his work as preparation for prophesy, but it ends up as pontification.”{{sfn|Bendik-Keymer|2014}}

==Quotes==

- p.236

{{quote|The category of religion lacks any permanent core. There is no set way in which the aspects of our experience that we designate as religious relate to other aspects. That the category of religion is historical, however, does not mean that it is empty of content. Its powers of discrimination are those that the history of mankind gives it. Each major change in the content of religion inspires a change in our idea of what the term most usefully designates.}}

- p.314

{{quote|Deep freedom is therefore freedom, grasped and realized through change of institutions and practices: not just through a one-time change but through a practice that can generate future, ongoing change in the institutional order of society. Deep freedom is thus also freedom as understood within the bounds of what I earlier described as the conception of a free society. The idea of deep freedom develops through an interplay between the conception of a free society and the institutional arrangements required to make that conception real. The conception informs the making of the institutional alternatives. The making of the alternative prompts us to enrich and revise the conception.}}

- p.349

{{quote|Our comprehensive conceptions of our identity, viewed in relation to our place in nature, are not, in this account, to be understood as merely or chiefly conjectures about a natural phenomenon, as if human nature were a thing. They do not resemble the thinking that produced the standard model of particle physics or the periodic table. They are prophecies, indeed imperfectly self-fulfilling prophecies, as I have argued in my defense of the concept of religion.}}

He was born in Meggetland House, west of [[Edinburgh]] the eldest son of Thomas Sivright (1739-1813).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/141306057/thomas-sivright&lt;/ref&gt; The large mansionhouse stood south of the junction of Colinton Road and Polwarth Terrace. The huge grounds are now the Meggetland sports fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stravaiging.com/history/castle/meggetland&lt;/ref&gt; The house was lost to a railway line in the 19th century.

In 1817 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were Sir [[David Brewster]], [[John Jamieson]], and [[James Bonar (scholar)|James Bonar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected at the same time as [[James Skene]] and [[William Pulteney Alison]].&lt;ref&gt;The Scots Magazine vol 79, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

Over and above his country estates he had a townhouse at 7 West Maitland Street in the West End of Edinburgh.

He died on 6 November 1835. He is buried with his parents in [[St. Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh|St Cuthberts Churchyard]] at the west end of [[Princes Street]] in Edinburgh. The grave holds a unique position under the west steeple, at the end of the main approach path from Lothian Road.

'''''The Urbino European Law Seminar''''' is a summer course organized every year since 1959 by the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino. The lectures are held in French, Italian and English at the Law Faculty of [[University of Urbino|Urbino University]], by visiting lecturers from many European countries and focus on current issues of [[European law]], [[private international law]], [[comparative law]] and Italian law. 

Following the seminar, participants are given a certificate as proof of their attendance. Depending on the specialty selected&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-paris1.fr/uploads/media/Certificate.and.diplomas.pdf Regulation of the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino.]&lt;/ref&gt; and if successful in examination, participants are also awarded a diploma from the Law Faculty of [[University of Urbino|Urbino University]] in either comparative law, European studies, advanced studies in European Law, or advanced European studies.

== History ==
The Urbino European Law Seminar was inaugurated on the 24th of August 1959&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ridc_0035-3337_1959_num_11_4_11303 Report of the inaugural session] : [S.N.], «"Corsi estivi" de la Faculté de droit de l'Université d'Urbino», ''Revue internationale de droit comparé'', 1959, pp. 550-751.&lt;/ref&gt; by Henri Batiffol, Phocion Francescakis, Alessandro Migliazza, Francesco Capotorti, Enrico Paleari and Germain Bruillard. Until 2004, [[Cino Del Duca|Cino]] and [[Simone Del Duca]] were the seminar's main benefactors. Since 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/news/consulting_public/0002/contributions/civil_society_ngo_academics_others/university_of_urbino_groupe_galileo_fr.pdf Response of the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino and the Galileo Initiative to the European Commission's Green Paper on the Revision of the «Brussels I» Regulation], on the «Justice, Freedom and Security» General Division of the European Commission's website.&lt;/ref&gt; the teachers and researchers of the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino, members of the ''Galileo Group'', receive funding from the scientific cooperation initiative between France and Italy named Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144245/http://www.universite-franco-italienne.org/appel+a+projets-fr-24-programme+galilee.html Presentation of the Galileo Initiative] on the website of the Franco-Italian University.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4834">The '''Washington Accord''' is an international accreditation agreement for professional [[engineering]] [[academic degree]]s between the bodies responsible for accreditation in its signatory countries. Established in 1989, the full signatories as of 2018 are [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Taiwan]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Philippines]], [[Peru]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Signatories&gt;{{cite web| title=Washington Accord| url=http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/| publisher=International Engineering Alliance|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement recognizes that there is substantial equivalence of programs accredited by those signatories. Graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries are recognized by the other signatory countries as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering. Recognition of accredited programs is not retroactive but takes effect only from the date of admission of the country to signatory status.

==Scope==
The Washington Accord covers undergraduate engineering degrees under [[Outcome-based education]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utar.edu.my/fes/file/OBE.pdf| title=Outcome Based Education| date=18 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engineering technology]] and [[postgraduate]] engineering programs are not covered by the accord. Engineering technology programs are covered under the [[Sydney Accord]] and [[Dublin Accord]]. Only qualifications awarded after the signatory country or region became part of the Washington Accord are recognized. The accord is not directly responsible for the licensing  of [[Professional Engineer]]s and the registration of [[Chartered Engineer]]s, but it does cover the academic requirements that are part of the licensing processes in signatory countries.

A '''Wickelphone''' is a sequence of three letters or symbols, which occur together in a [[word]].  For example, the word ''strip'' may be decomposed into a set of [[trigram]]s such as ''rip'' and ''str'' &amp;mdash; these are Wickelphones.  The term was devised by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart]] in reference to the work of [[Wayne Wickelgren]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Steven Pinker]], A. Prince |title=Connections and symbols |page=89 |chapter=Language and connectionism |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-262-66064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumelhart and McClelland then extended the idea by expressing the triples in [[phonetic]] terms as '''Wickelfeatures'''.  For example, the Wickelphone ''tri'' would correspond to a Wickelfeature of "[[stop consonant|stop]], [[lateral consonant|lateral]], [[vowel]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=98 |title=Social networks and historical sociolinguistics |author=Alexander Bergs |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-11-018310-8 |chapter=Personal pronouns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
