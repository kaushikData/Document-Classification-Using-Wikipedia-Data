A '''501(c)(3) organization''' is a corporation, trust, unincorporated association, or other type of organization exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of [[Internal Revenue Code|Title 26]] of the [[United States Code]]. It is one of the 29 types of [[501(c) organization|501(c)]] [[nonprofit organizations]] in the US. 

501(c)(3) tax-exemptions apply to entities that are organized and operated exclusively for [[religion|religious]], [[Charitable organization|charitable]], [[science|scientific]], [[literature|literary]], or [[education]]al purposes, for [[Public security#Organizations|testing for public safety]], to foster national or international [[amateur sports]] competition, for the prevention of [[Child abuse|cruelty to children]], [[Violence against women|women]], or [[Cruelty to animals|animals]]. 501(c)(3) exemption applies also for any non-incorporated [[Community Chest (organization)|community chest]], fund, [[Cooperating Associations|cooperating association]] or foundation organized and operated exclusively for those purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exempt-Purposes-Internal-Revenue-Code-Section-501(c)(3) Exempt Purposes – Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf IRS Publication 557 "Tax-Exempt Status For Your Organization", Page 19, (Rev.

{{usc|26|170}} provides a deduction for federal income tax purposes, for some donors who make [[Charitable contribution deductions in the United States|charitable contributions]] to most types of 501(c)(3) organizations, among others. Regulations specify which such deductions must be verifiable to be allowed (e.g., receipts for donations of $250 or more).

Due to the tax deductions associated with donations, loss of 501(c)(3) status can be highly challenging if not fatal to a charity's continued operation, as many foundations and corporate matching programs do not grant funds to a charity without such status, and individual donors often do not donate to such a charity due to the unavailability of the deduction.

== Types ==
The two exempt classifications of 501(c)(3) organizations are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;IRS, [https://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=136459,00.html "Life Cycle of a Public Charity/Private Foundation"], IRS.gov, Retrieved March 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Charitable organization#United States|public charity]], identified by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) as "not a private foundation", normally receives a substantial part of its income, directly or indirectly, from the general public or from the government. The public support must be fairly broad, not limited to a few individuals or families. Public charities are defined in the Internal Revenue Code under sections 509(a)(1) through 509(a)(4).
* A [[private foundation (United States)|private foundation]], sometimes called a non-operating foundation, receives most of its income from investments and endowments. This income is used to make grants to other organizations, rather than being disbursed directly for charitable activities. Private foundations are defined in the Internal Revenue Code under section 509(a) as 501(c)(3) organizations, which do not qualify as public charities.

== Obtaining status ==
The basic requirement of obtaining tax-exempt status is that the organization is specifically limited in powers to purposes that the IRS classifies as tax-exempt purposes. Unlike for-profit corporations that benefit from broad and general purposes, non-profit organizations need to be limited in powers to function with tax-exempt status, but a non-profit corporation is by default not limited in powers until it specifically limits itself in the articles of incorporation or nonprofit corporate bylaws. This limiting of the powers is crucial to obtaining tax exempt status with the IRS and then on the state level.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exemption-Requirements-Section-501%28c%29%283%29-Organizations IRS Exemption requirements: 501(c)(3) organizations]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations acquire 501(c)(3) tax exemption by filing IRS [[Form 1023]].&lt;ref name="atlantatribune"&gt;Phillips, Marlissa J. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/212471376/ tax zone: Nonprofit Not Tax Exempt?]" ''The Atlanta Tribune''. December 2002. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}} the form must be accompanied by a $850 filing fee if the yearly gross receipts for the organization are expected to average $10,000 or more.&lt;ref name="Form 1023"&gt;IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1023.pdf "Form 1023"] (Rev. 6-2006), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IRS Exempt Organizations Website"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Exempt-Organizations-Select-Check IRS Exempt Organizations Website] Retrieved on September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; If yearly gross receipts are expected to average less than $10,000, the filing fee is reduced to $400.&lt;ref name="Form 1023" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IRS Exempt Organizations Website" /&gt; There are some classes of organizations that automatically are treated as tax exempt under 501(c)(3), without the need to file Form 1023:
* Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches. A convention or association of churches generally refers to the organizational structure of congregational churches.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://openjurist.org/758/f2d/1283/lutheran-social-service-of-minnesota-v-united-states Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota v. United States]". 758 F.2d 1283 (8th Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; A convention or association of churches can also refer to a cooperative undertaking of churches of various denominations that works together to perform religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rr74-224.pdf Revenue Ruling 74-224]". 1974-1 C.B. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|26|508|c|1|A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organizations that are not private foundations and that have gross receipts that normally are not more than $5,000&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|26|508|c|1|B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS released a software tool called Cyber Assistant in 2013, which was succeeded by Form 1023-EZ in 2014.

There is an alternative way for an organization to obtain status if an organization has applied for a determination and either there is an actual controversy regarding a determination or the Internal Revenue Service has failed to make a determination. In these cases, the [[United States Tax Court]], the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], and the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] have [[concurrent jurisdiction]] to issue a declaratory judgment of the organization's qualification if the organization has exhausted administrative remedies with the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7428|title=Internal Revenue Code 7428|publisher=via Legal Information Institute, Cornell University|work=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venable.com/files/Publication/2d68ea47-838d-43c0-9b66-5c7e78bdac69/Preview/PublicationAttachment/e24a14f6-f2dc-47ea-8232-62e2865afdb7/Tools_for_Bypassing_IRS_Delays_in_EO_Applications.pdf|title=Tools for Bypassing IRS Delays in EO Applications: Organizations and their representatives missed opportunities to mitigate the consequences of the IRS' delays and requests for inappropriate information|last2=Ziffer|first2=Yosef|date=September 2013|last3=Tenenbaum|first3=Jeffrey S.|work=Venable LLP|first1=Matthew T.|last1=Journy|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to October 9, 1969, nonprofit organizations could declare themselves to be tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) without first obtaining Internal Revenue Service recognition by filing Form 1023 and receiving a determination letter.&lt;ref name="403b"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-072-013.html|title=Internal Revenue Manual, Part 4. Examining Process, Chapter 72. Employee Plans Technical Guidelines, Section 13. 403(b) Plans, 4.72.13.8.6 Eligibility – Examination Steps, Paragraph 1(F)|work=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nonprofit organization that did so prior to that date could still be subject to challenge of its status by the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref name="403b" /&gt;

==Tax-deductible charitable contributions==
An approved 501(c)(3) exemption allows donors to the organization to reduce their own taxable incomes by deducting the amounts of their donations given, and thus to reduce their personal income taxes, and it allows the 501(c)(3) organization to avoid [[taxation in the United States|federal]] [[income tax in the United States|income taxes]] on the difference between revenues (donations, grants, service fees) received vs. expenses (wages, supplies, state and local taxes paid, etc.) in its main operations. In a for-profit business, that difference would represent taxable income and be taxed at federal corporate tax rates of 15 to 39 percent.&lt;ref name="smbiz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smbiz.com/sbrl001.html |title=Corporate and Individual Tax Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations with 501(c)(3) status may also be exempt from state and local corporate income taxes, which generally range from 0 to 12 percent.&lt;ref name="kpmg-corp-tax-rates"&gt;{{cite web |title=Corporate tax rates table (global corporate tax rates between 2006 and 2014) |url=http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/pages/corporate-tax-rates-table.aspx |publisher=[[KPMG]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing for public safety is described under section 509(a)(4) of the code, which makes the organization a public charity and not a private foundation,&lt;ref&gt;IRS, [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf Publication 557 "Tax-Exempt Status For Your Organization"], p. 43, (Rev. June 2008), Cat. No 46573C.&lt;/ref&gt; but contributions to 509(a)(4) organizations are not deductible by the donor for federal income, estate, or [[Gift tax in the United States|gift tax]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Walden, Steve. "Not all charitable gifts tax-deductible, IRS says". ''The Oklahoman'' (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma). February 14, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Before donating to a 501(c)(3) organization, a donor may wish to consult the searchable online IRS list of charitable organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IRS Search for Charities |url=https://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0,,id=96136,00.html |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427023508/https://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D96136%2C00.html |archivedate=April 27, 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lists that may be maintained by a state on a portion of its web portal devoted to its "department of justice" or "office of attorney general".

Consumers may file IRS Form 13909 with documentation to complain about inappropriate or fraudulent (i.e., fundraising, political campaigning, lobbying) activities by any 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form 13909: Tax-Exempt Organization Complaint (Referral) Form|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=April 24, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429025659/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf| archivedate= April 29, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Think tank]]s are often incorporated as  501(c)(3) organizations, and such a level of political influencing is usually considered acceptable.

501(c)(3) generally must disclose the identities of large donors to the IRS, but this information is not available for public disclosure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonprofitissues.com/to-the-point/nonprofit-required-report-anonymous-donors-irs|title=Is a nonprofit required to report anonymous donors to the IRS?|last=|first=|date=2011-06-14|website=Nonprofit Issues|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless the organization is a private foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990ezb.pdf|title=Form 990, Schedule B|last=|first=|date=2016|website=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|publisher=|page=5|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Religious organizations such as churches are exempt from reporting at all, as are organizations with annual gross receipts of $50,000 or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-exempt-organization-return-who-must-file|title=Annual Exempt Organization Return: Who Must File|last=|first=|date=2016-12-13|website=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|publisher=|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transparency==
All 501(c)(3) organizations must make available for public inspection its application for tax-exemption, including its Form 1023 or Form 1023-EZ and any attachments, supporting documents, and follow-up correspondence with the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref name="pd"&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-documents-subject-to-public-disclosure Public Disclosure and Availability of Exempt Organizations Returns and Applications: Documents Subject to Public Disclosure]".

==Limitations on political activity==

Section 501(c)(3) organizations are prohibited from supporting political candidates, as a result of the [[Johnson Amendment]] enacted in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Chuck. "[https://trust.guidestar.org/perspectives-on-the-johnson-amendment Perspectives on the Johnson Amendment]". ''Guidestar''. February 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 501(c)(3) organizations are subject to limits on [[lobbying]], having [[501(h) election|a choice]] between two sets of rules establishing an upper bound for their lobbying activities.

== Churches ==
Churches must meet specific requirements in order to obtain and maintain tax-exempt status; these are outlined in "IRS Publication 1828: Tax Guide for Churches and Religious Organizations".&lt;ref name="p1828"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1828.pdf|title=Tax guide for churches and religious organizations|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|work=26 USC 501(c)(3)|accessdate=April 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429180346/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1828.pdf|archivedate=April 29, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guide outlines activities allowed and not allowed by churches under the 501(c)(3) designation.&lt;ref name=p1828/&gt;

In 1980, the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] recognized a 14-part test in determining whether a religious organization is considered a church for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
{{numbered list | A distinct legal entity; | A recognized creed and form of worship; | A definite and distinct ecclesiastical government; | A formal code of doctrine and discipline; | A distinct religious history; | A membership not associated with any other church or denomination; | A complete organization of ordained ministers ministering to their congregations; | Ordained ministers selected after completed prescribed courses of study; | Literature of its own; | Established places of worship; | Regular congregations; | Regular religious services; | Sunday schools for the religious instruction of the young; | Schools for the preparation of its ministers.}}
Having an established congregation served by an organized ministry is of central importance.&lt;ref name="sos"&gt;"[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/927/335/109709/ Spiritual Outreach Society v. Commissioner]". 927 F.2d 335 (8th Cir. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Points 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 13 are also especially important. Nevertheless, the 14-point list is a guideline, it is not intended to be all-encompassing, and other relevant facts and circumstances may be factors.&lt;ref name=sos/&gt; Although there is no definitive definition of a church for Internal Revenue Code purposes, in 1986 the [[United States Tax Court]] said that "A church is a coherent group of individuals and families that join together to accomplish the religious purposes of mutually held beliefs. In other words, a church's principal means of accomplishing its religious purposes must be to assemble regularly a group of individuals related by common worship and faith."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914c251add7b049347bef00 Church of Eternal Life and Liberty, Inc. v.

An organization whose operations include a substantial nonexempt commercial purposes, such as operating restaurants and grocery stores in a manner consistent with a particular religion's religious beliefs does not qualify as a tax-exempt church.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://openjurist.org/950/f2d/365/living-faith-inc-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue Living Faith v.

==Political campaign activities==
Organizations described in section 501(c)(3) are prohibited from conducting [[political campaign]] activities to intervene in [[election]]s to public office.&lt;ref name="IRS-501c3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/The-Restriction-of-Political-Campaign-Intervention-by-Section-501(c)(3)-Tax-Exempt-Organizations |title=The Restriction of Political Campaign Intervention by Section 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organizations |website=Irs.gov |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=September 9, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202054714/https://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D163395%2C00.html |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internal Revenue Service website elaborates on this prohibition:&lt;ref name="IRS-501c3" /&gt;

{{quote|text=Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity.  Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.

Certain activities or expenditures may not be prohibited depending on the facts and circumstances.  For example, certain voter education activities (including presenting public forums and publishing voter education guides) conducted in a non-partisan manner do not constitute prohibited political campaign activity. In addition, other activities intended to encourage people to participate in the electoral process, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, would not be prohibited political campaign activity if conducted in a non-partisan manner.

On the other hand, voter education or registration activities with evidence of bias that (a) would favor one candidate over another; (b) oppose a candidate in some manner; or (c) have the effect of favoring a candidate or group of candidates, will constitute prohibited participation or intervention.}}

===Constitutionality===
Since section 501(c)(3)'s political-activity prohibition was enacted, "commentators and litigants have challenged the provision on numerous constitutional grounds," such as [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]], [[Vagueness doctrine|vagueness]], and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] and selective prosecution.&lt;ref name="Klapach"&gt;Joseph S. Klapach, Note, [http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2751&amp;context=clr Thou Shalt Not Politic: A Principled Approach to Section 501 (C)(3)'s Prohibition of Political Campaign Activity], 84 [[Cornell Law Review|Cornell L. Rev.]] 504 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions, such as ''[[Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Washington]]'', suggested that the Court, if it were to squarely examine the political-activity prohibition of § 501(c)(3), would uphold it against a constitutional challenge.&lt;ref name="Klapach"/&gt; However, some have suggested that a successful challenge to the political activities prohibition of Section 501(c)(3) might be more plausible in light of ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lepow, Hannah (2014). [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/colb2014&amp;div=22&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals Speaking Up: The Challenges to Section 501(c)(3)'s Political Activities Prohibition in a Post-Citizens United World]". [[Columbia Business Law Review|Colum. Bus. L. Rev.]]. 817.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==
{{Main article|501(h) election}}
In contrast to the prohibition on political campaign interventions by all section 501(c)(3) organizations, public charities (but not private foundations) may conduct a limited amount of [[lobbying]] to influence legislation. Although the law states that "No substantial part..." of a public charity's activities can go to lobbying, charities with large budgets may lawfully expend a million dollars (under the "expenditure" test), or more (under the "substantial part" test) per year on lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=120703,00.html |title=Political and Lobbying Activities |publisher=Irs.gov |date=January 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507002752/https://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D120703%2C00.html |archivedate=May 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internal Revenue Service has never defined the term "substantial part" with respect to lobbying.&lt;ref name="lobbyinglaw"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2003/11/30/the-lobbying-law-is-more-charitable-than-they-think/d0c3660d-6e51-48c4-b3f9-7403a4dac98b/|title=The Lobbying Law Is More Charitable Than They Think|last=Berry|first=Jeffrey M.|date=November 30, 2003|work=The Washington Post|page=B1|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to establish a [[safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] for the "substantial part" test, the [[United States Congress]] enacted §501(h), called the Conable election after its author, [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Barber Conable]]. The section establishes limits based on operating budget that a charity can use to determine if it meets the substantial test. This changes the prohibition against direct intervention in partisan contests only for lobbying. The organization is now presumed in compliance with the substantiality test if they work within the limits. The Conable election requires a charity to file a declaration with the IRS and file a functional distribution of funds spreadsheet with their Form 990. IRS form 5768 is required to make the Conable election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5768.pdf|title= Form 5768: Election/Revocation of Election by an Eligible Section 501(c)(3) Organization To Make Expenditures To Influence Legislation (Under Section 501(h) of the Internal Revenue Code) |work= Internal Revenue Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign activities==
A 501(c)(3) organization is allowed to conduct some or all of its charitable activities outside the United States.&lt;ref name="71-460"&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rr71-460.pdf Rev. Rul. 71–460, 1971–2 C.B. 231]".

''Exempt Organization Continuing Professional Education Text''. Internal Revenue Service. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; A 501(c)(3) organization is allowed to award grants to foreign charitable organizations if the grants are intended for charitable purposes and the grant funds are subject to the 501(c)(3) organization's control.&lt;ref name="63-252"&gt;"[http://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/Rev_Rul_63-252.pdf Rev. Rul. 63–252, 1963–2 C.B. 101]". ''Internal Revenue Service'' via Bradford Tax Institute. 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional procedures are required of 501(c)(3) organizations that are [[Private foundation (United States)|private foundation]]s.&lt;ref name= 1983eo-o/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/0504031.pdf Memorandum 200504031]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. January 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allowance of tax-deduction by donors===
Donors' contributions to a 501(c)(3) organization are tax-deductible only if the contribution is for the use of the 501(c)(3) organization, and that the 501(c)(3) organization is not merely serving as an agent or conduit of a foreign charitable organization.&lt;ref name= 63-252/&gt; The 501(c)(3) organization's management should review the grant application from the foreign organization, decide whether to award the grant based on the intended use of the funds, and require continuous oversight based on the use of funds.&lt;ref name= 63-252/&gt;

If the donor imposes a restriction or earmark that the contribution must be used for foreign activities, then the contribution is deemed to be for the foreign organization rather than the 501(c)(3) organization, and the contribution is not tax-deductible.&lt;ref name= 63-252/&gt;

The purpose of the grant to the foreign organization cannot include endorsing or opposing political candidates for elected office in any country.&lt;ref name= 63-252/&gt; 

===Foreign subsidiaries===
If a 501(c)(3) organization sets up and controls a foreign subsidiary in order to facilitate its charitable work in a foreign country, then donors' contributions to the 501(c)(3) organization are tax-deductible even if they are intended to fund the charitable activities in the foreign country.&lt;ref name= 63-252/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/201438032.pdf Public Letter Ruling 201438032]". ''Internal Revenue Service''. September 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

If a foreign organization sets up a 501(c)(3) organization for the sole purpose of raising funds for the foreign organization, and the 501(c)(3) organization sends substantially all contributions to the foreign organization, then donors' contributions to the 501(c)(3) organization are not tax-deductible to the donors.&lt;ref name= 63-252/&gt;

{{Shia Islam}}
The '''Risalat al-Huquq ''' ({{lang-ar|رسالة الحقوق}}, {{IPA-ar|'rɪsælætul huːquːq}}; "Treatise of Rights") is a work attributed to [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali ibn al-Husayn]] the fourth [[Imam]] of the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] except for his relatively short sayings and letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= 
Imam Zain ul Abideen |first= |date= |title= Treatise On Rights (Risalat al-Huquq)|url=http://www.al-islam.org/treatise-rights-risalat-al-huquq-imam-zain-ul-abideen |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |accessdate= 13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Risalah al-Huquq '' is narrated in [[Al-Khisal]], [[Al-Amali]], and [[Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih]] all by [[Ibn Babawayh|Shaykh al-Suduq]] and in [[Tuhaf al-Oqul]] by [[Hussayn ibn Shu'bah Harrani]]. This charter is narrated by [[Abu Hamza al-Thumali]], a reliable and admired companion of Ali ibn al-Husayn for the first time. ''Risalah al-Huquq '' is prefaced in of the two versions by: "This is the treatise of Ali ibn al-Husayn to one of his companions", which shows to be written at the request of a pupil of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rizvi|first= Sayyid Saeed Akhtar|date= |title= The Charter of Rights|url= http://www.shia-maktab.info/index.php/library/books/english?format=raw&amp;task=download&amp;fid=40 |location= |publisher= Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania|website= www.shia-maktab.info |isbn= 9987620051|accessdate= 13 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on On 'Treatise of rights' that the word 'rights' is much better translated as duties, obligations or responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Aviny"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviny.com/Occasion/ahlebeit/imamsajjad/veladat/87/Resale_Hoghogh/Derangi_Resale.aspx|title=A halt on the Risalatul Huquq |author=Allameh Haji |author-link=:fa:علامه محمد ابراهیم کلباسی |language= Persian|date= |website=Aviny.com (quoted in hokoomatislamic.blogfa.com) |publisher= |accessdate= 13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of validity==
Risalah al-Huquq attributed to Imam [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Sajjad]] is mentioned in the following sources:
* Tuhaf al-Oqul by Hussayn ibn Shu'bah Harrani
* Al-Khisal by Shaykh Al-Suduq
* Al-Amali by Shaykh Al-Suduq
* Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih by Shaykh Al-Suduq
The author of Tuhaf al-Oqul mentioned it without a reference, while al-Suduq writes in his al-Khisal as such:
{{quote|Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Mousa, from Muhammad ibn abi Abdullah Kufi, from Jafar ibn Malek Fazie from Kheran ibn Dahir, from Ahmad ibn Ali Ibn Sulayman Jibili from his father,from muhammad ibn Ali from Muhammad ibn Fazil, from Abu Hamza al-Thumali.}}
This hadith is Mursal in Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih:
{{quote|Ismaaill ibn Fazl from [[Abu Hamza al-Thumali|Thabit ibn Dinar]] from [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Sayyid al-Abideen Ali ibn al-Hussayn]] ibn [[Ali|Ali ibn Abitalib]].}}
The Risalatul Huquq begins with "The greatest right of God..." in Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih and it does not include the introduction section in which the rights are explained in brief. The mentioned introduction exists in Tuhaf al-Oqul. Number of the rights which are discussed in both introduction section, and the detailed section (rest of the hadith which describes the rights in detail) of the hadith are 50 in Tuhaf al-Oqul while the author al-Khisal and Man La Yahdhuruhu Al-Faqih mentions 51 rights in the detailed section and an additional right called "right of [[Hajj]]" is noticeable. But there's no mention of "right of Hajj" in the introduction of the hadith in al-Khisal.&lt;ref name="Aviny" /&gt;

==Meaning of ''rights'' in Risalah al-Huquq==
''Huquq'' ({{lang-ar|حقوق}}) is plural of ''Haq'' ({{lang-ar|حق}}) and is best translated as "rights". However, other words such as justice, truth, obligations, duties, responsibilities have meanings closely related to ''Haq''. Based on On 'Treatise of rights' the word 'rights' is much better translated as duties, obligations or responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Aviny"/&gt;

==Hadith==
''Risalah al-Huquq'' consists of two Introduction and detailed sections although these titles are not mentioned in the hadith.

===Introduction===

The introduction section describes the rights briefly and begins with the following paragraph:

{{Quote|Know -God have mercy upon you - that God has rights incumbent upon you and that these encompass you in every motion through which you move, every rest which you take, every way station in which you reside, every limb which you employ, and every instrument which you use. Some of these rights are greater than others. And the greatest of God's rights incumbent upon you is what He has made incumbent upon you for Himself - the Blessed and the Exalted - from His rights: that which is the root of all rights from which others branch out. Then there are those that He has made incumbent upon you in yourself, from your crown to your foot, according to the diversity of your organs.}}

More in this section Imam Sajjad names the rights and briefly explains them.

;Conclusion By Imam Sajjad
:The concluding comments of Imam Sajjad at the end of the treatise is as follows:

{{Quote|''These are the fifty rights that surround you and you cannot evade under any circumstances. It is incumbent upon you to observe them and exert all efforts to fulfill them. You should seek God the Majestic’s help in this respect. And there is no power or strength but in God. And all praise is due to God the Lord of the Worlds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mashyekhi  |first= Ghodratullah |translator= Dr. Ali Peiravi |translator2= Lisa Zaynab Morgan|date= |title= A Divine Perspective on Rights; A commentary on Imam Sajjad's "The Treatise of Rights" by Imam 'Ali Ibn al-Husayn as-Sajjad (as)|url=http://www.al-islam.org/divine-perspective-on-rights-a-commentary-of-imam-sajjads-treatise-of-rights |location=Qum|publisher= Ansariyan Publications|page= |isbn= |accessdate= 14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1882">In [[property law]], the '''American rule''' of possession states that a [[landlord]] is obligated only to deliver legal possession, but not actual possession, of a leased premises to a tenant.  Thus, if a tenant arrives at a leased premises only to discover that it is still inhabited by a previous tenant who is holding over, or by squatters, it is the tenant who has standing to sue for eviction and/or damages, and not the landlord.  The tenant may not cancel the lease or refuse to pay rent due to the landlord for the time that the tenant is out of actual possession of the lease.  The American rule survives in only a minority of jurisdictions.

By contrast, the [[English rule (property)|English rule]] states that in such a scenario, the tenant may cancel the lease, obligating the landlord to deliver not only legal possession but also actual possession, and giving the landlord standing to sue the party in wrongful possession of the premises.

The nomenclature of the American rule runs contrary to the general tendency in property law, where American law evolved out of and in many instances diverged from English property law: the American rule is the original default rule, and the English rule, having been passed subsequently in England, began to be adopted by an increasing number of American jurisdictions following the ruling in ''[[Hannan v. Dusch]]'', 153 S.E. 824 (1930).

The order halted the longtime tradition of presenting visiting [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[tribal chief|chieftains]] with gifts, especially [[gunpowder]] and [[lead shot]]. While gift giving was generally acknowledged as a diplomatic gesture of goodwill, Amherst viewed it as "excessive coddling" which was financially costly to the British government. The decree initiated a period of increasing distrust between British and Native American tribes and is considered by historians as one of the factors leading to [[Pontiac's Rebellion]].

Amherst justified ending the tradition of giving goods and supplies to Indians in terms of defending His Majesty's interests. Indians would have to spend more time on supplying themselves, thus less time could be spent dissenting from British authority.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766|last = Anderson|first = Fred|publisher = Vintage|year = 2001|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 455}}&lt;/ref&gt; By strictly limiting Native American's access to ammunition, Amherst was protecting the British Army from Indian attack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The decree denied Native groups access to alcohol and limited the amount of gunpowder they could legally obtain. Amherst prohibited British traders from traveling to Native villages and prohibited them from charging excessive prices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Yet, this forced American Indians further out of their local communities due to the need to travel to British forts in order to conduct business necessary for their survival.  Due to the lack of transport accessible to Indians, only the fortunate had the horses necessary to transport goods to the British forts. The size of the horses limited the amount of goods Indians could carry to trade and the traders were further compounded by the restrictions on goods they could receive from the British traders.

==Background==

Indian diplomacy prior to 1761 consisted of peace ceremonies were central to the foundation and consolidation of alliances were the values of reciprocity and generosity. In the second half of the seventeenth century, an Anglo-Indian alliance between British settlers and the Iroquois tribe was consolidated in the Covenant Chain where every word of a proposition was validated by the offering of a gift, during this period it was often wampum deemed highly sacred.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Facing East From Indian Country|last = Richter|first = Daniel|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Massachusetts|pages = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition upheld by the Indians' recently defeated allies, the French.  Yet Amherst declared, "It is not by intention… ever to attempt to gain the friendship of Indians by presents."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Indians in American History: An Introduction|last = Hoxie|first = Frederick|publisher = Harlan Davidson|year = 1988|isbn = |location = Arlington Heights, Illinois|pages = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amherst had removed the grounds that Anglo- Indian forces had established peace.

==Outcomes==

Amherst's policy of restricting the trading of ammunition to Indians made it increasingly difficult for Indians to obtain deerskins that were central to their trade, and thus their economy and livelihood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tribesmen were forced to revert to bow and arrows, in which their skill of precision had been lost by many years of adaptation to European alternatives, particularly gunpowder. Famine spread, intensified by crop failures and smallpox epidemics throughout he pays d'en haut and the Ohio Country in 1762.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some survivors travelled to English forts in hope of food, some having already resorted to eating their children.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mohawk Baronet: A Biography of Sir William Johnson|last = Flexner|first = James Thomas|publisher = Syracuse University Press|year = 2015|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir William Johnson, Northern Indian superintendent, complained that at Montreal tribes had received less winter gifts than the amount the French gave four families.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

With tribesmen unable to provide for their families and the removal of alcohol that was so central to Indian social life, Amherst's policies managed to inadvertently create a band of sober enemies, united with a common grievance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticisms==

One of Amherst's most outspoken critics to his policies came from his contemporary, [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson]]. Named Warraghiyagey (translated as "A Man who undertakes great Things") by the Mohawk tribe in 1742 and later esteemed with the title "sachem," Johnson was both respected and experienced in Indian diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = White Savage: William Johnson and the Invention of America|last = O'Toole|first = Fintan|publisher = Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been appointed Commissary of Indian Affairs in 1746 after being noted for his close ties with the Six Nations, his success led him to being appointed as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1755.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.earlyamerica.com/early-america-review/volume-1/sir-william-johnson-indian-superintendent-colonial/|title = The Role of Sir William Johnson In the Colonial Development of America and His Involvement in the Expansionist Policies of the British Imperial Government|date = |accessdate = November 30, 2015|website = Archiving Early America|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albany Congress in 1754 proved that Johnson was indispensable when dealing with Indian affairs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sir William Johnson: Interpreter of the Iroquois|last = Hamilton|first = Milton|date = 1963|journal = Ethnohistory|doi = 10.2307/480696|volume=10|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir William Johnson's success was founded in his adoption and respect for Indian treaty traditions. In a conference in Albany in 1746, Johnson even wore the same apparel and paint as an Indian War-Captain.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As the principal negotiator in Indian treaties and publicly esteemed as the leading individual in Indian relations, he vehemently warned Amherst of the dangers of removing the process of gift giving from negotiations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Johnson predicted that an Indian war would be inevitable; in 1763, Indian's in the Great Lakes Region were driven by their discontent with Amherst's post-war Indian policies to take part in Pontiac's Rebellion.

==Historians' perspectives==

[[Fred Anderson (historian)|Fred Anderson]] argues that Amherst's principle aim behind the decree was to impose order on North America, thus a rational objective for any professional soldier rather than it being a capricious act of cruelty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, Mark Danley identifies Amherst's lack of understanding of the culture and customs of Native Americans was a central cause of his order.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607-1890: A Political, Social, and Military History|last = Tucker|first = Spencer C.|publisher = ABC CLIO|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Santa Barbara|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Danley also criticizes Amherst's arrogance in dismissing the warnings of his colleagues, who, experienced in the practices of Native diplomacy, warned that the decree would inevitably lead to war.

Likewise, [[Francis Jennings]] identifies Amherst's decree as signaling the inverse relationship between his increasing glory from successes in the Seven Years' War with a decline in his use of logic and cautiousness. While trying to save money by forbidding the practice of giving peace offerings, Amherst aimed to make Indians subsist primarily on hunting, an illogical aim given the control he simultaneously placed on ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Empire Of Fortune: Crowns, Colonies &amp; Tribes in the Seven Years War in America|last = Jennings|first = Francis|publisher = W.W. Norton and Company|year = 1988|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Dubrulle argues that rather than a mere oversight of the complexities of Indian relationships and traditions, Amherst was uninterested in who the Native Americans were; he was only interested in who they could become. To Dubrulle, Amherst's decree aimed at transforming American Indians into clones of the hardworking British public.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The '''Articles for the Government of the United States Navy''' were the [[Military justice|military laws]] of the [[United States Navy]] for much of its early history.  The Articles were often referred to informally as '''"Rocks and Shoals"''', after the language of Article 4, Section 10:

{{Pull quote|The punishment of death, or such other punishment as a court martial may adjudge, may be inflicted on any person in the naval service...[who] intentionally or willfully suffers any vessel of the Navy to be stranded, ''or run upon rocks or shoals'', or improperly hazarded or maliciously or willfully injures any vessel of the Navy, or any part of her tackle, armament, or equipment, whereby the safety the vessel is hazarded or the lives of the crew exposed to danger.}}

The Articles were replaced by the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] in 1951.

==In popular culture==
Rocks and Shoals plays a major part in the first quarter of the [[Tom Clancy]] novel ''[[Clear and Present Danger]]'', when the captain of a [[U.S. Coast Guard]] [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] decides to try a pair of [[pirate]]s under its rules for [[rape]] and [[murder]].

'''Artists Rights Society''' (ARS) is a copyright, licensing, and monitoring organization for visual artists in the United States. Founded in 1987, ARS is a member of the [[ International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers]] and as such represents in the United States the intellectual property rights interests of over 60,000 visual artists and estates of visual artists from around the world (painters, sculptors, photographers, architects and others).

== Represented artists and estates ==
The long list of the artists represented by ARS includes such names as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henry Darger]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[René Magritte]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Man Ray]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Frida Kahlo]], among many others.&lt;ref name="list1"&gt;[http://www.arsny.com/new-page-3/ "Most Frequently Requested ARS Member Artists"]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to estates, ARS represents many living artists, including [[Damien Hirst]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Dorothea Rockburne]], [[Mark Tobey]], and [[Bruce Nauman]], among others.&lt;ref name="list2"&gt;[https://www.arsny.com/searchartists// "Browse Complete List of ARS Member Artists"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infringement and advocacy ==
In 2002 and 2006, ARS asked [[Google]] to remove customised versions of its logo put up to commemorate artists [[Salvador Dalí]] and Joan Miró, alleging that portions of specific artworks under their protection had been used in the logos, and that they were utilized without permission. According to Theodore Feder, president of ARS, "there are underlying copyrights to the works of Miró, and they are putting it up without having the rights."&lt;ref name="miro"&gt;[http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2006/04/20/google_takes_down_miro_image.html "Google takes down Miro image." ''Silicon Beat'' April 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Google complied with the request, but denied that there was any violation of copyright. 

Since 2008, ARS and Google have worked together to produce customized versions of Google's logo{{cn|date=February 2015}} to commemorate ARS member artists, Marc Chagall (2008), René Magritte (2008) and Jackson Pollock (2009). &lt;ref name="chagall"&gt;[https://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html Google.com: More Google Logos]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In June 2008, ARS president Theodore Feder, with artist [[Frank Stella]], wrote an Op-Ed for ''The Art Newspaper'' decrying a proposed U.S. [[orphan works]] law. &lt;ref name="artnews"&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article.asp?id=8580 ''The Art Newspaper'' "The proposed new law is a nightmare for artists" by Frank Stella. June 6, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, ARS worked with the Illustrator's Partnership of America (IPA) and the Advertising Photographers of America (APA) to submit to congress a document titled, "Suggested Amendments to H.R. 5889: Orphan Works Act of 2008."&lt;ref name="ipa1"&gt;[http://ipaorphanworks.blogspot.com/2008/07/hr-5889-amendments.html Illustrators' Partnership Orphan Works Blog: "H.R. 5889 Amendments" June 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The document outlined 12 amendments which the ARS, IPA and APA believe will decrease the potential negative impact of the [[Orphan Works]] Act and discourage "wide-scale infringements of visual art while depriving creators of protections currently available under the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]."&lt;ref name="ipa2"&gt;[http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/home/ Orphan Works Legislative Action Center]&lt;/ref&gt; ARS has joined over 60 other art licensing businesses (including the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]], [[Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators]] and the [[Stock Artists Alliance]], among others) in opposing both The Orphan Works Act of 2008 and The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASIP Home|url = http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11320236|website = capwiz.com|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipa2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4995">The '''California Court Case Management System''' ('''CCMS''') is the [[court case]] management system intended for use by the several courts of the [[judiciary of California]], which includes the [[Supreme Court of California|Supreme Court]], 6 [[California Courts of Appeal|Courts of Appeal]], and 58 [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Courts]].

==Fees==
{{POV-section|date=April 2017}}
Pursuant to California Rule of Court 2.506 and Government Code Section 68150(h), courts may impose fees for the costs of providing access to its electronic records.

Several superior courts do so, including Alameda, Los Angeles, Riverside, Sacramento, and San Diego, and the fees have been criticized by Thomas Peele as exorbitant and extraordinarily high, with the Alameda County Superior Court fees being the subject of a [[MoveOn.org]] petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thomas Peele: Alameda Superior Court fees block public access|first=Thomas|last=Peele|date=25 July 2014|work=[[Contra Costa Times]]|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_26212372/thomas-peele-alameda-superior-court-fees-block-public}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask the Alameda County Superior Court to Reduce its Exorbitant Online Search Costs|work=[[MoveOn.org]]|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Five Superior Courts—in Orange, Sacramento, San Diego, San Joaquin, and Ventura Counties—use CCMS version 3 to process civil cases. This represents approximately 25 percent of the civil case volume in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Check: Whatever Happened to CCMS|publisher=California Courts website|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/21775.htm|access-date=2014-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415232813/http://www.courts.ca.gov/21775.htm#|archive-date=2014-04-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresno is the only Superior Court still using version 2 of CCMS. In August 2013, the Judicial Council approved funding for a system that will replace CCMS version 2 in Fresno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Allocates $92 Million of Trial Court Special Funds| publisher=California Courts website | date=23 August 2013 | url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/23321.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2002, the [[California Administrative Office of the Courts]] (AOC) started the Second-Generation Electronic Filing Specification (2GEFS) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Open-Source System for Electronic Court Filing|first=Jim|last=Beard|date=1 June 2004|work=[[Linux Journal]]|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a $200,000 consultant's report declared the project ready for a final push, the [[Judicial Council of California]] scrapped the program in 2012 after $500 million in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=California abandons $2 billion court management system|first=Michael|last=Krigsman|date=2 April 2012|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=17 December 2012|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/projectfailures/california-abandons-2-billion-court-management-system/15363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical==
The 2GEFS Court Filing 2.0 specification was based on experiences with the [[Legal XML]] Court Filing 1.0 (before it became [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] Legal XML).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2GEFS Lessons Learned Document|first=Winchel|last=Vincent III|publisher=xmlLegal|date=16 November 2004|url=http://www.e-court-filing.org/Documents/Library02/2GEFS/2GEFSLessonsLearned_Ver1_0_2004_11_16.pdf|access-date=2013-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827005129/http://www.e-court-filing.org/Documents/Library02/2GEFS/2GEFSLessonsLearned_Ver1_0_2004_11_16.pdf#|archive-date=2013-08-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 8th edition (2004: 225) reads "an outlawed felon considered [[Outcast (person)|a pariah]] – [[Lone_wolf_(trait)#Person|a lone wolf]] – open to attack by anyone." A person designated a ''caput lupinum'' was a [[criminal]] whose rights had been waived. As such, he or she could be legally harmed by any [[citizen]].

In [[international law]], '''consularization''' is the act of [[authentication|authenticating]] any legal document by the [[consul (representative)|consul]] office, by the consul signing and affixing a red ribbon to the document. International trade shipments often require consular invoices and other documents that may need to be consularized include travel documents (such as a parental consent letter for persons under 18 traveling without a parent), [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]], and [[Power of attorney|powers of attorney]].

==Consular invoices==
A consular invoice is  a document, often in triplicate, submitted to the consul or embassy of a country to which goods are to be exported before the goods are sent abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelman, Edward G. (2006) ''Dictionary of international trade''. 7th edn. Petaluma, Calif. World Trade Press, p. 41. {{ISBN|1885073739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed documents then travel with the goods and enable the customs officials in the destination country to verify the quantity, value and nature of the goods on arrival. A fee may be charged by the consulate for the checking and approval of the documents.

At the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] round in 1952, it was proposed that consularization of commercial invoices be abolished. In 2005, the United States and Uganda submitted a proposal to the [[World Trade Organization]] to abolish consularization.

Alternative terms include ''konsularfaktura'' (German), ''facture consulaire'' (French), ''factura consular'' (Spanish), ''fattura consolare'' (Italian) and ''fatura consular'' (Portuguese Br.).&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelman, pp. 676-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''contribution claim''' is a [[Cause of action|claim]] brought by one or more [[defendant]]s to a [[lawsuit]] for money damages brought by a [[plaintiff]].  A contribution claim asserts the party (usually a [[defendant]]) is entitled to "contribution" from a third party for any money damages awarded to the plaintiff.

For example, if a plaintiff sues a [[homeowner]] for [[damages]] caused by a garage door, the defendant homeowner could add a third party, the [[manufacturer]] of the garage door to contribute to any damages awarded to the plaintiff according to the proportionate share of responsibility, [[legal liability|liability]], or fault assigned to the homeowner and the manufacturer by the [[jury]].

In most cases, contribution claims are brought like the original lawsuit itself.  The claim must be personally served on the new, third party defendant, by the third party plaintiff (the defendant bringing the claim for contribution [[relief]]).  In contrast, a [[counter-claim]] asserts that the party (usually a defendant) is entitled to offset the damages awarded to plaintiff by the proportionate share of any responsibility, liability, or fault assigned to the plaintiff by the jury.  Finally, a [[cross-claim]] is the same as a counter-claim or contribution claim, except that it is asserted by a defendant against other defendants.  Counter-claims and cross claims do not require [[service of process|personal service]] because no new parties are being added to the lawsuit.

In some [[United States|state]] [[court systems]], a contribution claim must be opened as a new case, and thus the defendant must pay for a [[Court costs|filing fee]], [[Docket (court)|docket]] number, or [[index number]].  In other states, however, no additional fee is required.

Exceptions to the ban were allowed for [[police officer]]s and guns registered before 1976.

{{Politics of Indonesia}}
The '''General Elections Commission''' ({{lang-id|Komisi Pemilihan Umum}}, abbreviated as '''KPU''') is the body that organises elections in Indonesia. Its responsibilities include deciding which parties can contest elections, organising the voting and announcing the results and seats won in the various branches of the government.

==History==
Following the [[Fall of Suharto|fall of President Suharto]] and the end of Indonesia's authoritarian [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]], as a result of public pressure, [[B. J. Habibie|President Habibie]] brought forward the general elections planned for 2002 to 1999. On 1 February the [[People's Representative Council]] passed Law No.3/1999 on the General Election, which mandated the establishment of a "free and independent General Elections Commission comprising members of political parties and the government" to oversee the elections. The commission was then established with 53 members and former home affairs minister Rudini as chair. As a result of further public pressure, the government appointed five independent people as its representatives, including noted human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution. Other independent members included former [[Supreme Court of Indonesia|Supreme Court]] judge Adi Andojo Soetjipto and political commentator  Andi Mallarangeng. The [[Indonesian legislative election, 1999|1999 elections]] were held on 7 June, and were a success thanks to the management of the KPU, although 27 of the 48 parties contesting the election (all but one of which won less than 0.7% of the vote) refused to sign the KPU document reporting the results. The KPU passed the problem on to President Habibie, who declared the results valid on 26 July.&lt;ref name="PUSPOYO282286"&gt;Puspoyo (2012) pp 282-296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABDULLAH537"&gt;Abdullah (2009) p537&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MANNINGVD1835"&gt;Manning &amp; van Dierman (2000) p18 &amp; p35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KPUwebsite1"&gt;KPU website: Profile of Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

The second incarnation of the KPU was established on 11 April 2001 to organise the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2004|2004 elections]], but this time was made up of individuals from academia and NGOs. In 2007 the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) passed Law No. 22/2007, which stipulated that members of the KPU serve a five-year term. It also stated that members of the KPU would be chosen by a selection committee that together with the president would put forward a list of names to the DPR, which would conduct a fit and proper test. As a result of this process, which lasted from 21 to 30 August 2007, the initial 45 candidates were whittled down to 21, and a vote was taken by the DPR to decide on the final membership. The seven people chosen for the 2007–2012 term KPU were members of regional KPUs, academics, researchers and bureaucrats:
* Abdul Hafiz Anshary
* Sri Nuryanti
* Endang Sulastri 
* I Gusti Putu Artha
* Syamsul Bahri
* Andi Nurpati
* Abdul Aziz
These members, minus Syamsul Bahri, who was facing legal problems, were appointed on 23 October 2007. Andi Nurpati left the KPU in 2010 since her entry to the then-ruling [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]], and was replaced by Saut Hamonangan Sirait.&lt;ref name="KPUwebsite1"/&gt;

==Seat of the General Elections Commission==
The Indonesian General Elections Commission is located in a building at Jalan Imam Bonjol 29. The building, designed by architect [[A.W. Gmelig Meyling]], was completed in 1955 and was among the first to be built in the post-war architecture style in Indonesia. It was described as ''"impressive"'' at its completion. The building was originally used for the Pusat Perkebunan Negara (Ministry of Agriculture) office.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=47}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the plan, the German government offers an average increase of 2.1%/year in macroeconomic energy productivity from 2008 to 2020.{{efn|For the purposes of the Nation Action Plan on Energy Efficiency, the period is specified as 2008–2020.

== Targets ==

The German government target under the National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency is specified in terms of energy [[productivity]] relative to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).  Under the plan, the German government offers an average annual increase of 2.1% in macroeconomic energy productivity from 2008 to 2020.&lt;ref name="nape-2014"/&gt;{{rp|7}}  Assuming an annual increase in GDP of 1.1%, this represents a reduction in the energy-related share of primary
energy consumption (in [[Tonne of oil equivalent|million tonnes crude oil equivalent]]) from {{convert|314.3|Mtoe|EJ|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} in 2008 to {{convert|276.6|Mtoe|EJ|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} in 2020.  And corresponds to a reduction in final energy consumption from {{convert|220.7|Mtoe|EJ|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} in 2008 to {{convert|194.3|Mtoe|EJ|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} in 2020.  These projections are covered by a caveat on economic and physical influences beyond the control of the government.&lt;ref name="nape-2014"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

This macroeconomic target is concurrent with other official energy efficiency and consumption targets not included in the National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency, in particular that of reducing [[primary energy]] consumption from 2008 levels by 20% in 2020 and by 50% in 2050.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015"&gt;

== Policy and monitoring ==

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency.  The policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures.  The central short-term measures of NAPE include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency, the raising of funding for building renovation, the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector, and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry.  German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.&lt;ref name="nape-site"&gt;{{cite web

The government's ''Fourth Energy Transition Monitoring Report'', published in 2015, briefly reviews the National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015"/&gt;{{rp|8–13}}

Government progress on its energy efficiency targets under NAPE and elsewhere (and on the ''[[Energiewende]]'' more generally) is subject to external review.  The 2015 review found energy efficiency developments in electricity and space heating were roughly on track, although developments in transport were not.  But because the various instruments introduced specifically under NAPE were still in planning, testing, or early introduction, the review panel was unable to analyse their effectiveness.  These instruments will be covered in future reviews.&lt;ref name="loeschel-etal-2015"&gt;

The 2016 annual report on NAPE, submitted to the EU on 28 April 2016, presented the major legislative and non-legislative energy efficiency measures adopted in the previous year.  These include the Energy Efficiency Network Initiative aimed at companies, new obligations on non-[[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]] to carry out regular [[energy audit]]s, increased funding for energy efficient commercial renovation and new-build, and a new Energy Efficiency Strategy for Buildings (ESG) that may result in an "almost climate-neutral building stock".&lt;ref name="annual-report-2016"/&gt;{{rp|3}}  In addition, the government is in the process of developing a scheme to promote heating optimization, an energy efficiency program for waste heat, programs to increase the energy efficiency in municipalities, and measures to improve the use of energy in [[rail transport]].  The report also noted that final energy consumption in the transport sector rose by 3.9{{nbsp}}PJ between 2013 and 2014, as a result of the increase in passenger-kilometres by around 2.0% and tonne-kilometres by around 1.3%, despite improvements in the final energy consumption per kilometre.&lt;ref name="annual-report-2016"&gt;

{{Property law}}

A '''gift''', in the [[law]] of [[property]], is the voluntary transfer of property from one person (the [[donor]] or grantor) to another (the donee or grantee) without full valuable [[consideration]]. In order for a [[gift]] to be legally effective, three requirements must be met:
# Intention of donor to give the gift to the donee (''donative intent'')
# Delivery of gift to donee.
# Acceptance of gift by donee.

==Elements==
===Intention===
{{Original research|section|date=June 2012|reson=unless referenced}}
The donor of the gift must have a present intent to make a gift of the property to the donee. A promise to make a gift in the future is unenforceable, and legally meaningless, even if the promise is accompanied by a present transfer of the physical property in question.

Suppose, for example, that a man gives a woman a ring and tells her that it is for her next birthday and to hold on to it until then. The man has not made a gift, and could legally demand the ring back at any time before the woman's birthday. In contrast, suppose a man gives a woman a deed and tells her it will be in her best interest if the deed stays in his safe-deposit box. The man has made a gift and would be unable to legally reclaim it.

===Delivery===
The gift must be delivered to the donee.&lt;ref&gt;For effective delivery of gift in Australia see: {{cite AustLII|NSWSC|78|1995|litigants=Horsley v Phillips Fine Art Auctioneers Pty Ltd |date=16 October 1995 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the gift is of a type that cannot be delivered in the conventional sense - a house, or a bank account - the delivery can be effected by a ''constructive delivery'', wherein a tangible item allowing access to the gift - a [[deed]] or [[key (lock)|key]] to the house, a passbook for the bank account - is delivered instead. ''Symbolic delivery'' is also sometimes permissible where manual delivery is impractical, such as the delivery of a key that does not open anything, but is intended to symbolize the transfer of ownership.

Certain forms of property must be transferred following particular formalities described by statute law. In [[England]], [[real property]] must be transferred by a written deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type=act |year=1925 |chapter=20 |act=Law of Property Act}} s.52&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of [[equitable interest]]s must be performed in writing by the owner or their agent.

A gift is assumed when property owner deeds real estate as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. Regardless of contribution to purchase price, such a deed guaranteees each tenant equal shares upon sale or partition of the property.

===Acceptance===
The donee must accept the gift in order for the property transfer to take place. However, because people generally accept gifts, acceptance will be presumed, so long as the donee does not expressly reject the gift. A rejection of the gift destroys the gift, so that a donee cannot revive a once-rejected gift by later accepting it. In order for such an acceptance to be effective, the donor would have to extend the offer of the gift again.

==Types==
Gifts can be either:

===''inter vivos''===
* lifetime gifts (''inter vivos'' gift, ''donatio inter vivos'') - a gift of a present or future interest made and delivered in the donor's lifetime; or

===''causa mortis''===

* deathbed gifts (gift ''causa mortis'', ''donatio mortis causa'') - a future gift made in expectation of the donor's imminent death. A gift ''causa mortis'' is not effective unless the donor dies of the impending peril that he or she had contemplated when making the gift, i.e. these gifts can only be made when the donor is in a terminal condition.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Donatio Mortis Causa |volume=8 |page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifts can also be:
===outright===
* outright - made free of any restrictions, such as being subject to a trust;
===onerous===
* onerous - made with a burden or obligation imposed on the donee; or
===remunerative===
* remunerative - made to compensate for services rendered

==Revocation==
Conditional gifts can be revoked based on (1) donee not fulfilling the conditions (2) breach of contract by donor such as an engagement ring and in this case, the donee keeps the gift.
{{Empty section|date=August 2012}}

==Taxation==

=== In India===
In India, previously there was Gift Tax Act under which donor had to pay the gift tax on the amount of gift. However, the said Act has been abolished and from FY 2004-05, a new provision was inserted in the Income Tax Act (1961) under section 56 (2) which provides that if the gift is received by an individual or Hindu undivided family from any relatives or blood relatives or at the time of marriage or as inheritance or in contemplation of death, it will not be taxable. In all other cases if the aggregagte of gifts received exceeds Rs 50,000 in a year, the gift will be taxable as income from other source.

===United Kingdom===
{{Expand section|date=June 2012}}
Gifts into a trust above a certain value (known as the nil rate band which is currently £325,000 but this limit may be reduced by certain gifts made in the last 7 years) are generally subject to inheritance tax in the United Kingdom though at the reduced rate of inheritance tax of 20% rather than the full rate of 40%.  There are certain reliefs that may apply to reduce or eliminate the IHT due including [[business property relief]] and [[agricultural property relief]]. Gifts to individuals are generally not subject to inheritance tax unless the donor dies within 7 years of the date of the gift.  There is anti-avoidance legislation to prevent assets being gifted but with the donor retaining a benefit from the asset (for example the gift of the main residence while continuing to live in it will be ineffective from an IHT perspective unless market value rent is charged). Gifts in life may be a way to circumvent [[inheritance tax]] on death.

The United States '''Gold Reserve Act''' of January 30, 1934 required that all [[gold]] and [[gold certificate]]s held by the [[Federal Reserve]] be surrendered and vested in the sole title of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fame.org/pdf/White%20House%20Statement%20on%20Proclamation%202072.pdf |title=White House Statement on Proclamation 2072 - Franklin D. Roosevelt |date=January 31, 1934 |publisher=FAME - Foundation for the Advancement of Monetary Education |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426013733/http://www.fame.org/pdf/White%20House%20Statement%20on%20Proclamation%202072.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ355/choi/1934jan30.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gold Reserve Act outlawed most private possession of gold, forcing individuals to sell it to the Treasury, after which it was stored in [[United States Bullion Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]] and other locations. The act also changed the nominal price of gold from $20.67 per [[troy ounce]] to $35. This price change incentivized foreign investors to export their gold to the United States, while simultaneously devaluing the U.S. dollar in an attempt to spark inflation. The increase in gold reserves due to the price change as well as the confiscation clause resulted in a large accumulation of gold in the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury. The increase in the [[money supply]] lowered real interest rates which increased investment in durable goods.

A year earlier, in 1933, [[Executive Order 6102]] had made it a criminal offense for U.S. citizens to own or trade gold anywhere in the world, with exceptions for some jewelry and collector's coins. These prohibitions were relaxed starting in 1964 – gold certificates were again allowed for private investors on April 24, 1964, although the obligation to pay the certificate holder on demand in gold specie would not be honored. By 1975 Americans could again freely own and trade gold.

The Gold Reserve Act authorized the [[Exchange Stabilization Fund]] to use such assets as were not needed for exchange market stabilization to deal in [[government securities]].

==U.S. economic historical narrative==
[[File:Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs Gold Bill 1934.jpg|right|thumb|300px|President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] signs the bill into law in 1934.]]

The United States was still suffering the negative effects of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] in 1934 when the Gold Reserve Act was enacted. President Roosevelt was challenged with decreasing [[unemployment]], raising wages and increasing the money supply, but was restricted by United States' strict adherence to the gold standard.&lt;ref name=GREEN&gt;[http://famguardian.org/Subjects/MoneyBanking/FederalReserve/CentralBankGoldReserves.pdf Central Bank Gold Reserves]&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold Reserve Act, which banned the export of gold, restricted the ownership of gold and halted the convertibility of gold into [[paper money]] helped him overcome this obstacle.&lt;ref name=GREEN/&gt; This act ratified the previous [[Executive Order 6102]] which required almost all gold to be exchanged for paper currency.

The Gold Reserve Act also revalued the price of gold to $35 per troy ounce. As a result, the Gold Reserve Act, an act of [[monetary policy]], drastically increased the growth rate of the [[Gross National Product]] (GNP) from 1933 to 1941. Between 1933 and 1937 the GNP in the United States grew at an average rate of over 8 percent.&lt;ref name=ROM&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4155464&amp;fileId=S002205070001189X What ended the great depression?] Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  This growth in real output is due primarily to a growth in the money supply M1, which grew at an average rate of 10 percent per year between 1933 and 1937.&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt;  Traditional beliefs about the recovery from the Great Depression hold that the growth was due to [[fiscal policy]] and the United States' participation in [[World War II]]. Friedman and Schwartz stated that the "rapid rate [of growth of the money stock] in three successive years from June 1933 to June 1936 ... was a consequence of the gold inflow produced by the revaluation of gold plus the flight of capital to the United States".&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt; Treasury holdings of gold in the US tripled from 6,358 in 1930 to 8,998 in 1935 (after the Act) then to 19,543 metric tonnes of fine gold by 1940.&lt;ref name=GREEN/&gt;

The revaluation of gold referenced was an active policy decision made by the Roosevelt administration in order to devalue the dollar.&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt; The largest inflow of gold during this period was in direct response to the revaluation of gold.&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt; An increase in M1, which is a result of an inflow of gold, would also lower real interest rates, thus stimulating the purchases of durable consumer goods by reducing the opportunity cost of spending.&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt; If the Gold Reserve Act had not been enacted, and money supply had followed its historical trend, then real GNP would have been approximately 25 percent lower in 1937 and 50 percent lower in 1942.&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt;

==International economic historical narrative==

The [[international community]] during the depression began to shift much of its gold reserves to the United States. Foreign investors clamored over the $15 increase in value from $20.67 to $35 per troy ounce, and exported their gold to the United States in record amounts causing U.S. treasury holdings to increase. This data shows two important aspects that involved gold in the early 20th century. The first was the massive expansion of gold as a currency across the globe. This data also demonstrates the rapid increase of gold reserves to the US. Even in 1900 the U.S. only held 602 tonnes of gold in reserve. This was 61 [[tonne]]s less than Russia and only 57 tonnes more than France.&lt;ref name=GREEN/&gt;

Over the next 20 years the countries' reserves grew as the amount of gold in the market increased and as normal trading occurred. However, in the 1930s there was a sudden shift up in reserves in the U.S. From 1930 to 1940, treasury holdings had tripled, mostly due to foreign investing. Another reason behind the shift of reserves to the US was the suspension of the [[gold standard]] in Britain on September 21, 1931. Gold reserves in the [[Bank of England]] also grew over ten times from 1930 to 1940, but it was still less than the amount the U.S. had. The [[Bank of France]] also saw over 200 tonnes of gold get transferred to New York following the raising of prices in America.&lt;ref name=GREEN/&gt;

===Foreign gold holdings affected===

{{Section OR|date=December 2014}}

Although hard to find and interpret the raw data, according to data collected by [[Goldsmith]] in their 1955 report, somewhere between 2 and 3.2 billion dollars' worth of imported [[gold stock]] was being held. At 20 dollars an ounce, that would represent between 100 and 160 million ounces of gold, which would be worth between 125 and 200 billion dollars today at $1250/ oz, which was about half of the gold held by the U.S. treasury at the time. When the price changed, it would take $35 instead of $20 for foreign countries to buy back their gold. This implies a loss of 41% of their invested gold stock. This would be between 41 and 65 billion dollars' worth of gold (in today's money) or 800+ million dollars in 1934 dollars. But, this change did incentivize transferring additional gold to the U.S., at the higher price.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nber.org/databases/jones-obstfeld/text/usa_curr_ac.txt The National Bureau of Economic Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth transferred compared to the US economy===

{{Section OR|date=December 2014}}

There are multiple ways to illustrate how much the money was transferred by the Act compared to the [[GDP]]. The [[Real GDP]] in 1934 was $860 billion. (0.86 trillion in chained 2009 dollars inflation adjusted).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multpl.com/us-gdp-inflation-adjusted/table US Real GDP by Year&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of wealth taken by the price change of gold (125+ billion in today's dollars) to GDP of 1934 ($860 billion in 2009 dollars) is 14.5%. To compare that ratio to today's U.S. GDP of $15.7 trillion, 14.5% would be about 2.3 trillion dollars today. The nominal GDP of 1934 was $66.8 billion. The $800+ million of wealth (in 1934 dollars) transferred would only be 1.2% of the GDP, if we use 1934 dollars. 1.2% of 2012's GDP would be about $190 billion today.&lt;ref&gt;http://useconomy.about.com/od/GDP-by-Year/a/US-GDP-History.htm U.S. GDP by Year&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of the FRS and Treasury==

[[Gove Griffith Johnson]], an economist and author said: "One may be skeptical of the wisdom with which [[monetary instruments]] will be used, but the possibility of abuse extends throughout the whole sphere of governmental activity and is a risk which must be assumed under a democratic or any other form of government."&lt;ref name=THOR&gt;http://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=165 Gold Policy in the 1930s by Mark Thornton&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Gold Reserve Act 1934, the Federal Reserve System was in trouble as the Great Depression had swept over the country and people looked to the Fed for solutions. Some people{{who|date=December 2014}} claim that "[[market failure]]" was not the cause of this trouble. Instead, they place the blame for the years of the Great Contraction (from 1929 to 1933) on the mismanagement of the monetary policy by the [[central bank]]. That explains why Congress handed over the Federal Reserve's powers to the Treasury. Johnson explains that the Treasury's gold policy "was an essential instrument for producing desired political aims".&lt;ref name=THOR/&gt; In other words, the Federal Reserve System had served more as a "technical instrument for effecting the Treasury’s policies", according to Johnson.

Roosevelt justified Gold Reserve Act 1934 by saying that "Since there was not enough gold to pay all holders of gold obligations, ... the federal government should expropriate and keep all of the gold."&lt;ref name=THOR/&gt;

Since the [[Central Banking Act of 1935]], the [[Federal Open Market Committee]] (FOMC) has authorized the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] to purchase and/or sell U.S. government securities in the open market in order to determine the stock of money in the U.S. The Fed Board also gained its power over member bank reserve requirements as a result. Since the FOMC was determining the quantity of money in circulation, the quantity of gold in the system did not affect the stock of money in the U.S. economy. Due to the Banking Act, the secretary of the Treasury was no longer the Fed's Board of Governors. However, being a chairman gave the secretary enough power to influence the Fed.&lt;ref name=THOR/&gt;

Treasury managers wished to halt monetary expansion in 1936 by stagnating gold and increasing reserve requirements. For all intents and purposes, this led to a freeze of the monetary system and U.S. economy. The Treasury began its own gold sterilization policy in order to stop inflation from potentially increasing due to an increase in inflow of gold into the U.S. soon after the Fed enacted the same policy. Gold holdings more than doubled in the period of 1935 to 1940.&lt;ref name=GREEN/&gt; This lasted for 16 months from 1936 to 1938. In more efforts, as of the end of 1936, the Treasury noted its gold purchases as part of "inactive" account. In other words, the Treasury met the price of gold through sales of government securities in financial markets in order to keep the pile of gold high but they would not be converted into currency in the Treasury.&lt;ref name=THOR/&gt;

===Effect on inflation/deflation===

After the act of 1934, [[deflation]], which would sometimes be a great as −10.5% in the bust of 1921 (which was preceded by over 14% inflation for 4 consecutive years immediately prior to 1921), would never again drop below −2.1%. Before 1934, from 1914 to 1934, [[inflation]] was a (geometric) average of 1.37% per year. After 1934, from 1934 until 2013, inflation was a (geometric) average of 3.67% per year. Inflation was more stabilized, but still higher than the previous period. This may be due to leaving the gold standard, over time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/ US inflation calculator&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation arising from GRA===

The passage of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 signified that the American people could no longer hold gold, with the exception of jewelry and collectors' coins. After the passage of the Gold Reserve Act several people were indicted for violating the clauses that restricted gold ownership and trade. Frederick Barber Campbell (who was actually convicted under the Gold Reserve Act's predecessor, Executive Order 6102), was convicted of hoarding gold when he tried to withdraw 5,000 troy ounces of gold he had at [[Chase National Bank]]. Gus Farber, a diamond and jewelry merchant was arrested with his father and 12 others for illegally selling $20 gold coins without a license. The Baraban family was arrested for operating a gold scrap business under a false license. Foreign companies even had their gold confiscated. The [[Uebersee Finanz-Korporation]], a Swiss banking company, had $1,250,000 in gold coins that were being held in the United States.

In the Consolidated [[Gold Clause Cases]] (independently known as ''Perry v. U.S.'', ''U.S. v. Bankers Trust Co.'', ''Norman v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.'', ''Nortz v. U.S.''), the Gold Reserve Act was subject to scrutiny by the United States Supreme Court, which narrowly upheld Roosevelt's gold confiscation policy.

==Recent events==

The 2008 decision ''216 Jamaica Avenue, LLC vs S&amp;R Playhouse Realty Co.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0322p-06.pdf|title=216 Jamaica Avenue, LLC vs S&amp;R Playhouse Realty Co.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; established that a gold clause in contracts signed before 1933 was only suspended, not erased, and under certain limited circumstances might be reactivated.

The '''Grenada 17''' are the seventeen political, military and civilian figures who were convicted of various crimes associated with the overthrow of the [[Maurice Bishop]]'s [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|government]] of [[Grenada]] in 1983 and his subsequent murder.

==History==
In October 1983, various officials of the people's revolutionary government (PRG) of Grenada under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] deposed and put under house arrest Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]]. Large public demonstrations followed all over the country. On 19 October 1983, a large demonstration at the Prime Minister's residence led to Bishop being freed. Bishop then went with a large group to army headquarters at Fort Rupert. Later in the day, an army unit arrived from Fort Frederick and a large number of civilians at the fort subsequently died.  

After the fighting, eight persons were lined up facing a courtyard wall at the fort. They were subsequently killed. The dead consisted of:

*Prime Minister Maurice Bishop
*Foreign Minister Unison Whiteman
*Minister of Housing Norris Bain
*President of the Agricultural and General Workers Union Fitzroy Bain
*Minister of Education [[Jacqueline Creft]]
*Keith Hayling of the Marketing &amp; National Import Board
*Evelyn Bullen, businessman
*Cecil Evelyn Maitland, businessman

After the overthrow of the Coard Government, eighteen people were put on trial for their responsibility in the death of Maurice Bishop. On 4 December 1986 the High Court returned death sentences against 14 individuals in the deaths of Bishop and the seven others:

*[[Hudson Austin]] (Head of the Army)
*[[Bernard Coard]] (Deputy Prime Minister/Acting Prime Minister)
*Dave Bartholomew (Central Committee member)
*Callistus Bernard (soldier in charge of the firing squad at Fort Rupert - admitted shooting Bishop)
*Phyllis Coard (Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs)
*Leon Cornwall (Central Committee member)
*Liam James (Central Committee member)
*Ewart Layne (General - despatched army forces to Fort Rupert)
*Colville McBarnette (Central Committee member)
*Cecil Prime (Captain - present at Fort Rupert at the time of the executions)
*Lester Redhead (Captain - present at Fort Rupert at the time of the executions)
*Selwyn Strachan (Central Committee member)
*Christopher Stroude (Major - present at Fort Rupert at the time of the executions)
*John Ventour (Captain)

Two men were found guilty of eight incidents of [[manslaughter]] and given 45-year prison sentences.

*Vincent Joseph
*Cosmos Richardson

Andy Michell was found guilty of manslaughter and given 30 years in prison.

Raeburn Nelson was found not guilty and released.

All the death sentences have subsequently been commuted.

On 18 December 2008, Hudson Austin, Colville McBarnett and John Ventour were released. The seven remaining prisoners were due to be released by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_11263466 "Grenada releases 3 coup prisoners"] Associated Press, December 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday, 4 September 2009, the final seven prisoners held in connection with the Bishop coup were released from prison. Senator Chester Humphrey described the release as a milestone in the island's effort to heal wounds from the events of 1983. "It's the end of one chapter, not the completion of the book, as Grenada tries to build a future by not living in the past," he said, according to Associated Press news agency reports on 26 January 2009.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Anon|title="Last of Grenada 17 Released"|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2009/09/090907_grenada_release.shtml|accessdate=22 July 2012|newspaper=BBC Caribbean|date=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of the accused==

The seventeen have always maintained that they cannot be held responsible in relation to the murders of Maurice Bishop and the seven others. Those of the seventeen in positions of authority in government and in the army claim to have given no orders for the execution of the men and women. Callistus Bernard, the private who admits to organizing the firing squad and having shot Bishop, states that he "lost it". Several senior army officers present at the fort claim to have been elsewhere in the fort at the time of the executions. 

Colville McBarnette, while having admitted his role in a central committee meeting he claims ordered the execution of Bishop, says that he is innocent because of the minor degree of responsibility he had in the decision.

Ewart Layne signed a confession at the time of Bishop's murder accepting sole responsibility for issuing the orders that led to the executions. Layne subsequently said that he was beaten and forced to sign the statement.

Hudson Austin has never explained his actions nor attempted to defend them.

Bernard Coard, the head of the government at the time, has stated that he intended to leave the country after the protests concerning his arrest of Bishop broke out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/page7.html The Grenada Revolution Online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Some have questioned the fairness of the defendants' trial. Several people have campaigned on their behalf worldwide and a pamphlet by [[Richard Hart (Jamaican historian and politician)|Richard Hart]], ''The Grenada Trial: A Travesty of Justice'' (Committee for Human Rights in Grenada, 1993), gives a critique of the trial process. In October 2003 [[Amnesty International]] issued a report stating that their arrest and trial had been a miscarriage of justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3208441.stm Robert Plummer, "Amnesty raises plight of 'Grenada 17'", BBC News Online, 23 October 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3408">A '''guillotine clause''' is a stipulation that an adoption of a [[contract]] package depends on the adoption of all of the individual treaties or contracts included. Under the guillotine clause, if only one treaty or contract is either not accepted by an involved party or canceled later, all treaties or contracts are then deemed not accepted or terminated.

That prevents a party from cherry-picking the treaties of the contract package that it supports if the other party considers it to be essential for all of the contract package to be enforced.

The guillotine clause in treaties of the European Union with other countries is the most notable case of its use

==Switzerland==
An example of the guillotine clause is found in the [[Switzerland–European Union relations|body of bilateral treaties between the European Union to Switzerland]]. The treaties give Switzerland access to the [[internal market]] if Switzerland follow its rules. The clause states that if any of the seven treaties are to be terminated, all of the treaties are automatically terminated. Also, later changes in the underlying EU directives must be accepted by Switzerland.

One reason for the creation of this clause is that the more cumbersome decision-making processes of the European Union would make it difficult for it to respond to the termination of other contracts if Switzerland terminated them. 

In 2009, Switzerland accepted a change to one of the treaties, the treaty on free movement, by extending it to the new EU countries. That was relatively controversial in Switzerland, but it was passed in a [[Swiss referendums, 2009|referendum]] and so the guillotine clause was not invoked.

After the success of the [[Federal popular initiative "against mass immigration"|2014 Swiss referendum]] to limit EU immigration through quotas, the invocation of guillotine clause has been suggested to terminate all the other agreements signed since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140210STO35502/html/Schulz-Switzerland-faces-many-negotiations-if-it-limits-freedom-of-movement |title=Schulz: Switzerland faces many negotiations if it limits freedom of movement |accessdate=February 10, 2014 |work=European Parliament / News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The EU has claimed that the bilateral treaties already give Switzerland more cherry-picking in its relation to the EU than any other country of which Switzerland should be allowed no more than now.&lt;ref&gt;[[Council of the European Union]], 8 Jan 2013: ''[http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/EU/XXIV/EU/10/30/EU_103044/imfname_10389263.pdf Council conclusions on EU relations with EFTA countries]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland has a deadline in 2017 to achieve a negotiated solution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/19/eu-deal-switzerland-immigration-uk-eurosceptics&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Economic Area==
EU also has guillotine clauses in the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] agreements with [[Norway]] (2001), [[Iceland]] (2001), and [[Liechtenstein]] (2008), which must directly accept both existing and added EU directives within several fields relating to trade (except food) free movement and the [[internal market]].  Refusing such directives would give the EU the right to terminate the entire EEA agreement and so the EEA countries have avoided doing so.

The '''Hydraform Interlocking Soil Block''' ('''hydraform block''') is an interlocking [[earth block]] used in many [[Africa]]n countries for construction purposes. The hydraform block is made from [[soil cement]] which is a mixture of soil, cement and water, and is [[hydraulic]]ally compressed to form a high quality interlocking soil block. Soil from the building site can be used to manufacture building blocks. [[Sandcrete]] and landcrete are similar materials but are not compressed.

The Hydraform compressed earth block is very popular due to the cost savings that are involved during the construction process as only around 30% of the structure requires [[Mortar (masonry)| mortar]] between the blocks. Due to the interlocking nature of the stabilized soil block, unskilled labour can be utilised in construction thereby empowering rural communities and creating jobs.

The blocks interlock top to bottom and front to back. Blocks dimensions are {{convert|220|mm|in}} wide, {{convert|115|mm|in}} high and {{convert|230|mm|in}} long.

The '''Japan–Korea Protocol of August 1904''' was made between representatives of the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Korean Empire]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BdoAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Japan+korea+treaty+of+1905&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AFbXTNLoO8OBlAfewN38CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Japan%20korea%20treaty%20of%201905&amp;f=false  ''Korea, Treaties and Agreements,'' p. vii.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Negotiations were concluded on August 22, 1904.&lt;ref name="mission35"&gt;Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921–1922. (1922). {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|''Korea's Appeal,'' p. 35.|page=35}}; excerpt, "Alleged Treaty, dated August 22, 1904."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty provisions==
This treaty required Korea to engage financial and diplomatic advisers designated by Japan.  Also, the treaty required Korea to consult with Japan before making treaties with foreign powers, and before granting concessions or making contracts with foreigners.&lt;ref name="mission35"/&gt;

The treaty presumes that the [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] of His Majesty the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs ''[[ad interim]]'' of His Majesty the [[Emperor of Korea]] were respectively authorized and empowered to negotiate and to agree upon the specific language of the proposed bilateral treaty:&lt;ref name="scott37"&gt;Scott, {{Google books|BdoAAAAAYAAJ|p. 37.|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Article I.

The Korean Government shall engage as financial adviser to the Korean Government a Japanese subject recommended by the Japanese Government, and all matters concerning finance shall be dealt with after his counsel has been taken.&lt;ref name="scott37"/&gt;
* Article II.

The Korean Government shall engage as a diplomatic adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs a foreigner recommended by the Japanese Government, and all important matters concerning foreign relations shall be dealt with after his counsel has been taken.&lt;ref name="scott37"/&gt;
* Article III.

The Korean Government shall consult the Japanese Government previous to concluding Treaties or Conventions with foreign Powers, and in dealing with other important diplomatic affairs such as granting of concessions to or contracts with foreigners.&lt;ref name="scott37"/&gt;
:::&amp;mdash; [[Hayashi Gonsuke (diplomat)|Hayashi Gonsuke]], [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] (dated: the 22nd day of the 8th month of the 37th year of Meiji)&lt;ref name="scott37"/&gt;
:::&amp;mdash; [[Yun Chi-ho]], Acting Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (dated: the 22nd day of the 8th month of the 8th year of Gwangmu)&lt;ref name="scott37"/&gt;

An amplified explanation of the scope and purpose of Article III was mentioned in a 1904 letter from the [[Japanese Ambassador to the United States]] [[Takahira Kogorō]] to the [[United States Secretary of State|American Secretary of State]] [[John Hay]]: 
:"Article III is not intended to place an impediment in the way of the legitimate enterprise of foreigners in the sphere of commerce and industry, but is calculated to serve as a precaution against the conclusion of improvident and dangerous engagements which have often in the past proved a source of serious complications, as was conspicuously shown in the case of the Russian lease of [[Yongampo|Yongampho]]."&lt;ref&gt;Scott, {{Google books|BdoAAAAAYAAJ| pp. 37-38.|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recision==
[[Image:Eulsa retraction.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]]'s analysis of the "treaty of 1905" &amp;ndash; just one of many efforts to invalidate the consequences of a coercive process.]]
This "alleged treaty" was contrived in a coercive process;&lt;ref name="mission35"/&gt; and Koreans sought to invalidate the unwanted consequences by presenting evidence to the international community.  For example, 
* 1905: [[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire]] wrote personally to the heads of state in those countries having treaties with Korea; and the Korean government filed formal appeals and sent formal cable notices,&lt;ref&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ| p. 44.|page=44}}; excerpt, "The foregoing are in addition to the appeal of the Emperor of Korea, filed in the State Department on November 25, 1905, and his cable notice of the illegality of the claimed protectorate, filed in the State Department on November 26, 1905."&lt;/ref&gt; but these diplomatic gestures were unavailing.
* 1907: In what is sometimes called the "[[Hague Secret Emissary Affair]]," Korean emissaries sought unsuccessfully to seek international assistance at the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]] at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Carter J. '' et al.'' (1990). ''Korea Old and New: A History,'' p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1921: Korean representatives attempted to gain a hearing at the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921;&lt;ref&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|pp. 3-44.|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the effort was ineffective.

This treaty was confirmed to be "''already [[null and void]]''" by [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea]] concluded in 1965.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_on_Basic_Relations_between_Japan_and_the_Republic_of_Korea|title=Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea}}
"''It is confirmed that all treaties or agreements concluded between the Empire of Japan and the Empire of Korea on or before August 22, 1910 are already null and void.''"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Japan argued that the chronological point of reference for "already null and void" was August 15, 1948, when the government of the Republic of Korea was established.  This point of view is disputed by the Korean analysis, which construes the 1965 treaty as acknowledgment of the nullification of all Japanese-Korean treaties and agreements from 1904 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Man-yeol.

'''Joint venture brokers''' are people who connect business [[joint venture]] partners together for profit making projects. The joint venture brokers will earn a pre-negotiated percentage of the profits earned from the joint venture that they helped put together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guerrilla Marketing|first1=Jay Conrad|last1= Levinson|first2=Terry|last2= Telford|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year= 2008|ISBN=1-4251-8082-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint venture brokers are skilled networkers that can find key people/businesses in different niches and connect them to other people/businesses in the same niche in order to share one businesses products/services with another businesses customers. A joint venture broker must tread lightly and be aware not to put direct competitors together as partners, but find indirect competitors that both market to the same target audiences with different and complementary products/services. In finding such suitable partners, great joint venture partnerships can be created.

Often a joint venture broker will be hired by a business that has either a product, service, or a customer base that could be better monetized. The product/service owner will be seeking partners who have a customer base that is targeted to their product/service. Like-wise the person/business with a customer base (often ezine/newsletter publishers or high traffic webmasters) will be seeking products and services related to their customers' interests so they can market them to their customers.

The joint venture broker may be hired by either of these two partner types in order to connect them with each other to create successful and profitable joint ventures. The joint venture broker will often find multiple suitable partners for their clients to joint venture with, thus producing greater profits of which the broker is often paid a pre-negotiated percentage of sales.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The '''Kansas Women Attorneys Association''' (KWAA) is a voluntary, statewide bar organization devoted to advancing women in the legal profession through networking, service, and continued education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kswomenattorneys.com/content.aspx?page_id=0&amp;club_id=459170|title=Home - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=www.kswomenattorneys.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was formally founded in 1994, and currently has over 270 members.

== History ==
In 1989, the Topeka Women Attorneys Association hosted the first Kansas state meeting for female attorneys, led by [[Marla Luckert|Justice Marla Luckert]]. From 1989 to 1994, the Wichita Women Attorneys Association and Topeka Women Attorneys Association (Now Women Attorneys Association of Topeka) shared responsibility for this annual meeting.

In 1993, conference attendees determined a need for a permanent, statewide organization for female attorneys. The Jennie Mitchell Kellogg Circle (later KWAA) was formed the following year around the purposes of:
# Providing information to women seeking increased bar involvement, judicial positions, and professional development; and
# Providing a structure around which the annual conference could be organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kswomenattorneys.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=459170&amp;module_id=79240|title=About KWAA - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=www.kswomenattorneys.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, KWAA continues to host the annual Lindsborg Conference, as well as encourage monthly meetings among its regional districts and their local women attorney groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kswomenattorneys.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=459170&amp;module_id=177504|title=Local Women Attorney Groups - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=www.kswomenattorneys.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
Membership to KWAA is open to all attorneys, judges, and law students, regardless of gender. This membership allows individuals to access a discounted price to the Lindsborg conference, receive legal updates and answers to questions through the Listserv, and network with fellow attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kwaa.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=9&amp;club_id=459170|title=Benefits - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=kwaa.clubexpress.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 365 members are formally organized into 12 location-based districts, but also have the option to join practice area groups in addition to these. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kwaa.clubexpress.com|title=Home - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=www.kwaa.clubexpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governance for the organization is run through 5 committees (Awards Committee, District Representatives, KWAA Council, Lindsborg Conference Committee, and Past Presidents Council) and 26 subcommittees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kwaa.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=42&amp;club_id=459170|title=Committees - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=kwaa.clubexpress.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership year runs from August 1 to July 31 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kwaa.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=9&amp;club_id=459170|title=Benefits - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=kwaa.clubexpress.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lindsborg Annual Conference ==
The annual KWAA conference has been held in [[Lindsborg, Kansas|Lindsborg, KS]] since 1989. Today, the conference spans three days in July and is held at [[Bethany College (Kansas)|Bethany College]]. Conference attendees have the opportunity to participate in [[Continuing legal education|Continuing Legal Education]] courses, as well as a number of networking and social activities. In past years, the conference has featured national speakers like [[Kathleen Sebelius]], [[Molly Ivins]], [[Deanell Reece Tacha]], [[Nancy Kassebaum]], [[Gail Collins]], [[Wilma Mankiller]], and [[Ellen Goodman]].

== Jennie Mitchell Kellogg Achievement Award ==
The Jennie Mitchell Kellogg Achievement Award was first presented in 1999, and has been a yearly staple since. This award seeks to recognize a member who:
# Achieves professional excellence in her practice area;
# Influences other women to pursue a career in law;
# Opens doors that have been historically closed; and
# Advances opportunities for women in her field.
This award has been presented to notable women like [[Christel Marquardt]], [[Marla Luckert]], and Sally Pokorny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kwaa.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&amp;club_id=459170&amp;module_id=97691|title=About KWAA - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=kwaa.clubexpress.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History Preservation Efforts ==
The Kansas Women Attorneys Association works diligently to preserve and archive historical information pertaining to the female practice of law in Kansas. Research includes a complete list of female attorneys dating back to 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kwaa.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=86&amp;club_id=459170&amp;sl=527432019|title=Documents - Kansas Women Attorneys Association|website=kwaa.clubexpress.com|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These research efforts are often aided by area law schools including, [[Washburn University School of Law]], [[University of Kansas School of Law]], and [[University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law|University of Missouri- Kansas City School of Law]].

One of the projects with sister organization, Women Attorneys Association of Topeka, was the production of the book ''Journeys on the Road Less Travelled: Kansas Women Attorneys.'' The entire book may be found online through the [[Washburn University School of Law]] Digital Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://contentdm.washburnlaw.edu/cdm/ref/collection/womenattorneys/id/14|title=Journeys on the Road Less Travelled: Kansas Women Attorneys :: Kansas Women Attorneys|website=contentdm.washburnlaw.edu|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Metabolite sued [[LabCorp]] for infringement of a patent covering a diagnostic test. The claims of Metabolite's patent include the correlation between levels of [[homocysteine]] and vitamins [[Vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Vitamin B12|B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A jury ordered LabCorp to pay $4.7 million in damages and the decision was upheld by a federal court, which further stated that doctors were 'directly infringing' Metabolite's patents each time such a test is ordered and interpreted. LabCorp argued that the correlation is a principle of nature, and therefore the patent should never have been granted. The court dismissed the case, although [[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]], [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], and [[David Souter|Justice Souter]] dissented from this decision. Breyer's dissenting opinion cited numerous cases in which scientific and mathematical principles had been held to be patent ineligible, including ''[[O'Reilly v. Morse]]'' and ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]''..

Had the case been heard, and had Metabolite's patent been invalidated, the case would have had broad implications for biotechnology companies, which may have extended far beyond patentability of correlations of [[biomarker]]s to [[disease]] states. [[Lori Andrews]] outlined various concerns regarding how routine academic practices might become actionable under the results of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews LB (2006) ''The patent office as thought police'', [[The Chronicle of Higher Education|CHE]] '''52'''(24), B20.&lt;/ref&gt; Metabolite's brief to the court suggested that overturning the patent might lead to invalidation of all drug patents on the grounds that the inventors ''"merely discovered that certain chemicals interact with the human body in ways directed by chemistry."''

In ''[[Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.|Mayo v. Prometheus]]'' in 2012 the Supreme Court unanimously held what the dissenting Justices argued for in this case. That did not lead, however, to invalidation of all drug patents on the grounds that the inventors "merely discovered that certain chemicals interact with the human body in ways directed by chemistry," at least not as of 2015.

{{Unreferenced stub|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
'''Legalism''', in the [[Western world|Western]] sense, is an approach to the analysis of legal questions characterized by abstract logical reasoning focusing on the applicable legal text, such as a [[constitution]], [[legislation]], or [[case law]], rather than on the [[social]], [[economic]], or [[political]] context. Legalism has occurred both in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[common law]] traditions.

In its narrower versions, legalism may endorse the notion that the pre-existing body of authoritative legal materials already contains a uniquely pre-determined right answer to any legal problem that may arise.

Legalism typically also claims that the task of the judge is to ascertain the answer to a legal question by an essentially mechanical process.

[[File:Pallasmaa Kamppi.JPG|thumb|[[Kamppi Center]], Helsinki, 2006. The lightwell helps reduce overall energy demands.]]

In [[architecture]] a '''lightwell''', '''light well''' or '''air shaft''' is an unroofed external space provided within the volume of a large building to allow [[light]] and [[air]] to reach what would otherwise be a dark or unventilated area. Lightwells may be lined with glazed bricks to increase the reflection of sunlight within the space.

Lightwells serve to reduce the necessity for electric lighting, add a central space within the building, and provide an internal open space for windows to give an illusion of having a view outside.

==Area or areaway==
{{main|Area (architecture)}}
A subterranean lightwell at the front of a building to provide light to a basement is called an '''[[Area (architecture)|area]]''' (or '''areaway''' in North American usage).

==Ancient history==
The lightwell was used in ancient civilizations, such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The demography of Roman Egypt|last= Bagnall|first= Roger S|author2=Frier, Bruce W |date= 2006|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= [[Cambridge]], [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 978-0-521-46123-8|oclc= 28927049|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Palace of [[Knossos]] on [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes|title= Knossos|accessdate=2008-05-24 |last= Hogan|first= C Michael|date= 2008-04-14|work= The Modern Antiquarian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also instances of light well use by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Piscinae: Artificial Fishponds in Roman Italy|last= Higginbotham|first= James Arnold|date= 1997|publisher= [[University of North Carolina Press]]|location= [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill, NC]]|isbn= 978-0-8078-2329-3|oclc= 35172558|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| ''[[Valley Forge Christian College v.

Lyons]]'' || 1983 || Held that a plaintiff had standing to sue for damages from being subjected to a [[chokehold]] that was allowed under Los Angeles Police Department policy, but did not have standing to sue for an injunction against the chokehold policy itself, clarifying that standing must be found for different forms of relief individually. || 5-4
|-
| ''[[Allen v. Wright]]'' || 1984 || Held that a group of African-American parent plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge what they saw as a lack of enforcement of restrictions on certain private school tax exemptions by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], as the plaintiff parents' children had never applied, and had no plans to apply to those schools.  || 5-3

'''Maternity Protection Convention, 2000''' is  an [[International Labour Organization]] [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|Convention]].

It was established in 2000, with the [[preamble]] stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Noting the need to revise the [[Maternity Protection Convention (Revised), 1952]], and the Maternity Protection Recommendation, 1952, in order to further promote equality of all [[women in the workforce]] and the health and safety of the mother and child, and in order to recognize the diversity in economic and social development of Members, as well as the diversity of enterprises, and the development of the protection of maternity in national law and practice, and

&lt;br&gt;
"Taking into account the circumstances of women workers and the need to provide protection for [[pregnancy]], which are the shared responsibility of government and society, and

"Having determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention;

== History ==

This Convention revised a [[Maternity Protection Convention (Revised), 1952|1952 ILO convention (C103)]], which in turn was a revision of the original [[Maternity Protection Convention, 1919|1919 ILO convention (C3)]]. The revision was aimed at gaining more ratification by easing the requirements of the 1952 convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/dossier/31725%20%28R1867%29/kst-31725-2?resultIndex=1&amp;sorttype=1&amp;sortorder=4|title=31 725 (R 1867) Verdrag inzake de herziening van het Verdrag betreffende de bescherming van het moederschap (herzien), 1952; Genève, 15 juni 2000|accessdate=30 October 2010|date=3 October 2008|language=Dutch|publisher=Dutch government (officielebekendmakingen.nl)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4747">'''OHADA''' is a system of [[corporate law]] and implementing institutions adopted by seventeen [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]]n nations in 1993 in [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius]]. OHADA is the acronym for the French "''Organisation pour l'harmonisation en Afrique du droit des affaires''", which translates into English as "Organisation for the Harmonization of Corporate Law in Africa".

The OHADA Treaty is made up today of 17 African states. Initially fourteen African countries signed the treaty, with two countries ([[Comoros]] and [[Guinea]]) subsequently adhering to the treaty and a third (the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) due to adhere shortly.{{When|date=November 2017}} The Treaty is open to all states, whether or not they are members of the [[Organisation of African Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.int/en/ Organization of African Unity]&lt;/ref&gt;  OHADA was created with the objective of fostering economic development in West and Central Africa by creating a better investment climate so as to attract investment in a 225 million-consumer market.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Characteristics==
As a West and Central African initiative to harmonize business laws and implementing institutions, OHADA aims to find alternative solutions to the lack of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa - a region which has challenged and puzzled [[economic development|development economists]] for several decades. The stated purpose of the initiative is to facilitate and encourage both domestic and foreign investment in the member states, and as most of the participating countries are former [[French colonies]], they draw chiefly on a modernised French legal model to achieve their goals. The laws promulgated by OHADA are exclusively business-related. The OHADA treaty has created a supranational court ([[Common Court of Justice and Arbitration of the Organization for the Harmonization in Africa of Business Law]] [http://www.ohada.org/index.php/en/court-of-justice-and-arbitration/ccja-at-a-glance]) to ensure uniformity and consistent legal interpretations across the member countries, and the French influence in court proceedings is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3073&amp;context=expresso Dickerson, Claire M.: "Harmonizing Business Laws in Africa: OHADA Calls the Tune"] 44:1 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law (2005), 63 pages, retrieved 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The most critical tool for legal integration is the Uniform Act. A uniform act is the recollection of all relevant legal norms needed to ease business in the Member States. As of today,{{when|date=May 2016}} OHADA includes nine validated Uniform Acts: General Commercial Law, Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups, Secured Transactions Law, Debt Resolution Law, Insolvency Law, Arbitration Law, Harmonization of Corporate Accounting, Contracts for the Carriage of Goods, Cooperatives Companies Law. Two Uniform Acts (Arbitration and Accounting) are currently being revised.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13711">Until 1969, the term ''private foundation'' was not defined in the [[United States Internal Revenue Code]]. Since then, every U.S. charity that qualifies under Section [[501(c)(3)]] of the Internal Revenue Service Code as tax-exempt is a "private foundation" unless it demonstrates to the IRS that it falls into another category. Private foundations in the United States are generally subject to a 1% or 2% excise tax on net investment income.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/irm/part7/irm_07-026-001.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Philanthropic Terms. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014, from http://dearborncf.org/glossary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Foundation Center, a '''private foundation''' is a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization, which has a principal fund managed by its own trustees or directors.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Philanthropic Terms. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014, from http://dearborncf.org/glossary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins (2013) listed four characteristics that make up a private foundation:
* It is a charitable organization and thus subject to the rules applicable to charities generally;
* Its financial support came from one source, usually an individual, family, or company;
* Its annual expenditures are funded out of earnings from investment assets, rather than from an ongoing flow of contributions; 
* It makes grants to other organizations for charitable purposes, rather than to its own programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, B. (2013).

==History==
The [[Tax Reform Act of 1969]] created the private foundation as we know of it today where the tax code imposed the present day legal framework.  These restrictions came about as a reform effort to remedy perceived abuses of private foundations such as the claim that this type of charitable organization more likely served the private interests of the rich rather than the intended charitable purpose.  Such criticism asserted that private individuals created private foundations as a vehicle to protect their assets from taxation; meanwhile the descendants may assert control over these assets almost in perpetuity.  This is the context from which the present day legal framework arose.

In 2007 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that wealthy families are both increasing the number of foundations they close as well as increasing the number they establish.  One trend is to put a time limit on the life of a foundation, under the assumption that heavy spending over a short period of time will do more good than slower spending over the long term.  Some foundations are closed due to family disputes, concern about the effect of foundation wealth on descendants, and concern that future generations will not share the political beliefs that spurred the original establishment of the foundation.  Sometimes one is closed, only to be reopened with a new purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117677618145972189 Beatty, Sally, ''Families Wrestle With Closing Foundations'',] [[Wall Street Journal]], April 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
A private foundation is a nonprofit organization having a principal fund managed by its own directors or trustees. Private foundations maintain or aid charitable, educational, religious, or other activities serving the public good, primarily through the making of grants to other nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/faqs/html/pfandpc.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, some scholars, such as, Silk and Lintott (2002) argue that even though private foundations offer a number of tax benefits, taxes are not a sufficient reason to create a private foundation. Given some charitable intent on the part of the founder, there are several substantial financial and personal benefits to creating a foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Silk, R. D., &amp; Lintott, J. W. (2002). Private Charitable Foundations: A Primer. Journal of Financial Planning, 15(7), 84-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Rockefeller Foundation and the Gates Foundation as example, Eckl (2014) discusses the fact that private foundations have the power to shape global social and health policy. He argues that adding monetary resources and supplementary goodwill to existing global efforts is not the only goal of private foundations, rather it is still likely that they pursue a partisan agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Eckl, J. (2014). The power of private foundations: Rockefeller and Gates in the struggle against malaria. Global Social Policy, 14(1), 91-116&lt;/ref&gt; 

A private foundation is typically set up as a non-profit corporation that bears the name of its donors, but may alternatively be established as a trust. Donors specify the charitable purpose of the foundation (example: grants for cancer research, scholarships for the needy, support of religious goals) . During their lifetime, they may continue their charitable giving by making tax deductible contributions to the foundation. The foundation may also be funded with a bequest from the donors' will or trust or receive funds as the primary or secondary beneficiary of a qualified plan or IRA.The IRS reports that there were 115,340 private foundations in the U.S. in 2008, of which 110,099 were grantmaking (non-operating) and 5,241 were operating foundations.&lt;ref&gt;http://nccsdataweb.urban.org/PubApps/profileDrillDown.php?state=US&amp;rpt=PF&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 75% of the private foundations file annually with the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;http://nccsdataweb.urban.org/PubApps/profileDrillDown.php?state=US&amp;rpt=PF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Private Foundations==
Once a foundation has been classified by the Internal Revenue Service as a private foundation, there are ways to describe it based on how the foundation is funded and governed. There are three types of private foundations: Family foundations, Private Operating foundations, and Corporate Foundations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cof.org/content/foundation-basics#different_kinds&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family Foundation===
Many private foundations are family foundations. Family foundation is not a legal term, and therefore, it has no precise definition. Yet, approximately two-thirds of the estimated 44,000 private foundations in the United States are believed to be family managed.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Philanthropic Terms. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014, from http://dearborncf.org/glossary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This standard type of private foundation will provide grants directly to other charitable organizations that will use those funds to carry out the charitable activities or programs. Moody, Knap, Corra (2011) discuss the different definitions of family foundation that organizations and researchers used. They argue that because family foundation make up a large proportion of total foundations, it is essential to have a better clarity of the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, M., Knap, A. L., &amp; Corra, M. (2011). What Is a Family Foundation?. Foundation Review, 3(4), 47-61.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Council on Foundations defines a family foundation as a "foundation whose funds are derived from members of a single family. At least one family member must continue to serve as an officer or board member of the foundation, they or their relatives play a significant role in governing and/or managing the foundation throughout its life. Most family foundations are run by family members who serve as trustees or directors on a voluntary basis, receiving no compensation; in many cases, second- and third-generation descendants of the original donors manage the foundation."&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Philanthropic Terms. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014, from http://dearborncf.org/glossary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockefeller Foundation, and the Gates Foundation are two of the most renowned and influential family foundations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Emanuelle Birn, Philanthrocapitalism, past and present: The Rockefeller Foundation, the Gates Foundation, and the setting(s) of the international/global health agenda. Hypothesis 2014, 12(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private operating foundation===
Private operating foundations are private foundations that use the bulk of their income to provide charitable services or to run charitable programs of their own. They make few, if any, grants to outside organizations. Thus, a private operating foundation sponsors and manages its own programs. A typical example of this would be a day camp for underprivileged children. Rather than providing grants to another organization to administer such a camp, which a standard private foundation would do, the private operating foundation will "operate" the camp. The private operating foundation will maintain a qualified staff as well as other personnel needed to carry out the program on a continuing basis. To qualify as a private operating foundation, specific rules, in addition to the applicable rules for private foundations, must be followed. 

A private foundation qualifies as a private operating foundation by satisfying two numerical tests. These tests ensure that the private operating foundation is conducting its exempt activities directly and not simply making grants to other organizations. The first of the two tests is an income test, which requires a specific amount of income to be spent on direct charitable activities. 

The second test is actually made up of three different tests: an asset test, an endowment test and a support test. However, the private operating foundation only has to satisfy one of these three tests, in addition to the income test, to qualify. Similar to the income test, these other three tests help to ensure that the private operating foundation is using its funds to meet the requirement of conducting direct charitable activities. 

In contrast, a private foundation that principally provides grants to other entities or to individuals for charitable or other exempt purposes would not qualify as an operating foundation, and instead would be called a "nonoperating foundation". The [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] and the [[Getty Trust]] are examples of operating foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Philanthropic Terms. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014, from http://dearborncf.org/glossary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.elkocpa.com/nonprofit-tax-exempt/private-operating-foundations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopicn84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What it Takes to Be a Private Operating Foundation. (n.d.). Retrieved November 4, 2014, from http://mauilandlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/What-it-Takes-to-be-a-Private-Operating-Foundation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate Foundation===
A corporate (company-sponsored) foundation is "a private foundation that derives its grant-making funds primarily from the contributions of a profit-making business. The company-sponsored foundation often maintains close ties with the donor company, but it is a separate, legal organization, sometimes with its own endowment, and is subject to the same rules and regulations as other private foundations." &lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Philanthropic Terms. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014, from http://dearborncf.org/glossary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public.Resource.Org''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit corporation dedicated to publishing and sharing [[public domain]] materials in the [[United States]] and internationally. It was founded by [[Carl Malamud]] and is based in [[Sebastopol, California]].

Public.Resource.Org takes particular interest in digitizing and making accessible the works of the United States Federal Government, which because of [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|US government licensing rules for its own work]] are almost always in the public domain. Major projects conducted by the organization include the digitizing and sharing of large numbers of court records, US government-produced video, and laws of various places.

The organization often advertises its work by saying "Yes We Scan", a play on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign slogan "[[Yes We Can (slogan)|Yes We Can]]". The Yes We Scan focus as of autumn 2013 is an effort to digitize and publish every available set of [[safety standards]] for every jurisdiction in the world.

==Operation strategy==
Malamud works on the premise that information in the [[public domain]], and particularly government-generated information of this sort, ought to be as easy as possible for the public to access.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/08/carl-malamud-takes-on-westlaw.html |title=Carl Malamud Takes on WestLaw |first=Tim |last=O'Reilly |authorlink=Tim O'Reilly |work=[[O'Reilly Media|radar.oreilly.com]] |date=19 August 2007 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, he identifies interesting collections of information held by organizations which have failed to grant free public access to it.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt; Two typical circumstances are that the creator of the information has failed to make it available online in any form, or that the creator has provided the information to a private company which itself charges fees for access to the information.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt;  At this point, Malamud acquires the free information himself, publishes it in public.resource.org as a free communication channel, and then demonstrates publicly that he has made information free when otherwise it would not be and calls for pressure on the holder of the information to collaborate in developing the information release.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt;

==Projects==
===Access to IRS Form 990 (information return of tax-exempt entities) in digital format===
In 2013, Public.Resource.Org filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requesting copies of nine annual information reports ([[Form 990]]) for tax-exempt entities in MeF (modernized e-file) format.  The IRS refused to provide the MeF files, claiming that the effort to edit them to conform to required privacy standards for the filers represented an unreasonable burden.  On January 29, 2015, a U.S. District Court ruled against the IRS, requiring that the IRS provide the requested files within 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pacer

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Observers believe that this decision will result in the IRS moving more rapidly toward providing electronic versions of Form 990 to the public.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Access to United States legal resources===
In 2007 Malamud began publishing the full text of United States legal opinions dating from 1880 in an effort to begin a process intended to create a free publicly accessible database intended to hold the entirety of US Case law.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt;  Goals of the project included the creation of "an unencumbered full-text repository of the Federal Reporter, the Federal Supplement, and the Federal Appendix" and "an unencumbered full-text repository of all state and federal cases and codes." &lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt; In describing this project, journalist [[Tim O'Reilly]] described this information to be "clearly public data" yet also "the crown jewels of public data available for profit", as companies including [[West (publisher)|West]] had collected billions of dollars in fees for granting access to this data.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt;

Malamud called for increased awareness that Westlaw was a commercial broker of the United States Federal Reporter, Federal Supplement, and Federal Appendix.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt; While Westlaw had been adding value to the content by indexing it with their proprietary [[West American Digest System]] and accompanying summaries, the purchase of their products was the only way to access much of the public domain material they hosted.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt; Malamud began to distribute these materials for free while saying in an open letter to the company&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt;

{{quote|…it seems fairly clear that a large part of the publication stream is tightly interwoven into the very substance of the operation of the courts, with West serving as the either contractual or de-facto sole vendor reporting on behalf of the court. … You have already received rich rewards for the initial publication of these documents … We wish to make this information available to (the public) … It is crucial that the public domain data be available for anybody to build upon.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"/&gt;}}

In 2010 Google awarded the project 2 million USD in funding through their Project 10^100 challenge to submit ideas for changing the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/2m_google_grant_puts_aba_legal_rebels_struggling_legal_document_access_proj/ |title=$2M Google Grant Puts Struggling Legal Document Access Project in the Black |first=Martha |last=Neil |work=[[ABA Journal]] |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/10-million-for-project-10100-winners.html |title=$10 million for Project 10^100 winners |first=Lorraine |last=Twohill |work=googleblog.blogspot.com |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FedFlix===
Public.Resource.Org collects old and forgotten United States government video, digitizes it, and distributes it for free online in a project called FedFlix. Video is purchased or requested from government agencies such as the [[National Technical Information Service]].&lt;ref name="Badger2010"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://psmag.com/economics/fedflix-popularizes-uncle-sams-video-collection-23473 |title=Nonprofit Fedflix Smoothes Access to Federal Video Archive |first=Emily |last=Badger|work=[[Pacific Standard]] |date=30 September 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos are digitized and uploaded with [[metadata]] to [[YouTube]] and Public.Resource.Org's servers.&lt;ref name="Badger2010"/&gt; Most of these videos were produced with federal government funding and intended for educational purposes.&lt;ref name="Badger2010"/&gt; There is also a collection of videos from FedFlix at the [[Internet Archive]] which contains over 8,700 items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/FedFlix |title=FedFlix: Free Movies: Download &amp; Streaming: Internet Archive |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube's [[YouTube#Content ID|Content ID]] tool helps copyright holders make requests to remove their copyrighted videos from YouTube. Malamud has complained that large media organizations are using this tool to unfairly attack and call for the removal of Public.Resource.Org's upload of US federal government videos on the improper claim of their copyright over them, when in fact these works are purported by the US government to be public domain works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/12/pirates-of-youtube-cory-doctorow |title=The pirates of YouTube |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |work=theguardian.com |date=12 December 2011|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yes We Scan===
"Yes We Scan" is a phrase used as a name for various Public.Resource.Org projects which have the goal of digitizing and making available large collections of documents.

In 2009 when [[Carl Malamud]] petitioned to become the [[Public Printer of the United States]] the campaign slogan was "Yes we scan!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-malamud/yes-we-scan-why-i-want-to_b_170386.html |title=Carl Malamud: Yes We Scan: Why I Want To Lead The Government Printing Office |first=Carl |last=Malamud |work=huffingtonpost.com |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Public.Resource.org submitted a "YesWeScan.org" proposal to the United States federal government petitioning system [[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People]] asking for the creation of a plan to scan all public federal government holdings.&lt;ref name="yeswescan2011"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.archives.gov/aotus/?p=3965 |title=AOTUS: Collector in Chief - Yes We Scan Again! The Archives chats with voters on a "We the People" teleconference |first=David |last=Ferriero |authorlink=David Ferriero |work=blogs.archives.gov |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ferriero]] responded to the petition describing efforts to increase availability of government archives.&lt;ref name="yeswescan2011"/&gt;

In 2013 Public.Resource.Org organized a fundraiser for a Yes We Scan project to collect, digitize, and make available all government [[safety standards]] in every country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publicresource/public-safety-codes-of-the-world-stand-up-for-safe |title=Public Safety Codes of the World: Stand Up For Safety! by Carl Malamud, Public.Resource.Org |first=Carl |last=Malamud |work=kickstarter.com |year=2013 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Public.Resource.Org managed a smaller project to free the public safety codes in [[California]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boingboing.net/2010/12/09/californias-safety-c.html |title=California's safety codes are now open source! |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |work=boingboing.net |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===C-SPAN video licensing===
In 2007 Malamud petitioned for more open access to some C-SPAN recordings.

[[C-SPAN]] is a private media company which records and broadcasts the discussions of the United States Congress.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/26/technology/26cspan.html?_r=0 |title=Which Videos Are Protected? Lawmakers Get a Lesson |first=Noam |last=Cohen |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=26 February 2007 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company's business model is to provide its recordings for fees to cable and satellite television broadcasters.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt;

In February 2007, [[Nancy Pelosi]] was publishing on her blog as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] and inserted video clips from C-SPAN into her messages.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt; Persons representing her opposing political party claimed that she was violating copyright in using the videos.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt; C-SPAN investigated the situation and found that in some cases she was and in other cases she was not, and they clarified their position in the media.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt;

C-SPAN confirmed that through more than 25 years of operating it had  consistently asserted its copyright over all of the material which it created with its own cameras, which was 85-95% of its content.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt; The rest of its content was produced on the House and Senate floors with government cameras, and this material was in fact public domain content as a work of the US federal government.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt; A representative of C-SPAN said that "It is perfectly understandable to me that people would be confused… (because the situation is that) when a congressman says something on the floor it is public domain, but (when) he walks down the street to a committee hearing or give a speech and (then) it is not public domain.&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt; The representative went on to say that "I think a lot of people don't understand (that) C-SPAN is a business, just like [[CNN]] is, … (and) If we don't have a revenue stream, we wouldn't have six crews ready to cover Congressional hearings."&lt;ref name="Cohen2007"/&gt;

In 2007 Malamud petitioned for more open access to some C-SPAN recordings. [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] credited Malamud's efforts and a letter to [[Brian Lamb]] of C-SPAN to their agreement in 2007 to make congressional recordings much more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/03/c-span-unchains-congressional-hearing-videos |title=C-SPAN Unchains Congressional Hearing Videos |first=Fred |last=von Lohmann |work=eff.org |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boingboing.net/2007/03/01/dear-cspan-youre-not.html |title=Dear C-SPAN: you're not Disney, Congress isn't Mickey |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |authorlink=Cory Doctorow |work=[[Boing Boing|boingboing.net]] |date=1 March 2007  |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smithsonian Institution protest===
In 2006 Malamud complained that private company [[Showtime Networks]] and the publicly owned [[Smithsonian Institution]] were entering a contract to establish [[Smithsonian Networks]] without sufficient public disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://radar.oreilly.com/2006/04/smithsonian-sunshine.html |title=Smithsonian Sunshine - O'Reilly Radar |first=Tim |last=O'Reilly | authorlink =Tim O'Reilly|work=radar.oreilly.com |date=5 April 2006 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the contract Showtime would be able to deny permission to other media producers wishing access to Smithsonian collections.&lt;ref name="Wyatt2006"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/arts/television/01smit.html |title=Smithsonian Agreement Angers Filmmakers  |first=Edward |last=Wyatt |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 April 2006 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentarian [[Ken Burns]] said of this deal "I find this deal terrifying... It feels like the Smithsonian has essentially optioned America's attic to one company".&lt;ref name="Wyatt2006"/&gt;

==Responses==
[[Ralph Nader]] endorses the work of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ralph-nader/the-law-must-be-free-and-accessible_b_4747745.html |title=The Law Must Be Free and Accessible to All -- Not Secret and Profitable |first=Ralph |last=Nader |authorlink=Ralph Nader |work=huffingtonpost.com |date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''American Society for Testing and Materials et al. v. Public.Resource.Org''===
In the case of ''[[American Society for Testing and Materials et al. v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc.]]'', Public.Resource.org was sued by the [[ASTM International|American Society for Testing and Materials]], the [[National Fire Protection Association]], and the [[ASHRAE|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers]] for scanning and making available [[building code]]s and [[fire code]]s which these organizations consider their copyrighted property.  The case was heard in the District Court of the District of Columbia, with Judge [[Tanya S. Chutkan]] presiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/press/releases/publicresourceorg-fights-back-against-copyright-lawsuit |title=Public.Resource.Org Fights Back Against Copyright Lawsuit |authorlink=EFF |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pacer Docket

'''Reduction in rank''' may refer to three separate concepts:
*In [[military law]], a ''reduction in rank'' or ''degradation''&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|degrade}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[demotion]] in [[military rank]] as punishment for a [[crime]] or wrongdoing, imposed by a [[court-martial]] or other [[authority]]. It may be imposed in conjunction with other punishments, such as a [[Military discharge|bad conduct or dishonorable discharge]], loss of wages, [[wikt:confinement|confinement]] to [[barracks]], or [[Prison|imprisonment]] in a [[military prison]].
*''Reduction in rank'' may also refer to the voluntary, non-punitive practice of taking a lower rank, often as part of joining another [[military unit]] or [[military service]]. For example, those who join the [[Special Air Service]] or [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]] take the rank of [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]], often a lower rank than their previous rank but with greater pay, prestige, and responsibilities.
*There is a ''reversion'' in rank after an officer has been temporarily promoted to a higher rank while occupying a position requiring that rank; the officer reverts to the permanent rank on vacating the position bearing the higher rank. In the US military, this occurs most often to three- or four-star general or flag officers, who can be reduced in rank to no lower than their permanent rank of two stars. This occurs because three- and four-star ranks are always temporary ranks and are linked to their position's office. A three- or four-star officer could revert non-punitively to a lower rank because they no longer hold a position bearing the higher rank. Reversion of this type is less usual for lower US ranks as such temporary promotions are uncommon.

==History==
Reduction in rank ([[Latin]] ''gradus deiectio'' meaning position degradation) was a [[Roman military decorations and punishments|Roman military punishment]].&lt;ref name="Brand2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clarence Eugene Brand|title=Roman Military Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rbh7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT172|year=1968|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-75817-9|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, [[Courts-martial in the United States|courts-martial]] may adjudge reduction to any enlisted member to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|page=131|chapter=Part II|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Courts-martial in the United States#Summary court-martial|summary court-martial]] may not sentence a person to reduction by more than one grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|pages=191–192|chapter=Part II|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 15 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ) authorizes [[commanding officer]]s to "in addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand" impose "reduction to the next inferior [[pay grade]], if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction." Additionally, an officer of the grade of [[Major (United States)|major]], [[lieutenant commander]], or above is authorized to impose "reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above [[Pay grade#Pay grades and associated ranks by branch of service|E-4]] may not be reduced more than two pay grades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|pages=5–6|chapter=Appendix 2|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, article 58a of the UCMJ provides that, unless otherwise provided in regulation, an enlisted member above the pay grade of E-1 sentenced by a court-martial to confinement, a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or hard labor without confinement, shall be automatically reduced to the pay grade of E-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United States|title=[[Manual for Courts-Martial|Manual for Courts-Martial, United States]]|date=2016|edition=2016|page=19|chapter=Appendix 2|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==
In other countries, there is such a punishment, which is sometimes much more severe than that in the US.  It usually is assigned for serious crimes in peacetime and wartime.

===Russian Empire and USSR===
In the Russian Empire and in the USSR, most often it was a demotion in rank to private. 
In the Russian Empire to this punishment was added also other penalties such as beatings with whips, which were all the staff. Personnel lined up in formation, then each dealt one blow sentenced. Most often, this has led to the death of the convict from his injuries.

====For example====
Lieutenant-General Marquis [[Philip Osipovich Paulucci]], being quartermaster General of the [[Russian Caucasus Forces (before 1865)|Caucasus army]], on 3 November 1810, wrote in his diary: "the Tiflis infantry regiment non-commissioned officer Ermolaev, the former in the recruit depot when you split the party on the shelves, took the recruit 5 rubles brazenly. For any impermissible and intolerable service act, reducted thereof in the ordinary non-commissioned officer, require him to drive the rods through 500 people one time, and taken money from him to take away and give to a recruit. Flogging this very same to do tomorrow in 8 hours. This case put the body on view at the end of the Lord to the heads of regiments are strictly watched so that the lower ranks no one had injustices..."

Demoted in rank, with the exception only of occasions a great military feat, can get officer rank except by  Highest permission about not reading an incurred penalty obstacle to the awards; to enter with the idea of this is permitted no sooner than after three years after a demotion (article 43). On the basis of article 60, 556, 634, and 727&amp;nbsp;kN. SV VII. military. post. demoted cannot be produced in the non-commissioned officers, not assigned to any trip, you don't leave and transferred to the reserve only with a special permission.

===USSR===
In the USSR, demotion in rank to [[Ryadovoy|private]] begin to see use as a punishment immediately after the creation of the [[Soviet Armed Forces|red army]]. As a rule, it punished those who made unforgivable mistakes during combat, especially those who led to serious losses or tactical defeat. In addition, it also punished those who committed serious crimes while serving. In the second case, a demotion in rank was usually not the only punishment administered, and often accompanied an imprisonment or execution.
During the second world war, those demoted in rank were not imprisoned away from the front lines but instead made to serve in the [[Penal military unit|penal divisions]].
After the second world war, the punishment no longer meant execution or service in a penal unit, but did mean dismissal from service and forfeiture of all military awards. Most often it was imposed for serious crimes which entail criminal liability. In modern Russia this post-[[WW2]] version of the punishment is still used.

===Post-Soviet Ukraine===
On December 22, 2015, Konstantin Grishin (better known as [[Semen Semenchenko]]) was demoted in rank while serving as the commander of the voluntary [[Donbas Battalion|Donbass]] battalion.  While all of the other punishments he received. The reason for the demotion in rank was the fact that he does not have the appropriate training and education to carry the title of Lieutenant.

===Germany===
For example, during the Third Reich, the [[SS]] officer [[Helmut Knochen]] was demoted in rank because, during [[Operation Valkyrie|the coup attempt of 20 July 1944]], he did not adequately resist the conspirators, and got himself arrested.

He is a leading figure in the field of [[law and economics]], and was identified by ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'' as the [[Citation impact|most cited]] legal scholar of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=ShapiroJLS&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Fred R. |year=2000 |title=The Most-Cited Legal Scholars |journal=Journal of Legal Studies |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=409–26 |doi=10.1086/468080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner is known for his scholarly range and for writing on topics outside of his primary field, law. In his various writings and books, he has addressed animal rights, feminism, drug prohibition, same-sex marriage, Keynesian economics, and academic moral philosophy, among other subjects.

Posner is the author of nearly 40 books on jurisprudence, economics, and several other topics, including ''Economic Analysis of Law'', ''The Economics of Justice'', ''The Problems of Jurisprudence'', ''[[Sex and Reason]]'', ''Law, Pragmatism and Democracy'', and ''The Crisis of Capitalist Democracy''.

==Early life and education==
Richard Posner was born on January 11, 1939, in [[New York City]].  His father's family were of [[Romanian Jewish]] descent, and his mother's family were [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from [[Vienna, Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igreens.org.uk/richard_posner.htm ''The Bench Burner: An interview with Richard Posner''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509143331/http://www.igreens.org.uk/richard_posner.htm |date=May 9, 2007 }}, Reprint of article from ''New Yorker'' by [[Larissa MacFarquhar]], Dec. 10, 2001: "Posner grew up in New York - first in Manhattan and then in Scarsdale. His mother's relatives were Jews from Vienna who looked down on his father's family, which was from Romania and poorer than they were. 'They were all poor,' Posner says, 'but my mothers family had toilet paper, and my father's family had newspaper.' "&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing high school, Posner attended [[Yale University]], graduating in 1959 with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in [[English literature]].  He then attended the [[Harvard Law School]], graduating in 1962 with an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] ''[[magna cum laude]]''  as the valedictorian of his class&lt;ref name="cnn1"&gt;{{cite news

In 1968, Posner accepted a position teaching at [[Stanford Law School]].&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; In 1969, Posner moved to the faculty of the [[University of Chicago Law School]], where he remains a Senior Lecturer. He was a founding editor of ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'' in 1972.

On October 27, 1981, Posner was nominated by President [[Ronald Reagan]] to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] vacated by Judge [[Philip Willis Tone]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news

He served as [[Chief Judge]] of that court from 1993 to 2000 but remained a part-time professor at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Judge Posner retired from the federal bench on September 2, 2017.

Posner is a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] in [[philosophy]] and an [[economist]] in [[international legal theory|legal methodology]]. He has written many articles and books on a wide range of topics including law and economics, law and literature, the federal judiciary, [[moral theory]], [[intellectual property]], [[antitrust law]], public intellectuals, and [[legal history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/books/review/richard-posner-biography-william-domnarski.html|title=The Provocative Life of Judge Richard Posner|last=Witt|first=John Fabian|date=2016-10-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also well known for writing on a wide variety of current events including the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] recount controversy, [[Bill Clinton]]'s affair with [[Monica Lewinsky]]&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; and his resulting impeachment procedure,&lt;ref&gt;See {{smallcaps|Richard A.

Fletcher debate|publisher=Columbia School of Law|access-date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His analysis of the [[Lewinsky scandal]] cut across most party and ideological divisions. Posner's greatest influence is through his writings on law and economics; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called him "one of the most important [[antitrust]] scholars of the past half-century." In December 2004, Posner started a joint [[blog]] with [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Gary Becker]], titled simply "The Becker-Posner Blog".&lt;ref name="posner becker"&gt;{{cite news

Posner - Authors - The Atlantic |publisher=Correspondents.theatlantic.com |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner was mentioned in 2005 as a [[George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates|potential nominee]] to replace [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] because of his prominence as a scholar and an appellate judge. Robert S. Boynton wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that he believed Posner would never sit on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] because despite his "obvious brilliance," he would be criticized for his occasionally "outrageous conclusions," such as his contention "that the [[rule of law]] is an accidental and dispensable element of legal ideology," his argument that buying and selling children on the [[free market]] would lead to better outcomes than the present situation, government-regulated [[adoption]], and his support for the legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[LSD]].&lt;ref name=Boynton&gt;Boynton, Robert S.

'''Posner on Posner Series'''

Judge Posner was the focus of a "series" of posts (many Q&amp;A interviews with the Judge) done by University of Washington Law Professor [[Ronald K. L. Collins]]. The twelve posts—collectively titled "Posner on Posner"—began on November 24, 2014 and ended on January 5, 2015 and appeared on the Concurring Opinions blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Collins | first = Ronald K.

==Legal and philosophical positions==

[[File:Posneratftc.jpg|thumb|275px|Judge Posner making a dinner speech at the [[Federal Trade Commission]].]]

In Posner's youth and in the 1960s as law clerk to William J. Brennan he was generally counted as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. However, in reaction to some of the perceived excesses of the late 1960s, Posner developed a strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] bent. He encountered [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] economists [[Aaron Director]] and [[George Stigler]] while a professor at [[Stanford]].&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt; Posner summarized his views on law and economics in his 1973 book ''The Economic Analysis of Law''.&lt;ref name="cnn1" /&gt;

Today, although generally viewed as to [[Right-wing politics|the right]] in academia, Posner's [[pragmatism]], his qualified [[moral relativism]] and [[moral skepticism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Posner |title=The Problematics of Moral and Legal Theory |volume=111 |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |issue=7 |pages=1637, 1642–46 |year=1998 |jstor=1342477 |doi=10.2307/1342477 }} (clarifying his moral positions)&lt;/ref&gt; and his affection for the thought of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] set him apart from most American conservatives.  As a judge, with the exception of his rulings with respect to the sentencing guidelines and the recording of police actions, Posner's judicial votes have always placed him on the moderate-to-liberal wing of the Republican Party, where he has become more isolated over time. In July 2012, Posner stated, "I've become less conservative since the Republican Party started becoming goofy."&lt;ref&gt;Nina Totenberg, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/07/05/156319272/federal-judge-richard-posner-the-gop-has-made-me-less-conservative Federal Judge Richard Posner: The GOP Has Made Me Less Conservative] [[NPR]], July 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Among Posner's judicial influences are the American jurists [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] and [[Learned Hand]].

In June 2016, Posner was criticized by right-wing media organizations for a column he wrote for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in which he stated, "I see absolutely no value to a judge of spending decades, years, months, weeks, day, hours, minutes, or seconds studying the Constitution, the history of its enactment, its amendments, and its implementation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2016/supreme_court_breakfast_table_for_june_2016/law_school_professors_need_more_practical_experience.html?wpsrc=sh_all_mob_tw_top|title=Supreme Court Breakfast Table|first=Richard A.|last=Posner|date=June 24, 2016|work=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/federal-judge-u-s-constitution-is-outdated-judges-should-stop-studying-it/|title=Federal Judge: U.S. Constitution Is Outdated, Judges Should Stop Studying It|website=www.mediaite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has called his approach to judging pragmatic. "I pay very little attention to legal rules, statutes, constitutional provisions. ... A case is just a dispute. The first thing you do is ask yourself—forget about the law—what is a sensible resolution of this dispute? The next thing ... is to see if a recent Supreme Court precedent or some other legal obstacle stood in the way of ruling in favor of that sensible resolution. And the answer is that's actually rarely the case. When you have a Supreme Court case or something similar, they're often extremely easy to get around."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/us/politics/judge-richard-posner-retirement.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F09%2F11%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fjudge-richard-posner-retirement.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click Posner retirement]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===

Posner has written several opinions sympathetic to [[abortion rights]], including a decision that held that late term abortion was constitutionally protected in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alissa J. Rubin|Rubin, Alissa]] (1999-02-11) [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/11/news/mn-7143 Anti-Abortion Advocates Gain Ground in Late-Term Debate], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 Posner authored a decision in ''Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Schimel'' striking down regulations on abortion clinics in Wisconsin.  He rejected the state's argument that the laws were written to protect the health of women and not to make abortion more difficult to obtain.  Accusing the state of indirectly trying to ban abortions in the state Posner wrote, "They [Wisconsin] may do this in the name of protecting the health of women who have abortions, yet as in this case the specific measures they support may do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin v. Brad Schimel|url=http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2015/D11-23/C:15-1736:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1661222:S:0|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal rights===

Posner rejects the concept of animal rights. He recognizes the philosophical force of arguments for animal rights, but maintains that human intuition about the paramount value of human life makes it impossible to accommodate an ethic of animal rights.

Posner engaged in a debate with the philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in 2001 at ''[[Slate magazine]]'', in which Posner argued against restricting the use of animals for food and in scientific experimentation. He agreed that gratuitous cruelty to animals should be avoided, but contends that animal welfare should only be advanced where doing so provides a marginal benefit to society.

Posner argues that animal rights conflict with the moral relevance of humanity and that empathy for pain and suffering of animals does not supersede advancing society.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;"[http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/interviews-debates/200106--.htm Animal Rights: debate between Peter Singer &amp; Richard Posner]." Compendium of comments originally posted on ''[http://www.slate.com Slate]'' in 2001, collected and re-posted on ''[http://www.utilitarian.net Utilitarian Philosophers]'' in June 2001. Accessed 2017-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He further argues that he trusts his moral intuition until it is shown to be wrong and that his moral intuition says that "it is wrong to give as much weight to a dog's pain as to an infant's pain." He further states that people whose opinions were changed by consideration of the ethics presented in Singer's book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' failed to see the "radicalism of the ethical vision that powers [their] view on animals, an ethical vision that finds greater value in a healthy pig than in a profoundly retarded child, that commands inflicting a lesser pain on a human being to avert a greater pain to a dog, and that, provided only that a chimpanzee has 1 percent of the mental ability of a normal human being, would require the sacrifice of the human being to save 101 chimpanzees."&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

In a 2002 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article, Posner again criticized animal rights. The article begins as a book review but then dispenses with and departs from the arguments made in the book. In the article, Posner argues that using the cognitive ability of animals compared to that of very young normal human beings as a basis for rights-worthiness is arbitrary and in contrast with major traditional and contemporary philosophies (including the theology of [[Thomas Acquinas]] for one and [[Utilitarianism]] for another). In addition, he points out that this basis for rights has problematic implications&amp;mdash;including that it might soon make some computers more worthy of rights than some humans, a conclusion he calls absurd. Posner goes on to reason that granting human-like rights to animals is fraught with implications which could radically disrupt or devalue the rights of human beings. He alludes to Hitler's zoophilia as evidence that respect for animals and humaneness toward human beings are not necessarily associated. Arguing that the analogy of animal rights to the civil rights movement lacks imagination and is not very apt, Posner posits that animal welfare might be better protected by other legal models, one example of which would be stronger laws making animals property, since, he asserts, people tend to protect what they own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/378_vgs9bdkn.pdf|title=Animal Rights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antitrust===

Along with [[Robert Bork]], Posner helped shape the antitrust policy changes of the 1970s through his idea that 1960s antitrust laws were in fact making prices higher for the consumer rather than lower, while he viewed lower prices as the essential end goal of any antitrust policy.&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; Posner's and Bork's theories on antitrust evolved into the prevailing view in academia and at the Justice Department of the George H. W. Bush  Administration.&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt;

===''The Bluebook''===

''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook]]'' is the style guide which prescribes the most widely used legal citation system in the United States. Posner is "one of the founding fathers of ''Bluebook'' abolitionism, having advocated it for almost twenty-five years, ever since his 1986 ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1599750|title=Goodbye to the Bluebook|first=Richard A.|last=Posner|date=July 29, 1986|publisher=|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1343–1368|doi=10.2307/1599750}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject."&lt;ref name=VC&gt;Somin, Ilya (2011-01-25) [http://volokh.com/2011/01/25/richard-posner-on-the-bluebook/ Richard Posner on the Bluebook], ''[[Volokh Conspiracy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation'' exemplifies hypertrophy in the anthropological sense. It is a monstrous growth, remote from the functional need for legal citation forms, that serves obscure needs of the legal culture and its student subculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/review/the-bluebook-blues The ''Bluebook'' Blues, 120 Yale L.J. 850 (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He describes those needs as unrelated to practical legal activity but instead as social and political.

In the same article, Posner gives an excerpt of the entire citation style guide included (as an appendix) in the short manual he gives his own legal clerks (who he describes as "very smart"); the appendix is about 2-3 pages long, and he says the entire manual is about 1% as long as the Bluebook.

===Drugs===

Posner opposes the U.S. "[[War on Drugs]]" and called it "[[quixotism|quixotic]]". In a 2003 [[CNBC]] interview he discussed the difficulty of enforcing criminal [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] laws, and asserted that it is hard to justify the criminalization of marijuana when compared to other substances.  In a talk at [[Elmhurst College]] in 2012, Posner said that "I don't think that we should have a fraction of the drug laws that we have.  I think it's really absurd to be criminalizing possession or use or distribution of marijuana."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=AhBBV0aI7lM#t=3247s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal rules ===
In an interview with [[Adam Liptak]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' after announcing his retirement, Posner says he pays "very little attention to legal rules":

{{quote|I pay very little attention to legal rules, statutes, constitutional provisions," Judge Posner said. "A case is just a dispute. The first thing you do is ask yourself—forget about the law—what is a sensible resolution of this dispute?

The next thing, he said, was to see if a recent Supreme Court precedent or some other legal obstacle stood in the way of ruling in favor of that sensible resolution. "And the answer is that's actually rarely the case," he said. "When you have a Supreme Court case or something similar, they're often extremely easy to get around.}}

=== National security ===
At the ''Cybercrime 2020: The Future of Online Crime and Investigations'' conference held at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] on November 20, 2014, Posner, in addition to further reinforcing his views on privacy being over-rated, stated that "If the NSA wants to vacuum all the trillions of bits of information that are crawling through the electronic worldwide networks, I think that's fine. ... Much of what passes for the name of privacy is really just trying to conceal the disreputable parts of your conduct," Posner added. "Privacy is mainly about trying to improve your social and business opportunities by concealing the sorts of bad activities that would cause other people not to want to deal with you." Posner also criticized [[mobile OS]] companies for enabling [[end-to-end encryption]] in their newest software. "I'm shocked at the thought that a company would be permitted to manufacture an electronic product that the government would not be able to search" he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Judge: Give NSA unlimited access to digital data |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2855776/judge-give-nsa-unlimited-access-to-digital-data.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers===

Posner supported the creation of a law barring [[hyperlinks]] or [[paraphrasing of copyrighted material]] as a means to prevent what he views as [[free riding]] on newspaper journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Patent and copyright law===

Posner has expressed concerns, on the blog he contributed to with Gary Becker,  that both patent and copyright protection, though particularly the former, may be excessive. He argues that the cost of inventing must be compared to the cost of copying in order to determine the optimal patent protection for an inventor. When patent protection is too strongly in favor of the inventor, market efficiency is decreased. He illustrates his argument by comparing the pharmaceutical industry (where the cost on invention is high) with the software industry (where the cost of invention is relatively low).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Police recording===

As part of a three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit in Chicago, weighing a challenge to the Illinois Eavesdropping Act, which bars the secret recording of conversations without the consent of all the parties to the conversation, Posner was to deliver another memorable quote. At issue was the constitutionality of the Illinois wiretapping law, which makes it illegal to record someone without consent even when filming public acts like arrests in public. Posner interrupted the [[ACLU]] after just 14 words, stating, "Yeah, I know. But I'm not interested, really, in what you want to do with these recordings of peoples' encounters with the police. ..." Posner continued: "Once all this stuff can be recorded, there's going to be a lot more of this snooping around by reporters and bloggers. ... I'm always suspicious when the civil liberties people start telling the police how to do their business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Prisoners===

In a dissent from an earlier ruling by his protégé [[Frank Easterbrook]], Posner wrote that Easterbrook's decision that female guards could watch male prisoners while in the shower or bathroom must stem from a belief that prisoners are "members of a different species, indeed as a type of [[vermin]], devoid of [[human dignity]] and entitled to no respect.... I do not myself consider the 1.5 million inmates of American prisons and jails in that light."&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Johnson v. Phelan'', 69 F.3d 144, 151 (7th Cir. 1995) (Posner, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and public education===

Posner's views of public education policy are informed by his view that groups of students differ in intellectual ability, and therefore, that it is faulty to impose uniform educational standards on all schools. His view in this regard is undergirded by his view that different races differ in intelligence. (However, Posner says that he thinks it is "highly unlikely" that these differences are rooted in genetics, rather than environment.)

In a blog post, Posner wrote, "I suggest that the only worthwhile reforms of teacher compensation are raising teacher wages uniformly, providing recognition and modest bonuses for outstanding teachers, and increasing hiring standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rating Teachers - Posner|url=http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2012/09/rating-teachersposner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same post, he wrote, "I am not clear what we should think the problem of American education (below the college level) is. Most children of middle-class... Americans are white or Asian and attend good public or private schools, usually predominantly white. The average white IQ is of course 100 and the Asian (like the Jewish) almost one standard deviation higher, that is, 115. The average black IQ is 85, a full standard deviation below the white average, and the average Hispanic IQ has been estimated recently at 89. Black children in particular often come from disordered households, which has a negative effect on ability to learn and perhaps indeed on IQ.... Increasingly, black and Hispanic students find themselves in schools with few white or Asian students. The challenge to American education is to provide a useful education to the large number of Americans who are unlikely to benefit from a college education or from high school courses aimed at preparing students for college."

===Same-sex marriage===

In September 2014, Posner authored the opinions in the consolidated cases of ''[[Wolf v. Walker]]'' and ''[[Baskin v. Bogan]]'' challenging Wisconsin and Indiana's state level same-sex marriage bans.  The opinion of the three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that [[Indiana]] and [[Wisconsin]]'s bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional, affirming a lower court ruling.&lt;ref name="South Bend Voice"/&gt; During oral arguments, Wisconsin's Attorney General cited tradition as a reason for maintaining the ban, prompting Posner to note that: "It was tradition to not allow blacks and whites to marry – a tradition that got swept away." Though Posner argued in his 1992 book ''[[Sex and Reason]]'' that prohibitions against gay marriage were rationally justified, he held  in the 2014 cases that the [[same-sex marriage]] bans were both "a tradition of hate" and "savage discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Kyle|title=Appeals Court Judge Calls Indiana's Same-Sex Marriage Ban 'Tradition of Hate'|url=http://southbendvoice.com/2014/08/26/appeals-court-judge-calls-indianas-same-sex-marriage-ban-tradition-of-hate/|accessdate=4 September 2014|publisher=South Bend Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Posner wrote the opinion for the unanimous panel, finding the laws unconstitutional under the [[Equal Protection Clause]].  The Supreme Court then denied writ of certiorari and left Posner's ruling to stand.

==Judicial career==
Posner is one of the most prolific legal writers, through both the number and topical breadth of his opinions, to say nothing of his scholarly and popular writings.&lt;ref name="wsj2"&gt;{{cite news

In 1999, Posner was welcomed as a private [[mediation|mediator]] among the parties involved in the [[United States v. Microsoft|Microsoft antitrust case]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

A study published by Fred Shapiro in the University of Chicago's ''The Journal of Legal Studies'' found Posner is the most-cited legal scholar of all time by a considerable margin, as Posner's work has generated 7,981 cites compared to the runner-up [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s 4,488 cites.&lt;ref name=ShapiroJLS/&gt; Aside from the sheer volume of his output, Posner's opinions enjoy great respect from other judges, based on citations, and within the legal academy, where his opinions are taught in many foundational law courses.

===Notable cases===
In his decision in the 1997 case ''[[State Oil Co. v. Khan]]'', Posner wrote that a ruling 1968 antitrust precedent set by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] was "moth-eaten", "wobbly", and "unsound".&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; Nevertheless, he abided by the previous decision with his ruling.&lt;ref name="cnn1"/&gt; The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] and overturned the 1968 ruling unanimously; [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] wrote the opinion and spoke positively of both Posner's criticism and his decision to abide by the ruling until the Court decided to change it.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news

In 1999, Posner applied the ''[[lex loci delicti commissi]]'' rule on [[choice of law]] rather than the [[Restatement of Torts, Second]] when rejecting a claim by an Illinois dentist who [[slip and fall|slipped and fell]] in [[Acapulco]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Jack L.|last2=Sykes|first2=Alan O.|title=''Lex Loci Delictus'' and Global Economic Welfare: ''Spinozzi v.

====Contract law====
In ''Morin Building Products Co. v. Baystone Construction, Inc.''

====Civil rights====
In 1984, Posner wrote for the ''[[en banc]]'' circuit when it held that a [[consent decree]] regulating law enforcement [[Red Squad]]s did not apply to FBI terrorism investigations, over the dissent of Judge [[Richard Dickson Cudahy]]. In January 2001, Posner loosened that consent decree to allow the Chicago Police Department to conduct counterterrorism operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vermeule|first1=Adrian|authorlink1=Adrian Vermeule|title=Posner on Security and Liberty: ''Alliance to End Repression v.

In ''United States v. Marshall'' (1990), Posner dissented when [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], writing for the ''en banc'' circuit, held that the punishment for possession of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] is determined by the weight of the carrier it is found within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manning|first1=John F.|authorlink1=John F.

In 1995, Posner, joined by Judge [[Walter J. Cummings Jr.]], affirmed an injunction blocking Illinois from closing schools on [[Good Friday]] as a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]], over the dissent of Judge [[Daniel Anthony Manion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minow|first1=Martha|authorlink1=Martha Minow|title=Religion and the Burdon of Proof: Posner's Economics and Pragmatism in ''Metzl v.

==Awards and honors==
A 2004 poll by ''Legal Affairs'' magazine named Posner as one of the top twenty legal thinkers in the U.S.&lt;ref name="legal affairs"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Legal Affairs|title= Who Are the Top 20 Legal Thinkers in America?|url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/poll/|accessdate =May 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Posner and his wife, Charlene Horn, have lived in Hyde Park, Chicago, for many years. His son [[Eric Posner]] is also a prominent legal scholar and teaches at the [[University of Chicago Law School]]. Posner is a self-described "cat person" and is devoted to his [[Maine Coon]], Pixie.&lt;ref name="dailybeast"&gt;{{cite news

The '''Right2Know Campaign''' is a [[South African]] non-profit advocacy organisation established in 2010 to reduce state secrecy in the drafting of laws, increase [[access to information]], and protect [[freedom of expression]] especially on the internet.  As part of this the campaign monitors and challenges potential legislation that it believes would infringe on [[personal liberties]] and [[transparent government]].  It is the first such organisation of its kind in post-Apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref name="Right2Knowabout" /&gt;

== Activism ==
Notable events that the Right2Know Campaign as been directly involved in include organising protests for investigations into corporate and government corruption,&lt;ref name="MTNramaphosa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201510140232.html | title=South Africa: R2K Protest for Investigation Into MTN and Ramaphosa Corruption Allegations | publisher=All Africa | date=14 October 2015 | accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; protect [[whistle-blowers]],&lt;ref name="ANCmedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://citizen.co.za/834158/anc-must-give-info-on-media/ | title=ANC ‘must give info on media’ | publisher=The Citizen | date=9 September 2013 | accessdate=7 November 2015 | author=Yadhana Jadoo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and campaigns to increase government accountability.

A significant success of the campaign was the calling for&lt;ref name="TimesKeyPoint"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2014/11/23/right2know-wants-national-key-points-revealed | title=Right2Know wants National Key Points revealed | publisher=Times Live | date=23 November 2014 | accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventual publication by government&lt;ref name="PolwebKeyP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/party/list-of-national-key-points-released--saharight2kn | title=R2K &amp; SAHA welcome Police Ministry's decision to release the National Key Points | publisher=Right2Know &amp; South African History Archive | date=23 January 2015 | accessdate=7 November 2015 | author=Catherine Kennedy and Murray Hunter}}&lt;/ref&gt; of South Africa's list of [[List of National Key Points|national key points]], thereby informing the public of which government locations in South Africa were forbidden to photograph.  It was claimed by government that the controversial security upgrades to President [[Jacob Zuma|Jacob Zuma's]] homestead, [[Nkandla (homestead)|Nkandla]], was justified as it was a listed national key point.&lt;ref name="TimesKeyPoint" /&gt;

In October 2015 South African State Security officials issued a statement to the South African parliament accusing the Right2Know Campaign of being an agent for foreign governments and the US government in particular.  The Right2Know campaign denied the accusations whilst stating that it openly publishes all of its financials to the public which indicate no such link and condemned the accusation as an example of the growing securitisation of the South African parliament.  It went on to point out that the South African security establishment have previously used such accusations in the past to try and explain public discontent by blaming a range of non-government organisations as foreign agents.&lt;ref name="R2Kaccused"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201510200469.html | title=South Africa: R2K Response to the Securocrats - We Aren't Hiding! | publisher=All Africa | date=18 October 2015 | accessdate=7 November 2015 | author=Right2Know Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Euthanasia}}

[[File:Euthanasia machine (Australia).JPG|thumb|right|This [[euthanasia device]] was invented by Dr [[Philip Nitschke]]. Four terminally-ill Australians used it to end their lives with a lethal dose of drugs after they answered "yes" to a series of questions on the lap-top screen. This procedure was legal in Australia's Northern Territory between 1995 and 1997.]]

The '''''Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995''''' (NT)&lt;ref name=Act&gt;[http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/parliamentary-business/committees/rotti/rotti95.pdf Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (NT)]&lt;/ref&gt; was a controversial [[law]] legalising [[euthanasia]] in the [[Northern Territory]], which was passed by the [[Northern Territory Parliament|Parliament]] of the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]] in 1995. The Act was passed by the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] on 25 May 1995 by a vote of 15 to 10, received the Administrator's assent on 16 June 1995, and entered into force on 1 July 1996. A year later, a repeal bill was brought before the Northern Territory Parliament in August 1996, but was defeated by 14 votes to 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrtd.net/euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide-australia|title=Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide in Australia|publisher=The World Federation of Right to Die Societies|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effect of the law was nullified in 1997 by the federal [[Parliament of Australia]] which passed the ''[[Euthanasia Laws Act 1997]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw%5Cmanagement.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200403820?OpenDocument |title=Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 |publisher=www.comlaw.gov.au |accessdate=6 January 2009 |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act continues on the Territory's statute books. Dr [[Philip Nitschke]] founded [[Exit International]] in response to the overturning of the Act.

While voluntary euthanasia had previously been condoned officially in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon, the act was the first time that a legislative assembly passed a law explicitly legalising euthanasia.&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zinn C |title=Australia passes first euthanasia law |journal=BMJ |volume=310 |issue=6992 |pages=1427–8 |date=June 1995 |pmid=7613271 |pmc=2549853 |doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6992.1427a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of Act==
The Act allowed a terminally ill patient to end their life with medical assistance, either by the direct involvement of a physician or by procurement of drugs. 

The Act set out a somewhat lengthy application process, designed to ensure that a patient was both mentally competent to make the decision and in fact terminally ill. Under the Act:

* a patient had to be over 18 and be mentally and physically competent to request his or her own death,
* the request had to be supported by three doctors, including a specialist who confirmed that the patient was terminally ill and a psychiatrist who certified that the patient was not suffering from treatable depression,
* once the paperwork was complete, a nine-day "cooling-off period" was required before the death could proceed.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/02/world/legal-euthanasia-australia-faces-a-grim-reality.html &lt;!--https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E4DD133DF931A35751C0A961958260--&gt; |title=Legal Euthanasia: Australia Faces a Grim Reality |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Mydans |first=Seth | date=2 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who assist in the ending of a person's life under the Act were immune from prosecution or other legal consequences if acting in good faith. (Sections 16 and 20).&lt;ref name=Act /&gt;

==Reaction to Act==
The passage of the Bill&amp;mdash;one of the first of its kind in the world&amp;mdash;provoked a furor in Australia, and indeed in much of the rest of the world. The Act received both widespread support from "death with dignity" and [[right to die]] groups who saw it as a model to be followed elsewhere, and widespread condemnation from euthanasia opponents, such as [[right to life]] groups, who sought to overturn it.

Opponents also included the [[Australian Medical Association]],&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt; and the Bishop of Darwin, [[Edmund John Patrick Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneycatholic.org/news/latest_news/2014/2014811_1975.shtml|title=Northern Territory Mourns Death of Darwin's Much-loved "Bishop Ted"|publisher=Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney |date=2014-08-11|accessdate=2014-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of Act==
While the law was in effect, four people died by suicide through its provisions.

The first was carpenter Bob Dent, 66, who died on 22 September 1996. Dent was a [[prostate cancer]] sufferer who became Australia's first person to lawfully end his life by means of [[Assisted suicide|physician assisted suicide]]. Dent, who had been suffering from prostate cancer for five years in what he called "a rollercoaster of pain", left an open letter when he died that stated: "If I were to keep a pet animal in the same condition I am in, I would be prosecuted. If you disagree with voluntary euthanasia, then don't use it, but don't deny the right to me to use it."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; He died with the help of Dr [[Philip Nitschke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrtd.net/faqs/factsheets/?id=164 |title=Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide in Australia |accessdate=23 March 2008 |format= |work=The World Federation of Right to Die Societies |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080201030028/http://www.worldrtd.net/faqs/factsheets/?id=164 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law applied to non-residents of the Northern Territory as well, and one non-resident did take advantage of the law.  A resident of South Australia, Janet Mills, 52, came to Darwin in December 1996. She had suffered for some 10 years from a rare disease known as [[mycosis fungoides]]. She used Nitschke's device to take her life on 2 January 1997.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

In addition, an anonymous 69-year-old male cancer patient used the law and Nitschke's device to die on 22 January 1997. A further two people had received approval to use the law when the law was nullified; a proposed amendment to the ''Voluntary Euthanasia Laws Bill'' allowing them to proceed did not pass.

==Overturning of the Act==
While some people in the Northern Territory were unhappy with the Act and campaigned for its repeal, the Northern Territory legislature was unwavering in its support. Views in the rest of Australia were much less supportive, however, and opponents began demanding that the [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] overturn the law, which it had the power to do since the Northern Territory does not have the same standing in Australian jurisprudence as the states. The federal parliament could not have overturned an identical state law, since the states are sovereign entities possessing legislative power in their own right. However, self-governing territories like the Northern Territory derive their power by way of a grant from the federal parliament. Consequently, the federal parliament retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the right to territory laws. In practice, it very rarely exercised that right.

On 25 March 1997, the federal parliament passed the ''[[Euthanasia Laws Act 1997]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw%5Cmanagement.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200403820?OpenDocument |title=Euthanasia Laws Act 1997 |publisher=www.comlaw.gov.au |accessdate=6 January 2009 |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, although not technically repealing the ''Rights of the Terminally Ill Act'', for all practical purposes rendered it of no legal effect. Rather than repeal the Act directly, the law instead amended the ''[[Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978]]'', the act under which the Commonwealth Parliament has delegated legislative power to the Northern Territory Parliament—effectively the territory's "constitution" or "charter"—removing the Territory's constitutional power to pass any law permitting euthanasia. The Act technically remains in force in the Territory, but to the extent that it permits euthanasia it is now invalid and of no legal effect.

Although passed as a reaction to the situation in the Northern Territory, the ''Euthanasia Laws Act 1997'' made similar amendments with respect to Australia's two other self-governing territories, the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Norfolk Island]], also preventing them from passing a law permitting euthanasia. The ''Euthanasia Laws Act 1997'' has no effect on the power of an Australian state to pass any law permitting euthanasia, and it expressly leaves open the possibility of a territory passing laws regarding the withholding of [[life support]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5184">'''Sewa Day''' is an international [[Volunteering|volunteer]] day and annual event celebrated primarily by [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]]-affiliated groups. It is celebrated a Sunday of October.

==Background==

''Sewa'', also ''Seva'', is short for the word ''[[Kar seva|Kar Seva]]'', which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''kar'', meaning hands or work, and ''seva'', meaning service.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |first=H. S. |last=Singha |publisher=Hemkunt Press |year=2000 |ISBN=8170103010 |p=121}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Image journeys: audio-visual media and cultural change in India |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Christiane Brosius, Melissa Butcher |year=1999 |publisher=Sage Publications |location= |isbn=978-0-7619-9325-4 |page=134 |pages= |url=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], the word ''seva'' also means "to worship, to adore, to pay homage through the act of love". In the writings of Sikh gurus, these two meanings of ''seva'' (service and worship) have been merged. ''Seva'' is expected to be a labour of love performed without desire and intention, and with humility.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Labour of love: Kar seva at Darbar Sahib's Amrit Sarover |first=Gurmit Singh |last=Virdee |journal=Sikh Formations: Religion, Culture, Theory |volume=1 |number=1 |pp=13–28 |DOI=10.1080/17448720500231409}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kar seva'' is often translated as "voluntary labour". In the Punjabi language the person performing such service is called a ''Sevadar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Seva Sikhi Wiki Seva definition], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewa Day was launched in 2010 by a nonprofit of the same name, a charity registered in [[England]] &amp; [[Wales]] (No. 4446848).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewaday.org/about-sewa-day//  Sewa Day About Us], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewaday.org/facts/  Sewa Day Facts], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The first six Sewa Days were held on the first Sunday of October. This will change in 2016:

Participating groups have organised Sewa Day volunteering projects in old peoples’ homes, homeless shelters, schools in disadvantaged areas, hospitals and hospices, parks, conservation areas and farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhsf.org.uk/sewa-day/  What is Sewa Day], National Hindu Students' Forum (UK), accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, over 75,000 volunteers took part in over 25 countries resulting in more than 561,000 volunteering hours. Sewa Day has taken place in the following countries:
* [[Asia]]: [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]]

'''ShadowCrew''' was a [[cybercrime]] [[message board]] ([[Internet forum|forum]]) that operated under the domain name ShadowCrew.com between August 2002 – November 2004.&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_22/b3935001_mz001.htm |date=May 30, 2005 |author=Brian Grow, with Jason Bush |title=Hacker Hunters: An elite force takes on the dark side of computing  |publisher=BusinessWeek |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shadowcrewscreenshot.jpg|thumb|This screenshot was taken 11/02/2004 at 4:33AM immediately after ShadowCrew forum was infiltrated by the Secret service.]]

==Origins==
The concept of the ShadowCrew was developed in early 2002 during a series of chat sessions between Brett Johnson (Gollumfun), Seth Sanders (Kidd), and Kim Marvin Taylor (MacGyver). The ShadowCrew website also contained a number of sub-forums where the latest information about hacking tricks, social engineering, credit card fraud, virus development, scams, and phishing.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Organizational structure==
ShadowCrew offered a haven for DarkWayne, TonyEffe and la dpg caramelle and oxy [[Security hacker|hackers]] to trade, buy, and sell anything from [[identity theft|stolen personal information]], to hacked [[credit card numbers]] and false identification.  ShadowCrew emerged from another underground site, [[counterfeitlibrary.com]] which was ran by Brett Johnson, in early 2002. and would be followed up by [[carderplanet.com]] owned by [[:uk:Dmitry Golubov|Dmitry Golubov]] a.k.a. Script, a website primarily in the Russian language. The site also facilitated the sale of drugs wholesale.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

During its early years, the site was hosted overseas, in [[Hong Kong]], but shortly before CumbaJohnny ([[Albert Gonzalez]])'s arrest, the server was in his possession, somewhere in [[New Jersey]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Aftermath and legacy==
ShadowCrew was the forerunner of NEVER cybercrime forums and marketplaces. The structure, marketplace, review system, and other innovations began with Shadowcrew laid the basis of today's underground forums and marketplaces.  Likewise, many of today's current scams and computer crimes began with Counterfeitlibrary and Shadowcrew.
The site flourished from the time it opened in 2002 until its demise in late October 2004.

$4 million in losses is the believed amount dealt with through this forum. This figure was arrived at by multiplying the number of credit cards transferred by $500 each (as per federal law when no monetary figure in a fraud case can be determined). This figure assumes that every single card was valid and had been used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussc.gov/2004guid/2b1_1.htm 2004 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual - Chapter 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925234919/http://www.ussc.gov/2004guid/2b1_1.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dollar figure quoted only pertains to the evidence gathered by the VPN employed and the members.  Actual dollar figure is potentially much higher due to the fact that the $500 per card federal law wasn't in existence until after federal agents took down the site.&lt;ref name="From Brett Johnson, a.k.a.

ShadowCrew admin [[Brett Shannon Johnson]] managed to avoid being arrested following the 2004 raids, but was picked up in 2005 on separate charges, in which he then turned informant for the Secret Service. Continuing to commit tax fraud as an informant, 'Operation Anglerphish' embedded him, then dubbed by Secret Service agents as "The Original Internet Godfather", as admins on both ScandinavianCarding and CardersMarket. When his continued carding activities were exposed as a part of a separate investigation in 2006, he briefly went on the run and made the USA Most Wanted List before being caught in August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zetter|first1=Kim|title=Secret Service Operative Moonlights as Identity Thief|url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/2007/06/secret_service?currentPage=all|accessdate=16 August 2015|date=6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sod''' or '''turf''' is [[grass]] and the part of the [[soil]] beneath it held together by its [[root]]s or another piece of thin material.

In [[British English]], such material is more usually known as ''turf'', and the word "sod" is limited mainly to agricultural senses.

== Uses ==
Sod is typically used for [[lawn]]s, [[golf course]]s, and [[Stadium|sports stadiums]] around the world. In residential construction, it is sold to [[landscaping|landscapers]], home builders or home owners who use it to establish a [[lawn]] quickly and avoid [[soil erosion]]. Sod can be used to repair a small area of lawn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/lawn_garden/home_gardening/lawn/cultural_information/Use+Sod+For+Quick+Repair+Of+Damaged+Lawns.htm|title=Use Sod For Quick Repair Of Damaged Lawns|publisher=Louisiana State University, Agricultural Center, Research and Extension|accessdate=1 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929175003/http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/lawn_garden/home_gardening/lawn/cultural_information/Use+Sod+For+Quick+Repair+Of+Damaged+Lawns.htm|archive-date=29 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Golf course turf|golf course]], or [[athletic field]] that has died. Sod is also effective in increasing cooling, improving air and water quality, and assisting in [[flood prevention]] by draining water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Sod is Good for the Planet|url=http://www.freshsod.com/blog/entry/why-sod-is-good-for-the-planet|publisher=Sod Growers Council|accessdate=14 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018042126/http://www.freshsod.com/blog/entry/why-sod-is-good-for-the-planet|archive-date=18 October 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scandinavia]] has a long history of employing [[sod roof]]ing and a traditional house type is the [[Icelandic turf house]].

Following the passage of the [[Homestead Acts#Homestead Act of 1862|Homestead Act]] by Congress in 1862, settlers in the [[Great Plains]] used sod bricks to build entire [[sod house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life in a Sod House|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/ourstory/activities/sodhouse/|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was effective because the prairie sod of the [[Great Plains]] was so dense and difficult to cut it earned the nickname "[[Nebraska]] marble". Blacksmith [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] made his fortune when he became the first to make a [[Plough|plow]] that could reliably cut the prairie sod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tallgrass Prairie: An Endangered Landscape|url=http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/prairie/review4.php|publisher=CSA|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==

Sod is grown on specialist farms. For 2009, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] reported 1,412 farms had {{convert|368188|acre|ha|1}} of sod in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table 29. Sod, Sprigs, and Plugs Sold: 2009|url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/Census_of_Horticulture_Specialties/hortic_2_029_029.pdf|publisher=Us Dept. of Agriculture|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually grown locally (within 100 miles of the target market)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sod Production: From an Economic Standpoint|url=http://turf.missouri.edu/stat/reports/sodecon.htm|publisher=MU Plant Sciences, University of Missouri|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to minimize both the cost of transport and also the risk of damage to the product. The farms that produce this grass may have many varieties of grass grown in one location to best suit the consumer's use and preference of appearance.

It is usually harvested 10 to 18 months after planting, depending on the growing climate. On the farm, it undergoes fertilization, frequent mowing, watering, and subsequent vacuuming to remove the clippings. It is harvested using specialized equipment, precision cut to standardized sizes. Sod is typically harvested in small square or rectangular slabs, or large {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} rolls.

[[Mississippi State University]] has developed a [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] method of cultivating sod. For the very few sod farms that export turf internationally, this soilless sod may travel both lighter and better than traditional sod. Additionally, since the sod is not grown in soil, it does not need to be washed clean of soil down to the bare roots (or sprigs), so time to export is shortened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ratliff|first=Bob|title=MSU-Developed Sod|url=http://www.dafvm.msstate.edu/landmarks/06/fall/4-5.pdf|work=Mississippi Landmarks Magazine, Volume 2 Number 4|publisher=Division of Agriculture, Forestry, and Veterinary Medicine at Mississippi State University|accessdate=25 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613190719/http://www.dafvm.msstate.edu/landmarks/06/fall/4-5.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immediacy ==

In many applications, such as [[erosion control]] and athletic fields, immediacy is a key factor. Seed may be blown about by the wind, eaten by birds, or fail because of [[drought]].  It takes some weeks to form a visually appealing lawn and further time before it is robust enough for use. Turf largely avoids these problems, and with proper care, newly laid sod is usually fully functional within 30 days of installation and its root system is comparable to that of a seeding lawn two or three years older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albrightseed.com/sodorseed.htm|title=The High Cost of Instant Gratification; To Sod or to Seed?|publisher=Streamline Publications|accessdate=1 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008203249/http://www.albrightseed.com/sodorseed.htm|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sod reduces [[Soil Erosion|erosion]] by stabilizing the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralsodmd.com/md/green/sodvsseed.jsp|title=Sod vs. Seed|publisher=Central Sod Farms, Inc.|accessdate=1 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008203301/http://www.centralsodmd.com/md/green/sodvsseed.jsp|archivedate=8 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prized cultivars (such as Bella Bluegrass) only reproduce [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shearman; Robert C. |title=US Patent Application Poa pratensis L. named 'NE-KYB-05-001'|url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=1&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PG01&amp;S1=NE-KYB-05-001&amp;OS=NE-KYB-05-001&amp;RS=NE-KYB-05-001|publisher=US Patent Office|accessdate=27 March 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; not [[Sexual reproduction|sexually]] (via seed). Sod cultivation is the only means of producing additional plants. To grow these varieties for sale, turf farms use a technique called [[sprigging]], where recently harvested sod mats are cut into slender rows and replanted in the field.

== Cultivars used ==

=== Fescue grass ===

==== Tall fescue ====
Tall [[Festuca|fescue]] (''Festuca'' spp.) is a cool-weather group of grasses originating in Europe, commonly used as sod. It exhibits moderate tolerance to both drought and cold, and as such is especially popular in inland temperate environments referred to in the turf and landscaping industries as the "[[Hardiness zone|transition zone]]", where summers are too hot for most cool-weather grasses, yet winters are too cold for most warm-weather grasses. Fescue is well-adapted to clay soils, moderately shade-tolerant, and somewhat resistant to disease, yet still vulnerable to [[brown patch]] and [[Fusarium patch]]. It grows most actively (and thus provides the most desirable appearance) in spring and fall, and required frequent watering during summer. Due to its bunch-type growth habit (unique among common sod grasses), it will not spread undesirably or invade adjacent areas once sodded, yet neither will it fill in voids, and periodic maintenance (such as overseeding with Fescue seed) may be required to sustain a homogeneous surface. It has poor wear tolerance compared to Bermuda grass, making it less popular for applications such as athletic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/content/tall-fescue|title=Tall Fescue {{!}} Department of Horticulture {{!}} Oregon State University|website=horticulture.oregonstate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/turf/publications/tallfesc.html|title=Tall Fescue {{!}} Archives {{!}} Aggie Horticulture|last=Service|first=Martin Anderson, Texas AgriLife Extension|website=aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaex.edu/publications/PDF/FSA-2112.pdf|title=Choosing a Grass for Arkansas Lawns|last=Patton|first=Aaron|last2=Boyd|first2=John|date=|website=University of Arkansas - Division of Agriculture - Cooperative Extension Service|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301154503/https://www.uaex.edu/publications/PDF/FSA-2112.pdf|archive-date=1 March 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fine fescues ====
Fine fescues (''F. rubra'', ''F. ovina, F. trachophylla'') are less popular as sod than the tall fescues. As their names suggest, they exhibit much thinner leaf blades, and tolerate lower mowing heights than the tall fescues. They may be somewhat more resistant to common diseases. Otherwise, their characteristics are similar. Fine Fescues are generally used in mixtures with other grasses.&lt;ref name="horticulture.oregonstate.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/content/fine-fescues|title=The Fine Fescues {{!}} Department of Horticulture {{!}} Oregon State University|website=horticulture.oregonstate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="horticulture.oregonstate.edu"/&gt;

=== Bermuda grass ===
[[Cynodon dactylon|Bermuda grass]] is quite commonly used for golf courses and sports fields across the [[Southern United States|southern portions of the United States]]. It tolerates a range of climates in the U.S., from hot and humid [[lagoon]]s, [[inlet]]s, and [[bay]]s of the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], to the arid expanses of terrain like [[plain]]s and [[Deserts of North America|deserts]] in the [[Southwestern United States|South]] and [[Midwestern United States|lower Midwest]]. "Established bermuda grass is a network of [[shoot]]s, [[rhizome]]s, [[stolon]]s, and [[Crown (botany)|crown tissue]] together that usually form a dense plant canopy. This dense plant canopy can be used to propagate clonal varieties by sod, sprigs, or plugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Taxonomic Key for Selected Turf-Type Bermudagrasses|url=http://www.tarleton.edu/Departments/txjanr/Volumes/Vol%2024%20-%202011/V%2024%20(83-87)%202011-12.pdf|work=Tarleton State University|publisher=Sam Houston State University|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggressive and resilient nature of Bermuda grass makes it not only an excellent [[turfgrass]] but also a challenging and [[invasive weed]] in land cultivated for other purposes. Its one noted weakness is its relatively low tolerance of shade. Given the economic importance of Bermuda grass (as a sod product, agricultural forage, and, at times, as an invasive weed), it has been the subject of numerous studies.

'''Discovery Bermudagrass:'''
:Discovery is a Bermuda grass that has an exceptional dark blue-green color. It also has extremely slow vertical growth which means that it only needs to be mowed once a month. Discovery has the drought resistance of a Bermuda grass but does not need to be maintained as much as other varieties. It was developed in Europe. It was made available in the United States in 2011 by [[Sod Solutions]] which owns the right to market it in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccertifiedsod.org/pages.php?pageid=12 North Carolina Crop Improvement Association (NCCIA)  Certified Sod]&lt;/ref&gt;  It grows well in all of the southern United States.

===Bluegrass===

It was immediately embraced by schools and homeowners in [[Utah]] who are trying to conserve water.&lt;ref&gt;John Hollenhorst [http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705391135/New-variety-of-Kentucky-Bluegrass-could-conserve-water.html?pg=all New variety of Kentucky Bluegrass could conserve water] ''Deseret News'', Retrieved September 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Bella is the world's first dwarf, vegetative bluegrass. It is sold only as sod, not as seed. Bella is a quick grower laterally but has very minimal vertical growth. Because it only grows to about 4 inches in height, it requires less mowing.  It grows in [[sand]], [[clay]], [[Muck (soil)|muck]], and [[Peat soil|peat]] soils, and it is currently being adopted across the [[northern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://turf.unl.edu/extpresentationspdf/IDNLA2011FromBufftoBluet.pdf What’s New From What’s From Buff To Blue: Grasses For a Green Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512144149/http://turf.unl.edu/extpresentationspdf/IDNLA2011FromBufftoBluet.pdf |date=2013-05-12 }} University of Nebraska –Lincoln, Retrieved January 31, 2911{{Clarify|date=December 2017|reason=date is wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== St. Augustine Grass===
[[St. Augustine Grass]] (''Stenotaphrum secundatum'') (also known as Charleston grass in [[South Carolina]] and Buffalo Turf in Australia) is warm-season, [[perennial grass]] that is a widely used. A native grass of tropical origin that extends from [[marsh]]es ([[Saltwater marsh|salt]] &amp; [[Freshwater marsh|freshwater]]), [[Lagoon|lagoon fringes]], and [[Beach ridge|sandy beach ridges]].

St. Augustine lawns are a popular coarse, wide–bladed coarse lawn planted throughout many areas of the [[Southeastern United States]] This grass is found in [[Mexico]], [[Australia]], and in tropical parts of [[Africa]]. It is a warm-season grass that does not handle cold weather very well. The majority of this grass is planted in vegetative forms (such as plugs and sod), as seeds are not usually available due to production difficulties.

'''Captiva St. Augustine:'''
:Developed by the [[University of Florida]] in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;LE Trenholm and  KevinKenworthy [http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/EP/EP39800.pdf  Captiva St. Augustine Grass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} University of Florida&lt;/ref&gt; Captiva is a [[Blissus leucopterus|chinch bug]] resistant St. Augustine [[cultivar]].  It has a lush, dark–green color with a dense canopy and a massive root system.  Because it has a slow leaf–blade growth and lateral spread, the requirement for mowing is reduced. Captiva has a good–excellent shade tolerance and has excellent pest resistance which means there is less need to use pesticides.

=== Centipedegrass ===
'''Covington:'''

{{Punctuation marks|℗}}
The '''sound recording copyright symbol''', represented by the graphic symbol ℗ (a circled capital letter [[P]]), is the [[copyright symbol]] used to provide notice of [[copyright]] in a sound recording (phonogram) embodied in a [[phonorecord]] ([[LP record|LP]]s, [[Tape recorder|audiotape]]s, [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]]s, [[compact disc]]s, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf U.S. Copyright Office Circular 3].&lt;/ref&gt;  Present in Europe since at least the mid-1960s, the use of the symbol in [[Copyright Law of the United States|United States copyright law]]&lt;ref name=notice&gt;Act of Oct. 15, 1971, Pub. L. No. 92-140, 85 Stat. 391, § 1(c) {{UnitedStatesCodeSec|17|402}}.&lt;/ref&gt; after 1971 was codified at [[17 U.S.C.]] § 402 and is specified internationally in the [[Geneva Phonograms Convention|Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/phonograms/trtdocs_wo023.html#P54_4231 Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms], done at Geneva, October 19, 1971, Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''P''' stands for phonogram,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Domain: How to Find &amp; Use Copyright-Free Writings, Music, Art &amp; More |last=Fishman |first=Stephen |year=2012 |publisher=Nolo Press |isbn= 9781413317213 |page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Copyright Guide for Authors |last=Lee |first=Robert E. |year=1995 |publisher=Kent Press |isbn= 9780962710674 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; the legal term used in most English-speaking countries to refer to works known in U.S. copyright law as "sound recordings".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat073107.html Statement of Marybeth Peters], United States Register of Copyrights, before the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary (July 31, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A sound recording has a separate copyright that is distinct from that of the underlying work (usually a musical work, expressible in musical notation and written lyrics), if any.  The sound recording copyright notice extends to a copyright for just the sound itself and will not apply to any other rendition or version, even if performed by the same artist(s).

In the United States, the sound recording copyright notice, which may only be affixed to a phonorecord, consists of three elements: 
# the ℗ symbol;
# the year of first publication of the sound recording;
# an identification of the owner of the copyright, either by name, abbreviation or other designation by which it is generally known.  The identification can be omitted if the owner is the sound recording's producer, and the producer is identified on associated packaging.&lt;ref name=notice/&gt;

The symbol in [[Unicode]] is {{unichar|2117|Sound recording copyright|html=}}, with the alternative names "published" and "phonorecord sign".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Unicode, Inc. |editor=Allen, Julie D.|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 6.1  |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/ |accessdate=July 20, 2012 |year=2012 |isbn=9781936213023 |chapter=Letterlike Symbols; Range: 2100-214F |chapterurl=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2100.pdf |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It closely resembles {{unichar|24c5|circled latin Capital letter P|html=}} and {{unichar|24DF|circled latin small letter P|html=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Unicode, Inc.  |editor=Allen, Julie D.|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 6.1  |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/ |accessdate=July 20, 2012 |year=2012 |isbn=9781936213023 |chapter=Enclosed Alphanumerics; Range: 2460-24FF |chapterurl=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2460.pdf |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol was introduced in 1971, essentially simultaneously in both domestic United States law and international treaty.

In the United States, it was added by {{USStatute|92|140|85|391|1971|10|15}}, which amended the [[1909 Copyright Act]] by adding protection for sound recordings and prescribed a copyright notice for sound recordings:
:(c) In section 19, title 17, of the United States Code, add the following at the end of the section: "In the case of reproductions of works specified in subsection (n) of section 5 of this title ["Sound recordings"], the notice shall consist of the symbol ℗ (the letter P in a circle), the year of first publication of the sound recording, and the name of the owner of copyright in the sound recording, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner: Provided, That if the producer of the sound recording is named on the labels or containers of the reproduction, and if no other name appears in conjunction with the notice, his name shall be considered a part of the notice.

'''Subrogation''' is the assumption by a third party (such as a second creditor or an insurance company) of another party's legal right to collect a debt or damages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subrogation|title=Definition of SUBROGATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a legal doctrine whereby one person is entitled to enforce the subsisting or revived rights of another for one's own benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Subrogation|author1=[[Charles Mitchell (academic)|Charles Mitchell]] |author2=Stephen Watterson|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |edition=1st|year=2007 |isbn=9780199296644|at=paragraph 1.01|quote=In [[English law]] the term 'subrogation' denotes a process by which one party is deemed to have been substituted for another, so that he can acquire and enforce the other's rights against a third party for his own benefit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A right of subrogation typically arises by operation of law, but can also arise by statute or by agreement. Subrogation is an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] remedy, having first developed in the English [[Court of Chancery]]. It is a familiar feature of [[common law]] systems. Analogous doctrines exist in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. 

Subrogation is a relatively specialised field of law; entire legal textbooks are devoted to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Subrogation|author1=[[Charles Mitchell (academic)|Charles Mitchell]]|author2=Stephen Watterson|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |edition=1st |year=2007 |isbn=9780199296644|at=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Law of Subrogation |author=Henry Newton Sheldon |publisher=Andesite Press |edition=1st |year=2017 |isbn=978-1375572576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doctrine ==

Countries which have inherited the [[common law]] system will typically have a doctrine of subrogation, though its doctrinal basis in a particular jurisdiction may vary from that in other jurisdictions, depending upon the extent to which [[Equity (law)|equity]] remains a distinct body of law in that jurisdiction.

English courts have now accepted that the concept of [[English unjust enrichment law|unjust enrichment]] has a role to play in subrogation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Bank of Cyprus v Menelaou'' [2015] UKSC 66; it was first recognised in ''Banque Financiere v Parc'' [1999] 1 AC 221.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, this approach has been stridently rejected by the High Court of Australia, where the doctrinal basis of subrogation is said to lie in the prevention of unconscionable results: for example, the discharge of a debtor or one party getting double recovery.&lt;ref&gt;''Bofinger v Kingsway'' [2009] HCA 44; Heydon, Leeming and Turner, ''Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane's Equity: Doctrine and Remedies'' (5th ed, 2015) 391-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of subrogation ==

The situations in which subrogation will be available are not closed and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Subrogation typically arises in three-party situations. Some common examples of subrogation include:
* ''Indemnity insurance.'' An indemnity insurer may be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of insured as against a third party who is responsible for the damage to the insured.
* ''Law of guarantees'''''.''' A surety may be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor as against the principal debtor.
* ''Trust creditors.'' A creditor of a trustee may be entitled to be subrogated to the trustee's right of indemnity.
* ''Subrogation to outgoing securities.'' A lender who advances funds for the purpose of discharging a security may be entitled to be subrogated to the third party's security as against the borrower.
* ''Bills of exchange.'' The indorser of a bill of exchange may be entitled to be subrogated to the holder as against the acceptor (who is liable to indemnify the indorser).

===Indemnity insurer's subrogation rights===
"Subrogation" has been used in this context to refer to two distinct situations. 

First, after paying out under a policy of indemnity insurance, an insurer may be entitled to stand in the shoes of the insured and enforce the insured's rights against the third party tortfeasor who is responsible for the loss.&lt;ref&gt;''Mason v Sainsbury'' (1782) 3 Dougl KB 61; ''Morris v Ford Motor Co'' [1973] QB 792
&lt;/ref&gt; This is subrogation in its proper or core sense.  Insurance subrogation, and, specifically, the types and amounts of payments that can be recovered, differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Secondly, after paying out under a policy of indemnity insurance, an insurer may be entitled to sue the insured where the insured has already had his loss made good by the third party tortfeasor. That is, the insurer has a claim against the insured so as to ensure that the insured does not get double recovery.&lt;ref&gt;''Castellain v Preston'' (1883) 11 QBD 380; ''Re Miller, Gibb &amp; Co'' [1957] 1 WLR 703
&lt;/ref&gt; This situation might arise if, for example, an insured claimed in full under the policy, but then started proceedings against the third party tortfeasor, and recovered substantial damages.&lt;ref&gt;In practice there are many reasons why an insured may do this; to recover a related uninsurable loss, to establish a defence to other claims against the insured.  However, in each case the law requires them to return the amount of any compensation received in respect of which they have also received insurance payments to the insurer.&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking, this is not a case of subrogation; it is a case of recoupment.

===Travel Insurance subrogation process===
In an "[[excess insurance|excess]]" or "[[supplemental insurance|supplemental]]" travel insurance policy where there is a 'first payer' clause, through the subrogation process an insurer is legally entitled to seek cost-sharing up to a certain percentage from a member's private group health insurance provider after the insurer pays out a travel insurance claim.&lt;ref name="CBC_2016_Mar_23" /&gt; These plans are less expensive but if there is a major claim made, Insurance carriers-such as [[Royal Bank of Canada#RBC Insurance|RBC insurance]]&lt;ref name="rbcinsurance"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.insurancehotline.com/rbcinsurance/ | title=RBC Insurance History | date=2016 | accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; can offer &lt;ref name="rbcinsurance" /&gt; 
{{quote|"Any of our policies are excess insurance and are the last payers. All other sources of recovery, indemnity payments or insurance coverage must be exhausted before any payments will be made under any of our policies."|RBC Insurance Saltzman CBC 2016}}
While these supplemental travel insurance policies may be less expensive in the short run, they can have devastating consequences if a serious and costly health crisis occurs while travelling.&lt;ref name="CBC_2016_Mar_23" /&gt; This means that if a client makes a claim, the insurer will recover that amount from the member's private group health insurance provider—for example $100,000 of the $200,000 total. This can become problematic if the member later has a serious illness because many private group health insurance providers have a lifetime maximum coverage amount-$500,000 for example-for its extended health plans. If the member purchases travel insurance from their own extended health-care provider, a claim would not have affected their lifetime maximum.&lt;ref name="CBC_2016_Mar_23"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/buy-travel-health-insurance-end-up-with-less-coverage-a-couple-s-hard-lesson-1.3495864 | title=Buy travel health insurance, end up with less coverage: A couple's hard lesson If you buy travel insurance, be aware of the 'first payer' clause | publisher=CBC | date=20 March 2016 | accessdate=23 March 2016 |author= Saltzman, Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surety's subrogation rights===
A [[surety]] who pays off the debts of another party may be entitled to be subrogated to the creditor's former claims and remedies against the debtor to recover the sum paid.&lt;ref&gt;''Forbes v Jackson'' (1882) 19 Ch D 615&lt;/ref&gt;  This would include the endorser on a [[bill of exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;''Duncan, Fox &amp; Co v North and South Wales Bank'' (1880) 6 App Cas 1&lt;/ref&gt; The surety will then have the benefit of any [[security interest]] in favour of the creditor for the original debt.  Conceptually this is an important point, as the subrogee will take the subrogor's security rights by operation of law, even if the subrogee had been unaware of them.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mitchell, ''The Law of Subrogation'', {{ISBN|0-19-825938-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Subrogation rights against trustees===
A [[trustee]] of who enters into transactions for the benefit of the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiaries]] of the trust is generally entitled to be indemnified out of the trust assets; this is secured by way of an equitable [[lien]] or first charge over the trust assets. This is a proprietary security interest. 

Trust creditors (that is, persons who have become creditors of the trustee ''qua'' trustee) may be entitled to be subrogated to the trustee's lien. This is a particularly precarious 'right' of trust creditors: a trustee may not have a right of indemnity (for example, because the trustee has committed a breach of trust in incurring the liability to the creditor in question) or it may be limited (for example, where the trustee has committed an unrelated breach of trust and the clear accounts rule operates). In some jurisdictions it is possible for the trustee's right of indemnity to be excluded altogether. In these cases, subrogation may be rendered worthless or impossible.

===Lender's subrogation rights===
Where a lender lends money to a borrower to discharge the borrower's debt to a third party (or which the lender pays directly to the third party to discharge the debt), the lender may be entitled to be subrogated to the third party's former rights against the borrower to the extent of the debt discharged.&lt;ref&gt;''Butler v Rice'' [1910] 2 Ch 277; ''Ghana Commercial Bank v Chandiram'' [1960] AC 732&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous ===
Where a [[bank]], acting on what it believes erroneously to be the valid mandate of its client, pays money to a third party which discharges the customer's liability to the third party, the bank is subrogated to the third party's former remedies against the customer.&lt;ref&gt;''B Liggett (Liverpool) Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd'' [1928] 1 KB 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of subrogation==
Where subrogation is available, the subrogated party is entitled to stand in the shoes of another and enforce that other party's rights. If the equity is established, the court may effect the subrogation remedy by way of equitable lien, charge, or a constructive trust with a liability to account. Crucially, the claimant's rights are wholly derivative, hence the claimant has no higher rights than the person to whom he or she is subrogated. 

== Subrogation in civil law jurisdictions ==
Analogous doctrines exist in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, articles 1651-1659 of the ''Civil Code of Quebec'', which deal with subrogation in the Quebec (civil) law&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''supreme crime''' is a legal principle that to initiate [[War#Motivations|war]] not in self-defense, called war of aggression in international law, but with the intent to conquer territory and subjugate other people, is more egregious than a normal crime. The term was introduced by Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], chief prosecutor for the [[United States]] at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
The loss of human life during [[World War I]] prompted the debate about the legality of war-making in the [[League of Nations]]. Shortly after the cessation of hostilities on the European theatre of [[World War II]], Jackson framed the legal principles making the initiation of a war of aggression a supreme crime as follows:

* The power of [[sovereign state]]s to make war, except in self-defense, should be restricted by law. (''"It is high time that we act on the juridical principle that aggressive war-making is illegal and criminal"'')
* This law must apply equally to all nations. (''"I am not willing to charge as a crime against a [[Germany|German]] official acts which would not be crimes if committed by officials of the United States"'')
* Nations can act only through their leaders and thus the individuals responsible for initiation of an aggressive war are accountable for acts of violence against others committed in the name of the state. (''"The guilt we should reach is not that of numberless little people, but of those who planned and whipped up the war.")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1926">The '''Telecommunications Act of 1993''' is an Act of the Parliament of Canada that regulates [[telecommunications]] by ensuring reliable services, protecting privacy, and to protect and encourage the Canadian media. The Act is administered by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) which reports to [[Industry Canada]]. It replaced the ''Railway Act'' of 1906, which governed telecommunication prior to 1993, making it the first full legislative scheme addressing telecommunications.

Among its stipulations are prescient regulations that in spirit follow the general principles of [[net neutrality]] decades before the telecommunications concept arose as a matter of public debate with the rise of the [[internet]] as a common telecommunications system. For instance, internet providers are considered utilities under this law in that they can't give "undue or unreasonable preference," nor can they influence the content being transmitted over their networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/us-canada-net-neutrality-party-politics-fcc-crtc-fight-1.4447558|title=Why Canada's net neutrality fight hasn't been as fierce as the one in the U.S.|last1=Braga|first1=Matthew|date=14 December 2017|accessdate=15 December 2017|publisher=CBC|agency=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, an amendment was passed to allow for the creation of a national [[Canadian Do Not Call List|Do-not-call list]] under section 41.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2041">The '''WGA script registration service''' is a service run by both the [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGAE) and the [[Writers Guild of America West]] (WGAW) to establish the date of creation of [[literary property]], typically a motion picture screenplay, useful in the often-contentious U.S. entertainment field. 

The service supports the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] but is also available for non-members to use.  This is one of the distinctions that makes the WGAE and WGAw true [[guild]]s and not simply a [[trade union]] bargaining for existing members.

Registration with the Guilds has become important in [[lawsuit]]s for [[copyright infringement]] especially where the degree of copying is very loose or vague or conceptual:  invoking the Guilds itself as registrar indicates that the Guilds' standard concept of property rights in literary works were expected to be followed by at least the registrant.

Although registration is an important part of assisting in protecting a writer's rights to his or her work and determining compensation, registration is not the same as a US Copyright.  Although a registration may constitute evidence in a copyright dispute, registration is not proof of copyright registration or ownership. Additionally, an official Copyright registration with the U.S. Library of Congress is required to invoke the jurisdiction of U.S. Federal Courts, where most copyright infringement claims are adjudicated.

'''''Washington v. Harper''''', 494 U.S. 210 (1990), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which an incarcerated inmate sued the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] over the issue of involuntary medication, specifically [[antipsychotic]] medication.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;{{ussc|name=Washington v. Harper|volume=494|page=210|pin=|year=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Respondent Harper, an inmate in the Washington [[prison system]] since 1976, had a history of becoming violent when not on antipsychotic medication. Twice he was transferred to the Special Offender Center (SOC), a state institution for convicted offenders with serious psychiatric problems. While there, Harper was  forced to take psychiatric medication against his will. The SOC followed its policies of institutional review for making a treatment decision to forcibly medicate an inmate.&lt;ref name="findlaw"/&gt; 

Upon his second hospitalization at the Center, Harper filed suit in state court under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging that the Center failed to provide a judicial hearing before involuntarily medicating him, thus violating the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The trial court rejected his claim but the State Supreme Court reversed the decision and remanded the case back to the trial court stating that the State could administer antipsychotic medication to a competent, nonconsenting inmate only if, in a judicial hearing,   at which the inmate had full adversarial procedural protections, the State could prove by "clear, cogent, and [494 U.S. 210, 211]    convincing" evidence that the forced medication  was necessary and effective for furthering an important state interest, weighing the individuals interest against that of the state.&lt;ref name="findlaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="melton1997"&gt;{{cite book | first=Melton | last=Gary | year= 1997 | title= Psychological Evaluations for the Courts: A Handbook for Mental Health Professionals and Lawyers | edition= 2nd | publisher=The Guilford Press | location=New York | pages=134, 350&amp;ndash;351 | isbn=978-1-57230-236-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Supreme Court]] granted a [[Writ of Certiorari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/legal/l1990/Harper.htm |title=Washington' et al., Petitioners v. Walter Harper |publisher= |accessdate=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[American Psychological Association]]  submitted an [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] brief in support of the inmate's right to a due process hearing, stating forced medication of an incarcerated inmate violated the [[due process]], [[equal protection]], and [[free speech]] clauses of the [[Constitution of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.apa.org/psyclaw/washington.html
|title=Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210
|publisher=American Psychological Association
|accessdate=2007-10-10
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
The Court reversed, finding the use of an internal institutional review  was adequate in making treatment decisions in this case  under the lesser standard of review embodied in ''[[Turner v. Safley]]'', {{ussc|482|78|1987}}.

The United States Supreme court ruled that the  Due Process Clause permits a state to treat an incarcerated inmate having a serious [[mental disorder]] with antipsychotic medication against his will, under the condition that  he is dangerous to himself or others and the medication prescribed is in his best medical interest.&lt;ref name="findlaw"/&gt;

== Subsequent analysis ==
An issue in this case was the institutional policy of forming a treatment decision team made up of two mental health professionals  and one associate superintendent. This three person committee  evaluated issues such as  the severity of the inmate's mental disorder and the risk to himself or others and then made the treatment decision.
Six members of the Court disagreed with Harper's argument that he had a right to due process through the court. In this decision the United States Supreme Court weighs in on the side that it is preferable for medical professionals to make treatment decisions rather than have those decisions made through judicial proceedings.&lt;ref name="melton1997" /&gt;

In the US, a wildlife inspector is a person employed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] in the defense against the illegal [[wildlife trade]] by ensuring that [[wildlife]] shipments comply with [[United States|US]] and international wildlife protection laws. 

Stationed at major international airports, ocean ports, and border crossings, wildlife inspectors monitor an annual trade worth more than $2.8 billion. They stop illegal shipments, intercept smuggled wildlife and wildlife products, and help the US fulfill its commitment to global [[Conservation biology|wildlife conservation]].

===Locations===
By law, most commercial wildlife shipments come through 17 'designated ports' - Anchorage, Alaska; Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Miami, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York, New York/Newark, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington. The Service operates wildlife inspection offices in these cities. Wildlife inspectors also staff 14 locations along the Mexican and Canadian borders and five additional ports that handle specific types of wildlife traffic. 

A Senior Wildlife Inspector is stationed at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, GA and coordinates training for Service Wildlife Inspector and Special Agents, Customs officers and other International, Federal, State and Local law enforcement agencies that deal with the import/ export of wildlife.

===The job===
The US is one of the world's largest markets for wildlife and wildlife products. High-volume 'live' traffic includes exotic reptiles, tropical fish, and primates. Manufactured products (such as boots, shoes, purses, jewelry, caviar, and meats) and less 'processed' wildlife items (such as hunting trophies, feathers, furs, skins, raw coral, and shells) are also common. Wildlife inspectors enforce a range of US and international laws, regulations, and treaties that protect wildlife and limit commercial traffic in endangered animals and plants.

Wildlife inspectors clear legal imports and exports and seize shipments that violate the law. They make sure that wildlife imports and exports are accompanied by the required permits and licenses, and verify that the contents of shipments match the items listed on declaration forms. They pay special attention to live wildlife, checking to see that animals in transit are treated humanely.

Although wildlife inspectors spend most of their time processing commercial cargo shipments, they also keep tabs on international passenger traffic. Unwary travelers all too often return from abroad with illegal wildlife souvenirs. Many smuggling rings use human couriers; inspectors find protected animals hidden in clothing and stuffed in suitcases and handbags.

Wildlife inspectors work closely with Service Special Agents and counterparts from Customs and Border Protection and other Federal agencies that police international trade. They staff special enforcement task forces that conduct inspection blitzes at international mail processing facilities, or target specific enforcement problems, such as the import and sale of medicinal products made from endangered species.

Outreach is also an important part of the job. Wildlife inspectors meet with customs brokers, trade associations, international travelers, and hunters going abroad to explain wildlife import/export rules and regulations. They are popular guest speakers at schools, nature centers, community conservation programs, and environmental fairs.  

Inspectors provided international training to our Canadian and Mexican counterparts, and have travel internationally to countries such as Nepal, China, Italy, Mongolian and Botswana to provide training to other wildlife law enforcement agencies in those countries.
