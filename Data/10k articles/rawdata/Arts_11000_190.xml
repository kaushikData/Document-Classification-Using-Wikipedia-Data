'''Architecture-Studio''' is a French Architecture Practice created in 1973 in Paris. Around its 14 partners, Architecture-Studio brings together an international team of architects, urban planners, interior designers, quantity surveyors and sustainable design specialists of twenty five different nationalities.

The [[Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg]], the [[Arab World Institute]] in [[Paris]] (together with [[Jean Nouvel]]), and the Notre-Dame-de-l'Arche-d'Alliance Church in [[Paris]] stand among Architecture-Studio's best known projects. Architecture-Studio has been developing over the years and has established an office in [[Shanghai]], and CA'ASI in [[Venice, Italy]].

==Philosophy==
Architecture-Studio defines Architecture as "an art that is socially committed and engaged in the construction of mankind's living environment".  Architecture-Studio's work is based on group culture, developing a real team work through a collective conception of Architecture; a will to go beyond individual interests in favour of dialogue and debate, thereby transforming all individual knowledge into collective creative potential.

Architecture-Studio believes that this also involves being open to encounters that can alter the way of thinking or, at least, inflect it (a book, a film, a man, a mistake on a building site…).  This approach is a key to the conception process; a process which is not linear but iterative, not static but dynamic, not only intellectual and abstract but organic and concrete.

==Associates==
Carried by this open-minded attitude, Architecture-Studio's team has progressively grown. Martin Robain, the founder, has been joined by:

* Rodo Tisnado (since 1976) ;

The '''Basilica of Saint Servatius''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Church (building)|church]] dedicated to [[Saint Servatius]], in the city of [[Maastricht]], [[the Netherlands]]. The architecturally hybrid but mainly [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church is situated next to the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church of Saint John, backing onto the town's main square, Vrijthof.

== History ==
The present-day church is probably the fourth church that was built on the site of the grave of [[Saint Servatius]], an [[Armenia]]n missionary who was [[bishop of Tongeren]] and died allegedly in 384 in Maastricht.&lt;ref&gt;According to the late-Medieval [[bishop of Maastricht|list of 21 holy bishops of Maastricht]], Servatius was the first bishop of Maastricht.&lt;/ref&gt; A small memorial chapel on the saint's grave was replaced by a large stone church built by bishop [[Monulph]] around 570. This church was replaced by a larger [[pilgrim]] church in the late 7th century, which was then replaced by the present-day structure, which was built in several stages over a period of more than 100 years. The [[nave]] was built in the first half of the 11th century, the [[transept]] in the second half of the century, and the [[choir]] and [[westwork]] in the 12th century. The Romanesque church was built during a period in which the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of Saint Servatius kept close ties to the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]], which resulted in a building that has the characteristics of a German [[imperial church]]. The [[dedication]] of the church in 1039 was attended by the emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] and twelve bishops. Most of the church's Medieval [[Provost (religion)|provosts]] were sons of the highest ranking German noble families. Several held the office of [[Chancellor_of_the_German_Empire#Historical_overview|chancellor of the German Empire]]; at least eight provosts went on to become [[archbishop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[:nl:Lijst van proosten van het Sint-Servaaskapittel te Maastricht|''List of provosts of the chapter of Saint Servatius'']] on Dutch Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpted ''Bergportaal'', at the south side of the church, was begun around 1180 and can be considered late Romanesque or early Gothic. All the chapels along the side aisles are Gothic (14th and 15th centuries), and so is the vaulted ceiling of the [[nave]] and the [[transept]]. In 1556 a late Gothic [[spire]] was added onto the westwork between the two existing towers. In 1770 the entire westwork was crowned with [[Baroque]] helmet spires, designed by the [[Liège]] architect Etienne Fayen.

Over the centuries the interior of the church underwent many changes. In the 17th century, the Gothic choir [[rood screen]] with sculpted depictions of the life of Servatius was demolished. Fragments from the 14th-century screen were discovered during the 1980s restoration works and are now kept in the church's [[lapidarium]] in the East crypt. By the end of the 18th century, the entire church interior had been painted white, the colourful Medieval stained glass windows had been replaced by colourless glass, and the church looked distinctly Baroque.

The north transept holds some epitaphs, of which the one for Egidius Ruyschen in [[Renaissance]] style is probably the most original. Nearby is the impressive tomb of the Count and Countess van den Bergh (Johannes  Bossier, 1685), which was transferred from the Dominican church of Maastricht. From the Dominican church were also transferred the ornate confessionals by [[Daniël van Vlierden]] (Hasselt, 1700), which are located in various parts of the church.

In 1797 the chapter was dissolved by the French revolutionaries and the church was used as a horse stable by the troops. The furnishings of the church were sold, stolen or trashed. Likewise, most of the church treasures disappeared during the first years of the French occupation. In 1804 the church was returned to the parish but the building was an empty ruin. It was during the period that followed that most of the damage was done. The 11th-century Chapel of Saint Maternus and the 15th-century ''Koningskapel'' (built by the French kings [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] and [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]) were considered irreparable and were demolished. For liturgical reasons, it was deemed necessary to lower the elevated choir, for which the underlying 11th-century crypt was demolished. In 1846 the four panels that belonged to the reliquary chest of Saint Servatius (''Noodkist'') were sold to an antiques dealer and ended up in the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]] in [[Brussels]].
[[Image:Torens van Sint-Servaaskerk en Sint-Janskerk - Maastricht - 20410047 - RCE.jpg|thumb|left|1937 with central tower]]
Between 1866 and 1900 the church underwent major restorations during which some of the damage done earlier in the century was reversed. The restoration was led by famous Dutch architect [[Pierre Cuypers]]. In 1955 a fire caused Cuypers' [[Gothic Revival]] westwork spire to fall through the roof of the church, which made another thorough restoration necessary (1982–1991). During this latter restoration, Cuypers' colourful interior decoration scheme was largely removed. During this most recent restoration, extensive excavations that were carried out in the church and adjacent buildings, revealed a wealth of information about the history of the church and its predecessors.

== Religious significance ==
Through the ages, the presence of the grave of Saint Servatius in the church [[crypt]] and the many [[relic]]s in the [[Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius|church treasury]], have drawn large numbers of [[pilgrim]]s. Starting in the 14th century (but perhaps earlier) a seven-yearly pilgrimage was organized in cooperation with nearby [[Aachen Cathedral]] and [[Kornelimünster Abbey]], attracting tens of thousands of visitors to the region. This so-called ''Heiligdomsvaart'' continued until 1632 when Maastricht became affiliated with the [[Dutch Republic]] ([[Capture of Maastricht]]). The Heiligdomsvaart was revived in the 19th century and the tradition continues in our days. The next Heiligdomsvaart will take place in July 2018.

Today, the Basilica of Saint Servatius is the main church of the [[Deanery]] of Maastricht, which belongs to the [[Diocese of Roermond]]. The church continues to be a center of Catholicism in Maastricht (the other main church being the [[Basilica of Our Lady (Maastricht)|Basilica of Our Lady]]). The church was made a [[Basilica Minor]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] during his visit in 1985.

== Art historical significance ==
Although the present building conveys a rather hybrid image of architectural styles, the church of Saint Servatius is considered to be one of the most important religious buildings in the former [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]]. Both the East choir and the [[Westwork]] of the Maastricht church have been influential in the development of Romanesque architecture in the [[Meuse]] and [[Rhine]] valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Den Hartog, pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have pointed out the significance of the South portal's late Romanesque sculpture for the early development of Gothic sculpture in France.&lt;ref&gt;Den Hartog, pp. 327-354, esp. notes 4 &amp; 5 on p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Romanesque sculpture===
Both the exterior of the East choir and the interior of the westwork of Saint Servatius contain [[architectural sculpture]] that is considered amongst the most interesting in the [[Mosan art|Mosan]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Den Hartog, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The 34 elaborately carved capitals in the Westwork depict scenes from books well-known to the [[Canon (priest)|canons]], such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine's]] ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'' and various [[Bestiary|bestiaries]]. Recurrent themes are: botanical ornaments, animals, humans fighting with animals, humans entangled in plants, and humans engaged in daily activities. A close relationship has been established by art historians between the Maastricht Westwork capitals and those of the East choir of Our Lady's in Maastricht, the [[Rolduc]] crypt, the [[dwarf gallery]] of the [[Doppelkirche Schwarzrheindorf]] ([[Bonn]]), and the [[Wartburg]] palace (near [[Eisenach]]).&lt;ref&gt; Mekking, pp. 195-202; Den Hartog, pp. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the Westwork of Saint Servatius is a sculpted Romanesque [[choir screen]], also referred to as the ''double relief''. The lower rectangular part depicts the [[Virgin and Child]] in a [[mandorla]] held by two angels, the upper part shows [[Christ]] handing over the [[keys of Heaven]] to [[Saint Peter]] and Saint Servatius. The relief closely relates to a choir screen in [[Pieterskerk, Utrecht|Saint Peter's]] in [[Utrecht]]. Elsewhere in the church a 12th-century [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] depicting the ''[[Christ in Majesty|Majestas Domini]]'' can be found as part of a former portal. The [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] ceiling shows remnants of ceiling paintings, depicting the visions of [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]]. This may be the only surviving work by a once important group of Maastricht and [[Cologne]] based painters, who received high praise from [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] in his [[Parzival]].

The church's South portal (''Bergportaal'') contains sculpture that marks the period of transition between late Romanesque and early Gothic sculpture. The sculpted tympanum and the two inner [[archivolt]]s date from around 1180 and are Romanesque is style, the rest of the portal can be considered Gothic and dates from around 1215.

===Treasury===
{{Main article|Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius}}
Since the donation of a silver [[reliquary]] in the shape of a Roman [[triumphal arch]] by [[Charlemagne]]'s biographer [[Einhard]] in c. 830, the church has acquired many treasures, most of which are now kept in the [[Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius|Treasury]]. Amongst the highlights are the reliquary shrine and the reliquary bust of Saint Servatius, the key, the cup, the [[crozier]] and the pectoral cross of Saint Servatius, a large [[ patriarchal cross]], and many other reliquaries and liturgical vessels, as well as an important collection of medieval ivories and textiles.

'''Betongtavlen''' ("The Concrete Tablet") is a Norwegian architecture and civil engineering award issued by the [[National Associations of Norwegian Architects]] and the [[Norwegian Concrete Association]]. The award is issues to a structure "where concrete is used in an environmentally, esthetically and technically excellent way". The award was first issued in 1961 for [[Bakkehaugen Church]] and has as of 2011 been awarded 53 times. The award is not necessarily awarded every year, and up to four structures have been awarded in a year. Structures awarded prices include office buildings, campus buildings, ski jumps, houses, hotels, bridges, tunnels, dams, oil platforms, industrial facilities, viewpoints and cultural institutions. Prizes are not necessarily awarded immediately after the structure was completed—for instance, [[Elgeseter Bridge]] was completed in 1951 but awarded the prize in 2006.&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkitektur.no/?nid=6016 |title=Betongtavlen |date=20 September 2011 |language=Norwegian |publisher=[[National Associations of Norwegian Architects]] |accessdate=16 December 2011 |archivedate=16 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63yNMsvtm?url=http://www.arkitektur.no/?nid%3D6016%26lcid%3D1044 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Candler College''' and '''Colegio Buenavista''' were educational institutions founded in Havana, Cuba by the United States Southern [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Methodist Episcopal Church]]. They were founded on two different dates, Candler College in 1899 and Colegio Buenavista in 1920. They both ceased to exist in 1961 when they were nationalized by the revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.&lt;ref name=Evolution&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oagjc001.php|title=RELIGIOUS REPRESSION IN CUBA: Its Evolution and Present Status|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools intended to provide a bilingual education in Spanish and English, based on the Christian faith. They offered from the pre-school level until finishing high school to Cuban children and youth, as part of the mission of the church on the island.

Although they were administered by different dependencies of the Methodist Church of Florida (United States), these two schools developed all their activities in coordination. Candler College offered elementary education only to boys while Colegio Buenavista provided primary education for girls. Young girls enrolled in Buenavista attended secondary education programs at Candler College; they only received religion and physical education classes at the Buenavista facilities. Some of Candler's boys did the seventh and eighth grades in English at Colegio Buenavista to be able to follow the United States High School curriculum. The younger boys also went to Kindergarten along with the girls. Candler College had a boarding school for boys only. Similarly, Buenavista provided the boarding for young girls and ladies. The two schools had separate lunch services for students who did not live a short distance away from them.

In order to give its graduates and other students, the opportunity to continue university studies, at Candler College Candler University was organized in 1956, opening the Faculties of Pedagogy, Languages, Philosophy, and Letters, Pharmacy and Commercial Sciences to began in 1957.

These institutions grew in number of students and in prestige over the years until their educational work was interrupted in 1961 when the Castro regime nationalized all the private educational establishments (religious and lay).&lt;ref name=Evolution/&gt; During the years in which Candler College and Colegio Buenavista existed, both schools provided a successful service to Cuban youth preparing their students for civic life by providing, in addition to official instruction, an integral formation based on Christian, moral and patriotic values. 
==History==
[[File:Students. Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]
The first Methodist school in Cuba was founded in 1899 by the American missionary Thad E. Leland on Calle Virtudes de [[La Habana]]. This was founded when the Bishop of the Methodist Church of Florida, the Rev. Warren Akin Candler, proposed to give a new impetus to the missionary work begun in Cuba in 1883, through educational projects. In 1903 this school was named Candler College in honor of Bishop Candler.&lt;ref&gt;Tamayo Pérez, Marbelito y García Hernández, Belkis. Iglesia Metodista de Cuba. Reseña histórica 1883–2007. La Habana, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend H. B. Bardwell, a missionary in Cuba since 1903, succeeded the reverends E.E Clements and B.F. Gilbert as director of Candler College in 1909. Aware of the need to expand, the Mission Board of the Florida Conference acquired a vast tract of land in La Ceiba, Marianao, where the first building for the new headquarters was built in 1912 of the school, inaugurated in January 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Bardwell, Harry B.

The headquarters of Havana was called Central Methodist College and that of Marianao retained the name Candler College. In addition to offering elementary and secondary education, between 1924 and 1946 at Candler College, a theological seminary was held, the School of Pastors, which was under the direction of the Reverend B. F. Gilbert followed by the Reverend E.E, Clements.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Ramos, Carlos. ''Un resumen de los setenta años de labor de la iglesia metodista en Cuba.''  Libro publicado en 1983.

The Reverend Bardwell directed Candler College for forty years, during which the spirit of the college was consolidated. He was replaced in 1949 by the Reverend Carlos Pérez Ramos, who had been assistant director since 1946. Under his direction, the school continued to grow and other buildings and facilities were built to meet new requirements.

Colegio Buenavista was founded in 1920 by the Women's Missionary Board of the Methodist Church to provide a Christian education for girls and young women and to respond to the request of the parents of Candler College students who demanded an education for their daughters. quality similar to that of his brothers. This women's school began to operate in a residence surrounded by gardens that acquired the church across the street Miramar, along the side of the Candler.&lt;ref&gt;Haskin, Sarah Estelle.

Until 1960, the directors of Colegio Buenavista were American missionaries who had carried out evangelization and social work for the Methodist Church in different parts of the island. Under his direction the school grew at the same pace as Candler College. Miss Belle Markey, the first director, was followed by Miss Junia Jones and then by Miss Ione Clay, who held the position for more than 25 years, until her retirement in 1956, and was replaced by Miss Juanita Kelly, who was succeeded by Miss Lorraine Buck. Four months before the nationalization of the school, the Reverend Humberto Carrazana, pastor of the Methodist Church of Marianao, was named director of Colegio Buenavista.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos&gt;{{cite news | first = Mercedes| last = Cil Rivero| title =Mis Recuerdos del Colegio Buenavista.| url = https://www.facebook.com/groups/candlercollege/doc/10150849356720693| via = Facebook | accessdate = November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades, the schools were considered among the best in Cuba and "many graduates were accepted in the best universities in the United States without taking admission exams."&lt;ref name="Pérez Ramos_1"&gt;Pérez Ramos, Carlos.

==Location, buildings and facilities==
[[File:Areal View. Candler College and Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|]]
Candler College was located in the southeastern corner of the intersection of Miramar (Calle 54) and Gutiérrez (Ave. 43) in La Ceiba, Marianao. Candler's main entrance was down Gutiérrez Street (Ave.43) and gave access to the gardens in the front part of the main building, where the offices were on the ground floor and the bedrooms for the pupils in the second and third floors. Through this entrance, taking to the left, were the Martian Corner and the two-story building where the High School classes were held. At the back of this building, which opened onto Calle Lanuza (Calle 52), an entrance was opened for the students of Candler University. There were three other entrances on Calle Miramar (Ave. 54): one that was used to enter the Chapel, the next allowed the entrance of cars to the esplanade and parking place; this entrance had on the right the two-story building of the School of Commerce, with its well-equipped classrooms and spacious corridors, and to the left was the Library building, which also had two floors. Surrounding the esplanade were the back of the main building with its long corridors, the front of the High School building, the dining room and kitchen with the apartment for the director on the second floor and the three-story building that occupied the School of Baccalaureate, with its laboratories and the Museum of Natural Sciences, in addition to classrooms.

The third entrance was the building of the Elementary School, in front of Font Street (Ave. 45). On the opposite side of the street, there was another sports field on the corner of 54th Street and 45th Ave. The Gymnasium, with its modern wooden plank for playing basketball and indoor volleyball and a stage at the back, was It was located in the southwest corner of 56th Street and 45th Ave.
[[File:Buenavista a color.jpg|thumb|left|El edificio principal de Buenavista on 54th Street]]
Colegio Buenavista was located in front of the entrances on the side of Candler, on the southwestern corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos/&gt;
The main Buenavista building had three entrances on Calle Miramar (Calle 54): the first was a gate to enter the main building, the beautiful mansion that was adapted to the initial needs of the school. On the ground floor were: the materials room, the kitchen, the dining room, and two classrooms. On the facade there were two converging stairs on a large terrace that gave access to the offices, the library, and the hall, from where a corridor led to the infirmary, the bedrooms and bathrooms for the pupils and the director, on the second floor.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos/&gt; On the third floor, there were more bedrooms for the older pupils and the missionaries. To the left of this building, there was an entrance for cars, gardens, a garage, and a small room. A hallway to the left led to the classrooms, lined along 54th Street and 45th Ave, which limited the large courtyard with its gardens. This included recreational areas, the platform for cultural activities, the Martian Corner and, on the other side, the tennis and volleyball court. A third entrance to the gardens of Calle Miramar led to a vestibule that separated a small religious meditation room and a classroom and the long corridor that gave access to the other classrooms. There was also an entrance through the back of the patio, on Calle Primelles (Calle 56). Crossing this street, a small door allowed to enter the sports ground for the students of Buenavista. The Auditorium of both schools was built next to this land, located in the south-western corner of 56th Street and 43rd Ave. Diagonal to this, in the northeast corner, with the entrance by Ave. 43, was the building of two stories with a smaller playground for students from pre-school to third grade.

Both schools in total occupied a vast lot whose area of more than 32,000 square meters was bounded by 45th Ave to the south, 52nd Street to the east, 58th Street to the west and 43rd Ave to the north. This large area was crossed by three streets: Calle 54, Ave. 45 and Calle 56, which separated the buildings of the schools and the sports grounds, the gymnasium, and the auditorium.

==Basics==
Candler College and Buenavista College were grounded in the creed and discipline of the Methodist church. They were opened to prepare students for their future life outside of school on the basis of Christian faith and practice as well as moral, civic and patriotic values. Its purposes were to provide a comprehensive education that would contribute to the personal development of students as individuals and members of society and raise the educational level of the newly founded republic.
===Methodist approach===
[[File:Candler College Chapel. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Candler College Chapel. Corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue]]
According to the thought of John Wesley, a good education was considered "one of the best ways to transform individuals, communities and societies as a whole" for their betterment and the glory of God. Education was not only the acquisition of academic knowledge but also wisdom and humility, which was founded on the teachings of Christ, in order to grow intellectually, personally and spiritually. The search for truth was encouraged through reason, research and debate, based on freedom of thought and expression. High academic standards were promoted as well as the development of talents through varied activities. As a result, challenges were posed to students, they were inspired and supported to achieve their best through self-discipline and a strong work ethic.

Candler and Buenavista maintained a distinctive approach to education that incorporated Christian ethical values. The Methodist Social Creed emphasizes interest in social welfare and justice as well as the need to combat prejudice and intolerance in whatever form they take by strengthening mutual respect and understanding.&lt;ref name="Pérez Ramos_1" /&gt; So tolerant attitudes and behaviors were reinforced, respectful and non-discriminatory.

It was hoped that students would learn to differentiate good and evil based on Christian and moral values. Family values based on love and mutual understanding and support were an important part of the formation of students.

High ideals of patriotism were present in the education of the students: love their homeland and be loyal to it, respect and honor the national emblems and recognize the merits of the main forgers of the nation, know its history, culture and traditions as well as the achievements of the newly created republic and interested in the needs and problems of its people and their efforts to solve them.

The civic values of freedom and democracy and the norms of coexistence related to rights and duties had a central place in the task of preparing future citizens as well as inculcating good manners and the appropriate habits required to live in society.

The strong ties with the Florida Methodist Church Conference, which partially supported both colleges, were evident in the influence of American culture and traditions in schools. The flag of the United States was present in all the parties and ceremonies along with the Cuban flag and the national anthems of the two countries were sung.

==Hymns and emblems==
The principle adopted by Candler College as a guide was Consilio et Prudentia (Wisdom and Prudence). The motto of Colegio Buenavista, which appears on his seal, was Esse quam Videri (Ser instead of appearing). The pennants of Candler College bore the distinctive colors of the school, red and black. Those of Buenavista the orange and the black. The hymns of the schools were the following:
[[File:Sello de Candler.jpg|thumb|left|Logo Candler College]]

==Academic structure==
[[File:Faculty. Candler College and Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|The Faculty]]
Candler College consisted of four schools, each coordinated by a sub-director:

* Elementary School, which included a pre-primary education degree and seven primary education grades (the latter was called preparatory). At the end of the sixth grade students could enter the Baccalaureate if they passed in any of the public secondary schools the official entrance exam that was required.
* Baccalaureate school, high school in Spanish, which comprised five years. In the latter, students could choose between two branches: Science and Letters. The students left prepared to continue studies of higher education in the different careers that were offered in the country at the university level.
* School of Commerce, consisting of two different branches: Accountant and Secretariat, which initially were programs of three years each. But from the course of 1957–58 Contador was extended to four years. Upon completion of studies in these programs, students were prepared to enter the world of work in commercial enterprises or where office work would be required.
* High School in English, which consisted of four years of secondary education that prepared the student to continue studies of higher education in the United States.

Colegio Buenavista offered preschool (Kindergarten and Pre-primary) and primary education in Spanish and English from first to eighth grades. Her students continued secondary education at Candler College.

The curriculum corresponded to the graduate school model adopted in Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century, which implies the progressive nature of the teaching-learning process so that the contents of the [[Course (education)|subjects]] were sequenced progressively from pre-school to secondary education.

Candler College and Buenavista followed the official programs for the Primary School and the Bachillerato proposed by the Cuban Ministry of Education, which determined in a precise way the contents for the subjects of each grade in the Study Plans, as well as the time required for each one. The teachers selected the [[textbooks]] and the materials among those prepared by authors Cubans. Primary Education in Spanish and the Baccalaureate had official recognition, as there were supervisors from the Ministry of Education who periodically visited the primary school classes. The Baccalaureate School was incorporated the Secondary Education Institute of Marianao, so that the students had to present exams of each subject before professors of this institute twice a year to obtain the [[accreditation]] of their results, and at the end, the [[diploma]] official that would allow them to enter the university. In the School of Commerce the professors prepared the study plans. The textbooks and materials were selected by them among those offered by the publishing houses and were available in the [[bookstores]]. The curricula for the High School followed the curriculum of the United States and the texts were brought from there. The schedules, the spaces and the didactic resources were conceived and managed in coordination by the sub-directors and teachers. They were autonomous to conduct the teaching-learning process. Each teacher was free to choose the teaching methods and teaching materials he or she considered most convenient for each subject and was responsible for the [[evaluation]] of the students, including the [[observation]] of their difficulties and needs in order to improve their performance. Grades or grades were reported monthly to the parents of the students.

Religious education was important in both schools. The Bible classes were part of the curriculum in all grades. The students not only read the history and teachings of Jesus and the [[apostles]] in the [[New Testament]], they also learned about the history of the [[Hebrew people]], their leaders, [[prophets]], and other characters; they also learned the [[Ten Commandments]] and read the [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] in the [[Old Testament]]. Worshiping God and [[praying]] were part of the student's formation. Twice a week the students of Buenavista and the boys of Candler in the Chapel met separately, where the word of God was preached and topics related to spiritual, moral, civic and patriotic values were discussed.

== Extracurricular activities ==
Students at both schools had opportunities to supplement their academic instruction through a number of sports and various extracurricular activities:
=== Sports ===
[[File:Deportes en Candler.jpg|thumb|left]]
Athletics and sports were always practiced in Candler. In the beginning, the favorite sports were tennis and baseball along with the [[training]] field and track. Later, students also practiced [[softball]], basketball, volleyball, and squash instead of tennis. Some students could participate in teams that were specially trained to compete in the intercollegiate championships. They won many trophies in baseball and basketball.

The girls also played sports at Buenavista: softball, kickball, volleyball and basketball. Teams were trained with the best players to also participate in intercollegiate competitions.

=== Music ===
In Buenavista there was a Music Department that, in addition to the regular music classes included in the curricula, offered piano and [[solfeggio]] and [[music theory]] lessons. The students could take these classes in their [[free time]] or at the end of the school day each day. The annual [[Recital]] was a tradition of many years, in which the students who took piano lessons played a piece of classical music. In this one also participated the Rhythmic Band.

In the decades of 1940 and 1950 there was also a school band that participated in stops or patriotic celebrations and played the National Anthem during the salute to the flag.

In addition, [[choirs]] were specially prepared to participate in [[festivals]] and other celebrations.

Since 1958 a choir was organized with students from both schools.

=== Other extracurricular activities ===
[[File:Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]
At different times, some groups of students interested in literature, musical appreciation, theater, [[Rhetoric|oratory]], or the publication of a newspaper were organized, guided by a teacher or counselor.

The [[excursions]] were traditional opportunities to visit places near the school or historical or recreational places in different parts of the country.

At Candler College, there was also a troop of [[Asociación de Scouts de Cuba|Boy Scouts]].

In addition, festivals, bazaars, theatrical performances, Christmas celebrations and others that were part of the annual planning of school activities were organized.

== Student body ==
Candler College and Colegio Buenavista were open to all children and young people without further requirements, who, apart from paying the monthly fee, committed to respecting their standards. Some students were scholarship two for the church and some parents got a reduction in the tuition for their children's education.

The two schools did not admit exclusively Methodist or Protestant students. The majority of the students were [[Catholic]] and there were also some students [[Jews]]. Due to the good level in the teaching of the English language, Candler and Buenavista were chosen by many parents of students [[Alien (law)|foreigners]]{{clarify|date=November 2018}} who lived in Cuba.

In the sixty-two years of existence of Candler College and forty-one of Buenavista, many thousands of students left the schools prepared to continue their studies or enter the world of work and become good citizens. They were equipped with solid foundations of religious faith and moral values to cope with life after school.

=== Alumni Associations ===

The Candler Fraternity was the association of graduates and alumni of Candler College. The former students of Buenavista belonged to the Association of Former Students of Colegio Buenavista.

Many alumni and teachers of Candler and Buenavista left their country in the early 1960s when the revolution that took power in 1959 turned to [[communism]]. Others emigrated later. The majority went to live in the United States, concentrating on the largest number in Florida. Some of those who have been in contact have met on different occasions to remember the old times and reaffirm the spirit of the schools that they all share.

The former students of Candler and Buenavista who remained in Cuba have formed the Candler-Buenavista Fraternity and meet annually since 1999.

'''The Chelsea Arts Club''' is a private members club at '''143 Old Church Street''' in [[Chelsea, London]] with a membership of over 3,800, including artists, sculptors, architects, writers, designers, actors, musicians, photographers, and [[filmmaker]]s. The club was established on 21 March 1891 (in Chelsea), as a rival to the older [[The Arts Club|Arts Club]] in [[Mayfair, London|Mayfair]], on the instigation of the artist [[James McNeill Whistler|James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], who had been a (sometimes controversial) member of the older club.

During its primary season from September–June the Chelsea Arts Club serves as a host for many functions, from instrumental and choral performances to visual arts exhibitions, literary talks, and weekend artist lunches.

Applicants for membership need to be sponsored by two current Members.

The club is located in the former '''Bolton Lodge''', a [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade II listed]] building on the [[National Heritage List for England]].&lt;ref name=NHLE&gt;{{NHLE|num=1225774|desc=Bolton Lodge|access-date=8 January 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Chelsea Arts Ball by William Gordon Burn Murdoch.jpg|thumb| 
''The Chelsea Art Ball'' by [[William Gordon Burn Murdoch]]]]
The Chelsea Arts Club was originally located in rooms at no. 181 [[King's Road]]. In 1902, the club moved to larger premises at no. 143 [[Old Church Street]]. In 1933 the club's premises, which had an acre of garden, were remodeled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clubhouse includes a snooker room, bedrooms, dining room, former 'ladies bar' turned private party room, and a garden.

From 1908 to 1958 the club held a series of public [[Fancy dress party|fancy dress balls]] at the [[Albert Hall]], latterly on [[New Year's Eve]], which raised funds for artists' charities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1958 balls were banned from the Albert Hall owing their notoriety for rowdiness, nudity and public homosexuality ([[Sexual Offences Act 1967|illegal before 1967]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, private functions were held at the club instead, with similarly lavish decorations and themes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1966 the club was redecorated, a new bar was opened, and membership was opened to women artists.

[[File:Chelsea Arts Club - dazzle.jpg|thumb|The building painted with [[dazzle camouflage]]]]
Although normally a plain white building, the club exterior is occasionally painted to coincide with a themed event. It has been painted by set designer Tony Common. In 2010 it was painted bright colours with images of circus performers, and in 2011 was painted to appear as if it had been bombed in order to coincide with celebrations marking 70 years since the end of [[The Blitz]].

For a time the icon was thought to have been dated from the thirteenth century, since it had been almost completely painted over at that time, but it was concluded in 1962 that it is in fact from the mid-sixth century, although the exact date of production is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weitzmann, ''The Monastery of Saint Catherine at Mount Sinai, the Icons'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1976), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Saint Catherine's Monastery|Saint Catherine’s Monastery]] was founded by the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]], late in his reign, between 548 and 565,&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; it enjoyed imperial patronage and donations from Justinian and his court, with the Christ Pantocrator icon having been one of the many possible imperial gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Kōnstantinos A. Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures of the Monastery of Saint Catherine'' (Athens: Ekdotike Athenon, 1990), 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it is generally believed to have been produced in the Byzantine capital of [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, Sinai, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation and meaning ==
{{see also|Christ Pantocrator}}

[[File:Composite_christ_pantocrator.png|thumb|Mirrored composites of left and right sides of image]]

Many agree that the icon represents the [[Hypostatic union|dual nature of Christ]], illustrating traits of both man and god,&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis and Gerry Walters, “An Encaustic Icon of Christ at Sinai,” ''The Art Bulletin'' 49, No. 3 (1967): 201; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Manaphēs 93; Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps influenced by the aftermath of the [[ecumenical council|ecumenical councils]] of the previous century at [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 84; Robin Cormack, ''Oxford History of Art: Byzantine Art'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Christ’s features on the left side{{clarify |date=March 2018 |reason=Is that *his* left side, or the left side of the painting?}} are supposed to represent the qualities of his human nature, while the right side represents his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His right hand is shown opening outward, signifying his gift of blessing, while the left hand and arm is clutching a thick [[Gospel]] book.&lt;ref&gt;Chatzidakis and Walters, “An Encaustic Icon,” 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested the icon at Sinai could have been a possible representation of the Kamouliana icon of Christ&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, ''Byzantine Art'', 78-9; Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 93.&lt;/ref&gt; or of the famous icon of Christ of the [[Chalke Gate]],&lt;ref&gt;Chatzidakis and Walters, “An Encaustic Icon,” 202.&lt;/ref&gt; an image which was destroyed twice during the first and second waves of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]]{{mdash}}first in 726, and again in 814{{mdash}}and thus its connection with the Christ Pantocrator is difficult to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and production ==

With a height of 84&amp;nbsp;cm, width of 45.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and a thickness of 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm, the icon was originally taller and wider before its top and sides were cut.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise there is only one spot with major damage, a large portion of Christ’s hair on his left side, including his left ear and shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] surface has continually been preserved in excellent condition overall.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, ''Sinai, the Icons'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many of the early icons from Sinai, the Christ Pantocrator was created by using this technique, known as encaustic—a medium using hot wax paint—that would rarely continue to be utilized in the Byzantine world after the iconoclastic controversies of the eighth and ninth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, ''Byzantine Art'', 111-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the monastery at Sinai is the only place in the world where a substantial number of these encaustic icons, particularly those dating from as early as the sixth century, have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Period of Byzantine [[Iconoclasm]], the production of Orthodox icons continued at Sinai, whereas they were being destroyed in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survival from Byzantine Iconoclasm and aftermath ==
The Muslim Arabs [[Early Muslim conquests|quickly took control]] of the entire [[Fertile Crescent]] south of the Turkish mountains, including Egypt and Sinai, cutting the monastery’s ties with Constantinople in the year 640.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by the time the era of iconoclasm had been initiated by [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] in 726, the Monastery of Saint Catherine had already been protected under [[caliphate|Muslim rule]] for nearly a century and was able to survive the destruction of iconoclasm.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weitzmann, “The Mosaic in St. Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai,” ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 110, No. 6 (Dec. 1966): 405; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 92; Manaphēs, ''Sinai: Treasures'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the location of the monastery in the rocky desert of Sinai, far away from any major trade or military route, kept the contents within St. Catherine’s safe from raiders as well as conquering armies.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, “Mosaic in St. Catherine’s,” 392; Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Even today the monastery houses more than 2,000 icons, dating from the sixth century to the modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Galey, Forsyth, Weitzmann, ''Sinai'', 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''collective work''' in the [[Copyright law of the United States]] is a work that contains the works of several authors assembled and published into a collective whole. 
The owner of the work has the property rights in the [[collective work]], but the authors of the individual works may retain rights in their contributions.
Electronic reproduction of the whole work is allowed, but electronic reproduction of the individual works on their own, outside the context of the work as a whole, may constitute an infringement of copyright.

==Definition==

The [[Copyright Act of 1976]], section 101, defines a collective work as "a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole". 
It is protected as long as the "author" can show that the selection and organization of the contributions is original, and that these contribution can themselves be protected, as opposed to being mere facts such as statistical data.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The act makes a clear distinction between the collective work and the individual contributions, 
{{quote|Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.{{sfn|Leaffer|2010|loc=PT176}} }}
The [[United States Copyright Office]] says, 
{{quote|A compilation or a collective work may be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, provided that it constitutes copyrightable subject matter. As discussed in Section 307, compilations and collective works are a subset of the subject matter categories set forth in Section 102(a) of the Copyright Act, rather than separate and distinct categories of works. ... Thus, a compilation or a collective work must qualify as a literary work; a musical work; a dramatic work; a pantomime or choreographic work; a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work; a motion picture or audiovisual work; a sound recording; and/or an architectural work.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=312.1}} }}

Because a collective work is a form of compilation,  the U.S. Copyright Office will apply the criteria for compilations to determine whether the author’s selection, coordination, and/or arrangement satisfies the originality requirement.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=312.3}}
Thus a website will be protected only if the author used creativity or subjective judgement to select and arrange the material.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=23}}
Ordinarily, the Office will not examine the preexisting material that appears in a [[derivative work]], a compilation, or a collective work to determine whether that material is protected by copyright or whether it has been used in a lawful manner.{{sfn|Copyrightable Authorship: What Can Be Registered – U.S.|loc=313.6(B)}}

==History==

The first copyright law in the United States, the [[Copyright Act of 1790]], covered maps, charts or books. 
The printed work was protected for 14 years from registration of its title with the district court, and could be renewed for another 14 years by the author, if still alive.
It did not provide for the copyright to be vested initially in an individual or employee who ordered or commissioned a map, chart or book.
The work only covered American authors, allowing publishers to flood the market with cheap reprints of British books.{{sfn|Patry|1994}}
The first major revision was the [[Copyright Act of 1831]], which extended the initial term to 28 years with the option to renew for another 14 years, and granted widows and children of deceased authors the right of renewal.{{sfn|Bracha|2008}}

The [[Copyright Act of 1909]], which became {{USPL|60|349}} on March 4, 1909, covered books, including composite and cyclopaedic works, directories, gazetteers, and other compilations; periodicals, including newspapers; and other works such as lectures, sermons, musical compositions, works of art and maps.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 5}}
Copyright was secured by publication with a notice of copyright.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 9}}
The owner was also required to deposit copies of the work with the copyright office.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 12}}
Copyright protection was for 28 years from date of publication, with the option to renew for a further 28 years.
Copyright could be registered and renewed for a contribution to a periodical or to a cyclopaedic or other composite work.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 23}}
Section 6 of the Act specified:
{{quote|That compilations or abridgements, adaptations, arrangements, dramatizations, translations, or other versions of works in the public domain, or of copyrighted works when produced with the consent of the proprietor of the copyright in such works, or works republished with new matter, shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this Act; but the publication of any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed or any part thereof, or be construed to imply an exclusive right to such use of the original works, or to secure or extend copyright in such original works.{{sfn|An act to amend and consolidate ... 1909|loc=Sec. 6}}}}

The 1909 Act was repealed and superseded by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], but remains effective for copyrighted works created before the Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect in 1978. 
The Copyright Act of 1976 created a static seventy-five-year term (dated from the date of publication) for anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire. 
The extension term for works copyrighted before 1978 that had not already entered the public domain was increased from twenty-eight years to forty-seven years, giving a total term of seventy-five years. 
The [[Copyright Renewal Act of 1992]] {{USStatute|102|307|106|264|1992|06|26}} amended the 1976 Copyright Act, and affected works copyrighted between January 1, 1964 and December 31, 1977. Renewal registration for these works was made optional, and a second term was automatically secured.
In 1998 the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] further extended copyright protection to the duration of the author's life plus seventy years for general copyrights and to ninety-five years from date of publication or 120 years from date of creation, whichever comes first, for works made for hire. 

==Divisibility of copyright==

The 1909 Copyright Act was confused in its discussion of the relationship between copyright in the collective work and that in the individual works.{{sfn|Leaffer|2010|loc=PT176}}
Under the 1909 Act a copyright could only be transferred to another owner in whole, and not in part.
Thus an author could not transfer the rights for their work to be published as part of a collective work without transferring all rights in their work.{{sfn|Fountain}}
''Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc.'', 425 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 397 concerned the rights of the author of the novel ''[[Dark Passage]]'', first published as a serial in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.
The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] held on 9 March 1970 that the doctrine of indivisibility could not wholly deprive an author of his copyright in a case like this.{{sfn|425 F. 2d 397 - Goodis v. United Artists Television}}

The doctrine of indivisibility was expressly eliminated in the Copyright Act of 1976.
Section 106 of the Act lists the exclusive rights that the copyright owner has in a copyrighted work, which are the rights of reproduction; preparation of derivative works; distribution; public performance; public display; and digital performance in sound recordings.
Each of these exclusive rights may be divided to any number of recipients, and each may be limited to a specified time or place.{{sfn|Fountain}}

==Property rights==

The compiler, or author of the collection, owns copyright in the expression he or she contributed, which is primarily the selection and arrangement of the separate contributions, but may include such things as a preface, advertisements, etc., that the collective author created.{{sfn|Barrett|2012|loc=PT449}}
The contributions remain the property of the authors by default, but the property may be passed to the owner of the collective work by a [[copyright transfer agreement]].
They may also obtain ownership of the contributions if they are [[Work for hire|works made for hire]].{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The Copyright Act of 1976 says a work is considered a "work made for hire" as either,

{{quote| (1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a [[collective work]], as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire. (17 U.S.C. § 101){{sfn|Works Made for Hire – US Copyright Office}} }}

It there is no contract transferring ownership and the contributions are not work for hire, the owner has the right to reproduce, distribute and revise the collective work, but does not have the rights to the individual contributions.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

==Classroom use==

Multiple copies of works for classroom use may be made subject to conditions that include "not more than one short poem, article, story, essay, or two excerpts may be copied from the same author, not more than three from the same collective work or periodical volume during one class term.{{sfn|DeGeeter|2004|p=158}}

==Websites==

The websites of daily or weekly magazines or journal such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' or ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' are collective works and qualify for group registration with the Copyright Office.
Electronic journals that are published one article at a time are not collective works.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=40}}
To defeat the "innocent infringer" rule{{efn|See [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]]}}, a collective work website must contain a copyright notice for the work as a whole. 
It does not need to have a copyright notice for the individual works.
Advertisements are not covered by this notice, and require a separate notice to be protected.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=83}}
If a website contains material from the United States government, which is in the public domain, the copyright notice should indicate to readers which parts of the content are public domain and which are not.
If the notice does not do so it will be found invalid, and the innocent infringer defense may be used.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=85}}

''[[Metropolitan Regional Information System, Inc. v. American Home Realty Network, Inc.]]'' [722 F.3d 591] was a [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] case in which a court held that the copyright owner of a collective work such as an automated database was not required by a pre-suit [[copyright registration]] requirement to identify names of creators and titles of individual work. Also, clicking yes to the term of use and uploading a photograph, is sufficient to writing component in assignment of right under {{usc|17|204}}.{{sfn|Metro. Reg'l Info. Sys., Inc. v. Am. Home Realty Network}}

==Electronic reproduction==

The Supreme Court case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'' (2001) concerned free-lance journalists who had been paid for their contributions to paper editions of newspapers and magazines, but their contracts had not covered digital rights for reproduction on CD-ROMs or publication on the Internet.
When the articles were distributed in electronic form a few years later, the court ruled that this did not constitute a revision of the work, because the articles could be accessed individually.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The court also discussed how the work was presented and visible to the user on the [[LexisNexis|Lexis]] online periodical database. 
The databases "present articles to users clear of the context provided either by the original periodical editions or by any revision of those editions ... without the graphics, formatting, or other articles with which the article was initially published.{{sfn|McJohn|2006|p=134}}{{efn|The New York Times argued without success that it had the right to reproduce issues in Braille, in microform or translated into a foreign language, even though these versions would have a very different look and feel, so should have the right to reproduce issues electronically. The court disagreed.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=145}}
Another point that may be made in favor of the judgement is that the newspaper's editorials and opinion section are not shown along with the individual article, and these are essential parts of the collective work and communicate a political perspective with which the authors are associated. The authors may be instead associated in the online work with unwelcome discussion threads that cause them to lose credibility.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=144–145}} }}

In ''Faulkner v. National Geographic Enterprises Inc.'' (2005), a Court of Appeal ruled that an electronic version of a newspaper was a revision of the collective work if it reproduced the paper version identically, including advertisements and photographs.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
In the late 1990s [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] had begun publishing ''The Complete National Geographic'', a digital compilation of all the past issues of the magazine. 
It was then sued over copyright of the magazine as a collective work in ''[[Greenberg v. National Geographic]]'' and other cases, and temporarily withdrew the availability of the compilation. 
On June 30, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit held that National Geographic had the right to publish faithful copies of its print magazine electronically.
The ruling noted, 
{{blockquote|In the light of the Supreme Court’s holding in ''Tasini'' that the bedrock of any § 201(c) analysis is contextual fidelity to the original print publication as presented to, and perceivable by, the users of the revised version of the original publication, we agree with the Second Circuit in ''Faulkner'' and find that National Geographic is privileged to reproduce and distribute the CNG under the “revision” prong of § 201(c)."{{sfn|Greenberg v. National Geographic Society}} }}

An online database that contains copyrightable works may be considered a collective work, where the owner of the database has a "thin" copyright over the selection and arrangement of the works in the database. The individual works may be covered by separate copyrights.{{sfn|Fishman|2007|p=270}}

'''''Concert in the Egg''''' is a painting formerly considered to be a copy of a lost work by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], and which is currently considered to be based on one of his drawings. [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] called it 'an old copy', without specifying another work it was copied from.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/60898 RKD''images'', nr 60898] ([[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==

The group of singers form the "yolk" of the egg, which symbolizes "fool" as in "[[yokel]]". The eel resembles a form of beer (ale). The scene is reminiscent of the similar ''[[Ship of Fools (painting)|Ship of Fools]]''. One of the singers is so intent on his song (pointing towards the book) that he doesn't notice that he is being robbed by the lute player.

Modern attribution of the painting (to an as yet anonymous follower of Bosch) was based on an analysis of the music in the open book, which shows notes of the chanson ''Toutes les nuictz'' by [[Thomas Crecquillon]] from 1549.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kikirpa.be/www2/cgi-bin/wwwopac.exe?DATABASE=obj2&amp;LANGUAGE=1&amp;OPAC_URL=&amp;%250=40001726&amp;LIMIT=50 record &amp;#91;40001726&amp;#93;] ([[Koninklijk Instituut voor het Kunstpatrimonium]])&lt;/ref&gt;
The work was bought in 1890 for 400 francs by the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille]] from ''Morhange'', a parisian art dealer.&lt;ref name=RKD /&gt; It was featured with the Dutch title ''Zangers en musici in een ei'' in an exhibition in 2008 at the [[Noordbrabants Museum]], 's-Hertogenbosch.

'''''Election''''' is a 1999 American [[Black comedy|black]] [[Comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed and written by [[Alexander Payne]] and adapted by him and [[Jim Taylor (writer)|Jim Taylor]] from [[Tom Perrotta]]'s 1998 [[Election (1998 novel)|novel of the same title]]. The plot revolves around a high school election and satirizes both suburban high school life and politics. The film stars [[Matthew Broderick]] as Jim McAllister, a popular high school social studies teacher in suburban [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Tracy Flick]], around the time of the school's [[Student governments in the United States|student body]] election. When Tracy qualifies to run for class president, McAllister believes she does not deserve the title and tries to stop her from winning.

Although a [[box office bomb]], ''Election'' received critical acclaim. The film received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]], a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for Witherspoon in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]] category, and the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film]] in 1999.

==Plot==
Jim McAllister is a beloved high school teacher living in Omaha, Nebraska, whose enthusiastic involvement in school activities masks his frustration with other aspects of his life. Tracy Flick is an overachieving senior whom Jim sees as having a secret vindictive and sexual side. Earlier in the year, Tracy had an [[Extramarital affair|affair]] with another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny. When the affair was discovered, Dave was fired and divorced by his wife Linda; Tracy walked away with her reputation unscathed.

Tracy announces to Jim, who is in charge of organizing the school's student government, that she is running for [[Student Government President|student body president]], telling him they "will be spending a lot of time together." Jim sees this as unbridled ambition and sexual manipulation, and finds it repugnant. With Tracy appearing to have no opposition, Jim decides to teach Tracy a lesson in humility by encouraging Paul Metzler, to enter the race. Paul is a polite and popular football player, sidelined due to a broken leg, leaving him depressed. Jim convinces Paul to declare his candidacy, giving him new purpose. This serves to bring out Tracy's vindictiveness, as she resents Paul's effortless popularity.

Paul's younger sister Tammy is dumped by her lover, Lisa, who says that she is straight and was just "experimenting". Lisa becomes Paul's girlfriend and [[campaign manager]]. In retaliation, Tammy decides to run for president as well, with a nihilistic platform that student government is a sham.

During a school assembly to hear the candidates' final campaign speeches, Tracy draws polite applause while Paul initially receives a warm reception despite giving a lackluster and halting speech, while Tammy delivers a defiant address in which she denounces the election and expresses her intention to dissolve the student government if elected. This rallies the student body to a [[standing ovation]]. As a result of her subversive speech, Tammy is suspended.

While working on a yearbook project, Tracy notices that one of her posters has come untaped from the wall. Attempting to fix it, she accidentally rips the poster apart. In a fit of frustrated rage, she destroys Paul's [[Campaign advertising|campaign posters]]. The following day when Jim confronts Tracy with his suspicion that she was responsible, Tracy claims innocence and threatens [[legal action]] against the school. Tammy falsely confesses to Tracy's crime even though she witnessed Tracy disposing of the posters. Tammy's name is removed from the ballot, she is expelled and her parents enroll her in a private [[parochial school]] for girls, much to her delight.

The day before the election, Jim visits Linda's house to help her with a home repair project, whereupon she initiates a physical relationship by kissing him. Linda asks Jim to rent a motel room for an after-school rendezvous, but never shows up at the motel. When Jim drives over to Linda's house to see what happened, he is stung by a bee on his right eyelid, causing a severe allergic reaction. He returns home to find Linda and his wife talking together. Knowing he has been caught, he spends the night in his car.

The next morning — Election Day — Jim's eyelid is disfigured from the bee sting, but he must oversee the counting of the election [[ballots]]. After the ballots are tabulated, it turns out Tracy has won by a single vote. Tracy's one vote margin of victory came about because Paul, feeling it would be dishonorable to vote for himself, voted for Tracy. During the ballot-counting verification, Jim observes Tracy dancing around gleefully in the hall — one of the student vote counters tipped her off that she won — and he secretly disposes of two of Tracy's ballots, declaring Paul the winner. When a janitor discovers the two discarded ballots in the trash and presents them to the principal, Jim is forced to resign. Jim's wife kicks him out of the house when he tries to apologize for what happened with Linda.

Divorced and humiliated, Jim leaves Nebraska, choosing to fulfill his longtime dream of moving to [[New York City]], where he becomes a tour guide at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and begins dating a new woman. Tracy gets accepted into [[Georgetown University]], while Paul gets into the [[University of Nebraska]]. Tammy finds a new girlfriend at her all-girls school. Jim encounters Tracy Flick one last time on a trip to Washington, D.C., during which he happens to see her get into a [[limousine]] with a male [[politician]]. Disgusted by the thought that Tracy's climb up the ladder of success is the result of her calculating and manipulative nature, Jim impulsively hurls a cup of soda at the limo before making a quick getaway. Jim later speaks to a group of elementary school students at the museum, refusing to respond to the raised hand of an overeager girl who reminds him of Tracy Flick.

==Production==
Director Alexander Payne had become a fan of the novel by Tom Perrotta on which the film is based; the novel's rights were sold to Payne in January 1997. The novel was inspired by two key events. The first was the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 Bush vs. Clinton election campaign]], in which [[Ross Perot]] entered as a third party candidate (a move echoed by Tammy Metzler). The second was a 1992 incident at [[Memorial High School (Eau Claire, Wisconsin)|Memorial High School]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in which a pregnant student was elected homecoming queen, but staff announced a different winner and burned the ballots to cover it up.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D71538F937A25753C1A964958260 | title=Officials Deny Pregnant Girl School Crown | work=The New York Times | date=October 14, 1992 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/21/tom-perrotta-interview | title=A life in writing: Tom Perrotta | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=John | last=Crace | date=February 21, 2009 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film uses a number of stylized techniques in its storytelling, particularly through the use of freeze frames, flashbacks and voiceovers, which allow sections of the narrative to be delivered from the points of view of the four main characters.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117492039.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title=Todd McCarthy Review from 'Variety' | date=April 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Election'' was a [[box office bomb]] as it grossed only $14.9 million against a budget of $25 million.

The film, however, was met with critical acclaim. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 93%, based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The critical consensus reads, "''Election'' successfully combines dark humor and intelligent writing in this very witty and enjoyable film."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten tomatoes|id=election}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 83 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|id=election-1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising Witherspoon and Payne, and saying, "...here is a movie that is not simply about an obnoxious student, but also about an imperfect teacher, a lockstep administration, and a student body that is mostly just marking time until it can go out into the world and occupy valuable space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/election-1999 | title=Election Movie Review (1999) | work=RogerEbert.com | date=April 30, 1999 | accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Election'' is ranked #61 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] "100 Funniest Movies" and #9 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s list of the "50 Best High School Movies", while Witherspoon's performance was ranked at #45 on the list of the "100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time" by ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]''. According to Payne, it is also President [[Barack Obama]]'s favorite political film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=Barack Obama has told me twice that it’s his favorite political film.|last=Jacobs|first=Matthew|title=Pick Flick: An Oral History Of 'Election,' 15 Years Later|date=7 May 2014|publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/07/election-oral-history_n_5248953.html|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The National Eisteddfod of Wales is [[Wales]]' most important national cultural event, taking place annually. Its open exhibition of art and craft, ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: 'The Art Space') is one of the highlights of the Welsh arts calendar.&lt;ref name=goingforgold&gt;{{cite web |title=Going for gold |work=|publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Going+for+gold%3B+Wales+Millennium+Centre+is+counting+down+to+its+10th...-a0359460344 |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold medals are awarded in the [[Visual arts|Visual Arts]] section for outstanding contributions in different media: a Gold Medal for Fine Art has been awarded since 1951;&lt;ref name=fineart&gt;{{cite web |title=Gold Medal for Fine Art |url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/winners/gold-medal-for-fine-art/ |publisher=The National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a medal for Architecture has been offered since 1954 (though withheld and not awarded between 1954 and 1959);&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;{{cite web |title=Gold Medal for Architecture |url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/winners/gold-medal-for-architecture/ |publisher=The National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Gold Medal for Craft and Design has been awarded since 1985.&lt;ref name=craftanddesign&gt;{{cite web |title=Gold Medal for Craft and Design |url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/winners/gold-medal-for-craft-and-design/ |publisher=The National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other awards are the Tony Goble Award, given to a first time exhibitor, and the Josef Herman Award, chosen by the public&lt;ref name=morais2014&gt;{{cite web |author=Morais, Joao |title=Eisteddfod 2014: National Open Exhibition |url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/eisteddfod-2014-national-open-exhibition/ |work=Wales Arts Review|year=2014 |volume=3 |issue=16 |accessdate=20 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Josef Herman]], a Polish emigree, won the Fine Art medal in 1962).&lt;ref name=BBC2011&gt;{{cite web |author=Chamberlain, Laura |title=Archbishop of Canterbury to present Eisteddfod art award |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/archbishop_of_canterbury_to_present_eisteddfod_art_award |work=BBC Wales |format=blog |date=26 July 2011|accessdate=20 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Architecture award was endowed by [[Thomas Alwyn Lloyd]] and is given in conjunction with the [[Design Commission for Wales]] and the [[Royal Society of Architects in Wales]], who advise the Eisteddfod judges.&lt;ref name=BBCblog2012 /&gt;

The award is given to practitioners working in Wales, and a language rule has been in force since 1950 that any original words in art works must be in the [[Welsh language]].&lt;ref name=BBCwindeterred&gt;{{cite news|author=Thomas, Huw |title=Eisteddfod's Welsh language rule could deter artist Josephine Sowden |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25628182 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=8 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 there was controversy when a [[Video art|video]] entirely in [[English language|English]] by England-born [[University of Wales, Newport|University of Wales Newport]] student Josephine Sowden was awarded the Fine Art medal.&lt;ref name=WOwindeterred&gt;{{cite news|author=Morgan, Sion |title=Eisteddfod winner deterred by festival's language policy |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-winner-deterred-festivals-language-6477961 |publisher=[[Wales Online]] |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Language row breaks out over Eisteddfod gold medal |url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/update/2013-08-09/language-row-breaks-out-over-eisteddfod-gold-medal/ |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV News]] |date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=7 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] (WMC) and [[Craft in the Bay]], [[Cardiff]] held an exhibition showcasing the work of previous winners of the Fine Art and the Craft awards.&lt;ref name=goingforgold /&gt;

The '''Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden''' is the State Theatre of the German [[Bundesland (Germany)|state]] [[Hesse]] in its capital [[Wiesbaden]], producing [[opera]]s, [[Play (theatre)|play]]s, [[ballet]]s, [[Musical theatre|musical]]s and [[concert]]s on four stages. It is also known as '''Staatstheater Wiesbaden''' or ''Theater Wiesbaden'', its orchestra is the '''Hessisches Staatsorchester'''. The building was inaugurated in 1894.

The theatre is the host for the annual festival [[Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden]], established in 1896 after the [[Bayreuth Festival]].

== History ==
[[File:Staatstheater Wiesbaden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The back of ''Großes Haus'', from the park]]
The building of the theatre was initiated and substantially supported by the German emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] who regularly visited the [[spa]] in Wiesbaden. A competition was won by a team of architects from [[Vienna]], [[Ferdinand Fellner]] and [[Hermann Helmer]]. They erected the building from 1892 to 1894 in [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque Revival style]], following models in [[Prague]] and [[Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.structurae.info/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0023189 |title=Hessisches Staatstheater |year=2006 |publisher=structurae.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inauguration was on 16 October 1894 in the presence of the emperor. The [[Foyer]] was built in 1902 by architect [[Felix Genzmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bauwerk-weimar.de/referenzen/projekte/2004_hesstheat.php |title=Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden |year=2004 |publisher=bauwerk-weimar.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905033012/http://www.bauwerk-weimar.de/referenzen/projekte/2004_hesstheat.php |archivedate=2011-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves three stages.

After [[World War I]] the theatre was renamed "Preußisches Staatstheater" (Prussian State Theatre). Since 1932 the city of Wiesbaden was responsible for the theatre, therefore it was renamed "Nassauisches Landestheater" (Theater of the Province [[Hesse-Nassau|Nassau]]).

[[File:Hessisches Staatstheater Tympanum.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the south facade]]
The building was seriously damaged in [[World War II]] by a bomb on 3 February 1945. The front was restored in a simplified way and the ceiling of the hall was decorated with a contemporary painting.

In 1946 the State of Hesse took over the operation of the theatre. In 1947 it was used again and called "Großhessisches Staatstheater" (State Theater of Great Hesse), later "Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden".

From 1975 to 1978 the auditorium was restored according to the historic model. The technical equipment was modernized.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebn24.com/index.php?id=32249 |title=Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden |language=German |author=Achim Thorwald |accessdate=27 April 2011 |publisher=European Business Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new tract was built, designed by [[Hardt-Waltherr Hämer]], for rehearsal rooms, workshops and administration.

== Performance facilities ==

[[File:Staatstheater Wiesbaden Zuschauersaa012.JPG|thumb|''Großes Haus'']]
The theatre has four stages, three of them in the historic house: 
* Großes Haus (Great House) with 1,041 seats.
* Kleines Haus (Small House) with 328 seats.
* Studio with 89 seats. 
* Wartburg, from 2003, is an additional small separate stage.

The staff consist of about 600 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deu.archinform.net/projekte/6990.htm |title=Hessisches Staatstheater |language=German |year=2011 |publisher=archinform.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annually more than 25 new operas, plays and ballets have been produced.&lt;ref name="AT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturpur.de/de/deutschland/buehnen/buehne/hessisches+staatstheater+wiesbaden/beschreibung/ |title=Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden |language=German |year=2011 |publisher=Kultur in Deutschland Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is especially dedicated to a young audience, collaborating with schools for "Schultheatertage". A professional ensemble, "Junges Staatstheater" (Young State Theater) is dedicated to children's and youth theater.&lt;ref name="AT" /&gt;

In addition to the annual [[Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden|Internationale Maifestspiele]] in May, since 2004 a biennial festival "Neue Stücke aus Europa" (New European Plays) is organized in collaboration with the [[Staatstheater Mainz]], presenting in ten days new plays in the original language with simultaneous translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesbaden.de/en/culture/theatre/hessian_state_theatre/hessian_state_theatre.php |title=Hessian State Theatre |year=2011 |publisher=Wiesbaden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Murfin''' (October 27, 1884 – August 10, 1955) was an American playwright and screenwriter. The author of several successful plays, she wrote some of them with actress [[Jane Cowl]]—most notably ''[[Smilin' Through (play)|Smilin' Through]]'' (1919), a sentimental fantasy that was adapted three times for motion pictures. In Hollywood Murfin became a popular screenwriter whose credits include ''[[What Price Hollywood?]]'' (1932), for which she received an Academy Award nomination. In the 1920s she wrote and produced films for her dog [[Strongheart]], the first major canine star.

==Life and career==
[[File:Murfin-Strongheart-1923.jpg|thumb|left|Jane Murfin with [[Strongheart]] (1923)]]
Jane Macklem was born October 27, 1884, in [[Quincy, Michigan]]. In 1907 she married attorney James Murfin, and retained his surname when the marriage ended fewer than five years later.&lt;ref name="Buck"/&gt;

Murfin began her career with the play ''Lilac Time'', which she co-wrote with actress [[Jane Cowl]]. The Broadway production opened February 6, 1917, and ran for 176 performances. Later that year the two women began collaborating, often under pseudonym Allan Langdon Martin,&lt;ref name="Murfin IBDb" /&gt; on a series of revivals of World War I melodramas.&lt;ref name="wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-jane-murfin/|title=Jane Murfin – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair later collaborated on ''Daybreak'', followed by ''Information Please'' (1918) and ''[[Smilin' Through (play)|Smilin' Through]]'' (1919).

In Hollywood, Murfin became a leading screenwriter, writing many romantic comedies and dramas by herself or in collaboration.&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz |first=Ephraim |authorlink=Ephraim Katz |editor1-last=Klein |editor1-first=Fred |editor2-last=Nolen |editor2-first=Ronald Dean |title=The Film Encyclopedia|publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York |year=1998 |edition=3rd|page=990 |isbn=0-06-273492-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jane-Murfin-Directing-1924.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Murfin ordering the placement of lights on a film she is directing (1924)]]

In 1920, director [[Laurence Trimble]] persuaded Murfin to purchase a [[German Shepherd]] dog—[[Strongheart]]—that became the first major canine film star.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Trimble |first=Laurence |authorlink=Laurence Trimble |date=1926 |title=Strongheart; The Story of a Wonder Dog  |location=Racine, Wis. |publisher=[[Whitman Publishing]] Company |oclc=4451141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=February 10, 1954 |title=Laurence Trimble Dies |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05E3DB1638E23BBC4852DFB466838F649EDE |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]  |access-date=2016-08-25  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strongheart NYT Obit"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=June 25, 1929 |title=Dog Hero of Films Dies |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9805E2DF1130E33ABC4D51DFB0668382639EDE |newspaper=The New York Times  |access-date=2016-08-25  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strongheart starred in four films that Trimble directed from Murfin's screenplays: ''The Silent Call'' (1921), ''[[Brawn of the North]]'' (1922), ''[[The Love Master (film)|The Love Master]]'' (1924) and ''White Fang'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/SearchResult.aspx?s=&amp;TBL=PN&amp;Type=CA&amp;ID=4364 |title=Strongheart |website=AFI Catalog of Feature Films |publisher=American Film Institute |access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murfin is credited with directing one film, ''Flapper Wives'' (1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/AbbrView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=9093 |title=Flapper Wives |website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the dissolution of her partnership with Trimble. Film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]] described this partnership as both professional and personal; although some sources describe Trimble and Murfin as a husband-and-wife filmmaking team, no marriage has been substantiated.&lt;ref name="Buck"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-jane-murfin/ |title=Jane Murfin |last1=Buck |first1=Julie |last2= |first2= |date=September 27, 2013 |website=Women Film Pioneers Project |publisher=Center for Digital Research and Scholarship, [[Columbia University Libraries]] |access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murfin's later screenwriting credits include ''[[Way Back Home (1931 film)|Way Back Home]]'' (1931), ''[[Our Betters]]'' (1933),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E02E0DE173BEF3ABC4C51DFB4668388629EDE|title=Constance Bennett, Violet Kemble-Cooper and Grant Mitchell in a Film of a Somerset Maugham Play|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=March 17, 2012|date=February 24, 1933|author=[[Mordaunt Hall]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Little Minister (1934 film)|The Little Minister]]'' (1934), ''[[Spitfire (1934 film)|Spitfire]]'' (1934), ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), ''[[Alice Adams (film)|Alice Adams]]'' (1935), ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940), and ''[[Dragon Seed (film)|Dragon Seed]]'' (1944).&lt;ref name="Murfin AFI"/&gt;

Murfin was married to director and actor [[Donald Crisp]] from 1932 until 1944.&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt;

She is buried near Jane Cowl at [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5292 Jane Murfin at Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Murfin was married first to lawyer James Murfin from 1907 to 1912. Her second marriage was to actor [[Donald Crisp]], for whom she would write parts in her scripts.&lt;ref name="wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu"/&gt;

==Accolades==
Murfin and [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]] were nominated for the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Story]] for ''[[What Price Hollywood?]]'' (1932). [[Frances Marion]] received the award, for ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]''.

The '''Kasbah of Béja''' is a historical citadel in the [[Tunisia]]n city [[Béja]], the [[Kasbah]] was built in the 2nd century BC and still exists till today which makes it one of oldest citadels in the region.

== Location ==

The Kasbah was built on the top of a hill of 305 meters in northern Béja, and this site was chosen so the castle can overlook the city and its surrounding plains and countryside.

== History ==

=== The Kasbah during the antique and middle ages ===

The first citadel of Béja was built in 2nd century BC by the [[Carthaginians]], at that time Béja was called [[Vaga (Tunisia)|Vaga]] and was an important agriculture town so Carthage needed to protect specially from barbarian raids, but after the decline of the Carthaginian power, specially after the [[third Punic war]], the city fell under the influence of the [[Numidians]] and their king [[Jugurtha]] made the fortress his center of reign. 
&lt;br /&gt;In 109 BC the [[Romans]] took power over the castle and then destroyed it. In 14 BC the Romans rebuilt the fort and improved it adding a garrison, walls and 22 towers.
&lt;br /&gt;The fort was once again razed to the ground this time by [[Vandals]] during the vandal invasion of North Africa, and the building only raised again by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] after their liberation of the city from the Vandal rule, where the [[Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] ordered in 533 Count Paulos to reconstruct the castle.  
&lt;br /&gt;The expansion of the fort continued after the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] where the new Muslim rulers of the country gave it the name "Kasbah" and made it the official center of their representatives of the northern-region, the expansion continued during the rule of the [[Aghlabids]] but in 943 the Kasbah suffered major damage when Béja was sacked by the [[Kharijite]] rebels led by [[Abu Yazid]] and in 945 the kasbah was restored by the [[Fatimide]] Caliph [[Al-Mansur Billah]].

=== The Kasbah during the modern era ===

[[File:Prise de Béja - 20-5-1881.jpg|thumb|right|Th fall of the Kasbah to the French troops]]
In the 16th century, during the reign of [[Ahmad III (Hafsid)|Ahmed III]], the Kasbah was fortified by adding 14 canons to the fort.  
&lt;br /&gt;The Ottomans too gave their part in the expansion of the citadel by establishing a [[flanking tower]] that protected the southern parts of the Kasbah and a garrison of the [[Janissary]], and in 1677 the Tunisian monarch [[Ali I Bey]] supported the garrison by a [[battalion]] of 500 knights from [[Spahis]].
&lt;br /&gt;After the [[French occupation of Tunisia]] in 1881, the Kasbah become a [[Gendarmerie]] barrack, and that from September 21, 1888 till the independence of the country in 1957.

== Current use ==

After the independence of Tunisia from France, the fortress was turned into a cultural center, but today the Kasbah is in bad conditions. Restorations started in 2005 and directed by the Tunisian [[National Heritage Institute (Tunisia)|National Heritage Institute]], but it has stopped for lack of funding.

'''''Knowing and the Known''''' is a 1949 book by [[John Dewey]] and [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]].

== Overview ==
As well as a Preface, an Introduction and an Index, the book consists of 12 chapters, or papers, as the authors call them in their introduction.&lt;ref name=KnowingKnown&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=John|title=Knowing and the Known|date=1976|publisher=Praeger|url=https://www.aier.org/sites/default/files/Files/Documents/Standard/KnowingKnownFullText.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapters 1 (Vagueness in Logic), 8 (Logic in an Age of Science) and 9 (A Confused "Semiotic") were written by Bentley; Chapter 10 (Common Sense and Science) by Dewey, while the remainder were signed jointly.

The terminology problem in the fields of [[epistemology]] and [[logic]] is partially due, according to Dewey and Bentley,&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].&lt;/ref&gt; to inefficient and imprecise use of words and concepts that reflect three historic levels of organization and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. p107-109&lt;/ref&gt; In the order of chronological appearance, these are :

*'''Self-Action''': Prescientific concepts regarded humans, animals, and things as possessing powers of their own which initiated or caused  their actions.
*'''Interaction''': as described by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], where things, living and inorganic, are balanced against something in a system of interaction, for example, [[Newton's laws of motion|the third law of motion]] states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
*'''Transaction''': where modern systems of descriptions and naming are employed to deal with  multiple aspects and phases of action without  any attribution to  ultimate, final, or independent entities, essences, or realities.

==Transactions==
A series of characterizations of Transactions indicate the wide range of considerations involved.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. p121-139&lt;/ref&gt;

*Transaction is inquiry in which existing descriptions of events are accepted only as tentative and preliminary. New descriptions of the aspects and phases of events based on inquiry may be made at any time.
*Transaction is inquiry characterized by primary observation that may range across all subject matters that present themselves, and may proceed with freedom to re-determine and rename the objects comprised in the system.
*Transaction is Fact such that no one of  the constituents can be adequately specified  as apart from the specification of  all the other constituents of the full subject matter.
*Transaction develops and widens the phases of knowledge, and  broadens the system within the limits of observation and report.
*Transaction regards the extension in time to be comparable to the extension in space, so that “thing” is in action, and “action” is observable in things.
*Transaction assumes no pre-knowledge of either organism or environment alone as adequate, but requires their primary acceptance in a common system.
*Transaction is the procedure which observes men talking and writing, using language and other representational activities to present their perceptions and manipulations. This permits a full treatment, descriptive and functional, of the whole process inclusive of all its contents, and with the newer techniques of inquiry required.
*Transactional Observation insists on the right to freely proceed to investigate any subject matter in whatever way seems appropriate,  under reasonable hypothesis.

Illustration of differences between self-action, interaction, and transaction, as well as the different facets of transactional inquiry are provided by statements of positions that Dewey and Bentley definitely did ''not'' hold and which ''never should be read'' into their work.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. p119-121&lt;/ref&gt;

# They do not use any basic differentiation of subject vs. object; of soul vs. body; of mind vs. matter; or self vs. nonself.
# They do not support the introduction of any ultimate knower from a different or superior realm to account for what is known.
# Similarly, they do not tolerate "entities" or "realities" of any kind intruding as if from behind or beyond the knowing-known events, with power to interfere.
# They exclude the introduction of "faculties" or other "operators" of an organism’s behaviors, and require for all investigations  the direct observation and contemporaneous report of findings and results.
# Especially, they recognize no names that are offered as expressions of “inner” thoughts, nor of names that reflect compulsions  by  outer objects.
# They  reject imaginary words and terms said  to lie between the organism and its environmental objects, and require the direct location and source for all observations relevant to the investigation.
# They tolerate no meanings offered as "ultimate" truth or "absolute" knowledge.
# Since they  are concerned with what is inquired into, and the process of knowings, they have no interest in any underpinning. Any statement that is or can be made about a knower, self, mind, or subject, or about a known thing, an object, or a cosmos must be made on the basis of, and in the language applicable to the specific investigation.

In summary, all of human knowledge consists of actions and products of acts in which men and women participate with other human beings, with animals and plants, as well as objects of all types, in any environment. Men and women have, are, and will present their acts of knowing and known in language. Generic people, and specific men and women, are known to be vulnerable to error. Consequently, all knowledge (knowing and known) whether commonsensical or scientific; past, present, or future; is subject to further inquiry, examination, review, and revision.

The lamp was created by London silversmith John Ruslen in 1709.&lt;ref&gt;

The lamp has been on loan to the [[London Jewish Museum]], which has displayed it for 77 years, since the day the museum opened in 1932.&lt;ref name="jp"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The lamp is considered to be among the most important objects in the museum's collection.&lt;ref name="ad" /&gt; It is feared that if sufficient funds cannot be raised to purchase the lamp, it will be purchased by a private collector and disappear from public view.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt; If the Museum, which is undergoing a major renovation, manages to raise sufficient funds to purchase the menorah, it will be on view in a new gallery entitled "Judaism: A Living Faith", designed to display the museum's "magnificent" collection of Jewish ceremonial art. The Museum's collection of ceremonial art has been awarded "designated" status by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council in recognition of its outstanding national importance.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;

In 2009 the family that has long loaned the lamp to the Museum announced that it wished to sell the lamp, a price of £300,000 was set should the Museum wish to purchase the lamp.&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;  The [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]] (NHMF) agreed to contribute £145,000. The Art Fund offered to contribute £75,000 and the MLA /V&amp;A Purchase Fund £30,000, if the Museum can raise the remaining £50,000 from private donors.&lt;ref name="ad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel Gruber's Jewish Art"/&gt;

The [[sterling silver]] menorah is chased with a relief image of the Prophet [[Elijah]] fed by [[raven]]s, a scene from the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] (I Kings 17:6). It is common for Jewish ceremonial artistic objects to depict a biblical character bearing the same name as the patron who commissioned an object, in this case Elias (Elijah) Lindo. The subject is not very common in Jewish art, but it was popular in the Baroque period in both Catholic and Protestant lands.&lt;ref name="Samuel Gruber's Jewish Art"&gt;

This list includes major monographs that were ''not'' released as standalone publications. In the case of journal articles and papers, the parent publication is indicated in brackets.

Only the primary [[prose|prosaic]] language is listed for each publication, although many of the earlier monographs also include substantial portions of [[Latin]] text in the form of taxon descriptions. Some of the taxa [[Species description|formally described]] in these monographs are not considered taxonomically valid today.

'''''Little Women''''' is a 1994 American [[family]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Gillian Armstrong]]. The screenplay by [[Robin Swicord]], is based on [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s [[Little Women|1868 novel of the same name]]. It is the fifth [[feature film]] adaptation of the Alcott classic, following silent versions released in 1917 and 1918, a [[Little Women (1933 film)|1933 George Cukor-directed release]] and a [[Little Women (1949 film)|1949 adaptation by Mervyn LeRoy]], with the story subsequently [[Little Women (2019 film)|adapted in 2019]] starring [[Saoirse Ronan]]. It was released exclusively on December 21, 1994, and was released nationwide four days later on December 25, 1994, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film is dedicated to murder victim [[Murder of Polly Klaas|Polly Klaas]] and literary agent Judy Scott-Fox.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/little-women-3-1200439688/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film focuses on the March sisters: beautiful Meg, [[Wiktionary:tempestuous|tempestuous]] Jo, tender Beth, and romantic Amy, who are growing up in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] during and after the [[American Civil War]]. With their father away fighting in the war, the girls struggle with major and minor problems under the guidance of their strong-willed mother, affectionately called Marmee. As a means of escaping some of their problems, the sisters revel in performing in romantic [[play (theatre)|plays]] written by Jo in their attic theater.

Living next door to the family is wealthy Mr. Laurence, whose grandson Theodore, nicknamed "Laurie", moves in with him and becomes a close friend of the March family, particularly Jo. Mr. Laurence becomes a mentor for Beth, whose exquisite piano-playing reminds him of his deceased young daughter, and Meg falls in love with Laurie's [[tutor]] John Brooke.

When Mr. March is wounded in the war, Jo sells her hair so that Marmee can purchase a train ticket to travel to Mr. March and nurse him back to health. While Marmee is away, Beth continues Marmee's visits to a struggling family in order to provide them food and firewood. During this time she contracts [[scarlet fever]] from the family's infant. Awaiting Marmee's return, Meg and Jo, who both previously survived scarlet fever, send Amy away to live in safety with their Aunt March. Fearing that she too may contract the illness, Amy laments to Laurie that she may die without ever being kissed. Laurie promises Amy to kiss her before she dies should she become ill. Prior to Beth's illness, Jo had been Aunt March's companion for several years, and while she was unhappy with her position she tolerated it in the hope her aunt one day would take her to [[Europe]]. When Beth's condition worsens, Marmee is summoned home and nurses her to recovery just in time for Christmas. Mr. Laurence gives his daughter's piano to Beth, Meg accepts John Brooke's proposal and Mr. March surprises his family by returning home from the war.

Four years pass; Meg (now twenty) and John marry, and Beth's health is deteriorating steadily. Laurie graduates from college, proposes to Jo (now nineteen) and asks her to go to [[London]] with him, but realizing she thinks of him more as an older brother than a lover, she refuses his offer. Jo later deals with the added disappointment that Aunt March has decided to take, the now seventeen year old, Amy with her to Europe instead of Jo, as Amy now works as aunt's companion and Aunt March wishes for Amy to further her training as an artist in Europe. Crushed, Jo departs for [[New York City]] to pursue her dream of writing and experiencing life. There she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a [[Germany|German]] [[professor]] who challenges and stimulates her intellectually, introduces her to [[opera]] and [[philosophy]], and encourages her to write better stories than the lurid [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]]s she has penned so far.

In Europe, Amy is reunited with Laurie. She is disappointed to find he has become dissolute and irresponsible, and scolds him for pursuing her merely to become part of the March family. In return, he bitterly rebukes her for courting one of his wealthy college friends in order to marry into money. He leaves Amy a letter asking her to wait for him while he works in London for his grandfather and makes himself worthy of her.

Jo is summoned home to see eighteen year old Beth, who finally dies of the lingering effects of [[scarlet fever]] (presumably [[rheumatic heart disease]]) that have plagued her for the past four years. A saddened Jo retreats to the comfort of the attic and begins to write her [[narrative|life story]]. Upon its completion, she sends it to Professor Bhaer. Meanwhile, Meg gives birth to [[Fraternal Twins|fraternal twins]] Demi and Daisy.

A letter from Amy informs the family that Aunt March is too ill to travel, so Amy must remain in Europe with her. In London, Laurie receives a letter from Jo in which she informs him of Beth's death and mentions Amy is in [[Vevey]], unable to come home. Laurie immediately travels to be at Amy's side. They finally return to the March home as husband and wife, much to Jo's surprise and eventual delight.

Aunt March dies and she leaves Jo her house, which she decides to convert into a school. Professor Bhaer arrives with the printed galley proofs of her [[manuscript]], but when he mistakenly believes Jo has married Laurie he departs to catch a train to the West, where he is to become a teacher. Jo runs after him and explains the misunderstanding. When she begs him not to leave, he proposes marriage and she happily accepts.

==Cast==
* [[Winona Ryder]] as Josephine "Jo" March, an ambitious young woman, who longs to become a successful author.
* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Friedrich Bhaer, an older professor who falls in love with Jo while he works as a tutor in New York and eventually marries her.
* [[Trini Alvarado]] as Margaret "Meg" March, the oldest March sister. She marries Laurie's tutor, John Brooke, and gives birth to fraternal twins: a boy, John (nicknamed "Demijohn" by Jo, which is shortened to "Demi"); and a girl, Margaret, called "Daisy" at home "so as to not have two Megs".
* [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Samantha Mathis]] as Amy March, the youngest March child and quick-witted daughter. Instead of the brown hair and brown or green eyes of her three older sisters, she has golden curls and blue eyes. She later marries Laurie and becomes a successful painter.

* [[Claire Danes]] as Elizabeth "Beth" March, the third March daughter and the pianist of the family. She is shy, good, sweet, kindly, and loyal. At the young age of fourteen, she contracted scarlet fever, which weakened her heart and resulted in her death four years later at the age of eighteen.
* [[Christian Bale]] as Theodore "Laurie" Laurence, the young neighbor who became Jo's best friend in their youth. Later, he tried, but failed, to convince her to marry him. He eventually falls in love with and marries Amy.

* [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Mr. March, the father of the four March daughters, Marmee's loving husband, and long-time devoted spouse.
* [[Florence Paterson]] as Hannah, the loyal housekeeper of the March family since Meg was born. The girls think of her more as a good friend than a servant.
* [[Janne Mortil]] as Sally Moffat, Meg's one and only good friend, who is quite rich and prosperous.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film 3{{sfrac|1|2}} stars, calling it "a surprisingly sharp and intelligent telling of Louisa May Alcott's famous story, and not the soft-edged children's movie it might appear." He added, "[It] grew on me. At first, I was grumpy, thinking it was going to be too sweet and devout. Gradually, I saw that Gillian Armstrong [...] was taking it seriously. And then I began to appreciate the ensemble acting, with the five actresses creating the warmth and familiarity of a real family."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941221/REVIEWS/412210302/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Guthmann of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called the film "meticulously crafted and warmly acted" and observed it "is one of the rare Hollywood studio films that invites your attention, slowly and elegantly, rather than propelling your interest with effects and easy manipulation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/06/23/DD68803.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Little Women'' has a strong 91% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 32 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10 and with the consensus: "Thanks to a powerhouse lineup of talented actresses, Gillian Armstrong's take on Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' proves that a timeless story can succeed no matter how many times it's told."

===Box office===
The film opened on 1,503 screens in the US and Canada on December 21, 1994. It grossed $5.3 million and ranked #6 at the box office on its opening weekend and eventually earned $50.1 million.&lt;ref name="bom" /&gt; Against its budget of $18 million, the film was a success.

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Winona Ryder, [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] for [[Colleen Atwood]] (who was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|BAFTA Award]] in the same category), and [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Original Score]] for composer [[Thomas Newman]], who won the [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI Film Music Award]].

Winona Ryder was named Best Actress by the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards. Kirsten Dunst won the [[Young Artist Award]], and the [[Boston Society of Film Critics Awards 1994|Boston Society of Film Critics]] honored her for her performance in both ''Little Women'' and ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]''.

Robin Swicord was nominated for the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] but lost to [[Eric Roth]] for ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.

==Home media==

She is currently executive producer of the digital drama series ''[[Anacostia (web series)|Anacostia]]'', where she has played the role of Alexis Jordan since 2011. Byrne has won three [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s for acting.

==Early life==
Byrne was born in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]], the daughter of Terrence Joseph and Mary Adele (née TuMulty) Byrne.&lt;ref name=filmref /&gt;

==Career==

===Featured roles===
Byrne began acting at a young age when she joined the cast of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', where she played the role of July.

She was a featured actor on a number of prime time episodic television programs, including ''[[Kate and Allie]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Parker Lewis Can't Lose]]'', ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', and ''[[Hearts are Wild]]''.

Byrne's best known film role was as the title character in the 1983 film ''[[Anna to the Infinite Power]]''. In 2010 she provided the commentary for the film's DVD release.

===Daytime television===
Byrne is best known for portraying [[Lily Walsh|Lily Walsh Snyder]] on the [[CBS Daytime]] [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]''. She started in May 1985 at age 15, taking over from another teenage actress. Byrne soon became part of a "[[supercouple]]" when then-[[head writer]] [[Douglas Marland]] paired "poor little rich girl" Lily with hard-luck farmhand [[Holden Snyder]], played by [[Jon Hensley]]. The show attracted controversy in 1987 when Byrne—months shy of her 18th birthday—and equally underage actor [[Brian Bloom]] played out a storyline in which they lost their virginity to each other.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!-- Source needed to establish that this was actually controversial in the press. --&gt;

Byrne won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Younger Actress]] in 1987.

She won another Daytime Emmy in 2001, this time as [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress]].

Byrne left ''As the World Turns'' again in April 2008. The show's [[executive producer]] [[Christopher Goutman]] stated, "We made Martha an incredibly generous offer in hopes that she would remain a valuable member of the ''ATWT'' cast.

===Music===
Byrne is also a singer. She contributed a Christmas medley to the 1994 [[RCA|RCA release]], ''A Soap Opera Christmas.'' She released her self-titled album ''Martha Byrne'' in 1996.

She has also released a second album, ''Woman Thing Music''. Byrne again was the subject of controversy, as the sponsor of the second album was [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]]. The CD could only be purchased in conjunction with the purchase of cigarettes, or at one of the "Woman Music Thing" concerts that Philip Morris sponsored. Byrne eventually withdrew endorsement from the music label, as she did not want to be associated with a product that could encourage underage smoking.

In 2006 Byrne released a third album, ''The Other Side''.

{{Greek myth (personified)}}
In [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], the '''Moirai''' or '''Moerae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔɪ|r|aɪ|,_|-|r|i}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/moirai Moirai] in [[Oxford Living Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/moirai Moirai] in [[Collins English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|Μοῖραι}}, "apportioners"), often known in English as the '''Fates''' ({{lang-la|Fata|Fata, -orum (n)=}}), were the white-robed [[Anthropomorphism|incarnations]] of [[destiny]]; their [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent was the [[Parcae]] (euphemistically the "sparing ones"), there are other equivalents in cultures that descend from the [[Proto-Indo-European_mythology#Societal_deities|proto-Indo-European culture]]. Their number became fixed at three: [[Clotho]] (spinner), [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] (allotter) and [[Atropos]] (literally 'unturnable' but metaphorically 'inflexible' or 'inevitable' – i.e. death).

They controlled the mother thread of life of every mortal from birth to death. They were independent, at the helm of necessity, directed fate, and watched that the fate assigned to every being by eternal laws might take its course without obstruction. The gods and men had to submit to them, although [[Zeus|Zeus's]] relationship with them is a matter of debate: some sources say he can command them (the ''Zeus Moiragetes''), yet others suggest he was also bound to the Moirai's dictates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Moirai.html#Zeus |title=Theoi project: Moirae and the Throne of Zeus |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Homer]]ic poems '''Moira''' or '''Aisa''', is related with the limit and end of life, and [[Zeus]] appears as the guider of destiny. In the ''[[Theogony]]'' of [[Hesiod]], the three '''Moirai''' are personified, daughters of [[Nyx]] and are acting over the gods.&lt;ref name=Hesiod221&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' 221–225. "Also Night ([[Nyx]]) bare the destinies (Moirai), and ruthless avenging Fates ([[Keres (mythology)|Keres]]), who give men at their birth both evil and good to have, and they pursue the transgressions of men and gods... until they punish the sinner with a sore penalty." [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm online ''The Theogony of Hesiod. Transl. Hugh Evelyn White'' (1914) 221–225].&lt;/ref&gt; Later they are daughters of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]], who was the embodiment of divine order and law. In [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' the Three Fates are daughters of [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (necessity).&lt;ref&gt;''Plato, Republic 617c (trans. Shorey) (Greek philosopher 4th century BC)'': [http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ananke.html Theoi Project – Ananke].&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that '''Moira''' is related with [[Tekmor (mythology)|Tekmor]] (proof, ordinance) and with [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (destiny, necessity), who were primeval goddesses in [[mythical]] [[cosmogonies]]. The ancient Greek writers might call this power '''Moira''' or [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]], and even the gods could not alter what was ordained :

"''To the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) the might of Zeus must bow; and by the Immortals' purpose all these things had come to pass, or by the Moirai's ordinance.''"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] |title=The Fall of Troy |location=13. 545 ff |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0490%3Abook%3D13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Prometh.515&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', 510–518: "Not in this way is Moira (Fate) who brings all to fulfillment, destined to complete this course. Skill is weaker far than Ananke (necessity). Yes in that even he (Zeus) cannot escape what is foretold." [http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ananke.html Theoi Project – Ananke]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a universal principle of natural order has been compared to similar concepts in other cultures like the [[Vedic]] [[Rta]], the [[Avesta]]n [[Asha]] ([[Asha|Arta]]) and the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] [[Maat]].

In earliest [[Greek philosophy]], the [[cosmogony]] of [[Anaximander]] is based on these [[mythical]] beliefs. The goddess [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] (justice, divine retribution), keeps the order and sets a limit to any actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], ''In Physica'' 24.13. The Greek peers of Anaximander echoed his sentiment with the belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate: Bertrand Russell (1946). ''A history of Western Philosophy, and its connections with Political and Social Circumstances from the earliest times to the Present Day''. New York. Simon and Schuster p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Rundscheibe Drei Parzen KGM AE470.jpg|thumb|The three fates, Lachesis, Atropos, and Cloto; by Hans Vischer c. 1530 AD. [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]]]]
The [[ancient Greek]] word '''moira''' (μοῖρα) means a portion or lot of the whole, and is related to ''meros'', "part, lot" and ''moros'', "fate, doom",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Moira Moira], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] ''meritum'', "reward", [[English language|English]] ''merit'', derived from the [[PIE]] root ''*(s)mer'', "to allot, assign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=merit merit], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moira'''  may mean portion or share in the distribution of booty (ίση μοῖρα ''ísē moîra'' "equal booty"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]], 9.318:[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmoi%3Dra ''Lidell,Scott A Greek English Lexicon'': μοῖρα],&lt;/ref&gt; portion in life, lot, destiny, (μοῖραv ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι ''moîran éthēken athánatoi'' "the immortals fixed the destiny")&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 19.152: :[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmoi%3Dra ''Lidell,Scott A Greek English Lexicon'': μοῖρα]&lt;/ref&gt; death (μοῖρα θανάτοιο ''moîra thanátoio'' "destiny of death"), portion of the distributed land.,&lt;ref&gt;The citizents of [[Sparta]] were called ''omoioi'' (equals), indicating that they had equal parts ("isomoiria" ἰσομοιρία) of the allotted land&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used for something which is meet and right (κατὰ μοῖραν, ''katà moîran'', "according to fate, in order, rightly")&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 16.367: :[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmoi%3Dra ''Lidell,Scott A Greek English Lexicon'': μοῖρα]&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that originally the word '''moira''' did not indicate destiny but included ''ascertainment'' or ''proof'', a non-abstract certainty. The word [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]], which was an agent related to unexpected events, came to be similar to the word '''moira'''.&lt;ref&gt;M.Nillson, Vol I, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;  This agent or cause against human control might be also called [[tyche]] (chance, fate): "You mistress '''moira''', and [[tyche]], and my [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] "&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Iph.Aul. V 113'': " ΄'ω πότνια μοίρα καί τύχη, δαίμων τ΄εμός "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%3Dxh ''Lidell,Scott A Greek English Lexicon'': τύχη].&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''nomos'', "law", may have meant originally a portion or lot, as in the verb ''nemein'', "to distribute", and thus "natural lot" came to mean "natural law".&lt;ref&gt;L.H.Jeffery (1976) ''Archaic Greece. The City-States c. 700–500 BC ''. Ernest Benn Ltd. London &amp; Tonbridge p. 42 {{ISBN|0-510-03271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''dike'', "justice", conveyed the notion that someone should stay within his own specified boundaries, respecting the ones of his neighbour. If someone broke his boundaries, thus getting more than his ordained part, then he would be punished by law. By extension, ''moira'' was one's portion or part in destiny which consisted of good and bad moments as was predetermined by the ''Moirai'' (Fates), and it was impossible for anyone to get more than his ordained part. In modern [[Greek language|Greek]] the word came to mean "destiny" (μοίρα or ειμαρμένη).

[[Destiny|Kismet]], the predetermined course of events in the [[Muslim]] traditions, seems to have a similar etymology and function: [[Arabic]] ''qismat'' "lot" ''qasama'', "to divide, allot"  developed to mean [[Fate]] or destiny. As a loanword, '''''qesmat''''' 'fate' appears in [[Persian language|Persian]], whence in [[Urdu]] language, and eventually in English [[Destiny|Kismet]].

==The three Moirai==
[[File:The Three Fates by Paul Thumann.jpg|thumb|''The Three Fates'' by [[Paul Thumann]] (19th century)]]

When they were three,&lt;ref&gt;The expectation that there would be three was strong by the 2nd century CE: when Pausanias visited the temple of Apollo at Delphi, with Apollo and Zeus each accompanied by a Fate, he remarked "There are also images of two Moirai; but in place of the third Moira there stand by their side Zeus Moiragetes and Apollon Moiragetes."&lt;/ref&gt; the Moirai were:
* '''[[Clotho]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|oʊ|θ|oʊ}}, Greek {{lang|grc|Κλωθώ}} {{IPA-el|klɔːˈtʰɔː|}} – "spinner") spun the thread of life from her [[Distaff]] onto her [[Spindle (textiles)|Spindle]].  Her Roman equivalent was ''[[Nona (mythology)|Nona]]'', (the 'Ninth'), who was originally a goddess called upon in the ninth month of [[pregnancy]].  
* '''[[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|k|ᵻ|s|ɪ|s}}, Greek {{lang|grc|Λάχεσις}} {{IPA|[ˈlakʰesis]}} – "allotter" or drawer of lots) measured the thread of life allotted to each person with her [[measuring rod]].  Her Roman equivalent was ''[[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]'' (the 'Tenth').  
* '''[[Atropos]]''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|r|ə|p|ɒ|s}}, Greek {{lang|grc|Ἄτροπος}} {{IPA|[ˈatropos]}} – "inexorable" or "inevitable", literally "unturning",&lt;ref&gt;Compare the ancient goddess [[Adrasteia]], the "inescapable".&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called Aisa) was the cutter of the thread of life.  She chose the manner of each person's death; and when their time was come, she cut their life-thread with "her abhorred [[Scissors|shears]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Comes the blind Fury with th'abhorred shears, / And slits the thin spun life." [[John Milton]], [[Lycidas]], l. 75. {{wikisource-inline|Lycidas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Roman equivalent was ''[[Morta (mythology)|Morta]]'' ('Dead One').

In the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' of [[Plato]], the three Moirai sing in unison with the music of the [[Siren (mythology)|Seirenes]]. [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] sings the things that were, [[Clotho]] the things that are, and [[Atropos]] the things that are to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plato|authorlink=Plato|title=Republic|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|edition=2 (November 15, 1992) |page=617c|translator=Sorrey|ISBN=978-0872201361}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pindar]] in his Hymn to the Fates, holds them in high honour. He calls them to send their sisters [[Hours (mythology)|Hours]], [[Eunomia (goddess)|Eunomia]] (Lawfulness), [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] (Right), and [[Eirene (Greek goddess)|Eirene]] (Peace), to stop the internal civil strife:
            &lt;blockquote&gt;
            Listen Fates, who sit nearest of gods to the throne of Zeus,
            and weave with shuttles of adamant,
            inescapable devices for councels of every kind beyond counting,
            [[Atropos|Aisa]], [[Clotho]] and [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]],
            fine-armed daughters of [[Nyx|Night]],
            hearken to our prayers, all-terrible goddesses,
            of sky and earth.
            Send us rose-bosomed Lawfulness,
            and her sisters on glittering thrones,
            Right and crowned Peace, and make this city forget the misfortunes which lie heavily on her heart.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], '' Fragmenta Chorica Adespota, 5''. Diehl&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ancient times caves were used for burial purposes in eastern [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]], along with underground shrines or temples. The priests and the priestesses had considerable influence upon the world of the living. Births are recorded in such shrines, and the [[Greeks|Greek]] legend of conception and birth in the tomb – as in the story of [[Danaë|Danae]]- is based on the ancient belief that the dead know the future. Such caves were the caves of [[Ida (mountain)|Ida]] and [[Dikte]] mountains in [[Crete]], where myth situates the birth of [[Zeus]] and other gods, and the cave of [[Eileithyia]] near [[Knossos]].&lt;ref name=Wunderlich290&gt;R. G. Wunderlich  (1994). ''The secret of Crete''. Efstathiadis group, Athens pp. 290–291, 295–296. (British Edition, Souvenir Press Ltd. London 1975)  {{ISBN|960-226-261-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] goddesses were named [[Britomartis|Diktynna]] (later identified with [[Artemis]]), who was a mountain [[nymph]] of hunting, and [[Eileithyia]] who was the goddess of childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert|Burkert]], Walter. (1985). ''The Greek Religion'', Harvard University Press. pp 32–47&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that in Pre-Greek religion Aisa was a [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]. In [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean]] religion Aisa or Moira was originally a living power related with the limit and end of life. At the moment of birth she spins the destiny, because birth ordains death.&lt;ref name=Ilias7.52&gt;"Not yet is thy fate (moira) to die and meet thy doom" ([[Ilias]] 7.52), "But thereafter he (Achilleus) shall suffer whatever Fate (Aisa) spun for him at his birth, when his mother bore him": ([[Ilias]] 20.128 ): [[Martin P. Nilsson|M. Nilsson]]. (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion'' Vol I, C.F.Beck Verlag., Műnchen pp. 363–364&lt;/ref&gt; Later Aisa is not alone, but she is accompanied by the "Spinners", who are the [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] of [[Destiny|Fate]].&lt;ref name=Oddysey7.198&gt;"But thereafter he shall suffer whatever Fate (Aisa) and the dread Spinners spun with her thread for him at his birth, when his mother bore him." (''[[Odyssey]]'' 7.198)&lt;/ref&gt; The act of spinning is also associated with the gods, who at birth and at marriage do not spin the thread of life, but individual events like destruction, return or good fortune. Everything which has been spun must be winded on the spindle, and this was considered a cloth, like a net or loop which captured man.&lt;ref&gt;"Easily known is the seed of that man for whom the son of Cronos spins the seed of good fortune at marriage and at birth." ([[Odyssey]], 4.208 ): 
[[Martin P. Nilsson|M.Nilsson]]. (1967). "Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion". C.F.Beck Verlag., München pp. 363–364&lt;/ref&gt;

Invisible bonds and knots could be controlled from a loom, and twining was a magic art used by the magicians to harm a person, and control his individual fate.&lt;ref name=Nilsson114&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|M.Nilsson]]. (1967). "Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion". C.F.Beck Verlag., München pp. 114, 200&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar ideas appear in [[Norse mythology]],&lt;ref&gt;"If a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero. But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving. ":Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007): ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo.  P. 72 {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Greek folklore. The appearance of the gods and the Moirai may be related to the fairy tale motif, which is common in many [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] sagas and also in Greek folklore. The fairies appear beside the cradle of the newborn child and bring gifts to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|M.Nilsson]]. (1967). "Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion". C.F.Beck Verlag., München pp. 363–364&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple attendants may be considered representations of the Moirai, who belonged to the underworld, but secretly guided the lives of those in the upperworld. Their power could be sustained by witchcraft and oracles.&lt;ref name="Wunderlich290"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]] the Moirai at birth are accompanied by [[Eileithyia]]. At the birth of [[Hercules]]  they use together a magic art, to free the newborn from any "bonds" and  "knots".&lt;ref name=Nilsson114/&gt;

==The Homeric Moira==
[[File:AstraeaVSH.JPG|thumb|An 1886 bas-relief figure of [[Astraea (mythology)|Dike Astraea]] in the Old Supreme Court Chamber at the [[Vermont State House]].]]

Much of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] religion survived into [[classical Greece]], but it is not known to what extent Greek religious belief is Mycenean, nor how much is a product of the [[Greek Dark Ages]] or later. [[Moses I. Finley|M.Finley]] detected only few authentic Mycenean beliefs in the 8th-century [[Homeric]] world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses I. Finley|M.Finley]] (1978). ''The world of Odysseus''. p.124&lt;/ref&gt; The religion which later the Greeks considered [[Greeks|Hellenic]] embodies a paradox. Though the world is dominated by a divine power bestowed in different ways on men, nothing but "darkness" lay ahead. Life was frail and unsubstantial, and man was like "a shadow in a dream".&lt;ref&gt;"Man's life is a day. What is he, what is he not? A shadow in a dream is man.: [[Pindar]], ''Pythionikos'' VIII 95-7: C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience''. The World publishing company. Cleveland and New York.  p. 64 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Homeric]] poems the words ''moira'', ''aisa'', ''moros''  mean "portion, part". Originally they did not indicate a power which led destiny,  and must be considered to include the "ascertainment" or "proof". By extension ''Moira'' is the portion in glory, happiness,  mishappenings, death (μοίρα θανάτοιο: destiny of death)  which are unexpected events. The unexpected events were usually attributed to [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]s, who appeared in special occurrences. In that regard ''Moira'' was later considered an agent, like the daemon of Pre-Greek religion.&lt;ref name=Nilsson361&gt;[[Martin P. Nilsson|M.Nilsson]] (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion, Vol I ''. C.F.Beck Verlag. München.  p.361-368&lt;/ref&gt;

People believed that their portion in destiny was something similar with their portion in booty, which was distributed according to their descent, and traditional rules. It was possible to get more than their ordained portion (moira), but they had to face severe consequences because their action was "over moira" (υπέρ μοίραν:over the portion). It may be considered that they "broke the order".  The most certain order in human lives is that every human should die, and this was determined by ''Aisa'' or ''Moira'' at the moment of birth.&lt;ref name=Ilias7.52/&gt; The [[Mycenae|Myceneans]] believed that what comes should come ([[fatalism]]), and this was considered rightly offered (according to [[destiny|fate]]: in order). If someone died in battle, he would exist like a shadow in the gloomy space of the underworld.&lt;ref name=Nilsson361/&gt;

The kingdom of ''Moira'' is the kingdom of the limit and the end. In a passage in ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Apollo]] tries three times to stop [[Patroclus]] in front of the walls of [[Troy]], warning him that it is "over his portion" to sack the city. Aisa (moira) seems to set a limit on the most vigorous men's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 16.705: "Draw back noble Patrolos, it is not your lot (aisa) to sack the city of the Trojan chieftains, nor yet it will be that of Achilleus, who is far better than you are.": C.Castoriades (2004), ''Ce que fait La Grece. 1 D' Homere a Heraclite. La creation Humaine II ''. Edition du Seuils, Paris p.300&lt;/ref&gt;

Moira is a power acting in parallel with the gods, and even they could not change the destiny which was predetermined. In the [[Iliad]], [[Zeus]] knows that his dearest [[Sarpedon]] will be killed by [[Patroclus]], but he cannot save him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 16.433: "Ah, woe is me, for that it is fated that Sarpedon, dearest of men to me, be slain by Patroclus, son of Menoetius!  And in twofold wise is my heart divided in counsel as I ponder in my thought whether I shall snatch him up while yet he liveth and set him afar from the tearful war in the rich land of Lycia, or whether I shall slay him now beneath the hands of the son of Menoetius."&lt;/ref&gt; In the famous scene of [[Weighing of souls|Kerostasia]], [[Zeus]] the chief-deity of the [[Mycenae|Myceneans]] appears as the guider of destiny. Using a pair of scales he decides that [[Hector]] must die, according to his  ''aisa'' (destiny).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. V. |last=Morrison |title=Kerostasia, the Dictates of Fate, and the Will of Zeus in the Iliad |journal=Arethusa |volume=30 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=276–296 |doi=10.1353/are.1997.0008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His decision seems to be independent from his will, and is not related with any  "moral purpose". His attitude is explained by [[Achilleus]] to [[Priam]], in a parable of two jars at the door of Zeus, one of which contains good things, and the other evil. Zeus gives a mixture to some men, to others only evil and such are driven by hunger over the earth. This was the old  "heroic outlook".&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 24.527-33: C. M. Bowra (1957). ‘’The Greek experience’’. The World publishing company. Cleveland and New York.  p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The personification of  ''Moira''   appears in the newer parts of the epos. In ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is accompanied by the "Spinners",  the personifications of [[Destiny|Fate]], who do not have separate names.&lt;ref name=Oddysey7.198/&gt; Moira seems to spin the predetermined course of events. [[Agamemnon]] claims that 
he is not responsible for his arrogance. He took the prize of [[Achilleus]], because [[Zeus]] and Moira predetermined his decision.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 19.87:"Howbeit it is not I that am at fault, but Zeus and Fate (Moira) and Erinys, that walketh in darkness, seeing that in the midst of the place of gathering they cast upon my soul fierce blindness on that day, when of mine own arrogance I took from Achilles his prize."&lt;/ref&gt; In the last section of ''[[Iliad]]'', ''Moira'' is the  "mighty fate" (μοίρα κραταιά:moira krataia) who leads destiny and the course of events. [[Thetis]] the mother of [[Achilleus]] warns him that he will not live long because mighty fate stands hard by him, therefore he must give to [[Priam]] the corpse of [[Hector]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]] 24.131: "For I tell thee, thou shall not thyself be long in life, but even nowdoth death stand hard by thee and mighty fate (moira krataia)".&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Hector]]’s birth mighty fate predetermined that his corpse would be devoured by dogs after his death, and [[Hecuba|Hecabe]] is crying desperately asking for revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iliad]]  24.209: On this wise for him did mighty fate spin with her thread at his birth, when myself did bear him, that he should glut swift-footed dogs far from his parents, in the abode of a violent man. "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythical cosmogonies==

The three Moirai are daughters of the primeval goddess [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] (Night), and sisters of [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]] (black Fates), [[Thanatos]] (Death) and [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] (retribution).&lt;ref name=Hesiod221/&gt;  Later they are daughters of [[Zeus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]ess [[Themis]] (the "Institutor"),&lt;ref name=Theogony901&gt;[[Theogony]] 901:''The Theogony of Hesiod.Transl.

Hesiod introduces a moral purpose which is absent in the [[Homer]]ic poems. The Moirai represent a power to which even the gods have to conform. They give men at birth both evil and good moments, and they punish not only men but also gods for their sins.&lt;ref name=Hesiod221/&gt;

In the cosmogony of [[Alcman]] (7th century BC),  first came [[Thetis]] (Disposer, Creation), and then simultaneously [[Greek primordial deities|Poros]] (path) and [[Tekmor (mythology)|Tekmor]]  (end post, ordinance).&lt;ref&gt;τέκμωρ (Τekmor): fixed mark or boundary, end post, purpose  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dte%2Fkmar τέκμαρ],

Poros is related with the beginning of all things, and Tekmor is related with the end of all things.&lt;ref&gt;Alcman, '' frag 5, (from Scholia), Transl Cambell, Vol Greek Lyric II'': [http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ananke.html Theoi Project – Ananke].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the [[Orphic]] cosmogony, first came [[Thetis|Thesis]] (Disposer), whose ineffable nature is unexpressed. [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (necessity) is the primeval goddess of inevitability who is entwined with the time-god [[Chronos]], at the very beginning of time. They represented the cosmic forces of Fate and Time, and they were called sometimes to control the fates of the gods. The three Moirai are daughters of Ananke.&lt;ref&gt;''Orphica. Theogonies frag 54 (from Damascius).  Greek hymns 3rd to 2nd centuries BC''  [http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ananke.html Theoi Project – Ananke].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
[[File:Sarcophagus Prometheus Louvre Ma339.jpg|thumb|[[Prometheus]] creates man. [[Clotho]] and [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] besides [[Poseidon]] (with his trident), and presumably [[Atropos]] besides [[Artemis]] (with the moon crescent). [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[sarcophagus]], [[Louvre]].]]

The Moirai were supposed to appear three nights after a child's birth to determine the course of its life, as in the story of [[Meleager]] and the firebrand taken from the hearth and preserved by his mother to extend his life.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, story of Meleager in ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 1.65.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Karl Braswell from readings in the [[Hesychius of Alexandria|lexicon of Hesychius]], associates the appearance of the Moirai at the family ''hearth'' on the ''seventh'' day with the ancient Greek custom of waiting seven days after birth to decide whether to accept the infant into the Gens and to give it a name, cemented with a ritual at the hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braswell |first=Bruce Karl |title=Meleager and the Moirai: A Note on Ps.-Apollodorus 1. 65 |journal=Hermes |volume=119 |issue=4 |year=1991 |pages=488–489 |jstor=4476850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sparta]] the temple to the Moirai stood near the communal hearth of the ''[[polis]]'', as [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] observed.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 3.11. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

As goddesses of birth who even prophesied the fate of the newly born, [[Eileithyia]], the ancient Minoan goddess of childbirth and divine midwifery, was their companion. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions an ancient role of Eileythia as "the clever spinner", relating her with destiny too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.21.3&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 8.21.3].&lt;/ref&gt; Their appearance indicate the Greek desire for health which was connected with the Greek cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' VII 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moirai assigned to the terrible [[chthonic]] goddesses [[Erinyes]] who inflicted the punishment for evil deeds their proper functions, and with them directed fate according to necessity. As goddesses of death they appeared together with the [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]s of death [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]] and the infernal Erinyes.&lt;ref name=Theoi.Moirai&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Moirai.html |title=Theoi Project Moirai |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lachesis (Washington, DC).jpg|thumb|left|Bas relief of [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]]. Base of a lampstand in front of the Supreme Court of the United States [[Washington, D.C.]].]]
In earlier times they were represented as only a few—perhaps only one—individual goddess. [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' (xxiv.209) speaks generally of the Moira, who spins the thread of life for men at their birth; she is ''Moira Krataia'' "powerful Moira" (xvi.334) or there are several Moirai (xxiv.49). In the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (vii.197) there is a reference to the ''Klôthes'', or Spinners. At Delphi, only the Fates of Birth and Death were revered.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi 1951:32.&lt;/ref&gt; In Athens, [[Aphrodite]], who had an earlier, pre-Olympic existence, was called ''[[Aphrodite Urania]]'' the "eldest of the Fates" according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (x.24.4).

&lt;!-- .There is not any reference for the Eteocretan text. 
A bilingual [[Eteocretan]] text&lt;ref&gt;The inscription, from the Delphinion in [[Dreros]], was published by Henri van Effenterre in ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique'' '''70''' (1946:602f); the original inscription has disappeared:  [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Eteocretan/Dreros2.html on-line text.]&lt;/ref&gt;  has the Greek translation Ομοσαι δαπερ Ενορκίοισι (''Omosai d-haper Enorkioisi'', "But may he swear [these] very things to the Oath-Keepers"). In [[Eteocretan]] this is rendered —&lt;small&gt;S|TUPRMĒRIĒIA&lt;/small&gt;, in which &lt;small&gt;MĒRIĒIA&lt;/small&gt; may refer to the divinities the Hellenes knew as the Moirai.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}--&gt;

Some Greek mythographers went so far as to claim that the Moirai were the daughters of [[Zeus]]—paired with [[Themis]] ("Fundament"),  as [[Hesiod]] had it in one passage.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'', 904.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the older myths they are daughters of primeval beings like [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] ("Night") in [[Theogony]],  or [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] ("Necessity") in [[Orphic]] cosmogony. Whether or not providing a father even for the Moirai was a symptom of how far Greek mythographers were willing to go, in order to modify the old myths to suit the [[patrilineal]] Olympic order,&lt;ref&gt;"Zeus obviously had to assimilate this spinning Goddess, and he made them into his daughters, too, although not by all accounts, for even he was bound ultimately by Fate", observe Ruck and Staples (1994:57).&lt;/ref&gt; the claim of a paternity was certainly not acceptable to [[Aeschylus]], [[Herodotus]], or [[Plato]].

Despite their forbidding reputation, the Moirai could be placated as goddesses. Brides in [[Athens]] offered them locks of hair, and women swore by them. They may have originated as birth goddesses and only later acquired their reputation as the agents of destiny.

According to the mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], in the [[Gigantomachy]], the war between the Giants and Olympians, the Moirai killed the Giants [[Agrios]] and [[Thoon (mythology)|Thoon]] with their bronze clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.6.1 1.6.1–2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zeus and the Moirai==
[[File:Atropos.jpg|thumb|[[Bas relief]] of [[Atropos]] cutting the thread of life]]

In the [[Homeric]] poems [[Moira (fate)|Moira]], who is almost always one, is acting independently from the gods. Only [[Zeus]], the chief sky-deity of the [[Mycenean Greeks|Myceneans]] is close to Moira, and in a passage he is the being of this power.&lt;ref name=Nilsson361 /&gt; Using a [[weighing scale]] (balance) Zeus weighs [[Hector|Hector's]] "lot of death" ([[Keres (mythology)|Ker]]) against the one of [[Achilleus]]. Hector's lot weighs down, and he dies according to [[Fate]]. Zeus appears as the guider of destiny, who gives everyone the right portion.&lt;ref name=Nilsson217&gt;[[Ilias]] X 209 ff. O.Crusius Rl, Harisson ''Prolegomena'' 5.43 ff: [[Martin P. Nilsson|M. Nillson]] (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion. Vol I ''. C.F.Beck Verlag. München pp. 217, 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is similar to the famous scene in the [[Culture of Egypt|Egypt]]ian book of the dead, although the conception is different. [[Anubis]] weighs the sins of a man's heart against the feather of truth. If man's heart weighs down, then he is devoured by a monster: Taylor, John H. (Editor- 2009), ''Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead: Journey through the afterlife''. British Museum Press, London, 2010. pp. 209, 215 {{ISBN|978-0-7141-1993-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Mycenean vase, Zeus holds a [[weighing scale]]  (balance) in front of two warriors, indicating that he is measuring their destiny before the battle. The belief ([[fatalism]]) was that if they die in battle, they must die, and this was rightly offered (according to fate).&lt;ref&gt;M.P.Nilsson, "Zeus-Schiksalwaage ". ''Homer and Mycenea '' D 56. The same belief in [[Destiny|Kismet]]. Also the soldiers in the World-War believed that they wouldn't die by a bullet, unless their name was written on the bullet: [[Martin P. Nilsson|M. Nillson]] (1967). ''Die Geschichte der Griechischen Religion. Vol I ''. C.F.Beck Verlag. München pp. 366, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Theogony]]'', the three ''Moirai'' are daughters of the primeval goddess, [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] ("Night"),&lt;ref&gt;[[H.J. Rose]], ''Handbook of Greek Mythology'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt; representing a power acting over the gods.&lt;ref name=Hesiod221/&gt; Later they are daughters of [[Zeus]] who gives them the greatest honour, and [[Themis]],  the ancient goddess of law and divine order.&lt;ref name="Finley78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery42"/&gt;

[[File:Clotho (Washington, DC).jpg|thumb|Bas relief of [[Clotho]]. Base of a lampstand in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]]]
Even the gods feared the Moirai or [[Fate]]s, which according to [[Herodotus]] a god could not escape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''Histories'' I 91&lt;/ref&gt; The Pythian priestess at [[Delphi]] once admitted, that [[Zeus]] was also subject to their power, though no classic writing clarifies as to what exact extent the lives of immortals were affected by the whims of the Fates.  It is to be expected that the relationship of Zeus and the Moirai was not immutable over the centuries. In either case in antiquity we can see a feeling towards a notion of an order to which even the gods have to conform. [[Simonides]] names this power [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (necessity) (the mother of the ''Moirai'' in [[Orphic]] cosmogony) and says that even the gods don't fight against it.&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz. Fr.420&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aeschylus]] combines [[Fate]] and necessity in a scheme, and claims that even Zeus cannot alter which is ordained.&lt;ref name=Prometh.515/&gt;

A supposed epithet ''Zeus Moiragetes'', meaning "Zeus Leader of the Moirai" was inferred by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] from an inscription he saw in the 2nd century AD at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]: "As you go to the starting-point for the chariot-race there is an altar with an inscription ''to the Bringer of Fate.''&lt;ref&gt;The Greek is ''Moiragetes'' (Pausanias, 5.15.5).&lt;/ref&gt; This is plainly a surname of Zeus, who knows the affairs of men, all that the Fates give them, and all that is not destined for them."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, v.15.5.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Temple of Zeus at [[Megara]], Pausanias inferred from the relief sculptures he saw "Above the head of Zeus are the [[Horae|Horai]] and Moirai, and all may see that he is the only god obeyed by Moira." Pausanias' inferred assertion is unsupported in [[cult (religion)|cult practice]], though he noted a sanctuary of the Moirai there at Olympia (v.15.4), and also at [[Corinth]] (ii.4.7) and [[Sparta]] (iii.11.8), and adjoining the sanctuary of [[Themis]] outside a city gate of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;"There is a sanctuary of [[Themis]], with an image of white marble; adjoining it is a sanctuary of the Fates, while the third is of Zeus of the Market. Zeus is made of stone; the Fates have no images." (Pausanias, ix.25.4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The fates had at least three known temples, in [[Ancient Corinth]], [[Sparta]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. At least the temple of Corinth contained statues of them: 
:"[On the Akropolis (Acropolis) of Korinthos (Corinth) :] The temple of the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) and that of Demeter and Kore (Core) [Persephone] have images that are not exposed to view."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 4. 7 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The temple in Thebes was explicitly imageless:  
:"Along the road from the Neistan gate [at Thebes in Boiotia (Boeotia)] are three sanctuaries. There is a sanctuary of Themis, with an image of white marble; adjoining it is a sanctuary of the Moirai (Moirae, Fates), while the third is of Agoraios (Agoreus, of the Market) Zeus. Zeus is made of stone; the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) have no images."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 25. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
The temple in Sparta was situated next to the grave of [[Orestes]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 11. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from actual temples, there was also altars to the Moirai. Among them was notably the altar in Olympia near the altar of Zeus Moiragetes,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 15. 5&lt;/ref&gt; a connection to Zeus which was also repeated in the images of the Moirai in the temple of Despoine in Arkadia&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 8. 37. 1&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Delphi, where they were depicted with Zeus Moiragetes (Guide of Fate) as well as with Apollon Moiragetes (Guide of Fate).&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 10. 24. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
On Korkyra, the shrine of Apollo which was legendary founded by Medea was also a place on which offerings where made to the Moirai and the nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 4. 1216 ff (trans. Rieu) (Greek epic C3rd B.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The worship of the Moirai are described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] for their altar near Sicyon: 
:"On the direct road from Sikyon (Sicyon) to Phlios (Phlius) . . . At a distance along it, in my opinion, of twenty stades, to the left on the other side of the Asopos [river], is a grove of holm oaks and a temple of the goddesses named by the Athenians the Semnai (August), and by the Sikyonians the Eumenides (Kindly Ones). On one day in each year they celebrate a festival to them and offer sheep big with young as a burnt offering, and they are accustomed to use a libation of honey and water, and flowers instead of garlands. They practise similar rites at the altar of the Moirai (Moirae, Fates); it is in an open space in the grove."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 11. 3 - 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-cultural parallels==

===Europe===
[[File:Nornorna spinner ödets trådar vid Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|The [[Norns]] spin the threads of [[Destiny|fate]] at the foot of [[Yggdrasil]], the tree of the world.]]

In [[Roman mythology]] the three Moirai are the [[Parcae|Parcae or Fata]], plural of "fatum" meaning prophetic declaration, oracle, or destiny. The English words [[fate]] (native [[wyrd]]) and [[fairy]] (magic, enchantment), are both derived from "fata", "fatum" .&lt;ref&gt;''Online Etymology Dictionary'': [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fate fate], [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fairy fairy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norse mythology]] the [[Norns]] are female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men, twining the thread of life. They set up the laws and decided on the lives of the children of men.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Voluspa]]'' 20: [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]]' translation for [[The American-Scandinavian Foundation]] with clickable names [http://cybersamurai.net/Mythology/nordic_gods/LegendsSagas/Edda/PoeticEdda/Voluspo.htm Völuspá] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718115311/http://cybersamurai.net/Mythology/nordic_gods/LegendsSagas/Edda/PoeticEdda/Voluspo.htm |date=2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their names were [[Urðr]], related with [[Wyrd]], weird ([[destiny|fate]]), [[Verðandi]],  and [[Skuld]], and it has often been inferred that they ruled over the past, present and future respectively, based on the sequence and partly the etymology of the names, of which the first two (literally 'Fate' and 'Becoming') are derived from the past and present stems of the verb ''verða'', "to be", respectively&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svetym Swedish Etymological dictionary ]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the name of the third one means 'Debt' or 'Guilt', originally 'That which must happen'.&lt;ref&gt;'' Online Etymology Dictionary'' [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shall shall]&lt;/ref&gt;

In younger legendary sagas, the Norns appear to have been synonymous with witches ([[Völva]]s), and they arrive at the birth of the hero to shape his destiny. It seems that originally all of them were [[Disir]], ghosts or deities associated with destruction and destiny. The notion that they were three may be due to a late influence from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebook (1913)/ Uggleupplagan.19.Mykenai-Newpada. [http://runeberg.org/nfbs/0792.html Nordisk Familjebook]&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies to their (disputed) association with the past, present and future.

The [[Valkyries]] (choosers of the slain), were originally [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemons]] of death. They were female figures who decided who will die in battle, and brought their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain. They were also related with spinning, and one of them was named [[Skuld]] (debt, guilt).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson H.R. Ellis (1988). ''Myths and symbols in Pagan Europe. Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions''. Manchester University Press p. 58-61 {{ISBN|0-7190-2579-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be related to [[Keres (mythology)|Keres]], the daemons of death in Greek mythology, who accompanied the dead to the entrance of [[Hades]]. In the scene of [[Weighing of souls|Kerostasie]] Keres are the "lots of death", and in some cases Ker (destruction) has the same meaning, with Moira interpreted as "destiny of death" (''moira thanatoio'' :μοίρα θανάτοιο) .&lt;ref name=Hesiod221/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Keres (mythology)|Keres]], derived from the Greek verb ''kirainein'' (κηραίνειν) meaning "to be destroyed". Compare ''Kir'' (κηρ), "candle". M.Nilsson (1967). Vol I, p 218, 366&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] [[Matres]] and [[Matrones]], female deities almost entirely in a group of three, have been proposed as connected to the [[Norns]] and the [[Valkyries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Landow|title=Norse Mythology, a guide to the ghosts, heroes, rituals and beliefs|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=2001|ISBN=0-19-515382-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anglo-Saxon]] culture [[Wyrd]] (Weird) is a concept corresponding to [[destiny|fate]] or personal destiny (literally: what befalls one).

In [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', the [[Weird sisters]] (or [[Three Witches]]), are [[prophet]]esses, who are deeply entrenched in both worlds of reality and supernatural. Their creation was influenced by [[United Kingdom|British]] folklore, [[witchcraft]], and the legends of the [[Norns]] and the Moirai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Karin S.|last=Coddon|title='Unreal Mockery': Unreason and the Problem of Spectacle in Macbeth|journal=[[ELH]]|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|date=Oct 1989|volume=56|issue=3|pages=485–501|doi=10.2307/2873194}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hecate]], the [[chthonic]] [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] goddess associated with magic, witchcraft, [[necromancy]], and three-way crossroads,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Hekate.html |title=Theoi project Hecate |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears as the master of the "Three witches". In [[Ancient Greek religion]], Hecate as goddess of childbirth is identified with [[Artemis]],&lt;ref&gt;Heidel, William Arthur (1929).

In [[Lithuanian mythology]] [[Laima]] is the personification of destiny, and her most important duty was to prophecy how the life of a newborn will take place. She may be related to the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Laksmi]], who was the personification of wealth and prosperity, and associated with good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;Greimas Algirdas Julien (1992). ''Of gods and men. Studies in Lithuanian Mythology''. Indiana University Press. p. 111, {{ISBN|0-253-32652-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Related to "Iaksmlka", mark, sign or token ([[Rigveda]] X, 71,2 ): Monier Williams.

The Moirai were usually described as cold, remorseless and unfeeling, and depicted as old crones or hags. The independent ''spinster'' has always inspired fear rather than matrimony: "this sinister connotation we inherit from the spinning goddess," write Ruck and Staples (Ruck and Staples 1994:). See [[weaving (mythology)]].

===Outside of Europe===
[[File:Egypt dauingevekten.jpg|thumb|A section of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' written on papyrus showing the "Weighing of the Heart" in the [[Duat]] using the feather of [[Maat]] as the measure in balance.]]

The notion of a universal principle of natural order has been compared to similar ideas in other cultures, such as [[Asha|aša]], ([[Asha]]) in [[Avestan language|Avestan]] religion, [[Rta]] in [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]], and [[Maat]] in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ramakrishna (1965:153–168), James (1969:35–36)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] religion and [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Asha|aša]], is commonly summarized in accord with its contextual implications of "truth", "right(eousness)", "order". [[Asha|Aša]] and its [[Vedic]] equivalent, [[Rta]], are both derived from a [[PIE]] root meaning "properly joined, right, true". The word is the proper name of the divinity [[Asha]], the personification of "Truth" and "Righteousness". ''Aša'' corresponds to an objective, material reality which embraces all of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1086/462470|last=Duchesne-Guillemin|first=Jacques|title=Heraclitus and Iran|journal=History of Religions|volume=3|issue=1|year=&lt;!--(Summer,--&gt;1963|pages=34–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cosmic force is imbued also with morality, as verbal Truth, and Righteousness, action conforming with the moral order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mary|last=Boyce|title=Zoroaster the Priest|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|publisher=University of London|location=London, England|volume=33|issue=1&lt;!-- In Honour of Sir Harold Bailey--&gt;|date=1970|pages=22–38|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00145100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the literature of the [[Mandeans]], an angelic being has the responsibility of weighing the souls of the deceased to determine their worthiness, using a set of scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Bunson|title=Angels A to Z|publisher=Crown Publishing|location=New York City|date=1996|ISBN=978-0517885376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Vedic religion, [[Rta]] is an ontological principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe. The term is now interpreted abstractly as "cosmic order", or simply as "truth",&lt;ref&gt;Mahony (1998:3).&lt;/ref&gt; although it was never abstract at the time.&lt;ref&gt;See the philological work of Own Barfield, e.g Poetic Diction or Speaker's Meaning&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that this idea originally arose in the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] period, from a con-sideration (so denoted to indicate the original meaning of communing with the star beings) of the qualities of nature which either remain constant or which occur on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=Oldenberg1894&gt;[[Hermann Oldenberg|Oldenberg, Hermann]] (1894). ''Die Religion des Veda''. Berlin: Verlag von Wilhelm Hertz.  Pp. 30,195–198&lt;/ref&gt;

The individuals fulfill their true natures when they follow the path set for them by the ordinances of ''Rta'', acting according to the [[Dharma]], which is related to social and moral spheres.&lt;ref name=Brown373&gt;Brown, W. N. (1992). "Some Ethical Concepts for the Modern World from Hindu and Indian Buddhist Tradition" in: Radhakrishnan, S. (Ed.) ''Rabindranath Tagore: A Centenary Volume 1861 – 1961''. Calcutta: Sahitya Akademi. {{ISBN|81-7201-332-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The god of the waters [[Varuna]] was probably originally conceived as the personalized aspect of the otherwise impersonal ''Ṛta''.&lt;ref&gt;Ramakrishna, G. (1965). "Origin and Growth of the Concept of ''Ṛta'' in Vedic Literature". Doctoral Dissertation: University of MysoreCf.&lt;/ref&gt; The gods are never portrayed as having command over ''Ṛta'', but instead they remain subject to it like all created beings.&lt;ref name=Brown373/&gt;

In [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]], [[maat]] was the [[ancient Egypt]]ian concept of [[truth]], balance, order, [[law]], [[morality]], and [[justice]]. The word is the proper name of the divinity [[Maat]], who was the goddess of harmony, justice, and truth represented as a young woman. It was considered that she set the order of the universe from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] at the moment of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Gods and Myths of Ancient Egypt, Robert A. Armour, American Univ in Cairo Press, p167, 2001, {{ISBN|977-424-669-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maat was the norm and basic values that formed the backdrop for the application of justice that had to be carried out in the spirit of truth and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Siegfried|last=Morenz|title=Egyptian Religion|translator-first=Ann E.|translator-last=Keep|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithica, New York|date=1992|ISBN=0-8014-8029-9|pages=117–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egyptian mythology]], Maat dealt with the weighing of souls that took place in the underworld. Her feather was the measure that determined whether the souls (considered to reside in the heart) of the departed would reach the paradise of afterlife successfully. In the famous scene of the [[Culture of Egypt|Egypt]]ian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', [[Anubis]], using a scale, weighs the sins of a man's heart against the feather of truth, which represents [[maat]]. If man's heart weighs down, then he is devoured by a monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=John H.|editor-last=Taylor|title=Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead: Journey through the afterlife|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London, England|date=2010|ISBN=978-0-7141-1989-2|pages=209, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Month of Photography Asia''' (also known as '''MOPA''' and '''MOPAsia''') was an international [[festival]] of [[photography]] in [[Singapore]]&lt;ref name="asian-correspondent"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://asiancorrespondent.com/2011/07/exploring-the-walls-between-peoples-in-the-month-of-photography-asia-in-singapore/ | date = 13 July 2011 | access-date = 3 December 2015 | publisher = [[Asian Correspondent]] | author = reddotrevolver | title = Exploring ‘Walls Between Peoples’ in Month of Photography Asia, Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2002 to 2011.

The festival promoted photography both as an art form and as a creative industry. Each year, Month of Photography Asia was curated along a specific theme and presented works by international and Singaporean photographers in relation to this.

The festival's main line-up of exhibitions was complemented by both public programmes, which included round tables, master classes, talks, portfolio reviews, screenings, tours and workshops.

[[File:Logo MOPAsia 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Logo of '''MOPAsia 2009''']]
The festival was first established in 2002 as the Month of Photography in Singapore, on a joint initiative by the Alliance Française de Singapour and the [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]]. It was inaugurated in the presence of Jean-Luc Monterosso, director of the [[Maison Européenne de la Photographie|European House of Photography]], MEP). Phish Communications managed the 2003, 2004 and 2006 editions of the festival. In 2007, the festival took the name of Month of Photography Asia (MOPA or MOPAsia).

== Curatorial themes ==
From 2004 onwards, a curatorial theme provided the backbone of each edition of the festival:
* 2004: ''Popular Pleasures through Photography''
* 2006: ''Le Regard Documentaire''
* 2007: ''Wanderings''&lt;ref name="ambafrance-2007"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ambafrance-sg.org/Month-of-Photography-2007 | access-date = 4 December 2015 | publisher = Embassy of France in Singapore | title = Month of Photography 2007 : "Wanderings"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ambafrance-meunier" /&gt;

* 2010: ''Praxis''
* 2011: ''Memory''&lt;ref name="asian-correspondent" /&gt;

== ''Out of Focus'' ==
In 2006, the festival started a series of group shows titled ''Out of Focus'' dedicated to emerging Singaporean or Singapore-based photographers who had not yet had a solo show.&lt;ref name="ambafrance-2007" /&gt; The first of these was curated by [[Tay Kay Chin]]. [[Objectifs]]: Centre for Photography and Filmmaking curated in 2007 to 2009.

== Residency programme ==
In 2008, the festival initiated an artist residency programme in partnership with [[Lasalle College of the Arts]], with the support of the French embassy. {{Illm|Alain Fleischer|WD=Q2636406}} was the first photographer in residence in 2008, followed by [[Françoise Huguier]] in 2009.

== ''InsideOut'' ==
In 2009, the festival added ''InsideOut'', a project that aimed to allow the audience to see Singapore through the eyes of migrant workers to foster mutual understanding. First launched in 2006 together with the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival, the project was revived in the 2009 edition of MOPAsia as ''InsideOut II''&lt;ref&gt;[http://migrantvoices.org/InsideOutII.html ''InsideOut II'',  Migrant Voices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026134250/http://migrantvoices.org/InsideOutII.html |date=26 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in 2010 as ''InsideOut III''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.insing.com/event/month-of-photography-asia-2010-insideout-iii/id-53310000 ''InsideOut III'', InSing.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713042154/http://events.insing.com/event/month-of-photography-asia-2010-insideout-iii/id-53310000 |date=13 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=October 2011}}
"'''Mother Savage'''"  (original title: ''La Mère Sauvage'') is a short story by the French realist writer [[Guy de Maupassant]]. It was first published on 3 March 1884.

==Plot==
[[File:Matka Sauvage.jpg|thumb|230px]] 
Two men are out hunting in the French countryside, the narrator and Serval. The latter tells the story of the Savage family: the father was killed by police with a [[gunshot]] to the head. Serval goes on to tell the story of Old Mother Savage and her son, who volunteered at age 33 to fight in the war. Mother Savage, isolated far from the village and "known to have money" is assigned to quarter four young [[Prussia]]n soldiers. The men do chores around the house as if it were their own. Mother Savage continually asks the young men about the French 23rd Regiment of the Line, where her son is on the front, but the young Prussians know nothing.

Later, the postman gives Mother Savage a letter from one of her son's comrades-in-arms which informs her of her son's death. The Prussians bring home a live rabbit for a meal, which Mother Savage has difficulty killing. As she finishes the preparation of the meal, she asks the young men for their names and home addresses. Mother Savage does not partake in the meal, and as they finish dinner, she insists on providing the young soldiers with hay to make their stay in the loft more comfortable. After the soldiers fall asleep, Mother Savage removes the ladder from the loft and starts a fire in the fireplace, which does not rage out of control until she stokes the fire with more hay. Mother Savage stands outside with her son's rifle to make sure the Prussians cannot escape. She hears their "clamor of human screams" and stands guard. Then when she is sure the Prussians are dead, she throws the rifle into the fire, and one loud shot goes off.

The other villagers and soldiers rush to her home, and a German officer interrogates Mother Savage. She informs him that the soldiers were in the fire and that she started the fire. She hands the officer the list of names and addresses she had gathered and is immediately pushed against her home and shot "almost in two", with the letter informing her of her son's death bloody in her hand.

== Analysis of narrator ==
The story is written from the perspective of the narrator, who retells the Mother Savage story as told by his friend Serval. Influenced by Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant writes in the realist style which focuses on objective reality and "shows" instead of "tells".

== Setting ==
The story is set during the winter of 1871 midway through the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in a quaint village in the French countryside. Snow covers the fields, and the forest lurks ominously, void of life. The countryside is dotted with small cottages emitting smoke from chimneys.

'''Omayra Sánchez Garzón''' (August 28, 1972&amp;nbsp;– November 16, 1985) was a 13-year-old Colombian girl killed in [[Armero]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], by the [[Armero tragedy|1985 eruption]] of the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] volcano. Volcanic debris mixed with ice to form massive [[lahar]]s (volcanically induced [[mudflow]]s, [[landslide]]s, and [[debris flow]]s) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain, killing nearly 23,000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages.

After a lahar demolished her home, Sánchez was pinned beneath the debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely as a result of either [[gangrene]] or [[hypothermia]]. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.

A photograph of Sánchez taken by the photojournalist [[Frank Fournier]] shortly before she died was published in news outlets around the world.  It was later designated the [[World Press Photo of the Year]] for 1985. Sánchez has remained a lasting figure in popular culture, remembered through music, literature, and commemorative articles.

== Background ==
{{main article|Armero tragedy}}
On November 13, 1985, the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] volcano erupted. At 9:09 pm of that night, [[pyroclastic flow]]s exploding from the crater melted the mountain's icecap, forming lahars (volcanic mudflows and debris flows) which cascaded into river valleys below. One lahar, consisting of three pulses, did most of the damage. Traveling at {{convert|6|m|ft|0|sp=us}} per second, the first pulse enveloped most of the town of [[Armero]], killing up to 20,000 people; the two later pulses weakened buildings. Another lahar killed 1,800 people in nearby [[Chinchiná, Caldas|Chinchiná]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martí|Ernst|2005|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total 23,000 people were killed and 13 villages in addition to Armero were destroyed.&lt;ref name=MWJ&gt;{{cite news |title=Rescuers in Colombia refuse to give up hunt for survivors |date=November 18, 1985 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal]] |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armero aftermath Marso.jpg|left|thumb|Formerly in the center of this area, the town of Armero was buried by thick volcanic mudflows in 1985.]]

Loss of life was exacerbated by the authorities' failure to take costly preventive measures in the absence of clear signs of imminent danger.&lt;ref name=Fielding/&gt; There had been no substantial eruption of the volcano since 1845, which contributed to complacency; locals called the volcano the "Sleeping Lion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC:On this day: November 13: 1985: Volcano kills thousands in Colombia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/13/newsid_2539000/2539731.stm | work=[[BBC News Online]]

In September 1985, as earthquakes and [[phreatic eruption]]s rocked the area around the volcano, officials began planning for evacuation. A hazard map was prepared in October;{{#tag:ref|This was the first hazard map ever prepared for a [[List of volcanoes in Colombia|Colombian volcano]].&lt;ref name="Vil5" /&gt;|group=nb}} it highlighted the danger from falling ash and [[volcanic rock|rock]] near [[Murillo, Tolima|Murillo]], [[Santa Isabel, Tolima|Santa Isabel]], and [[Líbano, Tolima|Líbano]], as well as the threat of lahars in [[Mariquita, Tolima|Mariquita]], [[Armero-Guayabal|Guayabal]], Chinchiná, and Armero.&lt;ref name=MGueri&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desastres.unanleon.edu.ni/pdf/2004/octubre/PDF/ENG/DOC4377/doc4377-contenido.pdf |title=Eruption of El Ruiz Volcano, Colombia |last=Gueri |first=Miguel |date=October 2004 |publisher=[[National Autonomous University of Nicaragua]]-León. p. 50 |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143331/http://desastres.unanleon.edu.ni/pdf/2004/octubre/PDF/ENG/DOC4377/doc4377-contenido.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk: many survivors had never heard of it, though several major newspapers had featured it.&lt;ref name="Vil5"&gt;{{harvnb|Villegas|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars, but had "met with strong opposition from economic interests."&lt;ref name="Villegas6" /&gt; He said that the short time between the map's preparation and the eruption hindered timely distribution.&lt;ref name="Villegas6"&gt;{{harvnb|Villegas|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colombian Congress criticised scientific and [[civil defense]] agencies for scaremongering, and the government and army were preoccupied with the [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|guerrilla campaign]] in [[Bogotá]], the national capital, which was then at its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2009/09_10_29.html |author=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory |title=Lessons Learned from the Armero, Colombia Tragedy |date=November 29, 2009 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Omayra Sánchez lived in the neighborhood of Santander&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; with her parents Álvaro Enrique, a rice and [[sorghum]] collector, and María Aleida, along with her brother Álvaro Enrique&lt;ref name=DG/&gt; and aunt María Adela Garzón.&lt;ref name="Sangre"&gt;{{harvnb|Barragán|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lp/&gt;  Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; The night of the disaster, Omayra and her family were awake, worrying about the ashfall from the eruption, when they heard the sound of an approaching lahar.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped under her house's roof.&lt;ref name=DG&gt;{{cite news |title=Trapped Girl, 13, Dies |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] |date=November 17, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was "trapped up to her neck",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Barragán (1987) said that she was trapped up to her waist.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt;

For the first few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by concrete but got her hand through a crack in the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood over the course of a day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt;

== Death ==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F5F6CE |salign=left| quote = Colombia and half of the world remained with the bitter sensation that Omayra Sánchez could have been able to continue living after remaining for almost 60 hours trapped from head to toe amidst the rubble of Armero. Her face, her words, and her courage, which streamed throughout the world on television and were a heartbreaking image in the largest newspapers and magazines of the United States and Europe, remained a testimony of accusation against those who could have at the very least made the tragedy less serious.

Germán Santa María Barragán in ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'', November 23, 1985&lt;ref name="ZA13" /&gt;|align= right|width=300px}}

Despite her predicament, Sánchez remained relatively positive: she sang to [[Germán Santa María Barragán]], a journalist who was working as a volunteer,&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; asked for sweet food, drank soda,&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried.&lt;ref name=JSOURCE&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Canadian Journalism Foundation]] |work=Canadian Journalism Project |last=Lacey |first=Dana |title=Why We Don't Cover Pakistan |date=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third night, Sánchez began [[hallucination|hallucinating]], saying that she did not want to be late for school,&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; and mentioned a maths exam.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{harvnb|Barragán|1994|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; on November 16 from exposure,&lt;ref name=picp&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4231020.stm |title=Picture power: Tragedy of Omayra Sanchez |date=September 30, 2005 |work=[[BBC News Online]] | publisher= [[BBC]] |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most likely from [[gangrene]] or [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref name=JSOURCE/&gt;

Her brother survived the lahars; her father and aunt died. Her mother expressed her feelings about Omayra's death: "It is horrible, but we have to think about the living&amp;nbsp;... I will live for my son, who only lost a finger."&lt;ref name=DG/&gt;&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TX5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QEENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3684,440325 |title=Ordeal Ends in Death |work=[[Leader-Post]] |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc. |date=November 18, 1985 |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the public became aware of Sánchez's situation through the media, her death became a symbol of the failure of officials to properly assist victims who could have been saved.&lt;ref name="ZA13" /&gt; Controversy broke out after descriptions of the shortages were released in newspapers, disproving what officials had previously indicated: that they had used the best of their supplies. Volunteer relief workers said that there was such a lack of resources that supplies as basic as shovels, cutting tools, and stretchers ran out. The rescue process was impeded by large crowds and disorganization. An unnamed police officer said that the government should have depended on human resources to alleviate the problems and that the system of rescue was disorganized.&lt;ref name=S-N&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fbdQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3RMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5678,7662718&amp; |title=Colombian officials defend rescue effort; lack of equipment blamed |work=[[Star-News]] |publisher=Bob Gruber |date=November 24, 1985 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia's Minister of Defense, Miguel Uribe, said he "understood criticism of the rescue effort",&lt;ref name=S-N/&gt; but said that Colombia was "an undeveloped country" that did not "have that kind of equipment."&lt;ref name=S-N/&gt;

== Photograph ==
Frank Fournier, a French reporter who landed in Bogotá on November 15, took a photograph of Sánchez in her final days, titled "The Agony of Omayra Sánchez".&lt;ref name=ottawa&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Mq8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=me8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3433,3016148 |title=Ottawa Man Third |date=February 7, 1986 |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |publisher=James Orban}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he reached Armero at dawn on the 16th, a farmer directed him to Sánchez, who by then had been trapped for nearly three days and was near-deserted. Fournier later described the town as "very haunting," with "eerie silence" punctuated by screaming.&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; He said that he took the photograph feeling that he could only "report properly on the courage and the suffering and the dignity of the little girl" in his attempt to publicize the disaster's need for relief efforts,&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; feeling otherwise "powerless".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, there was international awareness of the disaster. Sánchez was one of the victims at the center of the associated controversy over responsibility for the destructive aftermath. The image captured international attention. According to an unnamed BBC reporter, "Many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be the last few hours of Omayra's life."&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; After the photo was published in ''[[Paris Match]],'' many accused Fournier of being "a vulture." He responded, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I felt the story was important for me to report and I was happier that there was some reaction; it would have been worse if people had not cared about it.&amp;nbsp;... I believe the photo helped raise money from around the world in aid and helped highlight the irresponsibility and lack of courage of the country's leaders." &lt;ref name=picp/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The picture later won the [[World Press Photo of the Year]] for 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PEYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2s4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6813,1694667 |title=World Photo Award |date=February 7, 1986 |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The Armero catastrophe came shortly after the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla group's raid and subsequent [[Palace of Justice siege]] on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation. After Sánchez's death, blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to the volcano's eruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Nevado.html |title=Nevado del Ruiz (1985) |last=Camp |first=Vic |publisher=[[San Diego State University]] |date=March 31, 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nevado del Ruiz volcano is still active, according to the Volcano Watch Center in Colombia. Melting only 10 percent of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to {{convert|200000000|m3|cuft|sigfig=3|sp=us}}—similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985.&lt;ref name=Huggel2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huggel |first1=Cristian |last2=Ceballos |first2=Jorge Luis |last3=Pulgarín |first3=Bernardo |last4=Ramírez |first4=Jair |last5=Thouret |first5=Jean-Claude |title=Review and reassessment of hazards owing to volcano–glacier interactions in Colombia |year=2007 |volume=45 |journal=Annals of Glaciology |pages=128–136 |url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/45/a45A019.pdf |doi=10.3189/172756407782282408 |format=pdf |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |bibcode = 2007AnGla..45..128H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[lahar]]s can travel up to {{convert|100|km|mi|0|sp=us}} along river valleys in a few hours.&lt;ref name=Huggel2007/&gt; Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk.&lt;ref name=Thouret&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Thouret |first1=Jean-Claude |last2=Murcia |first2=A |last3=Salinas |first3=R. |last4=Parra |first4=E. |last5=Cepeda |first5=H. |last6=Cantagrel |first6=J-M. |title=Stratigraphy and quaternary eruptive history of the Ruiz-Tolima volcanic massif, Colombia.

The site was commemorated as a memorial with [[Christian cross]]es and a small monument to Sánchez.&lt;ref name=TJ&gt;{{cite news|title=Survivors of avalanche relive tragedy through TV movie |last=Johnson |first=Tim |date=September 18, 1997 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |publisher=[[Journal Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following the eruption, Sánchez has been repeatedly commemorated, especially in newspapers like ''El Tiempo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many victims of the disaster were commemorated, but Sánchez in particular has attracted lasting attention in popular poetry, novels, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a [[punk rock]] band formed in Chile in 2008 named themselves Omayra Sánchez; they express their "discontent that they feel with the negligence on the part of the people who in this day and age run the world".&lt;ref name="ZA13"&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adiós, Omayra: La catástrofe de Armero'' (1988), written by [[Eduardo Santa]] as a response to the eruption, depicts the girl's last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of the catastrophe.&lt;ref name="ZA13" /&gt; In ''No Morirás'' (1994), Germán Santa María Barragán writes that of all the horrors he saw at Armero, nothing was more painful than seeing the face of Omayra Sánchez under the ruins of her house.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; [[Isabel Allende]]'s [[short story]], "And of Clay Are We Created" ("De barro estamos hechos"), is told from the perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under the fireplace of her ruined home. Allende later wrote, "Her [Sánchez's] big black eyes, filled with resignation and wisdom, still pursue me in my dreams. Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Correas de Zapata |Sayers Peden|2002|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To try to prevent repetition of such a disaster, the government of Colombia created the ''Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres'' (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the ''Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres'' (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Programas/ViviendaAguaDesarrolloUrbanoAmbiente/Gesti%C3%B3ndelRiesgo/Direcci%C3%B3ndePrevenci%C3%B3nyAtenci%C3%B3ndeDesastres.aspx |title=Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres — DPAD |date=June 24, 2010 |publisher=Departamento Nacional de Planeación, República de Colombia |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002214757/http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Programas/ViviendaAguaDesarrolloUrbanoAmbiente/Gesti%C3%B3ndelRiesgo/Direcci%C3%B3ndePrevenci%C3%B3nyAtenci%C3%B3ndeDesastres.aspx |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All Colombian cities were directed to plan for natural disasters.&lt;ref name=Touret2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Touret |first1=Jean-Claude |last2=Laforge |first2=Christophe |title=Hazard Appraisal and Hazard-Zone Mapping of Flooding and Debris Flowage in the Rio Combeima Valley and Ibague City, Tolima Department, Colombia |journal=GeoJournal |year=1994 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=407–413 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j7h51t87x7201375 |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WarnePantomine1890.jpg|thumb|220px|''The Christmas Pantomime'' colour [[lithograph]] book cover, 1890, showing the [[harlequinade]] characters]]
'''Pantomime''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|n|t|ə|m|aɪ|m}}; informally '''panto''')&lt;ref&gt;Lawner, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[musical theatre|musical comedy]] stage production designed for family entertainment. It was developed in England and is still performed throughout the United Kingdom and (to a lesser extent) in other English-speaking countries, especially during the Christmas and New Year season. Modern pantomime includes songs, gags, slapstick comedy and dancing. It employs gender-crossing actors and combines topical humour with a story more or less based on a well-known fairy tale, fable or [[Folklore|folk tale]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid-Walsh, Jacqueline. "Pantomime", ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', Jack Zipes (ed.), Oxford University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780195146561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (1969), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a participatory form of theatre, in which the audience is expected to sing along with certain parts of the music and shout out phrases to the performers.

Pantomime has a long theatrical history in Western culture dating back to classical theatre. It developed partly from the 16th century [[commedia dell'arte]] tradition of Italy and other European and British stage traditions, such as 17th-century [[masque]]s and [[music hall]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt; An important part of the pantomime, until the late 19th century, was the [[harlequinade]].&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY/&gt;

Outside Britain, the word "pantomime" is often understood to mean [[Mime artist|miming]], rather than the theatrical form discussed here.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Webster's New World Dictionary]]'', World Publishing Company, 2nd College Edition, 1980, p. 1027.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word pantomime was adopted from  the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''pantomimus'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' ''s.v.''

Roman pantomime was a production, usually based upon myth or legend, for a solo male dancer—clad in a long silk tunic and a short mantle (''pallium'') that was often used as a [[Theatrical property|"prop"]]—accompanied by a sung ''libretto'' (called the ''fabula saltica'' or "dance-story") rendered by a singer or [[Greek chorus|chorus]] (though [[Lucian of Samosata|Lucian]] states that originally the pantomime himself was the singer).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Music was supplied by flute and the [[pulse (music)|pulse]] of an iron-shod shoe called a [[scabellum]]. Performances might be in a private household, with minimal personnel, or else lavish theatrical productions involving a large orchestra and chorus and sometimes an ancillary actor. The dancer danced all the roles, relying on masks, stock poses and gestures and a hand-language (cheironomy) so complex and expressive that the pantomime's hands were commonly compared to an eloquent mouth.&lt;ref name=AncientReception&gt;Alessandra Zanobi.

Roman pantomime was immensely popular from the end of the first century BC until the end of the sixth century AD,&lt;ref name=AncientReception/&gt; a form of entertainment that spread throughout the empire where, because of its wordless nature, it did more than any other art to foster knowledge of the myths and Roman legends that formed its subject-matter – tales such as those of the love of [[The Loves of Mars and Venus|Venus and Mars]] and of [[Aeneid|Dido and Aeneas]] – while in Italy its chief exponents were celebrities, often the protegés of influential citizens, whose followers wore badges proclaiming their allegiance and engaged in street-fights with rival groups, while its accompanying songs became widely known.{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}} Yet, because of the limits imposed upon Roman citizens' dance, the populism of its song-texts and other factors, the art was as much despised as adored,&lt;ref name=AncientReception/&gt; and its practitioners were usually slaves or freedmen.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Because of the low status and the disappearance of its ''libretti'', the Roman pantomime received little modern scholarly attention until the late 20th century, despite its great influence upon Roman culture as perceived in Roman art, in statues of famous dancers, graffiti, objects and literature.&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; After the renaissance of classical culture, Roman pantomime was a decisive influence upon modern European [[concert dance]], helping to transform ballet from a mere entertainment, a display of technical virtuosity, into the dramatic [[ballet d'action]]. It became an antecedent which, through writers and ballet-masters of the 17th and 18th centuries such as Claude-François Ménestrier (1631–1705), John Weaver (1673–1760), [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] (1727–1810) and Gasparo Angiolini (1731–1803), earned it respectability and attested to the capability of dance to render complex stories and express human emotion.&lt;ref name=AncientReception/&gt;

==Development of pantomime in Britain==
In the Middle Ages, the [[Mummers Play]] was a traditional English folk play, based loosely on the [[Saint George and the Dragon]] legend, usually performed during Christmas gatherings, which contained the origin of many of the archetypal elements of the pantomime, such as stage fights, coarse humour and fantastic creatures,&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, Mandy.

===''Commedia dell'arte'' and early English pantomime===
[[File:Richarlequin.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] as Harlequin, c. 1720]]
The development of English pantomime was also strongly influenced by the continental ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', a form of popular theatre that arose in Italy in the [[Early Modern Period]].  This was a "comedy of professional artists" travelling from province to province in Italy and then France, who improvised and told comic stories that held lessons for the crowd, changing the main character depending on where they were performing. Each "scenario" used some of the same stock characters. These included the ''[[innamorati]]'' (young lovers); the ''vecchi'' (old men) such as [[Pantalone]]; and ''zanni'' (servants) such as [[Arlecchino]], [[Colombina]], [[Scaramouche]] and [[Pierrot]].&lt;ref name=Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name=ox&gt;Mayer, David. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t177.e2999 "Pantomime, British"], ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance'', Oxford University Press, 2003, accessed 21 October 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian masque performances in the 17th century sometimes included the [[Harlequin]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, adaptations of the commedia characters became familiar in English entertainments.&lt;ref name=vanda&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/e/early-pantomime/ "Early pantomime"], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From these, the standard English [[harlequinade]] developed, depicting the eloping lovers [[Harlequin]] and [[Harlequinade#Columbine|Columbine]], pursued by the girl's father [[Harlequinade#Pantaloon|Pantaloon]] and his comic servants [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]] and [[Harlequinade#Pierrot|Pierrot]].&lt;ref name=vanda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; In English versions, by the 18th century, Harlequin became the central figure and romantic lead.&lt;ref name=cox&gt;Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found (eds). [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e1417 "Harlequinade",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'', Oxford Reference Online, Oxford University Press, 1996, accessed 21 October 2011. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic plot of the harlequinade remained essentially the same for more than 150 years, except that a bumbling policeman was added to the chase.&lt;ref name=vanda/&gt;

In the first two decades of the 18th century, two rival London theatres, [[Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre]] and the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] (the [[patent theatre]]s) presented productions that began seriously with classical stories that contained elements of opera and ballet and ended with a comic "night scene". ''Tavern Bilkers'', by [[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]], the dancing master at Drury Lane, is cited as the first pantomime produced on the English stage.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 14. Broadbent spends the first half of his book tracing the ancient and European origins of pantomime.&lt;/ref&gt; This production was not a success, and Weaver waited until 1716 to produce his next pantomimes, including ''The Loves of Mars and Venus – a new Entertainment in Dancing after the manner of the Antient Pantomimes''.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; The same year he produced a pantomime on the subject of ''[[Andromeda (play)|Perseus and Andromeda]]''. After this, pantomime was regular feature at Drury Lane.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1717 at Lincoln's Inn, actor and manager [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] introduced [[Harlequinade#Harlequin|Harlequin]] into the theatres' pantomimes under the name of "Lun" (for "lunatic").&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Dircks, Phyllis T. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/23486 "Rich, John (1692–1761)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2011, accessed 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaffee278&gt;Chaffee and Crick, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; He gained great popularity for his pantomimes, especially beginning with his 1724 production of ''The Necromancer; or, History of Dr. Faustus''.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

These early pantomimes were silent, or "dumb show", performances consisting of only dancing and gestures. Spoken drama was allowed in London only in the two (later three) patent theatres until Parliament changed this restriction in 1843.&lt;ref name="East London Theatre Archive"&gt;Haill, Catherine. [http://www.elta-project.org/theme-panto.html ''Pantomime''], University of East London, accessed 17 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of French performers played in London following the suppression of unlicensed theatres in Paris.&lt;ref name="ox"/&gt; Although this constraint was only temporary, English pantomimes remained primarily visual for some decades before dialogue was introduced. An 18th-century author wrote of [[David Garrick]]: "He formed a kind of harlequinade, very different from that which is seen at the [[Opéra-Comique]] in Paris, where harlequin and all the characters speak."&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Thomas. ''Memoirs of the life of David Garrick'', New edition, 1780, I. x. 129, ''quoted'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these early pantomimes were re-tellings of a story from ancient Greek or Roman literature, with a break between the two acts during which the harlequinade's zany comic business was performed. The theatre historian David Mayer explains the use of the "batte" or slapstick and the [[transformation scene]] that led to the harlequinade:
{{quote|Rich gave his Harlequin the power to create stage magic in league with offstage craftsmen who operated trick scenery. Armed with a magic sword or bat (actually a slapstick), Rich's Harlequin treated his weapon as a wand, striking the scenery to sustain the illusion of changing the setting from one locale to another. Objects, too, were transformed by Harlequin's magic bat.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;|}}

[[File:Pantomime 1803.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Playbill of an English circus and pantomime performance, 1803]]
Pantomime gradually became more topical and comic, often involving spectacular and elaborate theatrical effects as far as possible. [[Colley Cibber]], [[David Garrick]] and others competed with Rich and produced their own pantomimes, and pantomime continued to grow in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapters 14 and 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1806–1836===
By the early 1800s, the pantomime's classical stories were often supplanted by stories adapted from European [[fairy tale]]s, [[fables]], [[Folklore|folk tales]], classic English literature or [[nursery rhyme]]s.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;&lt;ref name=OriginV&amp;A/&gt; Also, the [[harlequinade]] grew in importance until it often was the longest and most important part of the entertainment. Pantomimes usually had dual titles that gave an often humorous idea of both the pantomime story and the harlequinade. "Harlequin and ________", or "Harlequin _______; or, the ________".  In the second case, harlequin was used as an adjective, followed by words that described the pantomime "opening", for example: ''[[Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren|Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren; or, Fortunatus and the Water of Life, the Three Bears, the Three Gifts, the Three Wishes, and the Little Man who Woo'd the Little Maid]]''. Harlequin was the first word (or the first word after the "or") because Harlequin was initially the most important character. The titles continued to include the word Harlequin even after the first decade of the 1800s, when [[Joseph Grimaldi]] came to dominate London pantomime and made the character, Clown, a colourful agent of chaos, as important in the entertainment as Harlequin. At the same time, Harlequin began to be portrayed in a more romantic and stylised way.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell Stott, pp. 95–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimaldi's performances elevated the role by "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society, and his happy talent of holding them up to ridicule. He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that the most saturnine looker-on acknowledged his sway; and neither the wise, the proud, or the fair, the young nor the old, were ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities."&lt;ref name=B16&gt;Broadbent, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; Grimaldi's performances were important in expanding the importance of the harlequinade until it dominated the pantomime entertainment.&lt;ref name=grimaldi&gt;Moody, Jane. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/11630 "Grimaldi, Joseph (1778–1837)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008, accessed 21 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1800s, therefore, children went to the theatre around the Christmas and New Year holiday (and often at Easter or other times) primarily to witness the craziness of the harlequinade chase scene. It was the most exciting part of the "panto", because it was fast-paced and included spectacular scenic magic as well as [[slapstick]] comedy, dancing and acrobatics. The presence of slapstick in this part of the show evolved from the characters found in Italian commedia dell'arte.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; The plot of the harlequinade was relatively simple; the star-crossed lovers, Harlequin and Columbine, run away from Columbine's foolish father, Pantaloon, who is being slowed down in his pursuit of them by his servant, Clown, and by a bumbling policeman. After the time of Grimaldi, Clown became the principal schemer trying to thwart the lovers, and Pantaloon was merely his assistant.&lt;ref name=grimaldi/&gt;

The opening "fairy story" was often blended with a story about a love triangle: a "cross-grained" old father who owns a business and whose pretty daughter is pursued by two suitors. The one she loves is poor but worthy, while the father prefers the other, a wealthy fop. Another character is a servant in the father's establishment. Just as the daughter is to be forcibly wed to the fop, or just as she was about to elope with her lover, the good fairy arrives.&lt;ref name=B16/&gt; This was followed by what was often the most spectacular part of the production, the magical transformation scene.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p"&gt;Wilson, p.?.&lt;/ref&gt; In early pantomimes, Harlequin possessed magical powers that he used to help himself and his love interest escape. He would tap his wooden sword (a derivative of the Commedia dell'arte slapstick or "batte") on the floor or scenery to make a grand transition of the world around him take place. The scene would switch from being inside some house or castle to, generally speaking, the streets of the town with storefronts as the backdrop. The transformation sequence was presided over by a Fairy Queen or [[Fairy Godmother]] character.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; The good fairy magically transformed the leads from the opening fairy story into their new identities as the harlequinade characters. Following is an example of the speech that the fairy would give during this transformation:

&lt;poem&gt;Lovers stand forth. With you we shall begin.
You will be fair Columbine{{spaced ndash}}you Harlequin.
King Jamie there, the bonnie Scottish loon,
Will be a famous cheild for Pantaloon.
Though Guy Fawkes now is saved from rocks and axe,
I think he should pay the powder-tax.
His guyish plots blown up{{spaced ndash}}nay, do not frown;
You've always been a guy{{spaced ndash}}now be a Clown.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

[[File:Dan Leno and Herbert Campbell.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Leno]] and [[Herbert Campbell]] in ''[[Babes in the Wood]]'', 1897, at the Drury Lane Theatre]]
This passage is from a pantomime adaptation of the [[Guy Fawkes]] story. The fairy creates the characters of the harlequinade in the most typical fashion of simply telling the characters what they will change into. The principal male and female characters from the beginning plotline, often both played by young women,&lt;ref name="East London Theatre Archive"/&gt; became the lovers Columbine and Harlequin, the mother or father of Columbine became Pantaloon, and the servant or other comic character became Clown. They would transition into the new characters as the scenery around them changed and would proceed in the "zany fun" section of the performance.&lt;ref name="Wilson, p"/&gt; From the time of Grimaldi, Clown would see the transformed setting and cry: "Here We Are Again!"&lt;ref name=grimaldi/&gt; The harlequinade began with various chase scenes, in which Harlequin and Columbine manage to escape from the clutches of Clown and Pantaloon, despite the acrobatic leaps of the former through windows, atop ladders, often because of well-meaning but misguided actions of the policeman. Eventually, there was a "dark scene", such as a cave or forest, in which the lovers were caught, and Harlequin's magic wand was seized from his grasp by Clown, who would flourish it in triumph. The good fairy would then reappear, and once the father agreed to the marriage of the young lovers, she would transport the whole company to a grand final scene.&lt;ref name=B16/&gt;

===1837 to the end of the harlequinade===
Despite its visible decline by 1836, the pantomime still fought to stay alive.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1843, when theatres other than the original patent theatres were permitted to perform spoken dialogue, the importance of the silent harlequinade began to decrease, while the importance of the fairy-tale part of the pantomime increased.&lt;ref name="OriginV&amp;A"&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/pantomime-origins/ "The Origin of Popular Pantomime Stories"], Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed January 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Two writers who helped to elevate the importance and popularity of the fairy-tale portion of the pantomime were [[James Planché]] and [[Henry James Byron]]. They emphasized puns and humorous word play, a tradition that continues in pantomime today.&lt;ref name="OriginV&amp;A"/&gt; As manager of Drury Lane in the 1870s, [[Augustus Harris]] wrote a series of extraordinarily popular pantomimes, focusing on the spectacle of the productions, that pushed this transition by emphasizing comic business in the pantomime opening and grand processionals.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, the harlequinade had become merely a brief epilogue to the pantomime, dwindling into a brief display of dancing and acrobatics.&lt;ref name=Crowther23&gt;Crowther, Andrew. "Clown and Harlequin", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 3, issue 23, Summer 2008, pp. 710–12.&lt;/ref&gt; It lingered for a few decades longer but finally disappeared, although a few of its comic elements had been incorporated into the pantomime stories.&lt;ref name=cox/&gt; The last harlequinade was played at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/development.html ''The Development of Pantomime''], Its-Behind-You.com, accessed 3 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern pantomime traditions and conventions==
Traditionally performed at [[Christmas]] and afterwards, with family audiences, British pantomime continues as a popular form of theatre, incorporating song, dance, buffoonery, [[slapstick]], [[cross-dressing]], in-jokes, topical references, audience participation, and mild [[sexual innuendo]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, David (2002). "British Culture: An Introduction", p. 74, Routledge; and [https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21636788-understand-britishand-have-fungo-and-see-christmas-pantomime-its-behind-you "It's Behind You"], ''The Economist'', 20 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional stories===
Pantomime story lines and scripts usually make no direct reference to Christmas, and are almost always based on traditional children's stories, particularly the [[fairy tales]] of [[Charles Perrault]], [[Joseph Jacobs]], [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and the [[Grimm Brothers]]. Some of the most popular pantomime stories include ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Aladdin]]'', ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'' and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'',&lt;ref name=HistoryIBY&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/Factsheets/The%20History%20of%20Pantomime.pdf "The History of Pantomime"], It's-Behind-You.com, 2002, accessed 10 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', ''[[Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Puss in Boots]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowie-Sell, Daisy. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/8064582/Top-ten-pantomimes-for-Christmas.html "Top ten pantomimes for Christmas"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 17 December 2010, accessed January 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional stories include ''[[Mother Goose]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Babes in the Wood]]'' (combined with elements of ''[[Robin Hood]]''), ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'', ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'', ''[[Sinbad]]'', ''[[St. George and the Dragon]]'', ''[[Bluebeard]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Thumbelina]]''.&lt;ref name=Chaffee278/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to about 1870, many other stories were made into pantomimes.&lt;ref name=OriginV&amp;A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Richards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nL6lBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|title=The Golden Age of Pantomime: Slapstick, Spectacle and Subversion in Victorian England|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]]|page=27|year=2015|isbn=978-1-78076-293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the familiarity of the audience with the original children's story is generally assumed, plot lines are almost always adapted for comic or satirical effect, and characters and situations from other stories are often interpolated into the plot. For instance "panto" versions of ''Aladdin'' may include elements from ''[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]'' or other ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tales; while ''Jack and the Beanstalk'' might include references to nursery rhymes and other children's stories involving characters called "Jack", such as ''[[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]''. Certain familiar scenes tend to recur, regardless of plot relevance, and [[Deus ex machina|highly unlikely resolution of the plot]] is common. Straight retellings of the original stories are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.limelightscripts.co.uk/origins-of-panto-stories/ | title = Origins of Panto Stories | publisher = Limelight scripts | accessdate = 2018-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance conventions===
The form has a number of conventions, some of which have changed or weakened a little over the years, and by no means all of which are obligatory. Some of these conventions were once common to other genres of popular theatre such as [[melodrama]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;
*The leading male juvenile character (the [[principal boy]]) is traditionally played by a young woman in male garments (such as [[breeches]]). Her romantic partner is usually the principal girl, a female [[ingénue]].
*An older woman (the [[pantomime dame]]{{spaced ndash}}often the hero's mother) is usually played by a man in [[travesti (theatre)|drag]].
*Risqué [[double entendre]], often wringing innuendo out of perfectly innocent phrases. This is, in theory, over the heads of the children in the audience and is for the entertainment of the adults.
*[[Audience participation]], including calls of "He's behind you!" (or "Look behind you!"), and "Oh, yes it is!" and "Oh, no it isn't!" The audience is always encouraged to hiss the villain and "awwwww" the poor victims, such as the rejected dame, who is usually enamoured with one of the male characters.
*Music may be original but is more likely to combine well-known tunes with [[parody music|re-written lyrics]]. At least one "audience participation" song is traditional: one half of the audience may be challenged to sing "their" chorus louder than the other half. Children in the audience may even be invited on stage to sing along with members of the cast.
*The animal, played by an actor in "animal skin" or animal costume. It is often a [[pantomime horse]] or cow (though could even be a camel if appropriate to the setting), played by two actors in a single costume, one as the head and front legs, the other as the body and back legs.
*The good fairy enters from stage right (from the audience's point of view this is on the left) and the villain enters from stage left (right from the point of view of the audience). This convention goes back to the medieval mystery plays, where the right side of the stage symbolised Heaven and the left side symbolised Hell.
*A slapstick comedy routine may be performed, often a decorating or baking scene, with humour based on throwing messy substances. Until the 20th century, British pantomimes often concluded with a [[harlequinade]], a free-standing entertainment of [[slapstick]]. Nowadays the slapstick is more or less incorporated into the main body of the show.
*In the 19th century, until the 1880s, pantomimes typically included a transformation scene in which a Fairy Queen magically transformed the pantomime characters into the characters of the harlequinade, who then performed the harlequinade.&lt;ref name=Crowther23/&gt;
*The Chorus, who can be considered [[Extra (actor)|extras]] on-stage, and often appear in multiple scenes (but as different characters) and who perform a variety of songs and dances throughout the show. Because of their multiple roles, they may have as much stage-time as the lead characters themselves.
*At some point during the performance, characters including the Dame and the comic will sit on a bench and sing a cheerful song to forget their fears. The thing they fear appears behind them, but at first the characters ignore the audience's warnings of danger. The characters soon circle the bench, followed by the ghost, as the audience cries "It's behind you!"  One by one, the characters see the ghost and run off, until at last the Dame and the ghost come face to face, whereupon the ghost, frightened by the visage of the Dame, runs away.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Millie. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sScff8kwJzYC&amp;pg=PA130 "Audience Participation, Community and Ritual"], ''British Pantomime Performance'', p. 130, Intellect Books, 2007. {{ISBN|1841501743}}.  Another bench scene is described in the same source at pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guest celebrities===
Another contemporary pantomime tradition is the celebrity guest star, a practice that dates back to the late 19th century, when [[Augustus Harris]], proprietor of the [[Drury Lane|Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], hired well-known variety artists for his pantomimes.

Many modern pantomimes use popular artists to promote the pantomime, and the play is often adapted to allow the star to showcase their well-known act, even when such a spot has little relation to the plot. As critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] has explained, if the star enters into the spirit of the entertainment, he or she can add to its overall effect, while if it becomes a "showcase for a star" who "stands outside the action", the celebrity's presence can detract, notwithstanding the marketing advantage that the star brings to the piece.&lt;ref name=Nifty&gt;Billington, Michael.

Pantomime is performed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Bermuda, Australasia, Canada, Zimbabwe, Jamaica, South Africa, India, Gibraltar, and Malta, mostly during the Christmas and New Year season.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Roberts (author)|Roberts, Chris]].

===United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland===
Many theatres in cities and towns throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland continue to have an annual professional pantomime. Pantomime is also very popular with [[amateur theatre|amateur dramatics]] societies throughout the UK and Ireland, and the pantomime season (roughly speaking, late November to February) will see pantomime productions in many village halls and similar venues across the country.

===Australia===
Pantomimes in Australia at Christmas were once very popular, but the genre has declined greatly since the middle of the 20th century. Several later professional productions did not recover their costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Blake | first = Elissa | title = British pantomime ready to take Sydney by storm|newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald | date = 24 June 2014 | url = https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/british-pantomime-ready-to-take-sydney-by-storm-20140625-zskg6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta===
Pantomime was imported{{when|date=May 2018}} for a British expatriate audience and later adapted by Maltese producers for Maltese audiences. While in many former territories of the British empire, pantomime declined in popularity after independence, as it was seen as a symbol of colonial rule, studies have shown that this genre remains strong in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;Spiteri, Stephanie.

===Jamaica===
The National Pantomime of Jamaica was started in 1941 by educators [[Henry Fowler (educator)|Henry Fowler]] and Greta Fowler, pioneers of the [[Little Theatre Movement]] in Jamaica. Among the first players was [[Louise Bennett-Coverley]]. Other notable players have included [[Oliver Samuels]], [[Charles Hyatt]], [[Willard White]], [[Rita Marley]] and [[Dawn Penn]]. The annual pantomime opens on [[Boxing Day]] at the Little Theatre in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and is strongly influenced by aspects of Jamaican culture, folklore and history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltmpantomime.com/pages/pantohist.html "History"], Little Theatre Movement, 2004, accessed 24 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heap, Brian.

===United States===

Pantomime has seldom been performed in the United States, although a few productions have been mounted in recent years. As a consequence, Americans commonly understand the word "pantomime" to refer to the art of mime as it was practised, for example, by [[Marcel Marceau]] and [[Nola Rae]]. However, certain shows that came from the pantomime traditions, especially ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]'', are performed quite often, and a few American theatre companies produce traditional British-style pantomime as well as American adaptations of the form.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to Professor Russell A. Peck of the [[University of Rochester]], the earliest pantomime productions in the US were ''Cinderella'' pantomime productions in New York in March 1808, New York again in August 1808, Philadelphia in 1824, and Baltimore in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Russell A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4754">'''Press support''' is a government [[subsidy]] available for [[newspaper]]s in some countries. The support can either be direct, in terms of money to the newspaper, or indirect, such as lowered or eliminated [[sales tax]]. The justification for press support is typically to maintain some level of diversity in the media market.

== Press support by country ==
=== Norway ===
Press support is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[subsidy|state subsidy]] available for [[newspaper]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The subsidy is twofold; the first part is a direct subsidy of the second- largest, by circulation, newspapers in each city. The other subsidy is that newspaper are subject to no [[sales tax]] (as are [[book]]s).
====Direct support====
The direct subsidy is managed by the [[Norwegian Media Authority]], and was [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 303 million in 2006, paid to 138 newspapers. It was introduced in 1965, because of the fear of a massive newspaper death like [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] had seen, mainly the second largest newspapers in each city. Also, at the time, most newspapers were not [[political neutrality|political neutral]], with many papers being controlled by either [[conservativism|conservative forces]], the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions|labour movement]] or [[List of political parties in Norway|political parties]]. Support is given to all newspapers that are do not have the largest circulation in the city of publishing. There are limitations on the newspapers who can receive support, including that the support will cease if they pay a [[dividend]] to their owners. Other support is given to [[media studies|media research]], follow-up studies, [[sami people|sami newspapers]], immigrant publications and distribution support for [[Finnmark]].

The press support has been partially successful, with a number of second-largest newspapers surviving, like ''[[Bergensavisen]]'' (Bergen), ''[[Rogalands Avis]]'' (Stavanger) and ''[[Dagsavisen]]'' (Oslo). Other secondary newspapers have been closed, like ''[[Trondheims-Pressen]]''. The largest receivers are often national newspapers, targeting special (often political) sectors, like ''[[Klassekampen]]'' (Socialist), ''[[Nationen]]'' (Agrarian) and ''[[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]]'' (Christian). Most of the large, [[business newspaper|business]] and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers, like [[Dagbladet]] or [[Dagens Næringsliv]], do not receive support, since they pay dividend to their owners.

====Indirect support====
By far the greatest level of support to newspapers arises out of their exemption from sales tax and exceeds NOK 1 billion. This exemption was instituted to foster a variety of perspectives from newspapers; to stimulate public debate and consciousness, [[democracy]], [[freedom of speech]] and to enable the media to act as society's watch-dog.

:''This  article concerns the Belgian government prize. For similarly named prizes aimed at other countries' nationals, see [[Prix de Rome (disambiguation)]].''

[[File:Medailleverso.jpg|thumb|right|Prize medal received by [[Constant Montald]] in 1886]]
The Belgian '''Prix de Rome''' ({{lang-nl|Prijs van Rome}}) is an award for young artists, created in 1832, following the example of the original French [[Prix de Rome]]. The [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp]] organised the prize until 1920, when the national government took over. The first prize is also sometimes called the '''Grand Prix de Rome'''. There were distinct categories for painting, sculpture, architecture and music. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==History==
The Prix de Rome was a [[scholarship]] for arts students. It was created in 1663 in [[France]] under the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. It was an annual burse for promising artists (painters, sculptors, and architects) who proved their talents by completing a very difficult elimination contest. The prize, organised by the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] (''Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture''), was open to their students. The award winner would win a stay at the [[Palazzo Mancini]] in [[Rome]] at the expense of the King of France. The stay could be extended if the director of the institution deemed it desirable.

Expanded after 140 years into five categories, the contest started in 1663 as three categories &amp;mdash; [[painting]], [[sculpting]], and [[architecture]]; in 1803, [[music]] was added; in 1804, [[engraving]] was added. The winner of the "First Grand Prize" (called the ''agréé'')&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms. Michael Clarke. Oxford University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; would be sent to [[French Academy in Rome|The Academy of France in Rome]] founded by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1666. In 1807, [[Louis Napoleon]] created the [[Prix de Rome (Netherlands)|Dutch version]] of the Prix de Rome. After the creation of Belgium as an independent state in 1830, the Belgian government started their own version of the Prix de Rome in 1832. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">'''Rita Boley Bolaffio''' ([[Trieste]], Italy, 7 June 1898 - [[New York City]], United States, 20 May 1995) was an [[artist]] who was instrumental in reintroducing [[collage]] and [[decoupage]] into the United States. She created powerful artwork that underscored the importance of grace and imagination.

==Early years==
Rita was born Margherita Luzzatto to Angelo Luzzatto and Olga Senigaglia in [[Trieste]], Italy.

Her family moved to [[Vienna]], where she passed [[World War I]]. She studied [[art]] under [[Josef Hoffmann]] at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] and did [[textile]] designs for the renowned [[Wiener Werkstaette]] under the name Grete Luzzatto. She also studied [[violin]] under the famous violinist [[František Ondříček]].

In 1919 she married Oscar Bolaffio, an architect and engineer, and cousin of painter [[Vittorio Bolaffio]]. They moved to [[Milan]] in 1928, where Rita became one of the first horsewomen in Italy, riding [[sidesaddle]], and won the "Premio Ciglione della Malpensa" (the Ciglione della Malpensa Prize) in 1936.

==American career==
[[Image:Ritaboley2.gif|thumb|right|200px|''Machine for Writing Poetry'', circa 1955]]
[[Image:Ritaboley4.gif|thumb|left|200px|''Arabesque'', circa 1963]]

In 1939, the [[Fascist]] anti-[[Jewish]] policies forced the family to flee to [[United States|America]]. She began a career as an [[artist]], specializing in imaginative [[collages]] that were displayed in the windows of most major department stores in America, including [[Lord &amp; Taylor]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Bergdorf Goodman]], [[Neiman Marcus]], [[Carson Pirie Scott]], and many more, as well as many private commissions. She regularly contributed covers for such magazines as [[Harper's Bazaar]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], [[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]], [[Good Housekeeping]], and [[Woman's Day]].

She had many awards and one-woman exhibitions at [[museums]] and [[art museum|galleries]] (e.g. [[James Pendleton Gallery]] in [[New York City]], [[J.L. Hudson Gallery]], [[Detroit]], [[Guild Hall Museum]], [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], N.Y. and the [[Columbia Museum of Art]] in [[South Carolina]]). Her work was showcased in the [[New York Times]], as well as European reference works on [[modern art]].

She received the [[Premio di Sorrento]] 1965 for her poem "Nell'afa".

'''Rønne Theater''', also '''Bornholms Teater''',  is a [[theatre]] in [[Rønne]], [[Bornholm]], [[Denmark]].  It is located on the corner of Teaterstræde (Theater Alley) and Østergade (East Street) in a half-timbered yellow and brown painted house with a red tiled roof.&lt;ref name=visitdenmark&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/danmark/ronne-theater-gdk614957|title=Rønne Theatre|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=11 October 2012|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, dating from 1783, was expanded into a theatre in 1823, making it Denmark's oldest provincial theatre still in active use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/fbb/sagvis.pub?sag=23525090|title=Rønne Theater|publisher=Kulturarv.dk|language=Danish|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Bender, A |author2=O'Brien.

==History==
The theatre's history goes back to 1818 when three young Bornholmers thought it would be a good idea to develop the carnaval [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]]s of the times into an actual theatre performance. As a result, on Carnaval Monday, 2 February 1818, a few scenes from [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s ''[[Jean de France]]'' were staged in Madam Wolffsen's Hall in Rønne's Silkegade. People were so enthusiastic that on 4 April, the drama group "Ei Blot til Lyst" was founded. After raising 4,444 [[Danish rigsdaler|Rigsdaler]], the company built the theatre in Teaterstræde. The first performance was [[August von Kotzebue|Kotzebue]]'s ''De onde Luner'' staged on 29 November 1823. Despite the various repairs and renovations the theatre building has undergone, the stage itself has survived unaltered until today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jensaagesen.dk/teater.htm Jens Aagesen, "Rønne Teater's start"]. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The theatre today==
Bornholms Teatre (Bornholm's Theatre), as it is now known, is a regional theatre which strives to offer a variety of rich, high-quality performances drawing on local culture while benefitting from the collaboration of the island's associations and artists. It also stages performances by theatrical companies on tour. A major annual attraction is the Bornholmer Revue. In collaboration with Bornholms Dramaskole, the theatre provides a venue for local children to be introduced to the art of drama. The [[Bornholm Regional Municipality]] provides financial support for the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornholmsteater.dk/velkommen-til-bornholms-teater.html "Om Bornholms Teatre"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721002935/http://www.bornholmsteater.dk/velkommen-til-bornholms-teater.html |date=2012-07-21 }}, ''Bornholms Teater''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The theater has become a summer performance venue.&lt;ref name="Nagy1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagy|first=Peter|title=World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9RV5UFtPNMC&amp;pg=PA1030|accessdate=11 October 2012|date=20 January 1995|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-05928-2|pages=1030–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Standard Model''' is the title of an [[exhibition]] held between 1 October and 25 October 2009 at the Nordin Gallery, Stockholm. The exhibition was made in collaboration between Swedish artist Karl Tuikkanen and London based Australian artist David Brazier and represents the first physical manifestation of their artistic partnership exploring ideas of [[communication]] and [[collaboration]] mediated through the [[internet]].

[[File:Standard model.jpg|thumb|500px|Standard Model Installation View, Nordin Gallery, Stockholm, 2009]]

==Process==
Central to the artists’ process has been mining the public information resource [[Wikipedia]], allowing for the logic of the network to develop the content of the exhibition. Beginning with the Wikipedia page for ‘standard model’ the artists used the system of selecting and sending Wikipedia links between Stockholm and London to quickly take them to destinations far removed from their points of departure.

Reminiscent of [[surrealist]] strategies of “[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]” and “[[Exquisite Corpse]]” Tuikkanen and Brazier relinquish authorial control, choosing instead to hand it over to the web based dialogue and the content of internet links. In doing so, coherence and rationality is discarded for a logic which follows loose associations, without hierarchy or proof of authenticity.

==Links==
Each artist began with the Wikipedia page for ‘[[standard model]]’. From there the artist would select a link and send it to the other artist who would repeat the process until the final information page was six times removed from the original Wikipedia page for ‘standard model’. The information that emerged through this process provided the content for works made and exhibited. This process was repeated 12 times.

'''The Bob Hope Theatre''' is a [[community theatre]] in [[Eltham]] in the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/YourCouncil/TheBorough/TownCentres/Eltham/PlacesOfInterest.htm Greenwich] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108183327/http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/YourCouncil/TheBorough/TownCentres/Eltham/PlacesOfInterest.htm |date=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is owned and run by the members of Eltham Little Theatre Company. The theatre's own repertory members present approximately 11 shows each year, including a pantomime every January, and an annual musical. A variety of other companies also perform at the theatre throughout the year &amp;ndash; about 15 additional productions.

==History==
Eltham Little Theatre (ELT) Company was formed on 12 November 1943, to promote drama, music and allied arts in Eltham and its immediate vicinity. During the early years, it was without a permanent home but early in 1946, ELT was able to arrange an annual lease on Eltham Parish Hall (the current theatre).&lt;ref name="greenwich2000.com"&gt;[http://wwp.greenwich2000.com/heritage/vip/folk/bob-hope.htm Bob Hope] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404225556/http://wwp.greenwich2000.com/heritage/vip/folk/bob-hope.htm |date=4 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eltham Parish Hall (built in 1910) was unavailable earlier as it was being used as a military furniture store for the duration of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/73DB5EF0-F4A3-4530-A88A-2C1CD4EB4C1E/0/060217ElthamTrailLeaflet4FinalVersion.pdf|title=Greenwich Accessibility features|first=|last=Greenwich|website=www.greenwich.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period from 1948 to 1950 there were some 600 individual members and 25 affiliated societies, and a production was staged every other weekend throughout the season.&lt;ref name="greenwich2000.com"/&gt;

Throughout this time, the theatre’s management aimed eventually to purchase the building. Members were continually engaged in fund-raising activities to that end. By 1957, however, it became apparent that the asking price was beyond reach, and a sub-committee memorandum was submitted to the Borough Council with a recommendation that the building be acquired as an artistic centre for Eltham. While rejecting the recommendation, the council awarded the theatre a grant in aid, towards running expenses, in the sum of £150. This grant, increased to keep step with inflation, continued until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobhopetheatre.co.uk/BHT%20History%20Booklet%20April%202005.pdf |title=A Brief History |website=Bobhopetheatre.co.uk |accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bob Hope Theatre is a member of the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]].

==Bob Hope intervention==
During the late 1970s, several commercial concerns expressed an interest in the building for such purposes as a video recording studio, a sports centre and a multi-entertainment complex. None of these came to fruition for one reason or another. However, in 1979, the owner of the theatre wanted to sell the land and so would not renew the lease and without funds to find another base, members were widely resigned to the closure of both the building and the company.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"/&gt;

By chance, [[Bob Hope]], who was born in Craigton Road, Eltham, was in the UK to promote the [[Bob Hope British Classic]] [[Golf]] Tournament when he heard about the plight of the theatre.

Hope resolved to do what he could to help, and raised £58,000 through the 1980 and 1981 golf tournaments.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2943934.stm|title=BBC NEews - Entertainment - Hope's hometown legacy|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope was assisted by celebrity friends in fund-raising for the theatre. While negotiations for the purchase of the building continued, [[Dickie Henderson]] (vice-chairman of the Bob Hope British Golf Classic) gave a benefit performance of his one-man show at the theatre to raise funds towards refurbishment. This was a tremendous evening of entertainment, enhanced by
the presence in the audience of several star personalities, including [[Max Wall]].&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"/&gt;

In November 1982, the purchase of the freehold was completed and Eltham Little Theatre was renamed The Bob Hope Theatre.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"/&gt;

In September 1982, Hope became co-honorary president of Eltham Little Theatre Company along with former [[President of the United States]] [[Gerald Ford]], who was heavily involved with the [[Bob Hope Classic]] [[Golf]] Tournament.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In August 1991, Hope donated £28,000 from the benefit performance he staged at the London Palladium to raise money directly for the theatre.&lt;ref name="bobhopetheatre.co.uk"/&gt;

==Famous alumni==

'''''The Course in Positive Philosophy''''' (''Cours de Philosophie Positive'') was a series of texts written by the French [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] and founding [[sociologist]], [[Auguste Comte]], between 1830 and 1842. Within the work he unveiled the [[epistemological]] perspective of [[positivism]]. The works were translated into English by [[Harriet Martineau]] and condensed to form ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte'' (1853).

The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science. It is in observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, that Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdeau, Michel, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ "Augste Comte"], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Summer 2011 Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "queen science" of human society itself. His ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in English in 1865) would therefore set out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of sociology.

'''The Daylight and Building Component Award''' is presented annually to an individual, or group of individuals, who have contributed significantly to the technical, social, artistic or design-related understanding of daylight. Previous awardees include architects, scientists, artists and building professionals, and the award carries with it a prize of 100,000 Euro. The award was established in 1980 and is given by the [[VELUX Foundation]].

==History==
Upon its establishment in 1980, the Daylight and Building Component Award was given to Danish citizens who had made a significant contribution to the understanding and practical use of daylight. In the early years, this meant that many of the recipients were architects or artists, many of whom had worked with daylight in an architectural or design context.  [[Jørn Utzon]], one of the most famous Danish Architects of the 20th century, was among the group awarded the first year. 
Through the next twenty-five years, the award was given intermittently,  often to larger groups of individuals. In 2006, the award was given to the father-son team of architects  [[Povl Wilhelm Wohlert]] and [[Claus Ditlev Wohlert]]. 

In 2008,   was converted to an annual award with four categories:
# Daylighting design
# Contribution to the science of daylighting
# Contribution to awareness or interest about daylighting.
# Contribution to the awareness of the industrial building component’s importance, value and practical use in the everyday life 

The monetary prize   was also doubled in 2008 to 100,000 Euro, making it one of the largest of its kind within the  architecture  and   building communities worldwide.  

In 2010, the award was given to American architect James Carpenter, whose recent projects include the design of [http://www.wtc.com/about/office-tower-7 7 World Trade Center], the first building to be reconstructed at the site since Sept. 11, 2001.

The award is given around the first of March each year at a ceremony in [[Hørsholm]], [[Denmark]].

[[File:Frama AssSC044.JPG|14th century Venetian ''Madonna and child'' found in the '''Treasure Museum'''|thumb]]

The '''Treasure museum of the basilica of Saint Francis''' contains a collection of sacred art that is on display in two halls found on the northern side of the Cloister of Pope Sixtus IV which is part of the ''Sacro Convento'' in [[Assisi]], Italy.  The entrance is found on the second level of the renaissance cloister behind the apse of the Basilica of Saint Francis, which houses the remains of [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. Since 1986 the Museum has also displayed a collection of works donated to the Conventual Franciscan Friars by the [[Secular Franciscan]] and American art critic, [[Frederick Mason Perkins]], who died in Assisi in October 1955.

The Museum is part of the ''[[Associazione Musei Ecclesiastici Italiani]]'' (AMEI) and the network ''[[Museale Ecclesiastica Umbra]]'' (MEU).

== History ==
In 1930, three years after the return of the Basilica and the Sacred Convent to the [[friar]]s, the first exposition of the Treasure was put on display in the hall of Pope Pius XI at the western end of complex. The exhibition was designed to honor the works of the original patrimony which survived not only the ravages of time, but especially the plundering by Napoleon's troops (in 1798 nearly 390 kilograms of vestments in silver and other valuables were stolen). These works also survived the suppression of religious orders in 1866 during Italy's unification, when in any case the room in which the Treasure was kept, at the bottom of the bell tower, was already in a dilapidated state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi#Bibliography|Nessi]]&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt; pp. 22-23.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From documents found in the archives, especially from the old sacristy inventories (the first of which was taken in 1338), we can learn something about the evolution of the collection. But other sources also testify to the Treasure's development: the first biographies of St. Francis attest, for example, that in 1230 on occasion of the translation of Francis's body to the new church dedicated to him, Pope Gregory IX sent as a gift "a gold cross studded with precious stones in which is set a relic of the wood of the [[True Cross|true cross]]. And with it decorative objects, liturgical objects and other objects to be used for serving at the altar, and extremely precious and magnificent sacred vestments."&lt;ref&gt;''Leggenda dei tre compagni'', 72: ''Fonti francescane'' 1486&lt;/ref&gt;

As many other gifts amassed during these early decades, their necessary care created various difficulties and also caused the followers of St. Francis (known as "il Poverello"), to have some misgivings. So in 1253, to resolve these conflicts, Pope Innocent IV intervened with this bull "Dignum Extimamus" recognizing that the friars were permitted use of these gifts but were not their owners, just as was the case for the entire sanctuary complex as directed by the Apostolic See. At the same time, he forbid the removal of any of these objects from the Basilica. This was reaffirmed by Pope Clement X in 1703.&lt;ref&gt;With the bull ''Cum sicut dilecti filii'' of 13 December 1703 it was forbidden to remove any objects whether for liturgical use or otherwise from the church or convent.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site ==
It's essential that the Treasure's exposition be considered within the context of the monumental complex, made up by the Basilica and the Sacred Convent, that constitutes the original location for which the Treasure was formed and for which some works were in fact specifically made. The rooms in which the Museum is found today were part of the original construction of 1228, made at the bidding of [[Pope Gregory IX]] to the community of friars. This area would certainly have been used even if for short stays by the Pope who had put the entire complex under his immediate jurisdiction.

In 1756 this area, sitting directly over the old dormitory (now known as the Sala Romanica), underwent heavy reconstruction in the Neo-gothic style, which is why it is today known as the Gothic Hall. It is precisely in this room that from 1977 the Treasure has been on view, while in the adjoining room, towards the so-called Papal Hall (the first site of the Museum), is the Sala Rossa, or Red Hall, in which since 1986 the [[F. M. Perkins]] Collection has been on display.

The current arrangement of the works dates from the year 2000 when the Museum was reopened after extensive repairs were made to the structural damage caused by the earthquake of September 1997.

== Works ==
Despite the impoverishment suffered during the course of its history, the Museum still contains works that can be admired for their great beauty and notable historical and artistic interest, allowing us only to imagine how much grander the collection was up until the end of the 18th century, when it remained in large portion intact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi#Bibliography|Nessi]]&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt; p. 23.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection contains for the most part works of the so-called [[Decorative arts|minor arts]], although it does contain some sculpture and paintings. Among that which has survived from the very start of the collection, we find clear testimony of the Treasure's international character in works of French origin (like the illuminated manuscripts from Paris from the middle of the 13th century; gold and silver metalwork, among which is the magnificent reliquary of the Seamless Garment as well as the reliquary of the thorn from the Crown of Thorns in classic Parigian gothic style from the second half of the 12th century; and also an elegant Madonna and Child in ivory, also in the purest French gothic of the 14th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gothicivories.courtauld.ac.uk/images/ivory/18e10dbb_60172eb0.html |title=Gothic Ivories |access-date= 25 December 2011|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Flemish origin (the tapestry of Pope Sixtus IV and a few ivory carvings), and of Germanic origin (the clock donated in 1701 by the Austrian Emperor Leopold I to Fr. Vincenzo Coronelli, and a few precious metal works from Salzburg).

Gold and silver metalwork predominates: the reliquaries come in various forms and styles, and are from various places and times. Some are distinguished by their uniqueness, for example those of Saint Andrew (13th century) and Saint Ursula (14th century), decorated with gilded and engraved glass. Among the altar vessels are a number of chalices, from different epochs, of which the most celebrated is surely that of gold-plated silver and enamels made by [[Guccio di Mannaia]] and gift of [[Pope Nicholas IV]], the first Franciscan pope, who reigned from 1288-1292.

Also on display are: two rare Sicilian silk dossals from the beginning of the 13th century, works of Venetian glass (a crystal cross with miniatures from the early 14th century), and a number of painted works among which is the processional cross, painted on both sides, by the Master of the Blue Crucifix (late 13th century), and two altar panels by Tiberio di Assisi&lt;ref&gt;The altarpanel shows the Crucifixion between saints and angels. It was commissioned by the confraternity of the Disciplinati in the first decade of the 17th century for the chapel of Saint Anthony the Abbot in the Lower Church.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lo Spagna,&lt;ref&gt;The panel was commissioned in 1516 by the Third Order of Saint Francis for the chapel of Saint Catherine in the Lower Church. It was later moved to the chapel of Saint Louis, and was placed in the museum probably after being on loan for an exposition in Spoleto celebrating the 100th annivesary of the death of the artist.&lt;/ref&gt; both working at the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries. Among the textiles deserving special mention is the Florentine altar-frontal which was based on a drawing by [[Antonio del Pollaiolo]] and donated to the Basilica by Pope Sixtus IV in (perhaps?) 1478 on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the canonization of Saint Francis.&lt;ref name="Bargioli"&gt;[[Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi#Bibliography|Bargioli]]&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt; pp. 244-245&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Frederick Mason Perkins Collection ==
In the second half of the 20th century, the Perkins Collection, made up of 56 paintings and a sculpture spanning the 14th to the 16th century, was donated to the Museum. The collection contains, to name only a few items, a portrait of ''Saint Francis'' by [[Fra Angelico|Beato Angelico]], a ''Madonna and Child ''by [[Il Garofalo|Garofalo]], two panel paintings by [[Giovanni di Paolo]] and three by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], a ''Saint Sebastian'' by dell’[[Ortolano]]&lt;ref name="Ortolano"&gt;Michele Danieli, Scheda 48 in: ''Natura e maniera. ''&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''Saint Christopher ''by Sassetta.

'''Underground art''', is any form of [[art]] that operates outside of conventional norms in the art world, part of [[underground culture]]. This can include essentially any [[genre]] of art that is not popular in the art world, including [[visionary art]] and [[street art]]. Underground art can include art created both legally and illegally, organized or unauthorized, and can essentially exist in any form.

Visionary Art is often considered a form of underground art because of it popularity outside conventional art channels. Rather than being displayed in [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[museum]]s, most visionary art is displayed online, at music festivals, or other forms of gatherings such as Burning Man and Rainbow Gatherings.

Street Art, also is often considered a form of underground art because of its unconventional settings. Again, rather than galleries and museums, street art exists in outdoors spaces, utilizing stickers, [[Lock On (street art)|Lock On]] sculptures, [[Street installation|installations]], [[Stencil graffiti|stencils]], and/or [[spray paint]] as its medium.

[[Graffiti]], a form of street art, typically refers to illegal forms of street art. Public response to graffiti is not always favorable and is often negative. Others say that unauthorized art comes from a desire to spread beauty and make [[cityscape]]s more interesting by painting over blank or barren walls.
A controversial point is whether or not these types of art should be taught in a formal setting. Guerrilla art falls under that umbrella of thought.  It is understood, that these acts mostly happen on [[public property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=7556|title=Stage - Vaude-Villains|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-daum12apr12,0,5834055.column|title=Obama as an Art Form|accessdate=2008-04-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613080430/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-daum12apr12,0,5834055.column &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because heraldry developed at a time when English clerks wrote in [[Anglo-Norman French]], many terms in English heraldry are of French origin, as is the practice of placing most [[adjective]]s after [[noun]]s rather than before. A problem arises as to acceptable spellings of French words used in English blazons, especially in the case of adjectival endings, determined in normal French usage by gender and number. It is considered by some heraldic authorities as pedantry to adopt strictly correct linguistic usage for English blazons:
:"To describe two hands as ''appaumées'', because the word ''main'' is feminine in French, savours somewhat of pedantry. A person may be a good armorist, and a tolerable French scholar, and still be uncertain whether an escallop-shell covered with [[bezant]]s should be blazoned as bezanté or bezantée". (Cussans, ''Handbook of Heraldry'', 1898)
Cussans (1898) adopted the convention of spelling all French adjectives in the masculine singular, without regard to the gender and number of the nouns they qualify; however, as Cussans admits, the commoner convention is to spell all French adjectives in the feminine singular form, for example: ''a chief undée'' and  ''a saltire undée'', even though the French nouns ''chef'' and ''sautoir'' are in fact masculine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/handbookofherald00cuss_0#page/n51/mode/2up Example from Cussans, ''Handbook of Heraldry'', 1898, p.47]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patterning with ordinaries and subordinaries ==

The diminutives of the [[ordinary (heraldry)|ordinaries]] are frequently employed to vary the field.

Any of these patterns may be [[Tincture (heraldry)#Counterchanging and countercolouring|counterchanged]] by the addition of a division line; for example, ''barry [[argent]] and azure, counterchanged per fess'' or ''checquy [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] and [[gules]], counterchanged per chevron''.

=== Barry, paly, bendy ===
[[File:Blason Albert.svg|thumb|100px|A shield ''barry of ten argent and gules'']]
When the field is patterned with an even number of horizontal (fesswise) stripes, this is described as ''barry'' e.g. of six or eight, usually of a colour and metal specified, e.g. ''barry of six [[argent]] and [[gules]]'' (this implies that the chiefmost piece is argent). More rarely, a barry field can be of two colours or two metals. (The arms of the [[Kingdom of Hawai'i]] show a very unusual example of barry of three different tinctures, and there are even more exceptional examples of barry of a single tincture, as in the arms of Kempten on the Zurich roll,[http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/ZurichRoll/].  The arms of Eyfelsberg zum Wehr provide a perhaps unique example of barry of four different tinctures that do not repeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Heraldry, British and Foreign: With English and French Glossaries|pages=669}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=June 2018}}  With ten or more pieces, the field is described as ''barruly''.
A field ''having the appearance of'' a number of narrow piles throughout issuing from the dexter of sinister flanks is ''barry pily''.
[[File:Paly demo.svg|thumb|100px|left|A shield ''paly argent and gules'']]
When the field is patterned with an even number of vertical stripes (pallets), the field is described as ''paly''. 
[[File:Ecu bandé d'azur et d'argent.svg|thumb|100px|A shield ''bendy azure and argent '']]
[[File:Blason ville fr Milhavet (Tarn).svg|thumb|100px|A shield ''bendy sinister sable and argent'']]
[[File:Chevronny or and gules.svg|thumb|left|100px|A shield ''Chevronny Or and gules'']]
When the field is patterned with a series of diagonal stripes (bendlets), running from top-left to bottom-right, the field is described as ''bendy''. In the opposite fashion (top-right to bottom-left) it is ''bendy sinister''; (of ''skarpes,'' the diminutive in [[England]] of the bend sinister) of chevronels, ''chevronny''.  (An unusual example of bendy in which a metal alternates with two colours is in the arms of Dr. Murray Lee Eiland Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arms of Dr. Murray Lee Eiland Jr|url=http://www.armorial-register.com/arms-za/eiland-ml-arrms.html|accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In modern practice the number of pieces is nearly always even.  
A shield of thirteen vertical stripes, alternating argent and gules, would not be ''paly of thirteen, argent and gules'', but ''argent, six pallets gules''. (This is the lower portion of the shield on the [[Great Seal of the United States of America]]. The incorrect blazon is usually used anyway, to preserve the reference to the thirteen original colonies, and this form is occasionally imitated allusively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/Buchanan-Boardman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)
One unusual design is described in part as ''bendy of three'' though, as each third is again divided, the effect is of a six-part division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=899&amp;ProjectElementID=3229 The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada - Heraldry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

If no number of pieces is specified, it may be left up to the heraldic artist (but is still an even number).

An instance of a ''[[fess]]... [[#Barry, Paly, Bendy|paly]] [[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]], Argent, [Bleu] [[Bleu celeste|Celeste]] and [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]'' occurs in the arms of the 158th Quartermaster Battalion of the [[United States Army]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/QM/158QuartermasterBattalion.htm&lt;/ref&gt; although this is atypical terminology and it could be argued that the fess should be blazoned as "per pale, in dexter per pale Sable and Argent, and in sinister per pale Bleu Celeste and Or".

In the [[:File:Wappen Deutsches Reich - Fürstentum Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.png|modern arms]] of the [[House of Schwarzburg|Count of Schwarzburg]], the quarters are divided by a cross bendy of three tinctures.

When the shield is divided by lines both palewise and bendwise, with the pieces coloured alternately like a chess board, this is ''paly-bendy''; if the diagonal lines are reversed, ''paly-bendy sinister'';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/anthonywood.htm&lt;/ref&gt; if horizontal rather than vertical lines are used, ''barry-bendy''; and mutatis mutandis, ''barry-bendy sinister''.

A field which seems to be composed of a number of triangular pieces is ''barry bendy and bendy sinister''.

=== Chequy ===
[[File:Blason Famille d'Auray.svg|thumb|200px|''Chequy or and azure'', the famous mediaeval arms of [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|de Warenne, Earl of Surrey]], today quartered by the [[Duke of Norfolk]]. Effectively a field ''azure semée of chequers or'' with the first chequer placed in the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] chief]]
When divided by palewise and fesswise lines into a [[Check (pattern)|chequered pattern]], the field is ''chequy''. The [[coat of arms of Croatia]] ''Chequy gules and argent'' is well known.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, David E.; Stephens, Suzanna M. W. ''The Big Book of Logos 5'', Collins Design, 2008, {{ISBN|0-06-125574-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Keith; Hampshire, Mark. ''Squares, Checks, and Grids, Communicating With Pattern'', RotoVision, 2008, {{ISBN|978-2-940361-82-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Akiko (Editor) ''Design for Sports: The Cult of Performance'', 1st ed., Princeton Architectural Press, 1998, {{ISBN|1-56898-145-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of "Bleichröder, banker to Bismarck,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/jewish.htm#titled-europe Jewish Heraldry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; show chequy ''fimbriated'' (the ''chequers'' being divided by thin lines). The arms of the 85th Air Division (Defense) of the [[United States Air Force]] show "a checky grid" on part of the field, though this is to be distinguished from "chequy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10118 Factsheets : 85 Air Division (Defense)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030120148/http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10118 |date=2012-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of chequers is generally indeterminate, though the fess in the arms of Robert Stewart, Lord of Lorn, they are blazoned as being "of four tracts" (in four horizontal rows);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baronage.co.uk/jag-ht/jag013.html JAG - Differencing - 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and in arms of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], fifteen chequers are specified. The number of vertical rows can also be specified. When a bend or bend sinister, or one of their diminutives, is chequy, the chequers follow the direction of the bend unless otherwise specified. James Parker cites the French term ''equipolle'' to mean chequy of nine, though mentions that this is identical to a ''cross quarter-pierced'' (strangely, this is blazoned as "a [[Latin square]] chequy of nine" in the arms of the [[Statistical Society of Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ssc.ca/main/about/history/arms_e.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217193713/http://www.ssc.ca/main/about/history/arms_e.html |archive-date=2009-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also gives the arms of Prospect as an unusual example of chequy, "Chequy in perspective argent and sable";&lt;ref&gt;http://www02.so-net.ne.jp/~saitou/cgi-bin/more.cgi?input=Chequy&lt;/ref&gt; this must be distinguished from cubes as a charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcsim.co.uk/coatofarms.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Chequy is not "fanciable"; that is, the lines of chequy cannot be modified by [[line (heraldry)|lines of partition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grsampson.net/AHtc.html – see footnote 16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lozengy, fusilly, masculy and rustré ===
{{double image|right|WarbeltonArms.png|150|LozengyOrAndAzure.png|150|'''Left''': ''Lozengy or and azure'' (effectively a field ''azure semée with lozenges or''); '''right''': ''Lozengy azure and or'' (effectively a field ''or semée with lozenges azure'')}}
When the shield is divided by both bendwise and bendwise-sinister lines, creating a field of lozenges (again coloured like a chessboard), the result is ''lozengy''.  (But generally lozengy is depicted with the lozenges narrower in width than would be ''bendy bendy-sinister'', which at least in theory would be a different field.)  A field lozengy must be distinguished from an ordinary such as a bend which is blazoned of one tincture and called "lozengy"; this means that the ordinary is entirely composed of lozenges, touching at their obtuse corners. Such arrangement is better blazoned as ''lozenges bendwise''. (The [[Royal arms of Bavaria]] have occasionally been blazoned as ''lozengy fesswise''; that is, with the narrower axis of the component lozenges vertically rather than horizontally oriented. Similarly, [[Erding (district)|Landkreis Erding]] adopted arms with a chief ''bendy lozengy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/de-by-ed.html Erding County (Germany)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the arms of the Crofts of [[Dalton-in-Furness]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]] are ''Bendy lozengy argent and sable.''&lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.family.rootsweb.com/~heraldry/bga_crofton_crome.html&lt;/ref&gt;)  In ''paly bendy'' the bendwise lines are supposed to be less acute than in plain lozengy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www02.so-net.ne.jp/~saitou/cgi-bin/more.cgi?input=Lozengy&lt;/ref&gt;)

Part of the field of the arms of the 544th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group of the United States Air Force is ''lozengy in perspective''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Institute of Heraldry|title=544th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissaince Group|accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A field ''fusilly'' can be very difficult to distinguish from a field lozengy (in early days no clear distinction was made between lozenges and fusils); the fusil is supposed to be proportionately narrower than the lozenge, and the bendwise and bendwise-sinister lines are therefore more steeply sloped.

A field ''masculy'' is composed entirely of [[mascle]]s; that is, lozenges pierced with a lozenge shape – this creates a solid fretwork surface and is to be distinguished from a field ''fretty''.

An extremely rare, possibly unique example of a field ''rustré'' - [[Tincture (heraldry)#Counterchanging and countercolouring|counterchanged]] [[Lozenge (heraldry)|rustres]] - occurs in Canadian heraldry in the arms of R.C. Purdy Chocolates Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1019&amp;ProjectElementID=3508 The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada - R.C. Purdy Chocolates Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gyronny ===
[[File:Campbell arms.svg|thumb|200px|''Gyronny of eight or and sable'', arms of [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]]]]
A shield that is divided quarterly and per saltire, forming eight triangular pieces, is ''gyronny''. This is technically a field covered with "gyrons", a rare charge in the form of a [[Wedge (shape)|wedge]], shown individually in the well-known arms of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Mortimer]]. Possibly the best known example is in the arms of the ancient Scottish family of Campbell: ''Gyronny of eight or and sable'', borne most notably by the [[Duke of Argyll]],&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Chief of the [[Clan Campbell]]. The first tincture in the blazon is that of the triangle in dexter chief.  (There are apparently very rare examples in which gyronny is of more than two tinctures such as the arms of Origo of Milan: ''Gyronny, sable, argent, vert, sable, argent, vert, sable, vert''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Heraldry, British and Foreign: With English and French Glossaries|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gyronny can also have a different number of pieces than eight; for example, Sir William Stokker, Lord Mayor of London, had a field gyronny of six; there may be gyronny of ten or twelve, and the arms of Clackson provide an example of ''gyronny of sixteen''.(There cannot be gyronny of four, as that would be either per saltire or quarterly, or three, as that would be tierced in pairle or tierced in pairle reversed.)  While the gyrons of gyronny almost invariably meet in the fess point (the exact centre of the shield) [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143125/http://geocities.com/bona_spes/uni/UZ.html  the arms] of the [[University of Zululand]] are an unusual example of gyronny meeting in the nombril point (a point on the shield midway between the fess point and the base point). Gyronny can be modified by (most of) the lines of partition (there would be exceptions such as dancetty and angled).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/davidphillips.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[canting arms]] of Maugiron show ''Gyronny of six'', clearly deemed ''mal-gironné'' ("badly gyronny").

=== Variations of lines ===
Any of the division lines composing the variations of the field above may be blazoned with most of the different [[line (heraldry)|line]] shapes; e.g. ''paly [[nebuly]] of six, Or and sable.'' One very common use of this is ''barry wavy azure and argent''; this is often used to represent either [[water]] or a body of water in general, or the sea in particular, though there are other if less commonly used methods of representing the sea, including in a more naturalistic manner.

== Semé ==
[[File:Arms of the Kings of France (France Ancien).svg|left|150px|thumb|Medieval [[coat of arms of France]]: ''Azure semy-de-lis or'']]
When the field (or a charge) is described as '''''semé''''' or '''''semy''''' of a [[sub-ordinary]] or other [[charge (heraldry)|charge]], it is depicted as being scattered (literally "seeded") with many copies of that charge. Semé is regarded as part of the field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur Charles|last=Fox-Davies|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|isbn=1-4179-0630-8|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2004|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus within the opening section of the blazon describing the field before the first comma. Thus: ''Azure semy-de-lis or'' not ''Azure,  semy-de-lis or''. A charge on top would be blazoned: ''Azure semy-de-lis or, a bend argent''.

To avoid confusion with a simple use of a large number of the same charge (e.g. ''Azure, fifteen fleurs-de-lis Or''), the charges semé are ideally depicted cut off at the edge of the field, though in olden depictions this is often not the case. An example of this can be found in the modern [[Coat of arms of Denmark]], which now features three lions among nine hearts, but the ancient arms depicted three leopards on a ''semy'' of hearts, the number of which varied and was not fixed at nine until 1819. There are also some exceptions to this, as in the case of some bordures blazoned "semé", which are usually depicted with a discrete number (often eight) of the charge. Thus for example the arms of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], which despite a blazon of "seme" are invariably depicted with either eight or ten "crowns Golde" on its bordure. A large number (usually eight) of any one charge arranged as if upon an invisible bordure is said to be ''in orle'', an [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Subordinaries|orle]] being a diminutive band within the bordure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://historymedren.about.com/od/pimbley/a/pim_o.htm
|title= Orle
|work= Pimbley's Dictionary of Heraldry
|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most small charges can be depicted as semé, e.g. ''semé of roses,'' ''semé of estoiles,'' and so forth. In English heraldry, several types of small charges have special terms to refer to their state as semé:

*semé of cross-crosslets: ''crusily''
*semé of fleurs-de-lis: ''semé-de-lis''
*semé of [[bezants]]: ''bezanté''
*semé of plates: ''platé''
*semé of billets: ''billeté''
*semé of annulets: ''annulletty''
*semé of sparks: ''étincellé'';
*semé of [[goutte]]s ("drops" (of liquid)): ''gouttée'' / ''guttée'', with variants:&lt;ref&gt;Parker's Heraldry, A Dictionary of Heraldic Terms&lt;/ref&gt;
**Guttée-de-sang (blood, ''gules'')
**Guttée-de-poix (pitch (bitumen), ''sable'')
**Guttée-d'eau (water, ''argent'')
**Guttée-de-larmes (tears, ''azure'')
**Guttée-d'olives (olives, ''vert'')
*semé of torteaux (roundels gules): ''tortelly''

When a field semé is of a metal, the charges strewn on it must be of a tincture (colour), and vice versa, so as not to offend the [[rule of tincture]].

In Cornish heraldry the arms granted to the Hockin family are "Per fesse wavy gules and azure, in chief a lion passant gardant or beneath the feet a musket lying fesswise proper the base semy of fleurs-de-lis '''confusedly dispersed''' of the third," alluding to an incident in which the Cornish soldier Thomas Hockin caused the French to scatter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/Jpglossm.htm#Musket ; http://www.telecall.co.uk/~78741/arms.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995-2002 arms of Rogaška Slatina, Slovenia show ''Vert, semee of disks or decreasing in size from base to chief''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr/descr/si-obc14.html#si-rs95 The FAME: Slovenia - Communities, part 14 (Raz-Sev)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The heraldic [[tincture (heraldry)#Furs|furs]] of the [[tincture (heraldry)#Ermine and its variants|ermine]] family appear to be semé of the "ermine dots," but they are not counted as such; but fields semy of ermine spots are, as in the coat of [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/wales_current.html#wrexham%20cbc Wrexham County Borough Council].

== Masoned ==
[[File:ReynellArms.PNG|thumb|150px|''Argent masonry sable, a chief indented of the second''. Arms of Reynell&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lambrick Vivian|Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L.]], (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the  [[Heraldic visitation|Heralds' Visitations]] of 1531, 1564 &amp; 1620, Exeter, 1895, p.643&lt;/ref&gt; of Devon, England]] 
A field or ordinary ''masoned'' shows a pattern like that of a brick or [[ashlar]] stone wall. This can be "proper" or of a named tincture.  The tincture relates to the mortar between the stones or bricks, the latter being argent: a wall of red bricks with white mortar is thus blazoned: ''gules masoned argent''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=9&amp;ProjectElementID=21 The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada - Peter John Crabtree]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honeycomb ==
The town of [[Viļāni]], [[Latvia]], has part of its field honeycombed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daily-tangents.com/Gerboni/Cities/index.php3?city=Vilani&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this is in the arms of [[Fusagasugá]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], [[Colombia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cundinamarca.gov.co/cundinamarca/municipios/frm_municipios.asp?opcion=detalle_seccion&amp;codseccion=573&amp;codigo=32&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folds ==
The arms of the Special Troops Battalion of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division of the United States Army has the unique field ''Per pale Sable and Gules with stylized folds Sanguine'', the sinister half of the field symbolizing a warrior's cape.

== Pappellony ==
[[File:Blason Maison de Châteaubriant (ancien).svg|thumb|150px|''Gules papellony or''. Arms of Baron de Châteaubriant (ancient)]] 
A field ''pappellony'' (French: ''Papillon'', "butterfly") shows a pattern like the wings of a butterfly, though this is categorised as a fur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forgottensea.50megs.com/armory/lydiaoshannan.html Forgotten Sea Heraldry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of rows of pappellony are sometimes defined, such as seven in the arms of the Aleberici Family of Bologna. The arms of the French Barons de Châteaubriant (ancient) were: ''Gules papellony or.'' The Italian term ''squamoso'' and the French ''écaillé'', meaning 'scaly',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regalis.com/reg/medherald.htm Medieval Italian Heraldry - Regalis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; are similar.

== Pied at random ==
Used in some South-African coats, this means patterned like the markings of a [[bull]] or [[cow]]. There is at least one example that is more elaborately blazoned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027110657/http://www.geocities.com/heraldrysa/1-mung3.htm Municipal Heraldry - South Africa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tapissé of wheat ==
A field ''tapissé of [[wheat]]'' is entirely covered (literally "carpeted") by an interlocking stylised pattern looking like a wheat field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=180&amp;ShowAll=1 The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada - Heraldry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diapering ==
[[File:Diapering on Diocese of Worcester shield.jpg|right|thumb|Diapering of the field of the shield of the [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Diocese of Worcester]]: Argent, ten torteaux four three two and one]]
In English heraldry, [[diapering]] (covering areas of flat colour with a tracery design when depicting arms) is not considered a variation of the field; it is not specified in blazon, being a decision of the individual artist. A coat depicted with diapering is considered the same as a coat drawn from the same blazon but depicted without diapering.

In French heraldry, diapering is sometimes explicitly blazoned.

== Fretty and trellisé ==
A field ''fretty'' is composed of bendlets and bendlets-sinister or "scarps", interleaved over one another to give the impression of a trellis. Although almost invariably the bendlets and scarpes are of the same tincture, there is an example in which they are of two different metals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=49&amp;ProjectElementID=156 The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada - Heraldry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  (It is rare for the number of pieces of the fretty to be specified, though this is sometimes done in French blazon.)  (The bendlets and bendlets sinister are very rarely other than straight, as in the arms of David Robert Wooten, in which they are raguly.) Objects can be placed in the position of the bendlets and bendlets sinister and described as "fretty of," as in the arms of the [[Muine Bheag]] Town Commissioners: "Party per fess or fretty of blackthorn branches leaves proper and ermine, a fess wavy azure".
''Square fretty'' is similarly composed of barrulets and pallets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/leonardjohnweaver.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

''Trellisé'' appears in the arms of Luc-Normand Tellier, where it consists of "bendlets, bendlets sinister and barrulets" interlaced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=2017&amp;ProjectElementID=7038 The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada - Heraldry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[These are not, strictly speaking, variations of the field, since they are depicted as being on the field rather than in it.]

'''Velma Dinkley''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SmlvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 |title=D20 Girls Magazine&amp;nbsp;– Summer 2013 |first=Various |last=Authors |date=June 15, 2013 |publisher=Le Nurd Mystique LLC |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is usually seen wearing a baggy orange [[Polo neck|turtleneck]], short pleated skirt (or in later episodes an [[A-line skirt]], or sometimes shorts), [[knee socks]], [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]], and most prominently, a pair of square glasses, which she frequently loses. She is seen as the brains of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EDTkBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79 |title=The Female Investigator in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture |first=Lisa M. |last=Dresner |date=November 27, 2006 |publisher=McFarland |accessdate=December 21, 2016 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QxE0puk6j6YC&amp;pg=PT334&amp;dq=Velma%20Dinkley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwgKKwgoTRAhVJnRoKHSBwCSM4ChDoAQgnMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Velma%20Dinkley&amp;f=false |title=Sheroes: Bold, Brash, and Absolutely Unabashed Superwomen from Susan B.

==Character description==
Throughout her various incarnations, Velma is usually portrayed as a highly intelligent young woman with highly specific interests in science (which in the ''Scooby and Scrappy Doo'' series leads her to pursue a career as a NASA research scientist) or merely being very well read on obscure fields, such as Viking writing (as in the third Scooby-Doo series ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries]]''). In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo]]'', Velma is described by her younger sister Madelyn as being "born with a mystery book in her hand". Consequently, Velma is usually the one to figure out the mystery, sometimes with the help of [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] and [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]]. Velma Dinkley was inspired by the brainy tomboy [[Zelda Gilroy]], as played by [[Sheila James Kuehl|Sheila James]], from the late 1950s/early 1960s American sitcom ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]. (July 10, 2002).[http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm Post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514000000/http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm |date=May 14, 2006 }} on "News from Me" blog for ''Povonline.com''. Retrieved March 27, 2006. Excerpt: "Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on [[Maynard G. Krebs|Maynard]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[running gag]] in ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' and ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' is Velma's severe [[nearsighted]]ness and her trouble with keeping her glasses on her face (often resulting in them falling off while she is being chased by the villain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7GN0E_diWbAC&amp;pg=PA512 |title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century |first=David |last=Mansour |date=June 1, 2011 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another running gag is that despite the fact that she is the smallest of the Scooby-Doo gang she can actually carry away the whole gang in her arms from a villain.

When Scooby-Doo is too afraid to volunteer to help with a mission, Velma often offers him a dog treat called a "[[Scooby Snacks|Scooby Snack]]" as a bribe. She also occasionally displays a strong, take-charge personality when needed, sharply ordering Shaggy to "march!" in an early episode, and she is not above physically attacking a villain when provoked, as when she kicked The Creeper in the knee for snatching her glasses right off her face.  Her catchphrases are: "Jinkies!" and "My glasses! I can't see without my glasses!" (when she accidentally loses her glasses).

===Character background===
Like all of the Scooby-Doo kids, later [[ret-con]]ned as Mystery Incorporated members, Velma has differing personal backgrounds and histories depending on which series one is referring to.

In the original flagship ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' series, Velma attended the same high school as the rest of the gang (as stated in the inaugural episode "What a Night for a Knight"). However, by ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'', Velma is said to have graduated from a different high school than her friends (as stated in the episode "Spirited Spooked Sports Show").

In the film ''Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster'', it is revealed that her middle name is Daisy.

==Relatives==
Relatives of Velma shown during the series' run include:

* '''Dale and Angie Dinkley''': Velma's parents in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' (2010–13), voiced by [[Kevin Dunn]] and [[Frances Conroy]]. They own the Crystal Cove Mystery Museum, which has in its display all of the costumes from the villains the gang has defeated over the years, as well as other objects that have connections to the supernatural or the unexplainable. Angie constantly tries to help her daughter in any way she can, while Dale tends to reprimand Velma.
* '''Madelyn Dinkley''': Velma's younger sister voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]. She appears to be in her late teens and somewhat resembles her older sister in appearance and personality. Velma refers to Madelyn as a nerd and does not seem to realize how much alike they really are. Unlike Velma, Madelyn was not exactly sure what she wanted to do for a living and had previously attended clown college until she discovered a fondness for stage magic and enrolls in a school for stage [[Illusionist|magicians]]. Madelyn has a huge crush on [[Shaggy Rogers]] and as a result of this, Shaggy refers to Madelyn as "Doe-eyed Dinkley" or by simply "Madds". She plays an important role in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo]]'', when the magic school she's enrolled in is being terrorized by a giant [[griffin]].
* '''Aunt Meg''' and '''Uncle Evan''': Velma's aunt and uncle (voiced by [[Julia Sweeney]] and [[Diedrich Bader]]), who live in a small town called Banning Junction which features in a [[Halloween]] episode of ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]''.
* '''Marcy''': Velma's cousin and the daughter of Meg and Evan. She is studying mechanical engineering in college, but unlike Velma, she is fashionable. This along with Marcy's interest in Fred made her Daphne's rival of sorts. She was born on [[Halloween]] which over time led to her hatred of the holiday as it usually upstaged her birthday (even her parents have forgotten it). Consequently, she used local legend and her engineering background to create Mechanical Scarecrow Monsters to terrorize the town on her eighteenth birthday.
* '''Aunt Thelma''': works with [[dolphin]]s at a [[ocean|marine]] institute.
* '''Uncle Dave (Walton)'''
* '''Uncle John''': works as an [[archaeology|archaeologist]].
* '''Uncle Cosmo''': also works as an archaeologist.
* '''Uncle Elmo''': a [[Physician|doctor]].
* '''Uncle Ted''': also works as an archaeologist.
* '''Great Uncle Dr. Von Dinkenstein''': Velma's infamous great-uncle, resembling Frankenstein. He is the reason for Velma's crime solving business.

===Voice actors===
Velma has been voiced by several actresses. From 1969 to 1973, [[Nicole Jaffe]] voiced Velma; from 1976 to 1979, [[Pat Stevens]] voiced the character. From 1979 to 1980, Marla Frumkin provided her voice. Velma did not speak in the ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' final episode, "The Ransom of Scooby Chief". After the character's absence from 1980 to 1983 series, Marla Frumkin reprised the role of Velma as a guest star in ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries]]''. Velma was absent again until ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' when Christina Lange voiced the role. [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]] voiced Velma in a [[Johnny Bravo]] crossover episode. From the animated movie, ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'' on, B.J. Ward reprised her role in all movies through ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'', as well as an episode of the [[Adult Swim]] animated series, ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCkwhd23S7Y |title=Harvey Birdman Season 1, Episode 3 |last=TV Shows |date=October 13, 2015 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicole Jaffe]] returned temporarily to voice Velma in the direct-to-video movies ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico]]''.

From 2002 until 2015, Velma was voiced by [[Mindy Cohn]] of ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' fame. In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map]]'', Velma is voiced by [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]]. On July 8, 2015, it was announced that [[Kate Micucci]] would take over the role of Velma in the upcoming series ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]''. 

===Live-action actors===
In the 2002 and 2004 live-action movies, Velma is played by [[Linda Cardellini]], who then voiced her for the ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' video game and ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. [[Lauren Kennedy]] portrayed young Velma in a flashback sequence in ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]''. Velma is portrayed by [[Hayley Kiyoko]] in the 2009 live-action movie ''[[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins]]'' and its 2010 sequel ''[[Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster]]''. [[Sarah Gilman]] portrayed the young Velma in the 2018 direct-to-video film ''[[Daphne &amp; Velma]]''.

==Reception==
Although the ''Scooby-Doo'' series and direct-to-video films depict her as [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], the character has a fan base among lesbian viewers due to an interpretation that she is a depiction of a smart, self-possessed lesbian.&lt;ref name=BB106&gt;Burke, Timothy and Burke, Kevin (1998).

'''''Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle''''' (Zone of immaterial pictorial sensibility) is an [[artist's book]] and [[Performance art|performance]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]]. The work involved the sale of documentation of ownership of empty space (the Immaterial Zone), taking the form of a cheque, in exchange for [[gold]]; if the buyer wished, the piece could then be completed in an elaborate ritual in which the buyer would burn the cheque, and Klein would throw half of the gold into the [[Seine]].&lt;ref name="Stich"&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, p156&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual would be performed in the presence of an art critic or distinguished dealer, an art museum director and at least two witnesses.&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt;

Between the creation of the piece in 1959 and his death on June 6, 1962, eight ''Zones'' were sold,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz, n93 p268&lt;/ref&gt; of which at least three involved the elaborate ritual.&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Klein's receipts verify the existence of an invisible work of art, which prove that a formal sale has taken place. As Klein establishes in his 'Ritual Rules', each buyer has two possibilities; If he pays the amount of gold agreed upon in exchange for a receipt, Klein keeps all of the gold, and the buyer does not really acquire the "authentic immaterial value" of the work. The second possibility is to buy an immaterial zone for gold and then to burn the receipt. Through this act, a perfect, definitive immaterialization is achieved, as well as the absolute inclusion of the buyer in the immaterial.... Klein presents capitalist trading strategies and illuminates his ideas about the indefinable, incalculable value of art."&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen Hollein &amp; Pfeiffer, Hatje Kantz 2004 p221&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The piece is often seen as an early example of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online, essay on Klein by Ulrike Lehmann&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://calendar.walkerart.org/canopy.wac?id=4489 Walker Art Gallery online] retrieved 1-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the ''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility''==
Whilst on a trip to [[Cascia]], Klein had designed an aeromagnetic sculpture, partially as a response to [[Jean Cocteau|Jean Cocteau's]] assertion when visiting his exhibition ''La forêt d’éponges'', June 1959, that it would be even greater if the sponges hovered without supports.&lt;ref name="Stich3"&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, p168&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's new sculptural idea was to hollow out a sponge, fill it with a [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]] balloon and a piece of metal, and then place it above a concealed electromagnet to regulate the height at which it would hover. Whilst this idea was never implemented, Klein applied for- and received- a patent on June 30, 1959, and then wrote enthusiastically about this new idea to his dealer [[Iris Clert]], asking her in particular not to mention the invention to her friend, the artist [[Takis]], who had also been experimenting with air sculptures. This led to a serious argument with Clert, who tended to side with Takis, as well as re-opening a previous feud with [[Jean Tinguely]].&lt;ref name="Stich3"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Their disagreement was so strong that Klein had removed all of his art from Clert's gallery in August 1959 and had told her assistant to inform any interested buyers that his paintings were all invisible and that if a buyer wanted one, it would suffice to write a check. He further specified that the check had to be very visible."&lt;ref name="Stich2"&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz 1995, n90 p268&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Clert then told this anecdote to a number of visitors to her gallery, one of whom, Peppino Palazzoli, an Italian gallerist, expressed an interest in buying an invisible artwork from Klein; in an attempt to repair the friendship, Clert informed Klein of the sale.&lt;ref name="Stich2"/&gt; She also recommended that Klein design a 'proper receipt'.&lt;ref name="Stich2"/&gt; Palazzoli became the official owner of the first ''Zone'' on November 18 that year, having bought the work for 20 grams of gold, valued at $466.20 as of November 1, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlygold.com/TutorialPages/Value_Of_Gold.asp Only Gold valuation website]&lt;/ref&gt; The reunion with Clert was to prove short-lived, however. By the end of 1959, he would sever his affiliation with her gallery, and the ''Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility'' would be their last collaboration. His next exhibition, the notorious ''Anthropométries de l'epoque bleue'', March 1960, (featuring models covered in blue paint pressing themselves on to canvases in front of an invited audience of notables) would be held in the considerably more upmarket Galerie Internationale d'Art Contemporain, on the [[Rive Droite]].

[[Image:ZoneImmaterielKlein2.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Yves Klein and [[Dino Buzzati]] engaged in the ritual transfer of immateriality, January 26, 1962]]

===The artist's book and Klein's use of gold===
The book took the form of a parody of a banker's chequebook. Klein printed eight books of these receipts of which five survive&lt;ref&gt;or at least claimed that he did; See Stich, n92, p268&lt;/ref&gt;- apart from the first book (which contained 31 unnumbered checks for an unspecified amount of gold), each book contains 10 numbered receipts for a set value of gold; series one cheques cost 20 grams of gold, series four cost 160 grams. The value of the seventh book's cheques was listed in the ''Antagonismes'' Exhibition, Paris 1960, at 1,280 grams. 

Any gold that wasn't thrown into the Seine ended up in Klein's concurrent series of Monogolds; large scale works made of gold leaf. He had first come across the material's use in art whilst working in a framing workshop, Robert Savage's, in London 1949-50; he was also to encounter it used in golden [[Buddha]]s and screens whilst visiting [[Japan]]. Curiously, these encounters led Klein to associate the precious metal with immateriality;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"And the gold, it was something! These leaves that literally fluttered with the least current of air on the flat cushion that one held in one hand, while the other hand caught them in the wind with a knife.... What a material!
The illumination of matter in its deep physical quality, I came to embrace it during that year at the 'Savage' frame shop." Klein&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, quoted in Stich, Cantz 1995, p193&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Ritual===
The use of ritual in Klein's work is a theme running through his work, from his exhibition ''Le Vide'' (The Void) 1958, in which he exhibited invisible works at Clert's gallery flanked by [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guards]], to his elaborately planned wedding ceremony in 1962 and his [[Votive deposit|votive]] offering to [[Rita of Cascia|Saint Rita of Cascia]] (see [http://www.yveskleinarchives.org/documents/bio_html/1961_B_us.html]). Klein was fascinated by [[Catholicism]] &amp; [[Buddhism]], as well as being an enthusiastic member of the archaic group the Knights of the Order of [[Saint Sebastian]].&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen Hollein &amp; Pfeiffer, Schirn 2004 p217&lt;/ref&gt;
The obsession with the void, or nothingness, also runs throughout his work, with ''Le Vide'' (The Void) being the most famous example; for his second major exhibition at Iris Clert's, he emptied the entire gallery, painted it white (using his patented medium) and then persuaded the French government to send Republican Guards to stand outside as sentries, at the end of a hallway painted [[International Klein Blue|ultramarine]], covered with blue curtains to ensure there would be no way of anticipating the gallery's contents. Anyone who didn't have an invitation was charged 1,500 frs. entrance fee.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p134&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 people turned up for the opening,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p138&lt;/ref&gt; and Clert decided to prolong the exhibition for an extra week to accommodate the 'several hundred' visitors each day.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Stich, Hayward Gallery, Cantz 1995, p139&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Having rejected nothingness, I discovered the void. The meaning of the immaterial pictorial zones, extracted from the depth of the void which by that time was of a very material order. Finding it unacceptable to sell these immaterial zones for money, I insisted in exchange for the highest quality of the immaterial, the highest quality of material payment – a bar of pure gold. Incredible as it may seem, I have actually sold a number of these pictorial immaterial states . . . Painting no longer appeared to me to be functionally related to the gaze, since during the blue monochrome period of 1957 I became aware of what I called the pictorial sensibility. This pictorial sensibility exists beyond our being and yet belongs in our sphere. We hold no right of possession over life itself. It is only by the intermediary of our taking possession of sensibility that we are able to purchase life. Sensibility enables us to pursue life to the level of its base material manifestations, in the exchange and barter that are the universe of space, the immense totality of nature.” Yves Klein, from the ''Chelsea Hotel Manifesto'', 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://theorynow.blogspot.com/2007/09/transaction-voided.html Quoted from Theory Now]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reception of the Work===
The French press delighted in calling the event 'a scandal' (''Klein Sells Wind!''), but others were more impressed;&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt;
Various members of the group present to watch [[Michael Blankfort]]'s ritual transaction, for instance, on February 10, 1962, concurred that the event was 'extremely awe-inspiring',&lt;ref name="Stich"/&gt; ending with the noonday chimes ringing out from churches all around Paris. Blankfort, a Hollywood writer, wrote later of having "no other experience in art equal to the depth of feeling of [the sale ceremony]. It evoked in me a shock of self-recognition and an explosion of awareness of time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Blankfort quoted in Yves Klein, Stich, Cantz, 1995 p156&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the work is a response to [[Walter Benjamin|Walter Benjamin's]] essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://theorynow.blogspot.com/2007/09/transaction-voided.html Mark Cameron Boyd, Theory Now] retrieved 01-11-08&lt;/ref&gt; in which he wrote “The unique value of the ‘authentic’ work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value.”&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;[http://academic.evergreen.edu/a/arunc/compmusic/benjamin/benjamin.pdf "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" by Walter Benjamin]&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the ''Zones'' directly refute Benjamin's central argument, that modern mass production can finally "emancipate the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual".&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;
