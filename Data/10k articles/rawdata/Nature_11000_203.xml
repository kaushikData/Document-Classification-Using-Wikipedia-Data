A normalized '''1s Slater-type function''' is a function which is used in the descriptions of atoms and in a broader way in the description of atoms in molecules. It is particularly important as the accurate quantum theory description of the smallest free atom, hydrogen. It has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{1s}(\zeta, \mathbf{r - R}) = \left(\frac{\zeta^3}{\pi}\right)^{1 \over 2} \, e^{-\zeta |\mathbf{r - R}|}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a particular case of a [[Slater-type orbital]] (STO) in which the [[principal quantum number]] n is 1. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Slater orbital exponent'''. Related sets of functions can be used to construct [[STO-nG basis sets]] which are used in [[quantum chemistry]].

== Applications for hydrogen-like atomic systems ==

A '''hydrogen-like atom'''  or a '''hydrogenic atom''' is an [[atom]] with one  [[electron]].  Except for the hydrogen atom itself (which is neutral) these atoms carry positive charge &lt;math&gt;e(\mathbf Z-1)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z&lt;/math&gt; is the [[atomic number]] of the atom.  Because hydrogen-like atoms are two-particle systems with an interaction depending only on the distance between the two particles,  their (non-relativistic) Schrödinger equation can be exactly solved in analytic form. The solutions are one-electron functions and are referred to as ''hydrogen-like atomic orbitals''.&lt;ref&gt;In quantum chemistry an orbital is synonymous with "one-electron function", i.e., a function of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The electronic Hamiltonian (in atomic units) of a Hydrogenic system is given by
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{H}}_e = -  \frac{\nabla^2}{2} - \frac{\mathbf Z}{r}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z&lt;/math&gt; is the nuclear charge of the hydrogenic atomic system. The 1s electron of a hydrogenic systems can be accurately described by the corresponding Slater orbital:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf \psi_{1s} = \left (\frac{\zeta^3}{\pi} \right ) ^{0.50}e^{-\zeta r}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the Slater exponent. This state, the ground state, is the only state that can be described by a Slater orbital. Slater orbitals have no radial nodes, while the excited states of the hydrogen atom have radial nodes.

=== Exact energy of a hydrogen-like atom ===

The energy of a hydrogenic system can be exactly calculated analytically as follows :
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{1s} = \frac{\langle\psi_{1s}|\mathbf{\hat{H}}_e|\psi_{1s}\rangle}{\langle\psi_{1s}|\psi_{1s}\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\langle\psi_{1s}|\psi_{1s}\rangle} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{1s} = \langle\psi_{1s}|\mathbf -  \frac{\nabla^2}{2} - \frac{\mathbf Z}{r}|\psi_{1s}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{1s} = \langle\psi_{1s}|\mathbf -  \frac{\nabla^2}{2}|\psi_{1s}\rangle+\langle\psi_{1s}| - \frac{\mathbf Z}{r}|\psi_{1s}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{1s} = \langle\psi_{1s}|\mathbf -  \frac{1}{2r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left (r^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right )|\psi_{1s}\rangle+\langle\psi_{1s}| - \frac{\mathbf Z}{r}|\psi_{1s}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Using the expression for Slater orbital, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \psi_{1s} = \left (\frac{\zeta^3}{\pi} \right ) ^{0.50}e^{-\zeta r}&lt;/math&gt; the integrals can be exactly solved. Thus,
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{1s} = \left\langle \left(\frac{\zeta^3}{\pi} \right)^{0.50} e^{-\zeta r} \right|\left. -\left(\frac{\zeta^3}{\pi} \right)^{0.50}e^{-\zeta r}\left[\frac{-2r\zeta+r^2\zeta^2}{2r^2}\right]\right\rangle+\langle\psi_{1s}| - \frac{\mathbf Z}{r}|\psi_{1s}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{1s} = \frac{\zeta^2}{2}-\zeta \mathbf Z.&lt;/math&gt;

The optimum value for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \zeta&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by equating the differential of the energy with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf \zeta&lt;/math&gt; as zero.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\mathbf E_{1s}}{d\zeta}=\zeta-\mathbf Z=0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; \mathbf \zeta=\mathbf Z.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Non-relativistic energy ===

The following energy values are thus calculated by using the expressions for energy and for the Slater exponent.

'''Hydrogen : H'''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf Z=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf \zeta=1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E_{1s}=&lt;/math&gt;−0.5 E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E_{1s}=&lt;/math&gt;−13.60569850 eV
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E_{1s}=&lt;/math&gt;−313.75450000 kcal/mol

'''Gold : Au(78+)'''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf Z=79&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf \zeta=79&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E_{1s}=&lt;/math&gt;−3120.5 E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E_{1s}=&lt;/math&gt;−84913.16433850 eV
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E_{1s}=&lt;/math&gt;−1958141.8345 kcal/mol.

=== Relativistic energy of Hydrogenic atomic systems ===
Hydrogenic atomic systems are suitable models to demonstrate the relativistic effects in atomic systems in a simple way. The energy expectation value can calculated by using the Slater orbitals with or without considering the relativistic correction for the Slater exponent &lt;math&gt; \mathbf \zeta &lt;/math&gt;. The relativistically corrected Slater exponent &lt;math&gt; \mathbf \zeta_{rel} &lt;/math&gt; is given as
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathbf \zeta_{rel}= \frac{\mathbf Z}{\sqrt {1-\mathbf Z^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;The relativistic energy of an electron in 1s orbital of a hydrogenic atomic systems is obtained by solving the [[Dirac equation]].
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{1s}^{rel} = -(c^2+\mathbf Z\zeta)+\sqrt{c^4+\mathbf Z^2\zeta^2}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;Following table illustrates the relativistic corrections in energy and it can be seen how the relativistic correction scales with the atomic number of the system.

'''{{mp|2010 TD|54}}''' is a tiny [[asteroid]] and [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately 5 meters in diameter. It was first observed by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] in October 2010, when the asteroid crossed through the Earth-moon system and had a close encounter with Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2010 TD|54}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.7–3.2&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 2 years and 9 months (1,011 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.64 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 4[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The body's [[observation arc]] begins with its first observations by the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] and only spans over a period of 3 days until 12 October 2010. It has been observed since then.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close approach ===

{{mp|2010 TD|54}} made its closest approach at 10:51, 12 October 2010 UTC (6:51 EDT a.m.) at {{convert |0.000346 | AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=on}}. It is one of the [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth|closest known approaches of an asteroid to Earth]], at which time the object appeared at a [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of 14. It was first observed by of the [[Catalina Sky Survey]]{{'}}s telescopes north of [[Tucson, Arizona]] on 9 October 2010.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;

It has an Earth ''[[minimum orbit intersection distance]]'' of {{convert |0.000178086 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}}, which corresponds to 0.0693 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It was removed from the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] on 11 October 2010.&lt;ref name="CINEOS-Sentry" /&gt; The asteroid may have passed {{convert |0.0009 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}} from Earth in October 1979, but the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] orbit suggests it passed millions of kilometres from Earth in 1979.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

{{mp|2010 TD|54}} is a [[S-type asteroid|stony asteroid]], characterized as a Srv subtype.&lt;ref name="Popescu-2011" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

In November 2010, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2010 TD|54}} was obtained from photometric observations, which showed that the asteroid is a [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]]. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined [[rotation period]] of 0.0229317 hours (1 minute and 23 seconds) with a brightness amplitude of 0.92 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3]]}}). A high amplitude typically indicates that the body has an irregular, elongated rather than spherical shape.{{efn|name=lcdb-Ryan 2011}} This result supersedes a previously obtained lightcurve with a shorter period of 0.01167 hours  ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=1]]}}).&lt;ref name="Hicks-2010" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of {{convert |5 |m |ft |abbr=off |lk=off}} based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 28.9.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; NASA's press release gave an estimated diameter of 5 to 10 meters (16 to 33 feet).&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4773">The '''African easterly jet''' is a region of the lower troposphere over [[West Africa]] where the seasonal mean wind speed is at a maximum and the wind is easterly. The temperature contrast between the [[Sahara Desert]] and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] causes the jet to form to the north of the [[monsoon trough]]. The jet's maximum wind speeds are at a height of {{convert|3|km}}. The jet moves northward from its south-most location in January, reaching its most northerly latitude in August. Its strongest winds are in September while it begins shifting back towards the equator. Within the easterly jet, [[tropical wave]]s form. Convective complexes associated with these waves can form [[tropical cyclone]]s. If the jet is south of its normal location during August and September, [[tropical cyclogenesis]] is suppressed. If [[desertification]] continues across [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the strength of the jet could increase, although tropical wave generation probably would decrease, which would decrease the number of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin.

==Formation and characteristics==
During January, the African easterly jet lies at {{convert|3000|m}} above sea level at five degrees north latitude. Winds within it increase in speed from {{convert|30|km/h|abbr=on}} in January to {{convert|40|km/h|abbr=on}} in March. Shifting northward in April to the seventh parallel, winds within the jet increase to {{convert|45|km/h|abbr=on}}. By June, it shifts northward into northwest Africa.&lt;ref name="marcel"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v32qnYWh5gQC&amp;pg=PA139 | pages=138–139 | title=The Meteorology and Climate of Tropical Africa | author=Marcel Leroux | year=2001 | publisher=Springer | accessdate=5 February 2011 | ISBN=978-3-540-42636-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From June into October, the [[thermal low]] over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream to the south of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Pu and K. H.

Retrieved on 8 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-level African easterly jet develops because heating of the West African land mass during this time of year creates a surface temperature and moisture gradient between the Gulf of Guinea and the Sahara Desert. The atmosphere responds by generating vertical [[wind shear]] to maintain [[thermal wind]] balance. The jet reaches its zenith in August, lying between the 16th and 17th parallels. In September, winds maximize near {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} between the 12th and 13th parallels. The easterly jet weakens and drops southward during October and November.&lt;ref name="marcel"/&gt;

Potential of using of '''[[Renewable resources|climatic resources]]''', including solar and wind energy is large in '''[[Azerbaijan]]''', despite that the share of these resources within energy production is still small.

==Solar energy==

The possibility of use of [[solar energy]] is large in Azerbaijan Republic due to wide climatic resources and advantageous agroclimatic potential of the country. The quantitative indicators of sunny hours are sufficient in the country. The yearly amount of sunny hours is 1800-2900 in Azerbaijan. The highest indicator is typical for the territory of the Autonomous Republic of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], reaching up to 2900 hours a year. The Kura-Araz lowland, Jeyranchol area, and the [[Absheron peninsula|peninsula of Absheron]] are the territories with 2200-2400 sunny hours. The amount of solar radiation is also favorable, hesitating by regions from 125 to 150 kcal per sq. centimeter. It is 125-134 kcal per sq. cm in the Kura-Araz and Lankaran lowlands. The highest figure is in Nakhchivan (145-160 kcal per sq. cm).

Sumgait-located AzgunTech plant, constructed by State Company of Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources, operates since 2012. This firstly commissioned High-Tech Park in the country produces sun panels and [[LED lamp]]s. Each module of [[solar panel]]s in the plant has 60 solar cells with capacity of 42-250 watts. Production is also relevant to the project named "Thousand houses - thousand plants" designed for the housing sector, and is to provide installation of solar panels on housing buildings. It is expected that the capacity of the plant will made 240 thousand solar panels a year in the future. Production of solar batteries in Sumgait is expected to be realized, too. Besides with these, the plant will produce 36 million LED chips and 12 million diode lamps a year.

==Wind energy==

It is estimated that in Azerbaijan, natural and geographical condition, and also economic infrastructure may allow to produce 800 mWt of energy a year at the expense of [[wind power]]. This is equivalent to an electric energy of 2,4 billion kWt/hour. The best condition for developing wind power industry is on northwestern part of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Historically, a lot of windmills have been constructed in the territory of Azerbaijan, particularly in Absheron peninsula with the purpose of using drinking waters of wells. This method is currently used in some places of the peninsula.

Taking into consideration the power, directions, and continuation of winds as well as possibilities of taking advantage of wind energy, the two zones may be differed in the territory of country.

The first zone covers territories of Siyazan, Khizi, Absheron, Gobustan, Neftchala, Salyan, including the mouth of [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]]. This large area is dominated by northern and partially dillag northwestern winds. The speed of Nord (northern winds) is up to 8–10&amp;nbsp;m/s. In this strip zone from Siyazan to the point of Alat, the yearly number of wind-blowing hours reaches 2000-2200. The average speed of wind reaches 6–9&amp;nbsp;m/s in Absheron peninsula where the annual number of wind-blowing days reaches 245-280. At least 8-10% of the territory of Absheron is reliable for installation of wind turbines. There are great possibilities for development of wind farms also in the islands of the Caspian Sea, the number of which is 50 as well as the territories of Khachmaz, Masalli, and less-populated Gobustan. 
The second winds-dominated zone encompasses Jeyranchol Plateau, the regions of Ganjabasar, Goranboy, Terter and surrounding areas where northwestern winds are dominant. Creation of wind power plants in these territories would be effective particularly due to plenty sunny hours of spring and winter.

Ganja-Dashkasan region, and also the administrative areas of Sharur and Julfa, located in Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan are favorable territories areas for construction of wind farm due to the dominant winds average yearly speed of which make up 3–5&amp;nbsp;m/s. The last indicator is advantageous for operation of wind stations of medium power. The average yearly speed of winds in the Great Caucasus is 0,8-2,3&amp;nbsp;m/s as well as 1,8-2,4&amp;nbsp;m/s in Lankaran-Astara, and 1,9-2,7&amp;nbsp;m/s in Karabagh and other territories of the Lesser Caucasus. These indicators and the carried out analysis give a basis to suggest about efficiency of using wind power chiefly in Absheron, Gobustan, Siyazan, and the adjacent Pre-Caspian territories, and also northwestern part of Azerbaijan – Enke-boyugusu-Goranboy-Jeyranchol zone. Moreover, it is favorable also in term of efficient land use, because the both mentioned zones have not fertile soils, and therefore, are less-populated and suitable areas for allocation of wind generators.

In order to use alternative energy, the construction of hybrid polygon is underway in Maraza settlement of Gobustan. The polygon operates at the expense of not only wind and sunbeam but also [[biomass]]. By 2012, 2,7 mWt of energy is produced due to wind power, 2,0 mWt of energy is gained by using sunbeam as well as 1,0 mWt from biomass. The polygon will provide Gobustan region with electricity in the future. The creation of Sea Wind Farm in the Caspian Sea, estimated at €250 million is to be invested by non-state entities and the government in the future.

==Definition==
The [[Science Education Resource Center]], [[Carleton College]], offers the following description: "Earth system science embraces chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics and applied sciences in transcending disciplinary boundaries to treat the Earth as an integrated system. It seeks a deeper understanding of the physical, chemical, biological and human interactions that determine the past, current and future states of the Earth. Earth system science provides a physical basis for understanding the world in which we live and upon which humankind seeks to achieve sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/earthsystem/nutshell/|title=Earth System Science in a Nutshell|publisher=[[Carleton College]] |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
For millennia, humans have speculated how the physical and living elements on the surface of the Earth combine, with gods and goddesses frequently posited to embody specific elements. The notion that the Earth, itself, is alive was a regular theme of Greek philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Tickell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tickell |first=Crispin |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/features/2000-2009/2006/11/nparticle.2006-11-20.html |title=Earth Systems Science: Are We Pushing Gaia Too Hard? |work= 46th Annual Bennett Lecture - University of Leicester |location=London |publisher=University of Leicester |date=2006 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientific interpretations of the Earth system began in the field of [[geology]], initially in the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;Fielding H. Garrison, ''An introduction to the history of medicine'', W.B. Saunders, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; and China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century : The Achievements |series=History of civilizations of Central Asia |editor1-first=M.

As [[History of geology|geology developed as a science]], understanding of the interplay of different facets of the Earth system increased, leading to the inclusion of factors such as the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]], [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|planetary geology]] and [[Biosphere|living systems]].

In many respects, the foundational concepts of Earth system science can be seen in the holistic interpretations of nature promoted by the 19th century geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |journal=Science |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596-597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (1863–1945) saw the functioning of the [[biosphere]] as a geological force generating a dynamic disequilibrium, which in turn promoted the diversity of life. In the mid-1960s, [[James Lovelock]] first postulated a regulatory role for the biosphere in [[feedback]] mechanisms within the Earth system. Initially named the "Earth Feedback hypothesis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kasting| first1=James| title=The Gaia Hypothesis is Still Giving Us Feedback| url=http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/the-gaia-hypothesis-is-still-giving-us-feedback| accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/GAIA_hypothesis.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Gaia Hypothesis and Earth System Science |last=Schneider |first=Stephen |last2=Boston |first2=Penelope |work=University of Florida |publisher=MIT Press |date=1992 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Highfield| first1=Roger| title=Unlocking Lovelock, science's greatest maverick| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/10735286/Unlocking-James-Lovelock-sciences-greatest-maverick.html| website=The Telegraph| publisher=The Telegraph| accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock later renamed it the [[Gaia hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Tickell"/&gt; and subsequently further developed the theory with American evolutionary theorist [[Lynn Margulis]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Gribbon| first1=John and Mary| title=James Lovelock: In Search of Gaia| date=2009| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the field of [[systems science]] was developing across numerous other scientific fields, driven in part by the increasing availability and [[Computer performance|power]] of [[computer]]s, and leading to the development of [[climate model]]s that began to allow the detailed and interacting [[numerical weather prediction|simulation]]s of the Earth's [[weather]] and [[climate]].&lt;ref name=edwards2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edwards |first=P.N. |date=2010 |title=History of climate modelling |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.95/abstract |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |volume=2 |issue= |pages=128–139 |doi=10.1002/wcc.95 |access-date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent extension of these models has led to the development of "Earth system models" (ESMs) that include facets such as the cryosphere and the biosphere.&lt;ref name=washington2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Washington |first=W.M. |last2=Buja |first2=L. |last3=Craig |first3=A. |date=2009 |title=The computational future for climate and Earth system models: on the path to petaflop and beyond |url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1890/833 |journal=Phil.

As an integrative field, Earth system science assumes the histories of a vast range of scientific disciplines, but as a discrete study it evolved in the 1980s, particularly at [[NASA]], where a committee called the Earth System Science Committee was formed in 1983. The earliest reports of NASA's ESSC, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104410706;view=1up;seq=3 ''Earth System Science: Overview''] (1986), and the book-length [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Earth System Science: A Closer View''] (1988), constitute a major landmark in the formal development of Earth system science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Mooney| first1=Harold| title=Evolution of natural and social science interactions in global change research programs| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| date=February 26, 2013| volume= 110| issue = Supplement 1, 3665-3672| pages=3665–3672| doi=10.1073/pnas.1107484110| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_1/3665.full| accessdate=7 September 2015| display-authors=etal| pmid=23297237| pmc=3586612| bibcode=2013PNAS..110.3665M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early works discussing Earth system science, like these NASA reports, generally emphasized the increasing human impacts on the Earth system as a primary driver for the need of greater integration among the life and geo-sciences, making the origins of Earth system science parallel to the beginnings of [[global change]] studies and programs.

== Climate science ==
[[File:Ocean &amp; Earth System.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The dynamic interaction of the Earth's [[ocean]]s, [[climate|climatological]], [[Geochemical cycle|geochemical systems]].]]
Climatology and climate change have been central to Earth system science since its inception, as evidenced by the prominent place given to climate change in the early NASA reports discussed above. The Earth's climate system is a prime example of an emergent property of the whole planetary system which cannot be fully understood without regarding it as a single integrated entity. It is also a property of the system where human impacts have been growing rapidly in recent decades, lending immense importance to the successful development and advancement of Earth system science research. As just one example of the centrality of climatology to the field, leading American climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]] is the Director of one of the earliest centers for Earth system science research, the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, and its mission statement reads, "the Earth System Science Center (ESSC) maintains a mission to describe, model, and understand the Earth's climate system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Michael|title=Earth System Science Center|url=http://www.essc.psu.edu/|publisher=Penn State University|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Gaia hypothesis==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The Gaia hypothesis posits that living systems interact with physical components of the Earth system to form a [[homeostasis|self-regulating]] whole that maintains conditions that are favourable for life. Developed initially by James Lovelock, the hypothesis attempts to account for key features of the Earth system, including the long period (several billion years) of relatively favourable climatic conditions against a backdrop of [[Sun#Main sequence|steadily increasing]] [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]]. Consequently, the Gaia hypothesis has important implications for Earth system science, as noted by NASA's Director for Planetary Science, James Green, in October 2010: "Dr. Lovelock and Dr. Margulis played a key role in the origins of what we now know as Earth system science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NASA|first1=50th Anniversary Symposium: Seeking Signs of Life|title=Opening Keynote - 'Exobiology in the Beginning'|url=http://original.livestream.com/astrobiology50th/video?clipId=pla_89adff36-bad9-43a2-b416-29a41cb9fab1|website=livestream.com|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Gaia hypothesis and Earth system science take an interdisciplinary approach to studying systems operations on a planetary-scale,&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt; they are not synonymous with one another.

== Education ==
Earth system science can be studied at a postgraduate level at some universities, with notable programs at such institutions as the [https://www.ess.uci.edu/ University of California, Irvine], [http://www.essc.psu.edu/ University of Pennsylvania], and [https://earth.stanford.edu/ess Stanford University]. In general education, the [[American Geophysical Union]], in cooperation with the [[Keck Geology Consortium]] and with support from five divisions within the [[National Science Foundation]], convened a workshop in 1996, "to define common educational goals among all disciplines in the Earth sciences". In its report, participants noted that, "The fields that make up the Earth and space sciences are currently undergoing a major advancement that promotes understanding the Earth as a number of interrelated systems". Recognizing the rise of this [[systems approach]], the workshop report recommended that an Earth system science curriculum be developed with support from the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |title=Shaping the Future of Undergraduate Earth Science Education |publisher=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=2009-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916214004/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Earth System Science Education Alliance was begun, and currently includes the participation of 40+ institutions, with over 3,000 teachers having completed an ESSEA course as of fall 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth System Science Education Alliance|url=http://essea.strategies.org/background.html|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Timber DonnellyMills2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Timber]]]]

The '''exploitation of natural resources''' is the use of [[natural resource]]s for [[economic growth]],&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Richard. (2009). "[http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Exploiting_Natural_Resources-Chapter_5_Cronin.pdf Natural Resources and the Development-Environment Dilemma]." ''Exploiting Natural Resources''. The Henry L. Stimson Centre. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes with a [[negative connotation]] of accompanying [[environmental degradation]]. It started to emerge on an [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] scale in the 19th century as the extraction and processing of [[raw material]]s (such as in [[mining]], [[steam engine|steam power]], and [[machinery]]) developed much further than it had in preindustrial areas. During the 20th century, [[energy]] consumption rapidly increased. Today, about 80% of the [[world energy consumption|world’s energy consumption]] is sustained by the extraction of [[fossil fuel]]s, which consists of [[oil]], [[coal]] and [[gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Planas|first=Florent|title=The Exploitation of Natural Resources|url=http://www.unanpourlaplanete.org/en/the-human-footprint/the-exploitation-of-natural-resources.html|work=Un An Pour La Planete|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[non-renewable resource]] that is exploited by humans is [[Soil horizon#Layers|subsoil minerals]] such as [[precious metal]]s that are mainly used in the production of industrial [[commodity|commodities]]. [[Intensive farming|Intensive agriculture]] is an example of a mode of production that hinders many aspects of the [[natural environment]], for example the [[environmental degradation|degradation]] of [[forest]]s in a [[terrestrial ecosystem]] and [[water pollution]] in an [[aquatic ecosystem]]. As the [[world population]] rises and [[economic growth]] occurs, the [[depletion of natural resources]] influenced by the unsustainable extraction of [[raw materials]] becomes an increasing concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McNicoll|first=Geoffrey|title=Handbook of Sustainable Development|year=2007|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|pages=125–39|url=http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/wp/205.pdf|accessdate=2012-03-13|chapter=Population and Sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why resources are under pressure==
*Increase in the sophistication of [[technology]] enabling natural resources to be extracted quickly and efficiently. E.g., in the past, it could take long  hours just to cut down one tree only using saws. Due to increased technology, rates of [[deforestation#Rates|deforestation]] have greatly increased
*The [[Human overpopulation|number of humans]] is increasing. According to the UN, there were 7.6 billion of us in 2017. This number is expected to rise to about 10 billion in 2050 and about 11 billion in 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=esa.un.org|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Cultures of [[consumerism]]. Materialistic views lead to the mining of [[gold]] and [[diamond]]s to produce jewelry, unnecessary commodities for human life or advancement. Consumerism also leads to extraction of resources for the production of commodities necessary for human life but in amounts excessive of what is needed, because people consume more than is necessary or waste what they have. For example, the production of meat puts a great strain on our food system.
*Excessive demand often leads to conflicts due to intense [[competition]]. Organizations such as [[Global Witness]] and the [[United Nations]] have documented the connection.
*Non-equitable distribution of resources.

==Consequences of exploitation of resources==
Natural resources are not limitless, and the following consequences can arise from the careless and excessive consumption of these resources:
*[[Deforestation]]
*[[Desertification]]
*[[Holocene extinction|Extinction of species]]
*[[Forced migration]]
*[[Erosion|Soil erosion]]
*[[Oil depletion]]
*[[Ozone depletion]]
*[[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse gas increase]]
*[[Extreme energy]]
*[[Water pollution]]
*[[Natural hazard]]/[[Natural disaster]]
*Metals and minerals depletion

==Effects on local communities==

===The Global South===
[[File:Mill Children in Macon 2.jpg|thumb|right|Human Resources [[Macon, Georgia]], 1909]]

When a [[mining]] company enters a [[developing country]] in the [[Global South|global south]] to extract raw materials, advocating the advantages of the industry’s presence and minimizing the potential negative effects gain cooperation of the local people. Advantageous factors are primarily in [[economic development]] so services that the government could not provide such as health centers, police departments and schools can be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pedro|first=Antonio M.A.|title=Mainstreaming Mineral Wealth in Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategies|year=2004|publisher=Economic Commission for Africa|isbn= 9789211250978|pages=5–6|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:idZaZbstr5MJ:www.uneca.org/eca_programmes/sdd/documents/mainstreaming_mineral_wealth_policy_paper_final_ct.pdf+mining+and+poverty+reduction+conflicts&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjYQGHBBS22C9mvPPgpT4rou72rG_DS-vg_Eg3Nh9nEoxk0WY7R8SZeIN_mwZ3a4J-nARWjv3jJRmlLl-xF1w_muKytHW8bg9xVfmsJc5-zpuH38VBe46W0YBMyHxgJZP1-JlHs&amp;sig=AHIEtbSRua3GxxxFCBDpDO1vQvsYwsg1Yw|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with economic development, money becomes a dominant subject of interest. This can bring about major conflicts that a [[local community]] in a developing country has never dealt with before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pegg|first=Simon|title=Mining and poverty reduction: Transforming rhetoric into reality|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2006|volume=14|issue=3-4|pages=376–87|url=http://www.rosiamontana.ro/img_upload/472936e3bca2bc61045730fbb1869240/Mining_and_Poverty.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2012|publisher=Elsevier|issn=0959-6526|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2004.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These conflicts emerge by a change to more [[egocentrism|egocentric]] views among the locals influenced by [[consumerism|consumerist]] values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Noord Internationaal WB PRSP Sourcebook|year=2001|pages=4–6|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:vnNkNoXoBwsJ:www.intussen.info/OldSite/Documenten/Noord/Internationaal/WB/PRSP%2520Sourcebook/20%2520Mining%2520and%2520poverty%2520reduction.pdf+post+mining+projects+repercussion+impact+on+local&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShtohjYDEQ0JdmWqo71S2H96MwqkZU3vSgEvOlt-JwMxdYDL6pEH5K_N8EAY0hSGJ5Ztu26NgjUBL0n1hOxX_cPbAOUGD3v5YkL-Z9WJTMhybHIUo2R6PiEBt8nN0wYv90VlcwZ&amp;sig=AHIEtbRFyD6oxarM8QfTnUa2cNihzrIgiQ|author1=Weber-Fahr, M. |author2=Strongman, J. |author3=Kunanayagam, R. |author4=McMahon, G. |author5=Sheldon, C. |accessdate=20 March 2012|chapter=Mining and Poverty Reduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the exploitation of natural resources in the [[local community]] of a [[developing country]] are exhibited in the impacts from the [[Ok Tedi Mine]]. After BHP, now [[BHP Billiton]], entered into [[Papua New Guinea]] to exploit copper and gold, the economy of the [[indigenous peoples]] boomed. Although their quality of life has improved, initially disputes were common among the locals in terms of [[land rights]] and who should be getting the benefits from the mining project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bray|first=John|title=Natural Resources and Conflict: Options and Actions|year=2003|publisher=World Bank Publications|pages=287–347|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=034PFZRJwvIC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=ok+tedi+mine+local+violence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eSoGL0xuw7&amp;sig=4vNt3jWzyTEToOUJjL0qKaaK8Eg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ha5fT8rvHcfZ0QGH1rW3Bw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=ok%20tedi%20mine%20local%20violence&amp;f=false|accessdate=2012-03-12|chapter=Attracting Reputable Companies to Risky Environments: Petroleum and Mining Companies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences of the [[Ok Tedi environmental disaster]] illustrate the potential negative effects from the exploitation of natural resources. The resulting mining pollution includes toxic contamination of the natural water supply for communities along the [[Ok Tedi River]], causing widespread killing of aquatic life. When a mining company ends a project after extracting the raw materials from an area of a [[developing country]], the local people are left to manage with the environmental damage done to their community and the long run sustainability of the economic benefits stimulated by the mining company’s presence becomes a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2004|publisher=CSRM|pages=12–13|url=http://www.csrm.uq.edu.au/docs/Hunter_Valley.pdf|author1=Brereton, D. |author2=Forbes, P. |title=Monitoring the Impact of Mining on Local Communities:  A Hunter Valley Case Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6181">The term '''G-Zero world''' refers to an emerging [[Power vacuum|vacuum of power]] in [[international politics]] created by a decline of [[Western world|Western]] influence and the domestic focus of the governments of developing states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks Eurasia Group Top 10 Risks of 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131233850/http://eurasiagroup.net/pages/top-risks |date=2011-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/g-zero/ G-Zero], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to explain a world in which there is no single country or group of countries that has ability and will, economically and politically, to drive a truly global agenda. 

The term G-Zero was first coined by political scientists [[Ian Bremmer]] and [[David F. Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Racanelli, Vito. [http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2011/01/26/davos-who-or-what-is-g-zero/ Davos: Who or What is G-Zero?], ''Barron’s'', January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/01/28/132742511/the-friday-podcast-g-zero The Friday Podcast: G-Zero]. NPR ''Planet Money'', January 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; G-Zero became the main theme of [[Ian Bremmer|Ian Bremmer's]] book, ''[[Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World]]'' ([[Penguin Group|Portfolio]], May 2012).  

It is a reference to a perceived shift away from the preeminence of the [[G7|Group of Seven]] industrialized countries and the expanded [[G20|Group of Twenty]], which includes major emerging powers like [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[Turkey]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Damian. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/damianreece/8284541/Davos-WEF-2011-East-and-West-must-cooperate-if-were-to-survive-this-economic-mess.html Davos WEF 2011: East and West must cooperate if we’re to survive this economic mess], ''The Telegraph'', January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Reece, Damian, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/8332545/G20-Paris-Sarkozy-dares-to-dream-in-a-G-Zero-world.html G20 Paris: Sarkozy Dares to Dream in a G-Zero World] ''The Telegraph'', February 18, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Parag and Leonard, Mark [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/opinion/08iht-edkhanna08.html Why China wants a G-3 World] ''The International Herald Tribune'', September 8, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; It is also a rejection of terms like [[Group of Two|G2]], often used to identify a possible strategic partnership between the U.S. and Chinese governments, or G3, which represents an attempt to align U.S., European and Japanese interests to defend [[free market democracy]] from the rise of [[State capitalism#People.27s_Republic_of_China|Chinese-inspired state-dominated capitalism]].

Those who argue that the G-Zero has become the current international order warn that the [[G7]] has become obsolete, that the [[G20]] offers too many competing visions of the proper role of government in an economy to produce well-coordinated policies, that China has no interest in the responsibilities that come with a [[Group of Two|G2]], and that America, Europe and Japan are too mired in internal problems to forge a common approach to economic and security policy. 

In an article called “From G8 to G20 to G-Zero: Why no one wants to take charge in the new global order," Ian Bremmer writes that making compromises are difficult since each country has their own values and developed countries have voters that want their leader's focus to be domestic community, not the international one. Some of these developed countries include: the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Japan. As developed countries start to focus on their domestic issues, the lack of global leadership increases which in turn increases the transnational problems. As global leadership decreases, clashes between countries are also increasing such as America and China having different views on “statedriven and free-market varieties of capitalism”. There are also issues arising in East Asia between nations such as China and Japan in the East China Sea. The U.S. has to also focus on changes in their energy sector and whether they should participate in Syria’s civil war.

Bremmer explains that governments can adapt to the G-Zero through focusing on regional solutions such as China’s deals with the [[Association of South-East Asian Nations]] (A.S.E.A.N.) and the United States’ progress on the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]]. Governments can also form relationships with a diversity of partners. However some countries may still not be able to adapt to the G-0 because of three impacting events in the world: "China's rise, Middle East turmoil and the redesign of Europe". Countries affected by these events would be Japan, Israel and Britain. &lt;ref&gt; Ian Bremmer, [http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2013/06/g8-g20-g-zero-why-no-one-wants-take-charge-new-global-order "From G8 to G20 to G-Zero: Why no one wants to take charge in the new global order"], ''Newstatesman'', June 11, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the G-Zero has been criticized by some who argue that it overstates the decline in America’s [[political power|political]] and [[economic power]] and underestimates the willingness of [[developing countries]] to play a larger role on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/02/28/g-zero-gee-another-idea-with-zero-to-support-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia''''' is a large comprehensive encyclopedia of animal life. It is named after its original editor in chief, [[Bernhard Grzimek]] ({{IPA-de|ˈɡʒɪmɛk|pron}}).&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Grzimek’s Animal Life Encyclopedia [fact sheet] |publisher=Gale Cengage Learning |year=2008 |url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/pdf/facts/Grzimek.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027140730/http://www.gale.cengage.com/pdf/facts/Grzimek.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the encyclopedia was published as a 13-volume set in [[German language|German]] under the name ''Grzimeks Tierleben'' (''Grzimek's Animal Life'') in 1967-1972; it was translated into [[English language|English]] in 1972-75. The encyclopedia was an international collaboration by a large number of scientists including [[Theodor Haltenorth]], [[Wolfgang Gewalt]], [[Heinz-Georg Klös]], [[Konrad Lorenz]], [[Heinz Heck]], [[Lutz Heck]], [[Jean Dorst]], [[Constantine Walter Benson]], [[Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt]], [[Helmut Sick]], [[Heini Hediger]], [[Wolfgang Makatsch]], [[Erich Thenius]], [[Erna Mohr]], [[Adolf Portmann]], [[Nagamichi Kuroda]], [[Lester L. Short]], [[Gerlof Fokko Mees]], and [[Andrew John Berger]]. It was later extensively updated and republished in a 17-volume second edition under the supervision of [[Michael Hutchins]] in 2003. Some university libraries offer access to a digitized version of the second edition. The German edition also published three supplementary volumes: ''Entwicklungsgeschichte der Lebewesen'' (''History of Life''), ''Verhaltensforschung'' (''Behavioural Research'') and ''Unsere Umwelt als Lebensraum - Ökologie'' (''Our Environment as Living Space - Ecology'').

'''Harriet White Fisher Andrew''' was an American known for being the first woman to circle the globe in a [[Locomobile Company of America|Locomobile]].

== Birth and early life ==
Harriet White was born in [[Crawford County, Pennsylvania]] on March 31, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Passport Application, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington D.C.; Roll #: 97; Volume #: Roll 0097 - Certificates: 16331-17230, 22 Nov 1909-20 Dec 1909&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the daughter of Oscar A. White and Hannah Fisher, and was educated at The Young Women's Classical Seminary in [[Cleveland Ohio]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Universal Woman&lt;/em&gt;, The Los Angeles Times, 20 September 1914, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the [[Johnstown Flood]] she took care of victims.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fisher-White&lt;/em&gt;, The New York Times, 30 July 1898, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wu Tingfang]], Chinese diplomat and politician, called Mrs. Harriet White Fisher "The most wonderful woman in America."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wu Tin Fang, Chinese Minister, Pays Tribute to Mrs. Fisher&lt;/em&gt;, Trenton Evening News, 13 July 1908, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriages ==
Her first known marriage was to Clark Fisher.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clark Fisher Married&lt;/em&gt;. Trenton Evening Times, 29 July 1898, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; They were married in [[London]], [[England]] on July 20, 1898. The report of their marriage in the ''[[Trenton Evening Times]]'' states the bride's name as Mrs. White, a widow who moved to [[Flushing, Queens]] in 1896. However, a later interview of Harriet Fisher, stated she was a "White" by birth and her mother was distantly related to her husband.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Fisher died in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/36338257/clark-fisher|title=Clark Fisher (1835-1903) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=Findagrave.com|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married again on April 27, 1912 to Sylvan Alfredo Andrew, an officer in the [[Argentine Navy]], in [[Manhattan]]. It was described as a quiet ceremony in the press because the groom's brother had died on the ''[[Titanic]]'' a few days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Harriet Fisher Weds&lt;/em&gt;, ''[[The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]'', 30 April 1912, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Train accident ==
On October 8, 1902 two [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] passenger trains collided in [[Menlo Park, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Killed, Twelve Hurt In Pennsylvania Wreck&lt;/em&gt;, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 8 October 1902, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Harriet Fisher was severely injured. A report of her injuries stated she was in [[Presbyterian Hospital (New York City)]] for eight weeks, hospitalized with fractured hips, spinal injury, and internal injury.&lt;ref&gt;''The Central New Jersey Home News'', 23 January 1903, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steel industry ==
After her husband's death, Harriet Fisher took over the management of Eagle Steel Works (later named Fisher &amp; Norris Anvil Works) in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. She was the only woman member of the [[National Association of Manufacturers]]. She is quoted in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1911, describing her involvement in the business: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though I liked machinery even when a child," said Mrs. Fisher, "it was my husband's illness and the desire which every woman has to help in an emergency that led me to enter the Eagle Works, of which Mr. Fisher was the head. I went in as the 'boss'; but I soon learned that if I was to be respected by my employees, I would have to know more than they did. To this end, I began as a regular apprentice, learned to temper steel, chisel the face of an anvil, mold vises and make rails. In fact, I took a complete course in every department of the business, from melting pig-iron to bidding for contracts. Before I was through, I learned really to love the work with iron and steel, the whir of the machinery, and the sound of the forge."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Clark Fisher, Ironmistress&lt;/em&gt;, The Washington Post, Women Who Count 22 October 1911, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Her wealth was reported at $2,000,000 in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rich Woman's Auto Kills Laborer&lt;/em&gt;, The Chicago Tribune, 7 April 1906, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; "She underbid her rivals on part of the Panama Canal equipment and has made $1,000,000 on that feature of her plan's output." &lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woman Iron Founder is Admired in China&lt;/em&gt;, The Coffeyville Daily Journal, 15 January 1912, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== First woman to drive around the world ==
Initial reports prior to her setting off on the journey revealed her car was built in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], it was 40 [[Horsepower]] with no special equipment. It was a four-seater and her planned companions were Harold Fisher Brooks (a relative), a chef named Albert, and a maid. She also traveled with a pet monkey, a [[Bull Terrier]] and a [[Pug]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Woman Makes World Tour With Pets in Automobile&lt;/em&gt;, The San Francisco Call, 18 June 1910, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The planned route was to ship the car to England, travel to her Italian villa at [[Lake Como]], and then on through [[Egypt]], [[Russia]], [[India]], towards their final destination of [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Daring Woman to Circle Globe in Auto&lt;/em&gt;The Indianapolis Start, 27 June 1909, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; A bon voyage party was announced in July 1909 at the Automobile Club of America&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Fisher Will Tour Around The World in a Locomobile&lt;/em&gt;, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 13 July 1909, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;and the party set off on July 19, 1909.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Around The World By Auto&lt;/em&gt;, The New York Times, 17 August 1910, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that she arrived at Lake Como by November 1909.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Clark Fisher Had Great Trip in Locomobile&lt;/em&gt;, The Trenton Evening Times, 20 November 1909, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary newspaper account, stated that Fisher and her entourage had completed their journey to their destination of Japan and that the travelers and the vehicle were back in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is Now On Final Lap of Trip Around The World&lt;/em&gt;, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 3 July 1910&lt;/ref&gt; She arrived in [[Tarrytown, New York]] on August 16, 1910, completing her journey around the world.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Fisher Back&lt;/em&gt;, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 16 August 1910, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher wrote a book about her adventure titled ''A Woman's World Tour in A Motor''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Woman's World Tour in a Motor'', by Harriet White Fisher, published 1911 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hellenic Trench''' is a hemispherical-scale long narrow depression in the [[Ionian Sea]].

The [[hadal zone]] of the Hellenic trench is roughly {{nowrap|4,150 metres (13,615 feet)}} to 5,300 metres (17,388 feet) deep. The names of the three major parts of the Hellenic trench are: Matapan Deep System or Matapan–Vavilov Deep, roughly {{nowrap|5,120 meters (16,797 feet)}}, the Kithera–Antikithera System, {{nowrap|4,615 metres (15,141 feet)}}, and the Zakinthos–Strofadhes system, {{nowrap|4,150 metres (13,615 feet)}}.

The [[Calypso Deep]], located in the Hellenic Trench, is roughly {{nowrap|5,267 metres (17,280 feet)}} deep and is the deepest point in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The Hellenic trench region is an ecosystem to [[sperm whale]]s and other aquatic life and has been used by [[Marine biology|marine biologists]] to study the behaviour of various aquatic species.

This is the trench where several earthquakes, including the [[365 Crete earthquake]], occurred.

'''The [[Holocene]] glacial retreat''' is a geographical phenomenon that involved the global [[deglaciation]] of glaciers that previously had advanced during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. Ice sheet retreat initiated ca. 19,000 years ago and accelerated after ca. 15,000 years ago.  The [[Holocene]], starting with abrupt warming 11,700 years ago, resulted in rapid melting of the remaining ice sheets of North America and Europe. The retreat of glaciers altered landscapes in many ways and is currently still acting as a result of climate change.

=== North America ===
The retreat of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] in Canada led to the formation of moraines and up to 26 [[proglacial lakes]] scattered throughout central Canada. The deglaciation occurred from the last glacial maximum (21,000 years ago) until about 7000 years ago. Some of the lakes the southern Ungava Bay area were fully deglaciated c. 6,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jansson|first=Krister N|date=2003-05-01|title=Early Holocene glacial lakes and ice marginal retreat pattern in Labrador/Ungava, Canada|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018203002621|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=193|issue=3|pages=473–501|doi=10.1016/s0031-0182(03)00262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Ohio River]] was formed when the river was temporarily dammed just southwest of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], creating a large lake until the dam burst. The Ohio River largely supplanted the former [[Teays River]] drainage system, which was disrupted by the glaciers.

Ancient [[Lake Chicago]], on the southern margin of the Wisconsin Glacier, found successive lower outlets as the glacier retreated, until the [[Saint Lawrence River]] route was uncovered. Corresponding to each level, remnant lake shore features may be found in many areas. One prehistoric shoreline is delineated by Bluff Avenue, a north-south street on the [[La Grange, Illinois]] east side.

The [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern Patagonian Icefield]] is one of the locations that experienced a surge in glacial activity during the neoglaciation period.

Within the last 30 years while most locations have experienced continue glacial retreat, glaciers located in the Southern Alps of New Zealand have advanced in position.

'''Ice crystals''' are solid [[ice]] exhibiting atomic ordering on various length scales and include [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] columns, hexagonal plates, [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendritic crystals]], and [[diamond dust]]. 

== Formation ==
The hugely symmetric shapes are due to [[Deposition (chemistry)|deposition]]al [[Crystal growth|growth]], namely, direct deposition of water vapour onto the ice crystal. Depending on environmental temperature and humidity, ice crystals can develop from the initial hexagonal prism into numerous symmetric shapes. Possible shapes for ice crystals are columns, [[Needle ice|needles]], plates and dendrites. If the crystal migrates into regions with different environmental conditions, the growth pattern may change, and the final crystal may show mixed patterns. Ice crystals tend to fall with their major axis aligned along the horizontal, and are thus visible in polarimetric weather radar signatures with enhanced (positive) differential reflectivity values. Electrification of ice crystals can induce alignments different from the horizontal. Electrified ice crystals are also well detectable by polarimetric weather radars.

[[Temperature]] and [[humidity]] determine many different crystalline forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46320998 |title=Fundamentals of Physics and Chemistry of the Atmosphere |last=Visconti |first=Guido |date=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3540674209 |location=Berlin |oclc=46320998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice crystals are responsible for various [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] optics displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28724110 |title=Atmospheric Halos |first=Walter |last=Tape |date=1994 |publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]] |isbn=9780875908342 |location=Washington, DC |oclc=28724110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ice cloud]]s are composed of ice crystals, the most notable being [[cirrus cloud]]s and [[ice fog]]. The slight whitening of a clear blue sky caused by ice crystals high in the [[troposphere]] can be a sign that a [[weather front]] (and [[rain front|rain]]) is approaching, as moist air is carried to high levels and freezes to ice crystals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Square crystals ===
Square ice crystals form at room temperature when squeezed between two layers of [[graphene]]. The material is a new crystalline phase of ice, joining 17 others. The research derived from the earlier discovery that [[water vapor]] and liquid water could pass through laminated sheets of [[graphene oxide]], unlike smaller molecules such as [[helium]]. The effect is thought to be driven by the [[van der Waals force]], which may involve more than 10,000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] of pressure.&lt;ref name=graphene /&gt;

'''Jacques l'Hermite''' (c. 1582&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;June 2, 1624), sometimes also known as '''Jacques le Clerq''' {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[merchant]], [[explorer]] and [[admiral]] known for his journey around the globe with the [[Nassau Fleet]] (1623–1626) and for his blockade and raid on [[Callao]] in 1624 during that same voyage in which he also died. He served the [[Dutch East India Company]] as chief merchant in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] and [[Ambon Island]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The Chilean [[Hermite Islands]] near [[Cape Horn]] which his fleet charted in February 1624 are named after him.

==Personal life==
L'Hermite was born in [[Antwerp]], [[Dutch Republic]] (present-day Belgium) around the year 1582. After the [[Fall of Antwerp (1584–1585)|fall of Antwerp]] in 1585 in a battle with the [[Spanish Empire]], the family moved north to [[Amsterdam]] and later settled in [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref name="hunt54"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Brederode, van |first= Willem |title= Op jacht naar Spaans zilver, het scheepsjournaal van Willem van Brederode |publisher= Uitgeverij Verloren |date= 2008 |isbn= 978-90-8704-047-5 |page= |pages= 54–55|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the Republic in 1606 and spent the next six years working in the Dutch East Indies.

==Professional life==
In 1606 l'Hermite set sail to the [[Dutch East Indies]] as a secretary on the fleet commanded by Admiral [[Cornelis Matelief de Jonge|Cornelis Matelief Jr.]] where in 1607 he was appointed chief merchant on the ''Black Lion'' ({{lang-nl|Swarte Leeuw}}). From 1607–1611 l'Hermite was chief merchant ({{lang-nl|opperkoopman}}) for the Dutch East India Company in Bantam, Dutch East Indies. After six years working abroad he returned to Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref name="hunt54" /&gt; There he married Theodora van Wely in March 1613.&lt;ref&gt;New Dutch Biographic Dictionary, [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu05_01/molh003nieu05_01_0316.htm Hermite, Jr. Jacques l'], retrieved May 19, 2009. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1623 l'Hermite was commissioned by Prince [[Maurice of Nassau]] and the Dutch State General to lead a fleet of eleven ships known as the ''Nassau Fleet'' ({{lang-nl|Nassausche vloot}}) with its flagship ''Amsterdam''. The fleet set sail on a circumnavigational voyage westwards from Amsterdam to the western coast of [[South America]] with the objective to hunt down Spanish silver ships leaving [[Peru]] and to establish a Dutch colony in either Peru or Chile, at that time known as the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].&lt;ref name="Gerhard"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Gerhard |first= Peter |title= Pirates of New Spain 1575–1742 |publisher= [[Courier Dover Publications]] |date= 2003 |isbn= 0-486-42611-4 |page= |pages= 123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commanded by Admiral l'Hermite, the fleet was ''de facto'' led by his Vice-Admiral [[Gheen Huygen Schapenham]] and Rear-Admiral Julius Wilhelm Van Verschoor after l'Hermite like most of its crew suffered from [[dysentery]]&lt;ref name="Trouw"&gt;''[[Trouw]]'' newspaper archive, [http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/1994/10/08/2651188/HAD_HERMITE_GEWONNEN__DAN_SPRAK_PERU_NU_NEDERLANDS.html Had Hermite gewonnen, dan sprak Peru nu Nederlands], retrieved May 19, 2009. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the journey.

[[Image:PICT0510 - Largo di Torre Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|Temple of Juturna in [[Largo di Torre Argentina]], Rome.]]

In the [[Roman mythology|myth]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religion of ancient Rome]], '''Juturna''' was a [[List of Roman deities|goddess]] of fountains, [[water well|wells]] and [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the mother of [[Fontus]] by [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Juturna}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] turned her into a water [[nymph]] – a [[Naiad]] – and gave her a sacred well in [[Lavinium]], [[Latium]], as well as another one near the temple to [[Vesta (god)|Vesta]] in the [[Forum Romanum]]. The pool next to the second well was called [[Lacus Juturnae]]. A local water nymph or river-god generally presides over a single body of water, but Juturna has broader powers which probably reflect her original importance in Latium, where she had temples in Rome and Lavinium, a cult of healthful waters at Ardea, and the fountain/well next to the lake in the Roman forum. It was here in Roman legend that the deities Castor and Pollux watered their horses after bringing news of the Roman victory at the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC (Valerius Maximus, I.8.1; Plutarch, Life of Aemilius Paulus, 25.2, Life of Coriolanus, 3.4).

Virgil makes her a sister of [[Turnus]] who supported him against [[Aeneas]] by giving him his sword after he dropped it in battle, as well as taking him away from the battle when it seemed he would be killed. In the end, however, she could not save him from his fate, and retreated into her waters in mourning. Ovid relates her affair with Jupiter (Greek Zeus): the secret was betrayed by another nymph, [[Larunda]], whom Jupiter struck with muteness as punishment. Juturna is further hellenized by Juno’s conferral of catasterism (Aen. 12.143, 145), an act that links her with the Dioscuri. These divinities all share a similar function as helpers of mortals and had traditional cultic connections in early Latium.

Holloway has argued that the goddess shown carrying a winged helmet on early Roman coinage is Juturna, but her iconography is largely unknown. A later altar relief from the Temple of Castor and Pollux in the Roman Forum may depict her. A Roman festival was held in her honor on January 11, when she was given sacrifices and honored by the ''fontani'' (the men who maintained the fountains and aqueducts of Rome).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2029">The '''kilocalorie per mole''' is a unit to measure an amount of [[energy]] per number of [[molecule]]s, [[atom]]s, or other similar [[particle]]s.  It is defined as one [[kilocalorie]] of energy (1000 thermochemical gram [[calorie]]s) per one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, that is, per [[Avogadro’s number]] of particles.  It is abbreviated "kcal/mol" or "kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;". As typically measured, one kcal/mol represents a temperature increase of one degree Celsius in one liter of water (with a mass of 1kg) resulting from the reaction of one mole of reagents.

In [[SI units]], one kilocalorie per mole is equal to 4.184 [[joule per mole|kilojoules per mole]], or {{Val|6.9477|e=-21}} [[joule]]s per molecule, or 0.043&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt|eV]] per molecule. At room temperature (25&amp;nbsp;°C, 77&amp;nbsp;°F, or 298.15&amp;nbsp;K) it is equal to 1.688 [[kT (energy)|units in the ''kT'' term]] of [[Boltzmann's equation]].

Even though it is not an SI unit, the kilocalorie per mole is still widely used in [[chemistry]]&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt; for [[thermodynamics|thermodynamical]] quantities such as [[thermodynamic free energy]], [[heat of vaporization]], [[heat of fusion]] and [[ionization energy]], due to the ease with which it can be calculated based on the units of measure typically employed in quantifying a chemical reaction, especially in aqueous solution.  Typically but not exclusively, kcal/mol are used in the United States, whereas kJ/mol are preferred elsewhere.

The '''krytron''' is a [[cold-cathode]] [[gas-filled tube]] intended for use as a very high-speed [[switch]], somewhat similar to the [[thyratron]]. It consists of a sealed glass tube with four [[electrode]]s. A small triggering pulse on the [[control grid|grid]] electrode switches the tube on, allowing a large current to flow between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] electrodes. The vacuum version is called a '''vacuum krytron''', or '''sprytron'''. The krytron was one of the earliest developments of the [[EG&amp;G Corporation]].

==Description==
Unlike most other gas switching tubes, the krytron conducts by means of an [[electric arc|arc discharge]], to handle very high voltages and currents (reaching several kilovolts and several kiloamperes), rather than the low-current [[electric glow discharge|glow discharge]] used in other [[thyratron]]s. The krytron is a development of the [[Spark gap|triggered spark gap]]s and [[thyratron]]s originally developed for [[radar]] transmitters during [[World War II]].

The gas used in krytrons is [[hydrogen]];&lt;ref name="ch4"&gt;[http://gabrielse.physics.harvard.edu/gabrielse/papers/1990/1990_fei/fei.html "Trapping Low Energy in an Ion Trap"] Harvard Ph.D. Thesis of Xiang Fei (Defended 10 May 1990), [http://gabrielse.physics.harvard.edu/gabrielse/papers/1990/1990_fei/chapter_4.pdf Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt; [[noble gas]]es (usually [[krypton]]), or a [[Penning mixture]] can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconinvestigations.com/KRYT/Krytron.HTM Silicon Investigations Pulse Power Switching &amp; EG&amp;G Krytron Tube Replacement Page]. Siliconinvestigations.com (2010-02-22). Retrieved on 2010-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Krytron.svg|left|200px|Diagram of a Krytron]]
A krytron has four [[electrode]]s. Two are a conventional [[anode]] and [[cathode]]. One is a keep-alive electrode, arranged to be close to the cathode. The keep-alive has a low positive voltage applied, which causes a small area of gas to ionize near the cathode. High voltage is applied to the anode, but primary conduction does not occur until a positive pulse is applied to the trigger electrode ("Grid" in the image above). Once started, arc conduction carries a considerable current.

The fourth is a control grid, usually wrapped around the anode, except for a small opening on its top.&lt;ref name="tubecol"/&gt;

In place of or in addition to the keep-alive electrode some krytrons may contain a very tiny amount of radioactive material (usually less than {{convert|5|uCi|kBq|lk=on}} of [[isotopes of nickel|nickel-63]]), which emits [[beta particle]]s (high-speed [[electron]]s) to make [[ionization]] easier. The radiation source serves to increase the reliability of ignition and formation of the keep-alive electrode discharge.

The gas filling provides ions for neutralizing the [[space charge]] and allowing high currents at lower voltage.&lt;ref name="tubecol"&gt;[http://www.tubecollector.org/krytron.htm Krytron information on ''Tube Collector'' site]&lt;/ref&gt; The keep-alive discharge populates the gas with ions, forming a preionized plasma; this can shorten the arc formation time by 3–4 orders of magnitude in comparison with non-preionized tubes, as time does not have to be spent on ionizing the medium during formation of the arc path.&lt;ref name="pulse"/&gt;

The electric arc is self-sustaining; once the tube is triggered, it conducts until the arc is interrupted by the current falling too low for too long (under 10 milliamperes for more than 100 microseconds for the KN22 krytrons).&lt;ref name="ch4"/&gt;

Krytrons and sprytrons are triggered by a high voltage from a [[capacitor]] discharge via a trigger [[transformer]], in a similar way [[flashtube]]s for e.g. [[photoflash]] applications are triggered. Devices integrating a krytron with a trigger transformer are available.&lt;ref name="pulse"/&gt;

===Sprytron===
A '''sprytron''', also known as '''vacuum krytron''' or '''triggered vacuum switch''' ('''TVS'''), is a vacuum, rather than gas-filled, version. It is designed for use in environments with high levels of [[ionizing radiation]], which might trigger a gas-filled krytron spuriously. It is also more immune to electromagnetic interference than gas filled tubes.

Sprytrons lack the keepalive electrode and the preionization radioactive source. The trigger pulse must be stronger than for a krytron. Sprytrons are able to handle higher currents; krytrons tend to be used for triggering a secondary switch, e.g., a [[triggered spark gap]], while sprytrons are usually connected directly to the load.

The trigger pulse has to be much more intense, as there is no preionized gas path for the electric current, and a [[vacuum arc]] must form between the cathode and anode. An arc first forms between the cathode and the grid, then a breakdown occurs between the cathode–grid conductive region and the anode.&lt;ref name="pulse"&gt;[http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/pulse.html#krytron Pulse Power Switching Devices]. Electricstuff.co.uk. Retrieved on 2010-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprytrons are evacuated to [[Vacuum#Measurement|hard vacuum]], typically 0.001 [[pascal (unit)|Pa]]. As [[kovar]] and other metals are somewhat permeable for hydrogen, especially during the 600&amp;nbsp;°C [[bake-out]] before evacuation and sealing, all external metal surfaces have to be plated with thick (25 micrometers or more) layer of soft [[gold]]. The same metallization is used for other switch tubes as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconinvestigations.com/KRYT/Sprytron.pdf Evaluation of non-cyanide gold plating process for switch tubes], Sandia Report, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprytrons are often designed similar to [[trigatron]]s, with the trigger electrode coaxial to the cathode. In one design the trigger electrode is formed as metallization on the inner surface of an [[alumina]] tube. The trigger pulse causes surface [[electric arc|flashover]], which liberates electrons and vaporized surface discharge material into the inter-electrode gap, which facilitates formation of a [[vacuum arc]], closing the switch. The short switching time suggests electrons from the trigger discharge and the corresponding [[secondary electron]]s knocked from the anode as the initiation of the switching operation; the vaporized material travels too slowly through the gap to play significant role. The repeatability of the triggering can be improved by special coating of the surface between the trigger electrode and the cathode, and the [[jitter]] can be improved by doping the trigger substrate and modifying the trigger probe structures. Sprytrons can degrade in storage, by [[outgassing]] from their components, diffusion of gases (especially hydrogen) through the metal components, and gas leaks through the [[hermetic seal]]s; an example tube manufactured with internal pressure of 0.001 Pa will exhibit spontaneous gap breakdowns when the pressure inside rises to 1 Pa. Accelerated testing of storage life can be done by storing in increased ambient pressure, optionally with added helium, for leak testing, and increased temperature storage (150 &amp;deg;C) for outgassing testing. Sprytrons can be made miniaturized and rugged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e2v.com/resources/account/download-literature/66], Miniature triggered vacuum switches for precise initiation of insensitive loads in demanding environments, e2v 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprytrons can be also triggered by a [[laser]] pulse. In 1999 the laser pulse energy needed to trigger a sprytron was reduced to 10 microjoules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/nuke-stockpile.htm Stockpile Stewardship and Management ? United States Nuclear Forces]. Globalsecurity.org. Retrieved on 2010-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprytrons are usually manufactured as rugged metal/[[ceramic]] parts. They typically have low [[inductance]] (10 nano[[henry (unit)|henries]]) and low electrical resistance when switched on (10–30 milli[[ohm]]s). After triggering, just before the sprytron switches fully on in avalanche mode, it briefly becomes slightly conductive (100–200 amperes); high-power [[MOSFET]] transistors operating in avalanche mode show similar behavior. [[SPICE]] models for sprytrons are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10170107-jiZVdO/native/10170107.pdf Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information – Sponsored by OSTI]. Osti.gov (2010-05-28). Retrieved on 2010-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
This design, dating from the late 1940s, is still capable of pulse-power performance that even the most advanced semiconductors (even [[IGBT]]s) cannot match easily. Krytrons and sprytrons are capable of handling high-current high-voltage pulses, with very fast switching times, and constant, low [[jitter]] time delay between application of the trigger pulse and switching on.

Krytrons can switch currents of up to about 3000 amperes and voltages up to about 5000 volts. Commutation time of less than 1 nanosecond can be achieved, with a delay between the application of the trigger pulse and switching as low as about 30 nanoseconds. The achievable [[jitter]] may be below 5 nanoseconds. The required trigger pulse voltage is about 200–2000 volts; higher voltages decrease the switching delay to some degree.  Commutation time can be somewhat shortened by increasing the trigger pulse rise time. A given krytron tube will give very consistent performance to identical trigger pulses (low jitter).&lt;ref name="pulse"/&gt; The keep-alive current ranges from tens to hundreds of microamperes. The pulse repetition rate can range from one per minute to tens of thousands per minute.&lt;ref name="tubecol"/&gt;

Switching performance is largely independent of the environment (temperature, acceleration, vibration, etc.). However, the formation of the keep-alive glow discharge is more sensitive, which necessitates the use of a radioactive source to aid its ignition.

Krytrons have a limited lifetime, ranging, according to type, typically from tens of thousands to tens of millions of switching operations, and sometimes only a few hundreds.&lt;ref name="tubecol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pulse"/&gt;

Sprytrons have somewhat faster switching times than krytrons.

Hydrogen-filled thyratrons may be used as a replacement in some applications.

==Applications==
Krytrons and their variations are manufactured by [[Perkin-Elmer]] Components and used in a variety of industrial and military devices. They are best known for their use in igniting [[exploding-bridgewire detonator|exploding-bridgewire]] and [[slapper detonator]]s in [[nuclear weapon]]s, their original application, either directly (sprytrons are usually used for this) or by triggering higher-power [[spark gap]] switches. They are also used to trigger [[thyratron]]s, large [[flashlamp]]s in [[photocopier]]s, [[laser]]s and scientific apparatus, and for firing ignitors for industrial [[explosive]]s.

==Export restrictions in USA==
Because of their potential for use as triggers of nuclear weapons, the export of krytrons is tightly [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations|regulated]] in the United States. A number of cases involving the [[smuggling]] or attempted smuggling of krytrons have been reported, as countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons have attempted to procure supplies of krytrons for igniting their weapons. One prominent case was that of [[1985: The Year of the Spy#Richard Kelly Smyth | Richard Kelly Smyth]], who allegedly helped [[Arnon Milchan]] smuggle 15 orders of 810 krytrons total to Israel.&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/farr.htm|title=Israel's Nuclear Weapons|work=fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 469 of these were returned to America, with Israel claiming the remaining 341 were "destroyed in testing".&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

Krytrons and sprytrons handling voltages of 2,500&amp;nbsp;V and above, currents of 100&amp;nbsp;A and above, and switching delays of under 10 microseconds are typically suitable for nuclear weapon triggers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B4zSFd8DRWYC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=sprytron+vacuum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RHgUQFhYB0&amp;sig=hDvgFD1CLECWYnpyD-x36tABaMc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QcfIS9H2NJb00gS2jrzXDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=45&amp;ved=0CH8Q6AEwLDiWAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sprytron%20vacuum&amp;f=false Technologies underlying weapons of mass destruction] DIANE Publishing {{ISBN|1-4289-2110-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A krytron was the "[[MacGuffin]]" in Roman Polanski's 1988 film [[Frantic (film)|''Frantic'']]. The device in the film was either a high-tech updated version or simply a fictionalized version made up for the story. 

The krytron, incorrectly called a "kryton", also appeared in the [[Tom Clancy]] nuclear terrorism novel ''[[The Sum of All Fears]]''.

The plot of [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]]' book ''The Road to Armageddon'' revolved heavily around American-made krytrons that Iranian mullahs wanted for three Russian nuclear artillery shells they had hoped to upgrade to full nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Collins. ''The Road to Armageddon''. New Millennium. 2003. {{ISBN|1-932407-09-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "krytron" appeared in the season 3, episode 14 of the television drama ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]''.

In Season 3 of [[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]] episode "Kill Ari, Part 2", it was revealed that Ari Haswari, a rogue Mossad operative, had been tasked with acquiring a krytron trigger. Along with stolen plutonium from Dimona, these were key components for an Israeli sting operation. The krytron was also incorrectly called a "kryton".

==Further developments==
Optically triggered solid-state switches based on [[diamond]] are a potential candidate for krytron replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oWXDSWd8NPkC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=sprytron&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false CVD Diamond for Electronic Devices and Sensors] by Ricardo S.

{{Chinese folk religion}}
The '''Kunlun''' ({{CJKV|t=崑崙|s=昆仑|p=Kūnlún|w=K'un-lun}}) or '''Kunlun Shan''' is a mountain or mountain range in [[Chinese mythology]], an important symbol representing the ''[[axis mundi]]'' and [[divinity]].

The mythological Kunlun is based partially on the Kailash temple and partially on the [[Kunlun Mountains]] of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. Different locations of the Kunlun have been given in the various legends, myths, and semi-historical accounts in which it appears. These accounts typically describe Kunlun as the dwelling place of various gods and goddesses, where fabled plants and mythical creatures may also be found. Many important events in Chinese mythology took place on the Kunlun.{{sfn|Yang|2005|pp=160-164}}

==Historical development==
As the mythology related to the Kunlun developed, it became influenced by the later introduction of ideas about an ''[[axis mundi]]'' from the [[cosmology]] of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) [[Sumeru|Mount Sumeru]].{{sfn|Christie|1968|p=74}}

Another historical development in the mythology of Kunlun, (again with Indian influence) was that rather than just being the source of the [[Yellow River]], Kunlun began to be considered to be the source of four major rivers flowing to the four quarters of the compass.{{sfn|Christie|1968|p=74}}

The Kunlun mythos was also influenced by developments within the [[Taoism|Taoist]] tradition, and Kunlun came to be perceived more as a paradise than a dangerous wilderness.{{sfn|Christie|1968|p=75}}

Some recent research proposed that over time, the merging of various traditions has result in a duality of paradises – an East Paradise (identified with [[Mount Penglai]]) and a West Paradise, with Kunlun Mountain identified as the West Paradise. A pole replaced a former mythic system which opposed Penglai with Guixu ("Returning Mountain"), and the Guixu mythological material was transferred to the Kunlun mythos.{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=163}}

==Name==
{{See also|Gunung}}
The Chinese name "Kunlun" 崑崙 (or 崐崘) is written with characters combining the "[[Radical 46|mountain radical]]" 山 with phonetics of ''kun'' 昆 and ''lun'' 侖. Alternate names for ''Kunlun shan'' include Kunling 崑陵 (with "hill") and Kunqiu 崑丘 (with "mound").

The term "Kunlun" may be semantically related to two other terms: ''[[Hundun]]'' ({{CJKV|t=混沌|s=混沌|p=hùndùn|w=hun-t'un|l=primal chaos" or "muddled confusion}}), which is sometimes personified as a living creature; and ''kongdong'' ({{CJKV|t=空洞|s=空洞|w=k'ung-t'ung|p=kōngdòng|l=grotto of vacuity}}), according to Kristofer Schipper. [[Grotto-heavens]] were traditionally associated with mountains, as hollows or caves located in/on certain mountains. The term "Kunlun Mountain" can be translated as "Cavernous Mountain": and, the mythological Kunlun mountain has been viewed as a hollow mountain (located directly under the [[Pole star]]).{{sfn|Schipper|1978|pp=365-366}}

The term "Kunlun" however had also been used in old texts to refer to people and places unrelated to the mythical mountain. It was, for example, used to transcribe the southern people called ''Gurong'', who were slaves in China. [[Edward H. Schafer]] quotes the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' description. "They are also called Kurung. They are the barbarous men of the islands, great and small, of the Southern Seas. They are very black, and expose their naked Figures. They can tame and cow ferocious beasts, rhinoceroses, elephants, and the like."{{sfn|Schafer|1985|p=290}} Schafer notes that besides ''Kunlun'', these southerners were occasionally written ''Gulong'' 古龍 or ''Gulun'' 骨論.

Julie Wilensky notes that the term ''Kunlun'' is a "mysterious and poorly understood word first applied to dark-skinned Chinese and then expanded over time to encompass multiple meanings, all connoting dark skin."{{sfn|Wilensky|2002|p=2}} But then she goes on to say, "These uses of kunlun are unrelated to the name of the Kunlun Mountains." And in a footnote to this, " Chang Hsing-Iang writes that the Kunlun mountain 'region has been familiar to the Chinese from the earliest times, and no Chinese work has ever described its inhabitants as being black-skinned.'"{{sfn|Wilensky|2002|p= 4}} She then goes on to say how "Kunlun" was used to refer to places in Southeast Asia and Africa.{{sfn|Wilensky|2002|pp= 6-7, 27-29}}

==Location==
Various ideas of the location of the mythical Kunlun Mountain have been given: chapter eleven of the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' describes it as being in the northwest, chapter sixteen says it is south of the western sea, and other sources place it in the center of the earth.{{sfn|Yang|2005|pp=160-164}}

Some believed Kunlun to be located to the "far" west, in this case the alleged location was relocated further and further to the west, along with advances in geographical knowledge.{{sfn|Christie|1968|p=74}} E. T. C. Werner identifies Kunlun with the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain range.{{sfn|Werner|1994|p=16}}

At times, the mythical Kunlun Mountain has been confused with the modern [[Kunlun Mountains]] and with Kurung (or ''Kurung Bnam'', possibly meaning "Kings of the Mountain" in [[Khmer language|Old Khmer]] (formerly known as Old Cambodian), and equivalent to the [[Sanskrit]] ''Śailarāja'', also meaning "Kings of the Mountain", referring to a mythical holy cosmic mountain. Kurung (Kunlun) is known to have flourished during the time of the [[Tang dynasty]], and seems to have developed ambassadorial relations with the Tang court, by the time of [[Li He]] (790–816), who records a visit in one of his extent poems: although  geographical specifics of the state of Kunlun's location(s) remain uncertain, it is associated with trans-Gangetic India, possibly the [[Malay peninsula]] or areas controlled by the [[Sailendra]] thalassocracy.{{sfn|Schafer|1985|pp=47-48}}

==Description==
Kunlun Mountain has been described in various texts, as well as being depicted in art. Sometimes Kunlun appears as a pillar of the sky (or earth), sometimes appearing as being composed of multiple tiers,{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=160}} with the commonality of "mystery, grandeur, or magnificence" being emphasized in the mythological descriptions. The base of the Kunlun Mountain is said to penetrate as far into the earth, as its above-ground part proceeds towards the sky.{{sfn|Christie|1968|p=74}}

Generally, accounts emphasize the difficulty of access to the mountain and even more to its more hallowed places, due to surrounding waters and steep cliffs of immense heights. Kunlun typically also has a strong association with various means to obtain immortality, or longevity. Poetic descriptions tend to lavish Kunlun with paradisaical detail: gem-like rocks and towering cliffs of jasper and jade, exotic jeweled plants, bizarrely formed and colored magical fungi, and numerous birds and other animals, together with [[xian (Taoism)|humans who have become immortal beings]]. Sometimes it is the [[Eight Immortals]] who are seen, coming to pay their respects to the goddess Xiwangmu, perhaps invited to join her in a feast of immortal repast. This is the well-worn image or motif that is frequently painted, carved, or otherwise depicted in the material arts.

===Association with divinity===
====Supreme Deity====
{{Further|Chinese theology|Heaven}}
Kunlun is believed to be the representation of the Supreme Deity (''Taidi''). According to some sources, his throne is at the top tier of the mountain and known as the "Palace of Heaven". As Kunlun was sometimes viewed as the pillar holding up the sky and keeping it separated from the earth, some accounts place the top of Kunlun in Heaven rather than locating it as part of the earth: in this case the Supreme Deity's abode on Kunlun is actually in Heaven, and Kunlun functions as a sort of ladder which could be used to travel between earth and Heaven. Accordingly, any person who succeeded in climbing up to the top of Kunlun would magically become an immortal spirit.{{sfn|Yang|2005|pp=160-162}}

====Xiwangmu====
{{Further|Xiwangmu|Sun Wukong}}
Although not originally located on Kunlun, but rather on a [[Jade Mountain (mythology)|Jade Mountain]] neighboring to the north (and west of the [[Moving Sands]]), Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of Meng Hao in the West, in later accounts was relocated to a palace protected by golden ramparts, within which immortals ([[xian (Taoism)|xian]]) feasted on bear paws, monkey lips, and the livers of dragons, served at the edge of the Lake of Gems. Every 6000 years the peaches which conferred immortality upon those who ate them would be served (except the time when they were purloined by [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]). Originally a plague deity with tiger teeth and leopard tail, she became a beautiful and well-mannered goddess responsible for guarding the herb of immortality.{{sfn|Christie|1968|pp=78-79}}

====Yu Shi====
{{Further|Yu Shi}}
Yu Shi, a Chinese spirit or god of rain, also known as the "Lord of Rain" or "Leader of Rain" is thought to have his dwelling place upon the Kunlun slopes. During the reign of [[Shennong]], a certain Chisongzi (Master Red Pine) performed a rain-making ceremony which successfully ended a terrible drought, leading to his promotion to "[[Yu Shi]]", "Master of Rain".{{sfn|Christie|1968|p=75}}

====Shamans====
{{Further|Wu (shaman)|List of wu shamans}}
According to the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'', the top of Kunlun is the habitation of shamans, depicting Wu Peng holding the herb of immortality there, in the company of five other shamans.{{sfn|Hawks|2011|p=45}}

====''Xian''====
{{Further|Xian (Taoism)}}
In later tradition Kunlun was pictured as a Daoist paradise, inhabited by ''xian'', or Daoist immortals (humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form), which was presided over by Xiwangmu. The ''xian'' were often seen as temporary residents, who visited by means of flying on the back of a [[crane in Chinese mythology|magical crane]] or dragon.

===Creatures===
Kunlun has a lively bestiary, with various more-or-less fantastic beasts and birds described as present in its environs. Often the tiger or beings with tiger-like features are associated with Kunlun, since the tiger is symbolic of the west, as Kunlun is often associated with the Western Paradise.{{sfn|Christie|1968|p=34}} Creatures symbolic of immortality are often seen or described in depictions of Kunlun, such as [[deer]] or [[Crane (bird)|cranes]]. Xiwangmu is often identified as having a pet spotted deer. Besides the cranes (traditionally thought of as the mounts or the transformations of immortals), other birds come and go from the mountain, flying errands for Xiwangmu: these blue (or green) birds are her [[qingniao]]. Sometimes the poets claim to have received a happy inspiration during a visit by one of these birds, carrying a message from Xiwangmu.

===Plants===
The flora of Kunlun and its environs is in keeping with the rest of its natural (and supernatural qualities), and includes the Pearl and Jade Trees, the Tree of Immortality, and Tree Grain, the last of which (''Muhe'') was forty feet in height and five spans in thickness.{{sfn|Yang|2005|p=160}} [[Peach]]es are (and have been) often associated with Xiwangmu {{sfn|Eberhard|2003|p=320}} The ''[[langgan]]'' was a tree of fairy gems in colours of blue or green, which was reported to grow on Kunlun in the classic books of the Zhou and early Han dynasties.{{sfn|Schafer|1963|p=246}}

===Palaces and Gardens===
Kunlun is described as having various structures, areas, or significant features either on or around the area of the mountain. The palace of Xiwangmu, sometimes described as having golden ramparts, was located on Kunlun: those blessed to gather there might partake of the fruit of longevity.{{sfn|Christie|1968|p=72}} Often her palace is described as having a park or garden, bordering a Jasper Pool. Of gardens, a (the) Hanging Garden was referenced early on.

===Rivers and Sands===
Four rivers were sometimes said to flow out of Kunlun Mountain: the [[Red River (mythology)|Red River]] (Chishui, 赤水), the Yellow River, the Black River (黑水, black water), and the Yang River (Yang 2005: 161). A fifth river was said to flow around the base of Kunlun, which rose in a way which was particularly steep and hard to climb. This [[Weak River]] at the base of Kunlun flowed with a liquid so lacking in density that not even a feather could float upon it. This was a major obstacle, since it could neither be swum or floated over on a vessel (Yang 2005: 162, 219). However, this was an obstacle routinely overcome by those practiced in the way of magic (Daoist or shamanic). Two examples of those who overcame were [[Sun Wukong]] (''[[Journey to the West]]'') or [[Qu Yuan]] in his poem  ("[[Li Sao]]"), both already on the path to immortality, one as a god and the other as a poet. Another barrier to Kunlun were the dangerous and difficult-to-cross [[Moving Sands]], also known as Flowing Sands or Liusha. According to ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (Chapter 16), Kunlun was located south of the West Sea, behind the Red River, and on the shore of Liusha (Yang 2005: 162, 219).

==Events==
Kunlun Mountain is a major scene of action in various myths, as well as literary works derived from the myths, legends, or religious descriptions or depictions.

===Marriage of Nüwa and Fuxi===
{{Main|Nüwa|Fuxi}}
Fuxi and Nuwa's marriage took place on the mountain of Kunlun. Generally held to be  brother and sister, and the last surviving human beings after a catastrophic flood, the incest taboo was waived by an explicit sign after prayerful questioning of a divine being who approved their marriage and thus the repopulation of the world.

===Mu, Son of Heaven===
Mu son of Heaven is one visitor, carried along on his trip by eight extraordinary mounts, depicted in art as "weird and unworldly".{{sfn|Schafer|1963|p=59}}

==Cultural references==
Many important literary references and allusions to Kunlun Mountain are found in traditional works, including famous novels, poems, and theatrical pieces. It also appears in modern popular fictions.

===Novels===
Among other literature, Kunlun Mountain appears in ''[[Fengshen Bang|Fengshen Yanyi]]'', ''[[Legend of the White Snake]]'', the ''[[Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven]]'', ''[[Kunlun Nu]]'', and ''[[Journey to the West]]'' (also known as ''Monkey'').

===Theater===
The Kunlun Slave (slave from Kunlun) was a stock character in Chinese theater, and known in Japanese theater "Konron". He was portrayed as exotic in appearance, and possessed of superhuman powers. [[Mei Dingzuo]] (1549-1615) wrote a play "How the Kunlun Slave Became an Immortal".

===Poetry===
Kunlun Mountain is a subject of poetic allusion from the ancient poems "[[Li Sao]]" and "[[Heavenly Questions]]" by [[Qu Yuan]], through frequent mentions in the medieval [[Tang poetry|Tang dynasty poetry]], and, in the twentieth century in [[Poetry of Mao Zedong|Mao Zedong's]] 1935 poem "Kunlun".

===Modern popular culture===
Kunlun is used in the manga ''[[3×3 Eyes]]''.  The term, written as K'un-Lun, is also used in the story of the [[Iron Fist (comics) |Iron Fist]] in [[Marvel Comics]] as one of the seven Capital Cities of Heaven in the [[Features of the Marvel Universe|Marvel Universe]] that only appears on Earth periodically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/iron-fist-monastery-kun-lun/ |title= Iron Fist: K’un-Lun’s Monastery &amp; Danny’s Powers Explained |first=John |last=Casteele |date=March 18, 2017 |work=Screen Rant }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[volcanology]], a '''lava dome''' or '''volcanic dome''' is a roughly circular mound-shaped protrusion resulting from the slow [[eruption|extrusion]] of [[viscous]] [[lava]] from a [[volcano]]. Dome-building eruptions are common, particularly in convergent plate boundary settings&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780123859389000183|title=The Encyclopedia of Volcanoes|last=Calder|first=Eliza S.|last2=Lavallée|first2=Yan|last3=Kendrick|first3=Jackie E.|last4=Bernstein|first4=Marc|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780123859389|pages=343–362|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-385938-9.00018-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Around 6% of eruptions on earth are lava dome forming.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[geochemistry]] of lava domes can vary from [[basalt]] (e.g. [[Semeru]], 1946) to [[rhyolite]] (e.g. [[Chaitén (volcano)|Chaiten]], 2010) although the majority are of intermediate composition (such as [[Santa María (volcano)|Santiaguito]], [[dacite]]-[[andesite]], present day)&lt;ref name=eov&gt;{{Citation

This high viscosity can be obtained in two ways: by high levels of [[silicon dioxide|silica]] in the magma, or by [[degasification|degassing]] of fluid [[magma]]. Since viscous [[basalt]]ic and [[andesitic]] domes [[weathering|weather]] fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava, most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or [[dacite]].

==Dome dynamics==
[[File:MSH06 aerial crater from north high angle 09-12-06.jpg|right|thumb|Lava domes in the crater of [[Mount St. Helens]]]]
Lava domes evolve unpredictably, due to [[non-linear]] dynamics caused by [[crystallization]] and [[outgassing]] of the highly viscous lava in the dome's [[Magma|conduit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Nonlinear dynamics of lava dome extrusion|journal=Nature|volume=402|pages=37–41 |date=4 November 1999 |url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/EHaz/VolcanoInstability_class/melnik/melnik%20sparks%20nature.pdf|first1=O|last1=Melnik|first2=R. S. J. |last2=Sparks|doi=10.1038/46950|issue=6757|bibcode = 1999Natur.402...37M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Domes undergo various processes such as growth, collapse, solidification and [[erosion]].

Lava domes grow by [[Endogeny|endogenic]] dome growth or [[exogeny|exogenic]] dome growth. The former implies the enlargement of a lava dome due to the influx of magma into the dome interior, and the latter refers to discrete lobes of lava emplaced upon the surface of the dome&lt;ref name=eov /&gt; It is the high viscosity of the lava that prevents it from flowing far from the vent from which it extrudes, creating a dome-like shape of sticky lava that then cools slowly in-situ. [[Lava spine|Spines]] and [[Lava|lava flow]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are common extrusive products of lava domes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Domes may reach heights of several hundred meters, and can grow slowly and steadily for months (e.g. [[Unzen]] volcano), years (e.g. [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano), or even centuries (e.g. [[Mount Merapi]] volcano). The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the intermittent buildup of gas [[pressure]], erupting domes can often experience episodes of [[explosive eruption]] over time. If part of a lava dome collapses and exposes pressurized magma, [[pyroclastic flow]]s can be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Parfitt|first1=E.A.|last2=Wilson|first2=L|year=2008|title=Fundamentals of Physical Volcanology|location=Massachusetts, USA|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hazards associated with lava domes are the destruction of property from [[Lava|lava flow]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[forest fire]]s, and [[lahar]]s triggered from re-mobilization of loose ash and debris. Lava domes are one of the principal structural features of many [[stratovolcano]]es worldwide. Lava domes are prone to unusually dangerous explosions since they can contain rhyolitic [[silica]]-rich lava.

Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid [[seismicity]], which is attributed to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics of lava domes include their hemispherical dome shape, cycles of dome growth over long periods, and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Cryptodomes===
A '''cryptodome''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κρυπτός, ''kryptos'', "hidden, secret") is a dome-shaped structure created by accumulation of [[viscous]] [[magma]] at a shallow depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vsc/glossary/cryptodome.html |title=USGS: Volcano Hazards Program Glossary - Cryptodome |website=volcanoes.usgs.gov |access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a cryptodome was in the May [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]], where the explosive eruption began after a landslide caused the side of the volcano to fall, leading to explosive decompression of the subterranean cryptodome.&lt;ref name="CVOMountStHelens"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/st_helens/st_helens_geo_hist_99.html |title=USGS: Volcano Hazards Program CVO Mount St. Helens |website=volcanoes.usgs.gov |access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lava coulées===
[[File:Chao dacite domes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cerro Chao|Chao]] dacite coulée flow-domes (left center), northern Chile, viewed from [[Landsat 8]]. ]]
Coulées (or coulees) are lava domes that have experienced some flow away from their original position, thus resembling both lava domes and [[lava flows]].&lt;ref name="eov" /&gt;

The world's largest known [[dacite]] flow is the [[Cerro Chao|Chao dacite dome complex]], a huge coulée flow-dome between two volcanoes in northern [[Chile]]. This flow is over {{convert|14|km}} long, has obvious flow features like pressure ridges, and a flow front {{convert|400|m}} tall (the dark scalloped line at lower left).&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=82424 Chao dacite dome complex] at [[NASA Earth Observatory]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is another prominent coulée flow on the flank of [[Llullaillaco]] volcano, in [[Argentina]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/03/coulees/ Coulées!] by Erik Klemetti, an assistant professor of Geosciences at [[Denison University]].&lt;/ref&gt; and other examples in the [[Andes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1902">'''Liquefied natural gas terminal''' is a structure for [[liquefied natural gas]] to store. It can comprise special tanks, ships or even building structures. Port infrastructures and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] are also a part of LNG terminals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lei.lt/energy-security-conference/index_files/Masiulis.pdf LNEG terminal project in Lithuania]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquefied natural gas is the form used to transport natural gas over long distances, often by sea. In most cases, LNG terminals are purpose-built ports used exclusively to export or import LNG.

== Types ==
Liquefied natural gas terminals can be divided into two types: liquefaction terminals (export)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbi.com/markets/lng/liquefaction-export-terminals Liquefaction Export Terminals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209234600/http://www.cbi.com/markets/lng/liquefaction-export-terminals |date=2014-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[:ru:Регазификационный терминал сжиженного природного газа|regasification terminals]]&lt;sup&gt;RU&lt;/sup&gt; or receiving terminals (import).&lt;ref&gt;[http://total.com/en/energies-expertise/oil-gas/trading-shipping/fields-of-expertise/transportation-storage/regasification Regasification of LNG: Strategic Access to Markets ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== FSRU ===
A floating storage and regasification unit, or FSRU for short, is an LNG terminal whose main structure is a special ship that is moored next to the port. As of January 2014 there are operating FSRUs in [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Kuwait]], [[Israel]], the [[UAE]], [[Italy]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]] and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globallnginfo.com/World%20LNG%20Plants%20&amp;%20Terminals.pdf World's LNG Liquefaction Plants and Regasification Terminals]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27681">This '''list of largest universities by enrollment''' in the world includes total active enrollment across all campuses, as well as off-campus study. The enrollment numbers listed are the sum of [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] students in active enrollment. The universities included below confer degrees of bachelor-level or higher, and either share a central board of governance and a single chancellor or president, or confer degrees with the same institution name.

Many of these universities, particularly those in the United States, are actually systems of separate university campuses, and may not accurately represent a comparable student body. For example, the enrollment listed for the University of California is the population of the entire student body in the University of California system, which is composed of several individual campuses statewide. All University of California campuses are entitled "University of California" and then denoted further by the campus location, such as "University of California, Irvine". Other states organize their public universities differently in ways that further complicate any direct comparisons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22528">[[Russia]] can be divided into a [[Europe]]an and [[North Asia|an Asian part]]. The dividing line is generally considered to be the [[Ural Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. The European part is drained into the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Baltic Sea]], Black Sea, and Caspian Sea. The Asian part is drained into the Arctic Ocean and the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Notable rivers of Russia in Europe are the [[Volga]], [[Don River, Russia|Don]], [[Kama River|Kama]], [[Oka River|Oka]] and the [[Northern Dvina]], while several other rivers originate in Russia but flow into other countries, such as the [[Dniepr]] and the [[Western Dvina]].

In Asia, important rivers are the [[Ob River|Ob]], the [[Irtysh River|Irtysh]], the [[Yenisei River|Yenisey]], the [[Angara River|Angara]], the [[Lena River|Lena]], the [[Amur River|Amur]], the [[Yana River|Yana]], the [[Indigirka River|Indigirka]], and the [[Kolyma River|Kolyma]].

In the list below, the rivers are grouped by the seas or oceans into which they flow. Rivers that flow into other rivers are ordered by the proximity of their point of [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] to the mouth of the main river, i.e., the lower in the list, the more [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]].

There is an alphabetical list of rivers at the end of this article. [[File:Beggrov2.jpg|thumb|The [[Neva River]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]

'''Margaret Massey Hutchinson''' (1904–1997) was an English educator, [[Natural history|naturalist]] and author. Hutchinson was closely involved with [[Haslemere]] Educational Museum which was founded by her grandfather Sir [[Jonathan Hutchinson]] and she established and ran a [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]] school in West Sussex for 25 years.

She was a lifelong observer of nature, including a specialist study of [[Gall|plant galls]], and had a particular interest in the education of children in the context of the natural world.

==Early life==
Margaret Hutchinson was born on 18 December 1904 into a large [[Quakers|Quaker]] family in [[Haslemere]], Surrey, the fifth of nine children of Herbert Hutchinson and Elizabeth (Ella) Woods. Herbert's father was Sir Jonathan Hutchinson FRS, the eminent surgeon, to whom Margaret was also related on her mother's side.&lt;ref name=Childhood&gt;{{cite work|title=A Childhood in Edwardian Sussex: The making of a naturalist|publisher=Saiga Publishing|date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her early years were spent in an extremely rural environment where she developed a deep understanding of, and love for the natural world, something that would be a feature of her writing and teaching life. She described these first years in detail in her biography ''A Childhood in Edwardian Sussex: The making of a naturalist''.&lt;ref name=Childhood /&gt;

==Teacher, naturalist and writer==

In 1931 Froebel-trained Hutchinson opened Yafflesmead School at the family home in Kingsley Green, near Haslemere, in which for 25 years she provided a [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]] ''Kindergarten'' education for boys and girls between 1931 and 1955. Close friend and editor Penny Hollow wrote:
:''"Many former pupils still have fond memories of Margaret Hutchinson and how she opened their eyes to the world around them"''.&lt;ref name=Hollow&gt;{{cite work|author=Hutchinson, Margaret, ed. Penny Hollow|title=An Edwardian Childhood: The Making of a Naturalist|publisher=John Owen Smith|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fernhurst Society Newsletter No.37: Margaret Hutchinson in Kingsley Green|url=http://www.fernhurstsociety.org.uk/newsletters/newsletter037.html|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
David Kynaston quoted a parent in his book ''Austerity Britain'': 
:''"Yafflesmead is rather like home on a larger scale... cosy, no long corridors, no bleak classrooms"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Kynaston|first=David|title=Austerity Britain 1945–1951|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pupils from Yafflesmead (Getty Images)|url=http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/Search/Search.aspx?contractUrl=2&amp;assetType=image&amp;family=Editorial&amp;p=yafflesmead|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yafflesmead: Children studying, 1950 (Corbis Images)|url=http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/HU016851/children-studying|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A serious naturalist but with a keen sense of fun&lt;ref name=Hollow /&gt; Margaret Hutchinson included the study of nature in all her teaching. Her first book ''Children as Naturalists''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Hutchinson|first=Margaret|title=Children as Naturalists|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|date=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1947 and gained her a wider reputation; the book sold for over 30 years and was favourably reviewed in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the scientific journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature: Children as Naturalists (Abstract)|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v162/n4120/abs/162595b0.html|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Evelyn Lawrence, Director of the National Froebel Foundation, said in her foreword to ''Children as Naturalists'':
:''"...the circumstances in which Miss Hutchinson works are exceptional. Her classes are small, the school has large and very beautiful and varied grounds, and she herself is a scientifically trained and passionately enthusiastic naturalist."''

Yafflesmead School closed in 1955 so that Hutchinson could care for her aged parents&lt;ref name=Hollow /&gt; and was sold in 1957;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essex Record Office: Sale Catalogue of Yafflesmead, Kingsley Green|url=http://seax.essexcc.gov.uk/result_details.aspx?ThisRecordsOffSet=1&amp;id=163900|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently she dedicated herself to writing and study.

She was active at [[Haslemere Educational Museum]] as committee member, Honorary Librarian and trustee, where she often enthused parties of local school children about nature. Penny Hollow, in a postscript to the centenary edition of Margaret Hutchinson's memoirs remembered:
:''"A tall and imposing figure, she was greatly respected and everyone at the Museum was slightly in awe of her, always ensuring that her requests (polite notes signed with the characteristic "MMH") were quickly acted upon."''

Hutchinson was also a member of Haslemere Natural History Society for 74 years, wrote a column for the local newspaper, ''The Haslemere Herald'', for over 20 years and contributed to journals.&lt;ref name=Hollow /&gt;

In her 60s Hutchinson took up the study of plant [[gall]]s (cecidology), soon becoming an expert and contributing to the Journal of the [[British Plant Gall Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of the British Plant Gall Society|url=http://www.british-galls.org.uk/cecidology/Cecidology-2-1.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued the study until her last days, eventually donating her carefully indexed collection to the Haslemere Museum. Her journals and notebooks, covering nearly 80 years, are also at the Museum.&lt;ref name=Hollow /&gt;

Margaret Hutchinson never married; she died on 30 June 1997, aged 92,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalog of Old Books &amp; Authors|url=http://www.authorandbookinfo.com/ngcoba/hu4.htm|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Haslemere. The updated re-issue of ''An Edwardian Childhood'' was published in 2003 to commemorate the centenary of her birth.&lt;ref name=Hollow /&gt;

Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p&lt;/ref&gt; Marshes can often be found at the edges of lakes and streams, where they form a transition between the aquatic and terrestrial [[ecosystems]]. They are often dominated by grasses, rushes or reeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Encyclopedia|title=Marshes|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/marsh.aspx#2|accessdate=4 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523032037/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/marsh.aspx#2|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If woody plants are present they tend to be low-growing shrubs. This form of vegetation is what differentiates marshes from other types of wetland such as [[swamps]], which are dominated by trees, and [[mire]]s, which are wetlands that have accumulated deposits of acidic [[peat]].&lt;ref name="Rafferty"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rafferty|first=J.P.|title=Lakes and Wetlands|year=2011|publisher=Britannica Educational service publishing's

==Basic information==
[[File:Water Lily - geograph.org.uk - 483063.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Nymphaea alba|White water lilies]] are a typical marsh plant in European areas of deeper water.]]
[[File:Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus -100 Mile House, British Columbia, Canada -male-8.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Many kinds of birds nest in marshes; this one is a [[yellow-headed blackbird]].]]

Marshes provide a habitat for many species of plants, animals, and insects that have adapted to living in flooded conditions.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt; The plants must be able to survive in wet mud with low oxygen levels. Many of these plants therefore have [[aerenchyma]], channels within the stem that allow air to move from the leaves into the rooting zone.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt; Marsh plants also tend to have rhizomes for underground storage and reproduction.  Familiar examples include [[Typha|cattails]], [[sedges]], [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] and [[Cladium|sawgrass]]. Aquatic animals, from fish to salamanders, are generally able to live with a low amount of oxygen in the water. Some can obtain oxygen from the air instead, while others can live indefinitely in conditions of low oxygen.&lt;ref name="Rafferty" /&gt; Marshes provide [[habitat]]s for many kinds of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, waterfowl and aquatic mammals.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell &amp; Reece|title=Biology Eighth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=1162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshes have extremely high levels of biological production, some of the highest in the world, and therefore are important in supporting fisheries.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt;  Marshes also improve water quality by acting as a sink to filter [[pollutants]] and [[sediment]] from the water that flows through them. Marshes (and other wetlands) are able to absorb water during periods of heavy rainfall and slowly release it into waterways and therefore reduce the magnitude of flooding.&lt;ref name=Draper&gt;{{cite book|last=Draper &amp; Reed|title=Our Environment|year=2005|publisher=Nelson Education ltd.|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pH]] in marshes tends to be neutral to [[alkaline]], as opposed to [[bogs]], where peat accumulates under more acid conditions.

==Types of marshes==
[[File:Culbin Salt Marsh - geograph.org.uk - 185128.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A salt marsh in Scotland]]
Marshes differ depending mainly on their location and [[salinity]]. Both of these factors greatly influence the range and scope of animal and plant life that can survive and reproduce in these environments. The three main types of marsh are [[salt marshes]], freshwater [[tidal marsh]]es, and [[freshwater marsh]]es.&lt;ref name="Rafferty" /&gt; These three can be found worldwide and each contains a different set of organisms.

===Salt marshes===
{{main|Salt marsh}}
Saltwater marshes are found around the world in mid to high [[latitude]]s, wherever there are sections of protected coastline. They are located close enough to the shoreline that the motion of the [[tide]]s affects them, and, sporadically, they are covered with water. They flourish where the rate of sediment buildup is greater than the rate at which the land level is sinking.&lt;ref name="Rafferty" /&gt; Salt marshes are dominated by specially adapted rooted vegetation, primarily salt-tolerant grasses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salt marshes are most commonly found in [[lagoon]]s, [[estuaries]], and on the sheltered side of shingle or [[Sandspit (landform)|sandspit]]. The currents there carry the fine particles around to the quiet side of the spit and sediment begins to build up. These locations allow the marshes to absorb the excess nutrients from the water running through them before they reach the oceans and estuaries.&lt;ref name="Rafferty" /&gt; These marshes are slowly declining. Coastal development and [[urban sprawl]] has caused significant loss of these essential habitats.&lt;ref&gt;B.R. Silliman, E.D. Grosholz, and M.D. Bertness (eds.) 2009. Human Impacts on Salt Marshes. A Global Perspective. University of California Press, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freshwater tidal marshes===
Although considered a freshwater marsh, this form of marsh is affected by the ocean tides. However, without the stresses of salinity at work in its saltwater counterpart, the diversity of the plants and animals that live in and use freshwater tidal marshes is much higher than in salt marshes. The most serious threats to this form of marsh are the increasing size and pollution of the cities surrounding them.&lt;ref name="Rafferty" /&gt;

===Freshwater marshes===
{{Main|Wet meadow|Vernal pool|Dry lake}}
[[File:MeadowInBigBear.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[wet meadow]] adjacent to [[Big Bear Lake]], [[San Bernardino Mountains]], California]]

Ranging greatly in both size and geographic location, freshwater marshes make up the most common form of wetland in North America.  They are also the most diverse of the three types of marsh. Some examples of freshwater marsh types in North America are:

====Wet meadows====
Wet meadows occur in areas such as shallow lake basins, low-lying depressions, and the land between shallow marshes and upland areas. They also occur on the edges of large lakes and rivers. Wet meadows often have very high plant diversity and high densities of buried seeds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. and A. A. Reznicek.  1986.  Great Lakes vegetation dynamics:  the role of fluctuating water levels and buried seeds.  Journal of Great Lakes Research 12: 25-36.&lt;/ref&gt; They are regularly flooded but are often dry in the summer.

====Vernal pools====
Vernal pools are a type of marsh found only seasonally in shallow depressions in the land. They can be covered in shallow water, but in the summer and fall, they can be completely dry. In western North America, vernal pools tend to form in open grasslands,&lt;ref&gt;Bauder, E. T. 1989. Drought stress and competition effects on the local distribution of ''Pogogyne abramsii''. Ecology 70: 1083–9.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the east they often occur in forested landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, A.J.K. and P.G. deMaynadier. 2008. Science and the Conservation of Vernal Pools in Northeastern North America. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt; Further south, vernal pools form in pine savannas and [[flatwoods]]. Many amphibian species depend upon vernal pools for spring breeding; these ponds provide habitat free from fish which eat the eggs and young of amphibians.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An example is the endangered [[gopher frog]] (''Rana sevosa'').&lt;ref&gt;Richter, S. C. and Seigel, R. A. 2002. Annual variation in the population ecology of the endangered gopher frog, Rana sevosa Goin and Netting. Copeia, 2002, 962–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar temporary ponds occur in other world ecosystems, where they may have local names.  However, the term vernal pool can be applied to all such temporary pool ecosystems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Playa lakes====
[[Playa lake]]s are a form of shallow freshwater marsh that occurs in the southern high plains of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, L. M. 2003. Playas of the Great Plains. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Like vernal pools, they are only present at certain times of the year and generally have a circular shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency|title=Playa Lakes|url=http://water.epa.gov/type/wetlands/playa.cfm|accessdate=5 February 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204144636/http://water.epa.gov/type/wetlands/playa.cfm|archivedate=4 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the playa dries during the summer, conspicuous plant zonation develops along the shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;Bolen, E. G., Smith, L. M., and Schramm, H. L., Jr. 1989. Playa lakes: prairie wetlands of the southern High Plains. BioScience 39: 615–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prairie potholes===
[[File:Prairie Pothole Wetlands.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Aerial view of prairie potholes]]
Prairie potholes are found in the northern parts of North America as the [[Prairie Pothole Region]]. These landscapes were once covered by glaciers, and as a result shallow depressions were formed in great numbers. These depressions fill with water in the spring. They provide important breeding habitats for many species of waterfowl. Some pools only occur seasonally while others retain enough water to be present all year.&lt;ref&gt;van der Valk, A. G. 1989. Northern Prairie Wetlands. Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Riverine wetlands ===
Many kinds of marsh occur along the fringes of large rivers.  The different types are produced by factors such as water level, nutrients, [[ice scour]], and waves.&lt;ref&gt;Day, R., P.A. Keddy, J. McNeill and T. Carleton. 1988. Fertility and disturbance gradients: a summary model for riverine marsh vegetation.  Ecology 69: 1044-1054&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
Some areas of the world have already lost 90% of their wetlands, including marshes.  They have been drained to create agricultural land or filled to accommodate urban sprawl. Restoration is the process of returning marshes to the [[landscape]] to replace those lost in the past.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2010"/&gt;  Restoration can be done on a large scale, such as by allowing rivers to flood naturally in the spring, or on a small scale by returning wetlands to urban landscapes.

[[Image:Terranes of Nova Scotia.PNG|thumb|Map of [[Nova Scotia]], showing how the Meguma terrane forms the southern portion.]]
The '''Meguma terrane''', also known as '''Megumia''', is a [[terrane]] exposed in southern [[Nova Scotia]], that became joined to the present [[North America]]n landmass as part of the [[Appalachian orogeny]]. 

The exposed part of the Meguma terrane, the Meguma Group, is largely composed of {{Circa}} {{Convert|10|km|abbr=on}} thick [[Cambrian]] to [[Ordovician]] [[turbidite]]s that have been interpreted as submarine fan deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waldron|White|MacInnes|Roselli|2005|loc=Maguma Terrane in Nova Scotia, p. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Meguma terrane is joined to the [[Avalonia|Avalon terrane]] along the [[Chedabucto Fault|Minas Fault Zone]], which runs east-west from [[Chedabucto Bay]] to [[Cobequid Bay]] and the [[Minas Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sangster|Smith|2007|loc=Regional Geology and Tectonic Setting, pp. 724–725}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meguma Group is intruded by numerous [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] [[pluton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horne|Culshaw|White|Kontak|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of the formation is unclear; some geologists believe that a magnetic anomaly along the coast of [[Cape Cod]] may represent a suture between the Meguma and Avalon terranes in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallett|Paskevich|Poppe|Brand|2003|loc=Geologic setting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the Avalon terrane, the Meguma terrane has not been definitely associated with a territory on the other side of the Atlantic.  It may be represented in either the [[Geology of the Iberian Peninsula#Galicia-Trás-os-Montes Zone|Galicia-Tras-Os-Montes Zone]] in Spain and Portugal;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} the [[West African Craton]] in Morocco; or the [[Amazonian Craton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nance|Gutiérrez-Alonso|Keppie|Linnemann|2010|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meguma was, nevertheless, part of [[Gondwana]] during the Cambrian, and possibly formed a single peri-Gondwanan fragment together with Avalon.  Meguma then became shortened during the [[Acadian orogeny]] but Avalon somehow escaped those Acadian deformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Waldron|White|MacInnes|Roselli|2005|loc=History of the Avalon-Meguma Boundary, p. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologically this area is of interest not only to students of geological history, but because metamorphism produced [[gold]] deposits which were mined extensively (up to {{Convert|30000|ozt/yr|kg/yr|abbr=on}}) in the latter half of the 19th century, and which remain potentially exploitable today during periods of higher gold prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sangster|Smith|2007|loc=Introduction and history, pp. 723–724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Minewater Project''', based in [[Heerlen]] and other areas, aims to demonstrate how the [[geothermal energy]] stored by [[mine water]] can be used as a safe and ecological way to heat buildings.

==Aims==
The aims of the pilot projects are:
*to supply new, 'green' energy from old mines
*regeneration, including possible opportunities for new jobs
*an environmental solution in place of an environmental problem

==Funding==
The Minewater Project is supported by a grant from the [[European Union]] under the framework of the [[Interreg|Interreg IIIB NWE]] Programme. There are five project partners and numerous European observers who are contributing their expertise and knowledge.

The total costs of the project amount to € 20 millions to which Interreg IIIB is contributing 48%.
The Project began work in March 2005, and it will run until June 2008.

==Heerlen==
The scheme in [[Heerlen]] will be located at two areas of redevelopment in the town at Heerlerheide Centrum and Stadpark Oranje Nassau. These sites are 3.5&amp;nbsp;km apart situated to the north of the town and in the centre of the town, respectively. The two sites will part of one system that will be able to both heat and cool buildings.

===Heerlerheide===

Two wells will be drilled in [[Heerlerheide]] to a depth of 825 metres. Nearly a kilometre beneath the town water can be found at about 35°C, like a warm bath. This task will not be easy and is likely to require 350 hours of continuous drilling.  By the time the drilling is complete and tests carried out, engineers will know a lot more exact detail about the water temperature and quality, and the cost of using it.

===Stadpark Oranje Nassau===

At [[Stadpark Oranje Nassau]] the drilling does not need to be so deep, because the mineshafts themselves are not so deep. An intermediate well will be drilled to 500 metres and also two shallow 250 metre wells.

The shallow wells will receive the water from Heelerheide that has meanwhile been used for heating buildings. The heat will have been used up, so the water will fill the shallow wells at a temperature of 17°C. This means that it can also be useful for cooling.

{{update|date=August 2016}}
A '''National Adaptation Programme of Action''' ('''NAPA''') is a type of plan submitted to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC)&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC: National Reports, http://unfccc.int/national_reports/items/1408.php retrieved 16 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Least Developed Country|Least Developed Countries]], to describe the country's perception of its most "urgent and immediate needs to adapt to climate change".&lt;ref name=napa&gt;UNFCCC: National Adaptation Programmes of Action, http://unfccc.int/national_reports/napa/items/2719.php retrieved 16 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  NAPAs are not supposed to include original research, but use existing information and include profiles of priority projects that are intended to address those needs that have been identified.

The UNFCCC maintains a database of NAPAs,&lt;ref name=napa_database&gt;UNFCCC Database of NAPAs, http://unfccc.int/cooperation_support/least_developed_countries_portal/submitted_napas/items/4585.php retrieved on 16 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and of country priorities that have been identified within NAPAs.&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC Database of NAPA priorities, http://unfccc.int/cooperation_support/least_developed_countries_portal/napa_priorities_database/items/4583.php retrieved 16 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  As of November 2011, it contained reports from 46 LDCs.&lt;ref name=napa_database /&gt;

The [[Least Developed Country Fund]] (LDCF) was established to finance the preparation of NAPAs and to implement the projects that they propose.&lt;ref name=ldcf&gt;GEF website: about the LDCF, http://www.thegef.org/gef/ldcf retrieved 16 November 2011 [[Global Environment Facility]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The LDCF currently has resources of at least US$415 million, of which US$177 million has been approved for 47 projects, attracting more than US$550 million in co-financing in the process.&lt;ref name=ldcf /&gt;

==Details==

NAPAs are meant to provide LDCs with an opportunity to identify their "urgent and immediate needs" for adapting to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, Seventh Meeting|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop7/13a04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the NAPA process, LDC government ministries, typically assisted by development agencies, assess their countries’ vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather events. They then develop a prioritized list of adaptation projects that will help the country cope with the adverse effects of climate change. LDCs that submit NAPAs to the UNFCCC then become eligible for funding through the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDC Fund) for NAPA projects. The LDC Fund was designed through the UNFCCC to specifically assist least developed countries, as they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, Article 4.9|url=http://unfccc.int/cooperation_support/least_developed_countries_portal/ldc_work_programme_and_napa/items/4722.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, forty five LDCs have written and submitted NAPAs to the UNFCCC, with Nepal as the latest country to submit its NAPA in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNFCCC, NAPAs Received by the Secretariat.|url=http://unfccc.int/cooperation_support/least_developed_countries_portal/submitted_napas/items/4585.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more countries (Angola, Myanmar, and Timor Leste) are scheduled to complete their NAPAs by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Environment Facility, Least Developed Countries Fund|url=http://www.thegef.org/gef/LDCF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Prize for Natural Sciences''' ({{lang-es|'''Premio Nacional de Ciencias Naturales'''}}) was created in 1992 as one of the replacements for the [[National Prize for Sciences (Chile)|National Prize for Sciences]] under Law 19169.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30536&amp;idVersion=1992-09-26 |title=Ley 19169: Establece normas sobre otorgamiento de Premios Nacionales |trans-title=Law 19169: Establishes Rules on Granting National Prizes |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Chile)|Ministry of Education]] |language=Spanish |date=26 September 1992 |access-date=8 December 2017 |via=Library of the National Congress of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two prizes in this same area are for [[National Prize for Exact Sciences (Chile)|Exact Sciences]] and [[National Prize for Applied Sciences and Technologies (Chile)|Applied Sciences and Technologies]].

It is part of the [[National Prize of Chile]].

The Oil Pollution Act of 1973 or '''Oil Pollution Act Amendments of 1973''', 33 U.S.C. Chapter 20 §§ 1001-1011, was a [[Law of the United States|United States federal law]] which amended the [[United States Statutes at Large|United States Statute]] {{usstat|75|402}}. The [[Act of Congress]] sustained the United States commitment to control the discharge of [[fossil fuel]] [[Pollutants#Pollutants|pollutants]] from [[Chemical tanker|nautical vessels]] and to acknowledge the [[embargo]] of coastal zones in [[international waters|trans-boundary waters]].

The H.R. 5451 [[legislation]] was passed by the United States 93rd Congressional session and enacted by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|37th President of the United States]] Richard Nixon on October 4, 1973.

==History of OILPOL==
The [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil]] (OILPOL) was an [[Public international law|international convention]] organized by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1954. The convention was held in [[London|London, England]] from April 26, 1954 to May 12, 1954. The international meeting was convened to recognize the disposal of [[hazardous waste]] which could potentially yield [[Toxicity|toxic]] [[contamination]] to the [[marine ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/oilpol1954.html |title=International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 |date=May 12, 1954 |publisher=Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide |accessdate=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 original text was authored in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. The [[environmental protocol]] was amended in 1962, 1969, and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/oilpolamend1962.html |title=Amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil of 12 May 1954 |date=April 11, 1962 |publisher=Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide |OCLC=133522 |accessdate=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/oilpolamend1969.html |title=Amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil of 12 May 1954 |date=October 21, 1969 |publisher=Admiralty and Maritime Law Guide |accessdate=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1971 OILPOL amendments imposed irrevocable oceanic jurisdictions for the [[Great Barrier Reef]] located in the [[Coral Sea]]. The international convention amendments introduced design control provisions for sea-going [[Watercraft|vessels]] which specified tank formation arrangement and tank size limitations for nautical [[Ship transport|transport ships]].

==Provisions of the Act==
The 1973 [[amendment]]s accentuated the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954 by complying with the 1969 and 1971 international convention agreement amendments.

[[File:The Pleiades (Elihu Vedder).jpg|thumb|300px|''The Pleiades'' (1885) by the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painter [[Elihu Vedder]]]]

The '''Pleiades''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|aɪ|.|ə|d|iː|z|,_|ˈ|p|l|iː|ə|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Πλειάδες}} {{IPA-el|pleːádes|}}), companions of [[Artemis]], were the seven daughters of the [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and the sea-nymph [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]] born on [[Mount Kyllini|Mount Cyllene]]. They were the sisters of [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], [[Hyas]], the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]], and the [[Hesperides]]. The Pleiades were [[nymph]]s in the train of Artemis, and together with the seven Hyades were called the Atlantides, Dodonides, or Nysiades, nursemaids and teachers to the infant [[Dionysus]]. They were thought to have been translated to the night sky as a cluster of stars, the [[Pleiades]], and were associated with rain.

== Etymology ==
Classicists debate the origin of the name ''Pleiades''. It ostensibly derives from the name of their mother, Pleione, effectively meaning "daughters of Pleione". However, the name of the star-cluster likely came first, and Pleione was invented to explain it.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hard, ''The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology'' (London: Routledge, 2004), p. 518.&lt;/ref&gt; According to another suggestion ''Pleiades'' derives from πλεῖν (''plein'' , "to sail") because of the cluster's importance in delimiting the sailing season in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]: "the season of navigation began with their heliacal rising".&lt;ref&gt;"Pleiad, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 20 January 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seven Sisters ==
Several of the most prominent male Olympian gods (including [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], and [[Ares]]) engaged in affairs with the seven heavenly sisters. These relationships resulted in the birth of their children.

* [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] (Μαῖα), eldest of the seven Pleiades, was mother of [[Hermes]] by Zeus.
* [[Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]] (Ἠλέκτρα) was mother of [[Dardanus (son of Zeus)|Dardanus]] and [[Iasion]], by Zeus.
* [[Taygete]] (Ταϋγέτη) was mother of [[Lacedaemon]], also by Zeus.
* [[Alcyone (Pleiades)|Alcyone]] (Ἀλκυόνη) was mother of [[Hyrieus]], [[Hyperenor]] and [[Aethusa]] by [[Poseidon]].
* [[Celaeno]] (Κελαινώ) was mother of [[Lycus, son of Poseidon|Lycus]] and [[Nycteus]] by [[Poseidon]]; and of [[Eurypylus (of Cyrene)|Eurypylus]] also by Poseidon, and of Lycus and Chimaereus by [[Prometheus]].
* [[Sterope (Pleiad)|Sterope]] (Στερόπη) (also Asterope) was mother of [[Oenomaus]] by [[Ares]].
* [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]] (Μερώπη), youngest of the seven Pleiades, was wooed by [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]. In other mythic contexts she married [[Sisyphus]] and, becoming  mortal, faded away. She bore [[Sisyphus]] several sons.

Sometimes they are related to the [[Hesperides]], nymphs of the morning star.

== Mythology ==

[[Image:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Lost Pleiad (1884).jpg|thumb|200px|''Lost Pleiad'' (1884) by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]].]]

After Atlas was forced to carry the heavens on his shoulders, [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] began to pursue all of the Pleiades, and Zeus transformed them first into doves, and then into stars to comfort their father.  The constellation of Orion is said to still pursue them across the night sky.

One of the most memorable myths involving the Pleiades is the story of how these sisters literally became stars, their ''[[Catasterismi|catasterism]]''. According to some versions of the tale, all seven sisters committed suicide because they were so saddened by either the fate of their father, Atlas, or the loss of their siblings, the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]]. In turn Zeus, the ruler of the Greek gods, immortalized the sisters by placing them in the sky. There these seven stars formed the star cluster known thereafter as the Pleiades.

The Greek poet [[Hesiod]] mentions the Pleiades several times in his ''[[Works and Days]]''. As the Pleiades are primarily winter stars, they feature prominently in the ancient agricultural calendar. Here is a bit of advice from Hesiod:

:"And if longing seizes you for sailing the stormy seas,
:when the Pleiades flee mighty Orion
:and plunge into the misty deep
:and all the gusty winds are raging,
:then do not keep your ship on the wine-dark sea
:but, as I bid you, remember to work the land."
(''Works and Days'' 618-23)

The Pleiades would "flee mighty Orion and plunge into the misty deep" as they set in the West, which they would begin to do just before dawn during October–November, a good time of the year to lay up your ship after the fine summer weather and "remember to work the land"; in Mediterranean agriculture autumn is the time to plough and sow.

The poet [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] mentions the Pleiades in his poem [[Locksley Hall]]:

:"Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising through the mellow shade,
:Glitter like a swarm of [[Firefly|fire-flies]] tangled in a silver braid."

The loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the [[Pleiades|Pleiades star cluster]] disappeared from view by the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pleiade.org/pleiades_02.html ''The Pleiades in mythology''], Pleiade Associates, Bristol, United Kingdom, accessed June 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marusek, James A.,  [http://www.breadandbutterscience.com/IndiaCataclysm.pdf ''Did a Supernova cause the Collapse of Civilization in India?''], October 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternate version ==

Although most accounts are uniform as to the number, names, and main myths concerning the Pleiades, the mythological information recorded by a [[scholia]]st on [[Theocritus]]' Idylls with reference to [[Callimachus]]&lt;ref&gt;Scholia on Theocritus, Idyll 13, 25&lt;/ref&gt; has nothing in common with the traditional version. According to it, the Pleiades were daughters of an [[Amazons|Amazonian]] queen; their names were Maia, Coccymo, Glaucia, Protis, Parthenia, Stonychia, and Lampado. They were credited with inventing ritual dances and nighttime festivals.

'''Pyroxenite''' is an [[ultramafic]] [[igneous]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]] consisting essentially of [[mineral]]s of the [[pyroxene]] group, such as [[augite]], [[diopside]], [[hypersthene]], [[bronzite]] or [[enstatite]]. Pyroxenites are classified into [[clinopyroxenite]]s, [[orthopyroxenite]]s, and the [[websterite]]s which contain both types of pyroxenes (see diagram below). Closely allied to this group are the [[hornblendite]]s, consisting essentially of [[hornblende]] and other [[amphibole]]s.

They are essentially of [[Igneous rock|igneous]] origin, though some pyroxenites are included in the [[Metamorphism|metamorphic]] [[Lewisian complex]] of [[Scotland]]. The pyroxene-rich rocks, which result from the type of [[contact metamorphism]] known as [[Metamorphic facies#Pyroxene-hornfels facies|pyroxene-hornfels facies]], have siliceous sediment or basaltic [[protoliths]], and are respectively metapelites and metabasites.

==Intrusive and mantle pyroxenites==
Igneous pyroxenites are closely allied to [[gabbro]]s and [[norite]]s, from which they differ by the absence of [[feldspar]], and to [[peridotite]]s, which are distinguished from them by containing more than 40% [[olivine]]. This connection is indicated also by their mode of occurrence, for they usually accompany masses of gabbro and peridotite and seldom are found by themselves.

They are often very coarse-grained, containing individual [[crystal]]s which may be several inches in length. The principal accessory minerals, in addition to olivine and feldspar, are [[chromite]] and other [[spinel]]s, [[garnet]], [[magnetite]], [[rutile]], and [[scapolite]].

Pyroxenites can be formed as cumulates in [[Layered intrusion|ultramafic intrusions]] by accumulation of pyroxene crystals at the base of the magma chamber. Here they are generally associated with gabbro and anorthite cumulate layers and are typically high up in the intrusion. They may be accompanied by [[magnetite]] layers, [[ilmenite]] layers, but rarely [[chromite]] cumulates.

Pyroxenites are also found as layers within masses of peridotite. These layers most commonly have been interpreted as products of reaction between ascending magmas and peridotite of the upper mantle. The layers typically are a few centimeters to a meter or so in thickness. Pyroxenites that occur as [[xenolith]]s in [[basalt]] and in [[kimberlite]] have been interpreted as fragments of such layers. Although some mantle pyroxenites contain garnet, they are not [[eclogite]]s, as clinopyroxene in them is less sodic than [[omphacite]] and the pyroxenite compositions typically are unlike that of [[basalt]]. Pyroxenites might play an important role in basalt genesis (e.g., Lambart et al., 2016), either by contributing directly to the magma production, or indirectly as the result of reaction between peridotite and magma derived from partial melting of eclogite (e.g., Sobolev and others, 2007).

==Pyroxenite lavas==
Purely pyroxene-bearing volcanic rocks are rare, restricted to [[Triodia (plant)|spinifex]]-textured [[Sill (geology)|sill]]s, [[lava tube]]s and thick flows in the [[Archean|Archaean]] [[greenstone belt]]s. Here, the pyroxenite lavas are created by in-situ crystallisation and accumulation of pyroxene at the base of a lava flow, creating the distinctive spinifex texture, but also occasionally mesocumulate and orthocumulate segregations. This is in essence similar to the formation of olivine spinifex textures in [[komatiite]] lava flows, the chemistry of the magma differing only to favor crystallisation of  pyroxene.

A type locality is the [[Gullewa Greenstone Belt]], in the [[Murchison (Western Australia)|Murchison]] region of [[Western Australia]], and the Duketon Belt near [[Laverton, Western Australia|Laverton]], where pyroxene spinifex lavas are closely associated with gold deposits.

==Distribution==
They frequently occur in the form of [[Dike (geology)|dike]]s or segregations in gabbro and peridotite: in [[Shetland]], Cortland on the [[Hudson River]], [[North Carolina]] (websterite), [[Baltimore]], [[New Zealand]], and in [[Saxony]]. They are also found in the [[Bushveld Igneous Complex]] in South Africa and Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Stratigraphy of the BIC http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/161/6/903/F2.large.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Peridotite Olivine-Orthopyroxene-Clinopyroxene - Common Peridotites highlighted.png|thumb|right|Classification diagram for peridotite and pyroxenite, based on proportions of olivine and pyroxene. The pale green area encompasses the most common compositions of peridotite in the upper part of the Earth's mantle]]
The pyroxenites are often subject [[serpentinite|serpentinization]] under low temperature retrograde metamorphism and [[weathering]]. The rocks are often completely replaced by [[Serpentine group|serpentine]]s, which sometimes preserve the original structures of the primary minerals, such as the lamination of hypersthene and the rectangular cleavage of augite. Under pressure-metamorphism hornblende is developed and various types of [[amphibolite]] and hornblende-[[schist]] are produced. Occasionally rocks rich in pyroxene are found as basic facies of [[nepheline syenite]]; a good example is provided by the [[melanite]] pyroxenites associated with the ''borolanite'' variety found in the Loch Borralan igneous complex of [[Scotland]].

'''Recycling''' is the process of converting [[waste]] materials into new materials and objects. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material and help lower [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. Recycling can prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, thereby reducing: energy usage, air pollution (from [[incineration]]), and water pollution (from [[landfill|landfilling]]).

Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the third component of the "[[Waste minimisation|Reduce]], [[Reuse]], and Recycle" [[waste hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J.

There are some [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards related to recycling such as ISO 15270:2008 for plastics waste and [[ISO 14001]]:2015 for environmental management control of recycling practice.

''Recyclable materials'' include many kinds of glass, paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, [[tire]]s, textiles, and [[electronics]]. The [[composting]] or other reuse of [[biodegradable waste]]—such as [[food waste|food]] or [[Green waste|garden waste]]—is also considered recycling.&lt;ref name="gar"&gt;{{cite book |last = The League of Women Voters |title = The Garbage Primer |publisher = Lyons &amp; Burford |year = 1993 |location = New York |pages = 35–72 |isbn = 978-1-55821-250-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials to be recycled are either brought to a collection center or picked up from the curbside, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new materials destined for manufacturing.

In the strictest sense, recycling of a material would produce a fresh supply of the same material—for example, used office paper would be converted into new office paper or used [[polystyrene]] foam into new polystyrene. However, this is often difficult or too expensive (compared with producing the same product from raw materials or other sources), so "recycling" of many products or materials involves their ''[[reuse]]'' in producing different materials (for example, [[paperboard]]) instead. Another form of recycling is the [[Waste sorting|salvage]] of certain materials from complex products, either due to their intrinsic value (such as lead from [[car batteries]], or gold from [[circuit board]]s), or due to their hazardous nature (e.g., removal and reuse of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from [[thermometer]]s and [[thermostat]]s).

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Recycling has been a common practice for most of human history, with recorded advocates as far back as [[Plato]] in the fourth century BC during the Byzantine era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://affairs.com/greenfiles/Revered/byzantine-empire-for-recycling/ |title = Byzantine Empire (for recycling)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During periods when resources were scarce and hard to come by, archaeological studies of ancient waste dumps show less household waste (such as ash, broken tools, and pottery)—implying more waste was being recycled in the absence of new material.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Black Dog Publishing |publisher = Black Dog Publishing |year = 2006 |location = London, UK |isbn = 978-1-904772-36-1 |title = Recycle : a source book }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pre-industrial]] times, there is evidence of scrap bronze and other metals being collected in Europe and melted down for perpetual reuse.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; Paper recycling was first recorded in 1031 when Japanese shops sold repulped paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Handbook of Energy: Chronologies, Top Ten Lists, and Word Clouds |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ScL77rOCZn0C&amp;dq=1031+japan+paper+recycling |publisher = Elsevier |date = 15 November 2013 |isbn = 978-0-12-417019-3 |first = Cutler J. |last = Cleveland |first2 = Christopher G. |last2 = Morris |page = 461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Sustaining the earth: choosing consumer products that are safe for you, your family, and the earth |url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/sustaining-the-earth-choosing-consumer-products-that-are-safe-for-you-your-family-and-the-earth/oclc/29702410 |publisher = Hearst Books |date = 1 January 1994 |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-688-12335-2 |first = Debra |last = Dadd-Redalia |page = 103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain dust and ash from wood and coal fires was collected by "[[Waste collector|dustmen]]" and [[downcycling|downcycled]] as a base material used in brick making. The main driver for these types of recycling was the economic advantage of obtaining recycled feedstock instead of acquiring virgin material, as well as a lack of public waste removal in ever more densely populated areas.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; In 1813, [[Benjamin Law (inventor)|Benjamin Law]] developed the process of turning rags into "[[shoddy]]" and "[[Glossary of textile manufacturing#M|mungo]]" wool in Batley, Yorkshire. This material combined recycled fibers with virgin [[wool]]. The [[West Yorkshire]] shoddy industry in towns such as Batley and Dewsbury lasted from the early 19th century to at least 1914.

Industrialization spurred demand for affordable materials; aside from rags, ferrous [[scrap]] metals were coveted as they were cheaper to acquire than virgin ore. Railroads both purchased and sold scrap metal in the 19th century, and the growing steel and automobile industries purchased scrap in the early 20th century. Many secondary goods were collected, processed and sold by peddlers who scoured dumps and city streets for discarded machinery, pots, pans, and other sources of metal. By [[World War I]], thousands of such peddlers roamed the streets of American cities, taking advantage of market forces to recycle post-consumer materials back into industrial production.&lt;ref name="cash"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Carl A. Zimring |publisher = Rutgers University Press |year = 2005 |location = New Brunswick, NJ |isbn = 978-0-8135-4694-0 |title = Cash for Your Trash: Scrap Recycling in America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beverage bottles were recycled with a refundable deposit at some drink manufacturers in Great Britain and Ireland around 1800, notably [[Schweppes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |title = sd_shire |format = PDF |date =  |accessdate = 27 October 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121014013216/http://www.britishsoftdrinks.com/PDF/history.pdf |archivedate = 14 October 2012 |df = dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An official recycling system with refundable [[Container deposit legislation|deposits]] was established in Sweden for bottles in 1884 and aluminum beverage cans in 1982; the law led to a recycling rate for beverage containers of 84–99 percent depending on type, and a glass bottle can be refilled over 20 times on average.

New chemical industries created in the late 19th century both invented new materials (e.g. [[Bakelite]] [1907]) and promised to transform valueless into valuable materials.  Proverbially, you could not [[wikt:make a silk purse of a sow's ear|make a silk purse of a sow's ear]]—until the US firm Arhur D. Little published in 1921 "On the Making of Silk Purses from Sows' Ears", its research proving that when "chemistry puts on overalls and gets down to business ... new values appear. New and better paths are opened to reach the goals desired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/purse/ |title = Report: "On the Making of Silk Purses from Sows' Ears," 1921: Exhibits: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT |author =  |date =  |website = mit.edu |accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recycling (or "salvage", as it was then usually known) was a major issue for governments throughout [[World War II]]. Financial constraints and significant material shortages due to war efforts made it necessary for countries to reuse goods and recycle materials.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web |last = Public Broadcasting System (2007) |title = The War Episode 2: Rationing and Recycling |url = https://www.pbs.org/ |accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These resource shortages caused by the [[world war]]s, and other such world-changing occurrences, greatly encouraged recycling.&lt;ref&gt;''Out of the Garbage-Pail into the Fire: fuel bricks now added to the list of things salvaged by science from the nation's waste'', [[Popular Science]] monthly, February 1919, page 50-51, Scanned by Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&lt;/ref&gt; The struggles of war claimed much of the material resources available, leaving little for the civilian population.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; It became necessary for most homes to recycle their waste, as recycling offered an extra source of materials allowing people to make the most of what was available to them. Recycling household materials meant more resources for war efforts and a better chance of victory.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; Massive government promotion campaigns, such as the [[Paper Salvage 1939–50|National Salvage Campaign]] in Britain and the [[Salvage for Victory]] campaign in the United States, were carried out on the [[home front during World War II|home front]] in every combative nation, urging citizens to donate metal, paper, rags, and rubber as a matter of patriotism.

=== Post-World War II ===

A considerable investment in recycling occurred in the 1970s, due to rising energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.plasticexpert.co.uk/recycling-ages-1970s/ |title = Recycling through the ages: 1970s |date = 30 July 2014 |accessdate = 7 March 2015 |website = Plastic Expert |publisher = Plastic Expert }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling aluminum uses only 5% of the energy required by virgin production; glass, paper and other metals have less dramatic but very significant energy savings when recycled feedstock is used.&lt;ref name="economistrecycle" /&gt;

Although consumer electronics such as the television have been popular since the 1920s, recycling of them was almost unheard of until early 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = CRC History – Computer Recycling Center |url = http://www.crc.org/about/crc_history.php |website = www.crc.org |accessdate = 29 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About us – Swico Recycling |url = http://www.swicorecycling.ch/en/about-us/ |website = www.swicorecycling.ch |accessdate = 29 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After these schemes were set up, many countries did not have the capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper, as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found that they could extract valuable substances such as copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and gold, during the recycling process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Where does e-waste end up? |url = http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/ |accessdate = 29 July 2015 |publisher = Greenpeace |date = 24 February 2009 |website = www.greenpeace.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002, e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU.&lt;ref name="Kinver"&gt;{{Cite news |title = Mechanics of e-waste recycling |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6254816.stm |date = 3 July 2007 |access-date = 29 July 2015 |last = Kinver |first = Mark |publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances, especially after strict laws were implemented in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bulgaria opens largest WEEE recycling factory in Eastern Europe |url = http://www.ask-eu.com/Default.asp?Menue=142&amp;Bereich=5&amp;SubBereich=16&amp;KW=130&amp;NewsPPV=8492 |website = www.ask-eu.com |accessdate = 29 July 2015 |date = 12 July 2010 |publisher = WtERT Germany GmbH }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = EnvironCom opens largest WEEE recycling facility / waste &amp; recycling news |url = http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/environcom-opens-largest-weee-recycling-facility-in-uk-1195.aspx |website = www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk |accessdate = 29 July 2015 |date = 4 March 2010 |publisher = The Sixty Mile Publishing Company |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515070836/http%3A//www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/environcom%2Dopens%2Dlargest%2Dweee%2Drecycling%2Dfacility%2Din%2Duk%2D1195.aspx |archivedate = 15 May 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |title = Where Gadgets Go To Die: E-Waste Recycler Opens New Plant In Las Vegas |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/e-waste-recycling-las-vegas-us-micro-electronics_n_1200527.html |journal = Huffington Post |accessdate = 29 July 2015 |last = Goodman |first = Peter S. |date = 11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = New plant tackles our electronic leftovers – BizTech – Technology – smh.com.au |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/new-plant-tackles-our-electronic-leftovers/2008/11/19/1226770518649.html |website = www.smh.com.au |accessdate = 29 July 2015 |date = 19 November 2008 |last = Moses |first = Asher }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, the [[European Union]] had about 50% of world share of the waste and recycling industries, with over {{formatnum:60000}} companies employing {{formatnum:500000}} persons, with a turnover of €24 billion.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/lead-market-initiative/recycling/index_en.htm Recycling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203063401/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/policy/lead-market-initiative/recycling/index_en.htm |date=3 February 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries have to reach recycling rates of at least 50%, while the lead countries were around 65% and the EU average was 39% as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/what/public-events/competitions/waste-smart-competition/recycling-rates-in-europe/view Recycling rates in Europe], [[European Environment Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt;
The EU average rises steadily, to 45% in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2017/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/recycling-of-municipal-waste Recycling of municipal waste], European Environment Agency, 30 Nov 2017.

(Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, changes in the recycling market have sparked a global "crisis" in the industry. On December 31, 2017, China announced its "National Sword" policy, setting new standards for imports of recyclable material and banning materials that were deemed too "dirty" or "hazardous". The new policy caused drastic disruptions in the global market in recycling and reduced the prices of scrap plastic and low-grade paper. Exports of recyclable materials from G7 countries to China dropped dramatically, with many exports shifting to countries in southeast Asia. The crisis generated significant concern about the practices and environmental sustainability of the recycling industry. The abrupt shift caused countries to accept more recyclable materials than they could process, raising fundamental questions about shipping recycling waste from economically developed countries to countries with few environmental regulations—a practice that predated the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |title = Why the world's recycling system stopped working |url = https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8 |journal = [[Financial Times]] |accessdate = 25 October 2018 |last1 = Hook |first1 = Leslie |last2 = Reed |first2 = John |date = 24 October 2018 |url-access=limited |archive-url=http://archive.today/2018.10.25-073925/https://www.ft.com/content/360e2524-d71a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8 |archive-date=25 October 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

=== Supply ===

For a recycling program to work, having a large, stable [[supply and demand|supply]] of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options have been used to create such a supply: mandatory recycling collection, [[container deposit legislation]], and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for, usually in the form that a certain percentage of a material must be diverted from the city's waste stream by a target date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

Container deposit legislation involves offering a refund for the return of certain containers, typically glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have been very successful, often resulting in an 80 percent recycling rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = A Beverage Container Deposit Law for Hawaii |url = http://www.opala.org/solid_waste/Container_Deposit_Summary_Oct2002.html |website = www.opala.org |accessdate = 31 July 2015 |date = Oct 2002 |publisher = City &amp; County of Honolulu, Department of Environmental Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such good results, the shift in collection costs from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt; A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = European Council |url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/pdf/final_rep_okopol.pdf |title = The Producer Responsibility Principle of the WEEE Directive |accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative way to increase supply of recyclates is to [[ban (law)|ban]] the disposal of certain materials as waste, often including used oil, old batteries, tires, and garden waste. One aim of this method is to create a viable economy for proper disposal of banned products. Care must be taken that enough of these recycling [[service (economics)|services]] exist, or such bans simply lead to increased [[fly-tipping|illegal dumping]].&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

=== Government-mandated demand ===

Legislation has also been used to increase and maintain a demand for recycled materials. Four methods of such legislation exist: minimum recycled content mandates, utilization rates, [[procurement]] policies, and recycled [[Mandatory labeling|product labeling]].&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

Both minimum recycled content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that a certain percentage of a new product must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option: industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose, and claim that they rob industry of necessary flexibility.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DeLong"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://jamesvdelong.com/articles/environmental/wasting-away.html |title = Regulatory Policy Center&amp;nbsp;— Property Matters&amp;nbsp;— James V. DeLong |accessdate = 28 February 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414205905/http://jamesvdelong.com/articles/environmental/wasting-away.html |archivedate = 14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Governments]] have used their own [[purchasing power]] to increase recycling demand through what are called "procurement policies". These policies are either "set-asides", which reserve a certain amount of spending solely towards recycled products, or "price preference" programs which provide a larger [[government budget|budget]] when recycled items are purchased. Additional regulations can target specific cases: in the United States, for example, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] mandates the purchase of oil, paper, tires and building insulation from recycled or re-refined sources whenever possible.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

The final government regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers are required to label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers are better able to make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient [[buying power]] can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers to increase the amount of recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

'''Recyclate''' is a raw material that is sent to, and processed in a waste recycling plant or materials recovery facility which will be used to form new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Web-Dictionary.com (2013) |title = Recyclate |url = http://www.web-definition.com/dictionary/r/re/recyclate/ |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070530/http://www.web-definition.com/dictionary/r/re/recyclate/ |archivedate = 7 April 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The material is collected in various methods and delivered to a facility where it undergoes re-manufacturing so that it can be used in the production of new materials or products. For example, [[plastic bottle]]s that are collected can be re-used and made into plastic pellets, a new product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Freudenrich, C. (2014) |title = How Plastics Work |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/plastic5.htm |accessdate = 7 July 2016 |date = 2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality of recyclate ===

The quality of recyclates is recognized as one of the principal challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount of non-target material and other non-recyclable material.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK&gt;{{cite web |last = DEFRA (2013) |title = Quality Action Plan Proposals to Promote High Quality Recycling of Dry Recyclates |url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/221028/pb13875-qap-recycling.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only target material is likely to be recycled, so a higher amount of non-target and non-recyclable material will reduce the quantity of recycling product.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; A high proportion of non-target and non-recyclable material can make it more difficult for re-processors to achieve "high-quality" recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality, it is more likely to end up being down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or landfilled.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; For example, to facilitate the re-manufacturing of clear glass products there are tight restrictions for colored glass going into the re-melt process.

The quality of recyclate not only supports high-quality recycling, but it can also deliver significant environmental benefits by reducing, reusing and keeping products out of landfills.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; High-quality recycling can help support growth in the economy by maximizing the economic value of the waste material collected.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; Higher income levels from the sale of quality recyclates can return value which can be significant to local governments, households, and businesses.&lt;ref name=GOV.UK /&gt; Pursuing high-quality recycling can also provide consumer and business confidence in the waste and resource management sector and may encourage investment in that sector.

There are many actions along the recycling supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate.&lt;ref name=Scottish&gt;{{cite web |last = The Scottish Government (2012) |title = Recylate Quality Action Plan – Consultation Paper |url = http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/10/6584/6 |date = 2012-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with the waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can affect the quality of final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt; The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt; Transportation and the compaction of materials can make it more difficult to separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt; The storage of materials outside, where the product can become wet, can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt; Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.

=== Quality recyclate action plan (Scotland) ===

The Recyclate Quality Action Plan of Scotland sets out a number of proposed actions that the [[Scottish Government]] would like to take forward in order to drive up the quality of the materials being collected for recycling and sorted at materials recovery facilities before being exported or sold on to the reprocessing market.&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt;

The plan's objectives are to:&lt;ref name=highland&gt;{{cite web |last = The Highland Council (2013) |title = Report by Director of Transport, Environmental and Community Services |url = http://www.highland.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/255D69BA-079F-4126-9C85-497B221D185A/0/recyclatequalityactionplan.pdf |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140407064459/http://www.highland.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/255D69BA-079F-4126-9C85-497B221D185A/0/recyclatequalityactionplan.pdf |archivedate = 7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drive up the quality of recyclate.
* Deliver greater transparency about the quality of recyclate.
* Provide help to those contracting with materials recycling facilities to identify what is required of them
* Ensure compliance with the Waste (Scotland) regulations 2012.
* Stimulate a household market for quality recyclate.
* Address and reduce issues surrounding the Waste Shipment Regulations.

The plan focuses on three key areas, with fourteen actions which were identified to increase the quality of materials collected, sorted and presented to the processing market in Scotland.&lt;ref name=highland /&gt;

The three areas of focus are:&lt;ref name=Scottish /&gt;

# Collection systems and input contamination
# Sorting facilities – material sampling and transparency
# Material quality benchmarking and standards

== Recycling consumer waste ==

=== Collection ===

[[File:DeutscheBahnRecycling20050814 CopyrightKaihsuTai Rotated.jpg|thumb|upright|A three-sided bin at a railway station in [[Germany]], intended to separate paper ''(left)'' and plastic wrappings ''(right)'' from other waste ''(back)'']]

A number of different systems have been implemented to collect recyclates from the general waste stream. These systems lie along the spectrum of trade-off between public convenience and government ease and expense. The three main categories of collection are "drop-off centers", "buy-back centers", and "curbside collection".&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

==== Curbside collection ====
{{Main|Curbside collection}}
[[File:ACT recycling truck.jpg|thumb|A recycling truck collecting the contents of a [[recycling bin]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]].]]

Curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems, which differ mostly on where in the process the recyclates are sorted and cleaned. The main categories are mixed waste collection, commingled recyclables, and source separation.&lt;ref name="gar"/&gt; A [[waste collection vehicle]] generally picks up the waste.

At one end of the spectrum is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in with the rest of the waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled to reprocess, but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.&lt;ref name="gar"/&gt;

In a commingled or [[Single-stream recycling|single-stream system]], all recyclables for collection are mixed but kept separate from other waste. This greatly reduces the need for post-collection cleaning but does require [[public education]] on what materials are recyclable.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economisttruth"/&gt;

=====Source separation=====
Source separation is the other extreme, where each material is cleaned and sorted prior to collection. This method requires the least post-collection sorting and produces the purest recyclates, but incurs additional [[operating cost]]s for collection of each separate material. An extensive public education program is also required, which must be successful if recyclate [[contamination]] is to be avoided.&lt;ref name="gar"/&gt;

Source separation used to be the preferred method due to the high sorting costs incurred by commingled (mixed waste) collection. However, advances in sorting technology have lowered this overhead substantially. Many areas which had developed source separation programs have since switched to what's called ''co-mingled collection''.&lt;ref name="economisttruth"/&gt;

==== Buy-back centers ====

Buy-back centers differ in that the cleaned recyclates are purchased, thus providing a clear incentive for use and creating a stable supply. The post-processed material can then be sold. If this is profitable, this conserves the emission of greenhouse gases; if unprofitable, it increases the emission of greenhouse gasses. Government subsidies are necessary to make buy-back centres a viable enterprise. In 1993, according to the U.S. [[National Waste &amp; Recycling Association]], it costs on average $50 to process a ton of material, which can be resold for $30.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

In the US, the value per ton of mixed recyclables was $180 in 2011, $80 in 2015, and $100 in 2017.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{Cite news |first = Paul |last = Singer |title = Recycling market in a heap of trouble |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/20/weak-markets-make-consumers-wishful-recycling-big-problem/100654976/ |newspaper = USA Today |location = Melbourne, Florida |pages = 1B, 2B |date = 21 April 2017 |accessdate = 21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, glass is essentially valueless, because of the low cost of sand, its major component; low oil costs thwarts plastic recycling.&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt;

In 2017, [[Napa, California]], was reimbursed about 20% of its costs in recycling.&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt;

==== Drop-off centers ====

Drop-off centers require the waste producer to carry the recyclates to a central location, either an installed or mobile collection station or the reprocessing plant itself. They are the easiest type of collection to establish but suffer from low and unpredictable throughput.

==== Distributed recycling ====

For some waste materials such as plastic, recent technical devices called [[recyclebots]]&lt;ref name="RPJ"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Baechler |first1 = Christian |last2 = DeVuono |first2 = Matthew |last3 = Pearce |first3 = Joshua M. |year = 2013 |title = Distributed Recycling of Waste Polymer into RepRap Feedstock |url = https://www.academia.edu/2643418 |journal = Rapid Prototyping Journal |volume = 19 |issue = 2 |pages = 118–125 |doi = 10.1108/13552541311302978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; enable a form of distributed recycling. Preliminary [[life-cycle analysis]] (LCA) indicates that such distributed recycling of [[HDPE]] to make filament of [[3D printers]] in rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes because of reductions in transportation energy.&lt;ref name="LCA"&gt;M.

=== Sorting ===

[[File:Recycling Video.webm|thumb|Video of recycling facility and processes.|thumb|Recycling sorting facility and processes]]

Once commingled recyclates are collected and delivered to a [[Materials recovery facility|central collection facility]], the different types of materials must be sorted. This is done in a series of stages, many of which involve automated processes such that a truckload of material can be fully sorted in less than an hour.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; Some plants can now sort the materials automatically, known as [[single-stream recycling]]. In plants, a variety of materials is sorted such as paper, different [[types of plastics]], glass, metals, food scraps, and most types of batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = None |first = None |title = Common Recyclable Materials |url = http://www.epa.gov/smm/wastewise/pubs/commonmats.pdf |publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate = 2 February 2013 |date = 2015-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in the areas where these plants exist.&lt;ref&gt;ScienceDaily. (2007). [https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/1002-recycling_without_sorting.htm Recycling Without Sorting Engineers Create Recycling Plant That Removes The Need To Sort] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831095259/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2007/1002-recycling_without_sorting.htm |date=31 August 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the commingled recyclates are removed from the collection vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of [[corrugated fiberboard]] and [[plastic bag]]s are removed by hand at this stage, as they can cause later machinery to jam.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

[[File:Glass and plastic recycling 065 ubt.JPG|thumb|left|Early sorting of recyclable materials: glass and plastic bottles in [[Poland]]]]

Next, automated machinery such as disk screens and air classifiers separate the recyclates by weight, splitting lighter paper and plastic from heavier glass and metal. Cardboard is removed from the mixed paper and the most common types of plastic, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] (#1) and [[HDPE]] (#2), are collected. This separation is usually done by hand but has become automated in some sorting centers: a [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

Strong magnets are used to separate out [[ferrous metal]]s, such as iron, steel, and [[tin can]]s. [[Non-ferrous metal]]s are ejected by magnetic [[eddy current]]s in which a rotating [[magnetic field]] [[electromagnetic induction|induces]] an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic [[eddy current]] is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected from the rest of the recyclate stream.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

[[File:Recycling Point - geograph.org.uk - 1382457.jpg|thumb|A recycling point in [[New Byth]], Scotland, with separate containers for paper, plastics, and differently colored glass]]

Finally, glass is sorted according to its color: brown, amber, green, or clear. It may either be sorted by hand,&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; or via an automated machine that uses colored filters to detect different colors. Glass fragments smaller than {{convert|10|mm|in}} across cannot be sorted automatically, and are mixed together as "glass fines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = None |first = None |title = What Happens to My Recycling? |url = http://www.1coast.com.au/page8390/What-happens-to-my-recycling.aspx |publisher = www.1coast.com.au |accessdate = 21 July 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811010701/http://www.1coast.com.au/page8390/What-happens-to-my-recycling.aspx |archivedate = 11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process of recycling as well as reusing the recycled material has proven advantageous because it reduces amount of waste sent to landfills, conserves natural resources, saves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and helps create new jobs. Recycled materials can also be converted into new products that can be consumed again, such as paper, plastic, and glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/downloads/benefits.pdf |title = Puzzled About Recycling's Value?

=== Rinsing ===

[[Food packaging]] should no longer contain any organic matter (organic matter, if any, needs to be placed in a [[biodegradable waste]] bin or be buried in a garden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Trench Composting Your Kitchen Waste |url = http://www.growveg.com/growblogpost.aspx?id=318 |website = www.growveg.com |accessdate = 31 July 2015 |last = Pleasant |first = Barbara |date = 26 September 2013 |publisher = Growing Interactive Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Since no trace of biodegradable material is best kept in the packaging before placing it in a [[trash bag]], some packaging also needs to be rinsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ecomythsalliance.org/2013/10/myth-you-must-rinse-all-containers-before-recycling-them/ |title = Rinsing food packaging |author = Daisy Simmons |website = EcoMyths |date = 2013-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recycling industrial waste ==

[[File:Shredded tires.JPG|right|thumb|Mounds of shredded rubber tires are ready for processing]]

Although many government programs are concentrated on recycling at home, 64% of waste in the United Kingdom is generated by industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/elibrary/Content/Internet/538/755/1929/421459230.pdf|title = UK statistics on waste – 2010 to 2012 |date = 25 September 2014 |accessdate = 3 December 2017 |website = UK Government |publisher = UK Government |page = 2 and 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the cost–effectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like [[retail store]]s, [[warehouse]]s, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized products, depending on the nature of the waste materials that are present.

The glass, lumber, [[wood pulp]] and paper manufacturers all deal directly in commonly recycled materials; however, old [[rubber tires]] may be collected and recycled by independent tire dealers for a profit.

Levels of metals recycling are generally low. In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) published reports on metal stocks that exist within society&lt;ref name="IRP"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |title = Publications – International Resource Panel |author =  |date =  |website = unep.org |accessdate = 7 July 2016 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121111132915/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |archivedate = 11 November 2012 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their recycling rates.&lt;ref name="IRP" /&gt; The Panel reported that the increase in the use of metals during the 20th and into the 21st century has led to a substantial shift in metal stocks from below ground to use in applications within society above ground. For example, the in-use stock of copper in the USA grew from 73 to 238&amp;nbsp;kg per capita between 1932 and 1999.

The report authors observed that, as metals are inherently recyclable, the metal stocks in society can serve as huge mines above ground (the term "'''urban mining'''" has been coined with this idea in mind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = How Urban Mining Works |url = http://urbanmining.org/2010/07/07/how-urban-mining-works-2/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100711042131/http://urbanmining.org/2010/07/07/how-urban-mining-works-2/ |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 11 July 2010 |accessdate = 9 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, they found that the recycling rates of many metals are very low. The report warned that the recycling rates of some rare metals used in applications such as mobile phones, battery packs for hybrid cars and fuel cells, are so low that unless future end-of-life recycling rates are dramatically stepped up these critical metals will become unavailable for use in modern technology.

The military recycles some metals. The [[U.S. Navy]]'s Ship Disposal Program uses [[ship breaking]] to reclaim the steel of old vessels. Ships may also be sunk to create an [[artificial reef]]. [[Uranium]] is a very dense metal that has qualities superior to lead and [[titanium]] for many military and industrial uses. The [[uranium]] left over from processing it into [[nuclear weapon]]s and fuel for [[nuclear reactor]]s is called [[depleted uranium]], and it is used by all branches of the U.S. military use for armour-piercing shells and shielding.

The construction industry may recycle concrete and old road surface pavement, selling their waste materials for profit.

Some industries, like the [[renewable energy industry]] and [[solar photovoltaic]] technology, in particular, are being proactive in setting up recycling policies even before there is considerable volume to their waste streams, anticipating future demand during their rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=N. C. | last1=McDonald | first2=J.

Recycling of plastics is more difficult, as most programs are not able to reach the necessary level of quality. Recycling of [[PVC]] often results in [[downcycling]] of the material, which means only products of lower quality standard can be made with the recycled material. A new approach which allows an equal level of quality is the [[Vinyloop]] process. It was used after the [[London Olympics 2012]] to fulfill the PVC Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = London 2012 seeks sustainable solutions for temporary venues |url = http://www.london2012.com/news/articles/2009/5/london-2012-seeks-sustainable-solutions-for-temporary-ve-1243087.html |publisher = ODA |accessdate = 20 August 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120827113019/http://www.london2012.com/news/articles/2009/5/london-2012-seeks-sustainable-solutions-for-temporary-ve-1243087.html |archivedate = 27 August 2012 |df = dmy-all |date = 2017-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-waste recycling ===
{{Main|Computer recycling}}

[[File:RetiredCPUs.jpg|thumb|Computer processors retrieved from waste stream]]

[[Electronic waste|E-waste]] is a growing problem, accounting for 20–50 million metric tons of global waste per year according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU.&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt; Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge [[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|Khian Sea]] dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in [[Haiti]], the [[Basel Convention]] was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the [[e-Stewards]] certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] of the EU the [[United States]] National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.

In the recycling process, television sets, monitors, cell phones, and computers are typically tested for reuse and repaired. If broken, they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labor is cheap enough. Other e-waste is shredded to pieces roughly {{convert|10|cm|in}} in size, and manually checked to separate out toxic batteries and [[capacitor]]s which contain poisonous metals. The remaining pieces are further shredded to {{convert|10|mm|in}} particles and passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals. An [[eddy current]] ejects non-ferrous metals, which are sorted by density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid, sorted, and smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to re-processors. Television sets and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove lead from CRTs or the mercury backlight from LCDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/homehazwaste/Events/AnnualConf/2006/April27/Session4/CompRecTH.pdf |format = PDF |first = Thomas Q. |last = Hogye |title = The Anatomy of a Computer Recycling Process |publisher = California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery |accessdate = 13 October 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200011/http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/homehazwaste/Events/AnnualConf/2006/April27/Session4/CompRecTH.pdf |archivedate = 23 September 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sweeep Kuusakoski – Resources – BBC Documentary |url = http://www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk/resources/bbc.php |website = www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk |accessdate = 31 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Sweeep Kuusakoski – Glass Recycling – BBC filming of CRT furnace |url = http://www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk/glassrecycling/furness.php |website = www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk |accessdate = 31 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plastic recycling ===
{{Main|Plastic recycling}}

[[File:Spoon recycling 3d printing.jpg|thumb|upright|A container for recycling used plastic spoons into material for 3D printing]]

Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products, sometimes completely different in form from their original state. For instance, this could mean melting down soft drink bottles and then casting them as plastic chairs and tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Layton |first = Julia |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-tech/sustainable/eco-plastic1.htm |title = "Eco"-plastic: recycled plastic |publisher = Science.howstuffworks.com |date = 22 April 2009 |accessdate = 9 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical recycling ====

Some plastics are remelted to form new plastic objects; for example, PET water bottles can be converted into polyester destined for clothing. A disadvantage of this type of recycling is that the molecular weight of the polymer can change further and the levels of unwanted substances in the plastic can increase with each remelt.

==== Chemical recycling ====

For some polymers, it is possible to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl terephthalate. The terephthalate diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again.

==== Waste plastic pyrolysis to fuel oil ====

Another process involves conversion of assorted polymers into petroleum by a much less precise thermal [[depolymerization]] process. Such a process would be able to accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including [[thermoset]] materials such as vulcanized rubber tires and the [[biopolymer]]s in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = RESEM A Leading Pyrolysis Plant Manufacturer |url = http://www.pyrolysisoil.net |publisher = RESEM Pyrolysis Plant |accessdate = 20 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; plant of this type in [[Carthage, Missouri]], USA, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.
Plastic Pyrolysis can convert petroleum based waste streams such as plastics into quality fuels, carbons. Given below is the list of suitable plastic raw materials for [[pyrolysis]]:
* Mixed plastic ([[HDPE]], [[LDPE]], [[polyethylene|PE]], [[polypropylene|PP]], [[Nylon]], [[Teflon]], [[polystyrene|PS]], [[ABS plastic|ABS]], [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|FRP]], etc.)
* Mixed waste plastic from waste paper mill
* Multi-layered plastic

== Recycling loops ==

[[File:RecyclingLoops.png|thumb|Loops for production-waste, product and material recycling]]

The (ideal) recycling process can be differentiated into three loops, one for manufacture (production-waste recycling) and two for disposal of the product (product and material recycling).&lt;ref name="recyclingBook"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|pp=197–199|chapter= Manufacture, Use and Disposal of Electronic Systems in the Circular Economy|publisher=Springer|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55840-0_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The product's manufacturing phase, which consists of material processing and fabrication, forms the ''production-waste recycling'' loop. Industrial waste materials are fed back into, and reused in, the same production process.

The product's disposal process requires two recycling loops: ''product recycling'' and ''material recycling''.&lt;ref name=recyclingBook/&gt;
The product or product parts are reused in the ''product recycling'' phase. This happens in one of two ways: the product is used retaining the product functionality ("reuse") or the product continues to be used but with altered functionality ("further use").&lt;ref name=recyclingBook/&gt; The product design is unmodified, or only slightly modified, in both scenarios.

Product disassembly requires ''material recycling'' where product materials are recovered and recycled. Ideally, the materials are processed so they can  flow back into the production process.&lt;ref name=recyclingBook/&gt;

== Recycling codes ==
{{Main|Recycling codes}}

[[File:Recycling codes on products.jpg|thumb|Recycling codes on products]]

In order to meet recyclers' needs while providing manufacturers a consistent, uniform system, a [[Recycling codes|coding system]] was developed. The recycling code for plastics was introduced in 1988 by the plastics industry through the [[Society of the Plastics Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&amp;DID=4645&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF Plastic Recycling codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721103005/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/bin.asp?CID=1102&amp;DID=4645&amp;DOC=FILE.PDF |date=21 July 2011 }}, American Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt; Because municipal recycling programs traditionally have targeted packaging—primarily bottles and containers—the [[resin identification code|resin coding system]] offered a means of identifying the resin content of bottles and containers commonly found in the residential waste stream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/doc.asp?cid=1102&amp;did=4644 About resin identification codes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019171528/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/doc.asp?cid=1102&amp;did=4644 |date=19 October 2010 }} American Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic products are printed with numbers 1–7 depending on the type of resin. Type 1 ([[polyethylene terephthalate]]) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, [[hula hoops]], [[credit cards]], wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in shopping bags, squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is [[polypropylene]] and makes up syrup bottles, straws, [[Tupperware]], and some automotive parts. Type 6 is [[polystyrene]] and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Recycling Symbols on Plastics&amp;nbsp;– What Do Recycling Codes on Plastics Mean |url = http://www.thedailygreen.com/green-homes/latest/recycling-symbols-plastics-460321?src=soc_fcbk |publisher = The Daily Green |accessdate = 29 February 2012 |date = 2008-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.

== Economic impact ==

Critics{{who|date=December 2017}} dispute the net economic and environmental benefits of recycling over its costs, and suggest that proponents of recycling often make matters worse and suffer from [[confirmation bias]]. Specifically, critics argue that the costs and energy used in collection and transportation detract from (and outweigh) the costs and energy saved in the production process; also that the jobs produced by the recycling industry can be a poor trade for the jobs lost in logging, mining, and other industries associated with production; and that materials such as paper pulp can only be recycled a few times before material degradation prevents further recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1 = Lynn R.

The [[National Waste and Recycling Association]] (NWRA), reported in May 2015, that recycling and waste made a $6.7 billion economic impact in Ohio, U.S., and employed 14,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=187090 |title = Recycling and waste have $6.7 billion economic impact in Ohio |author = RecyclingToday |date = 14 May 2015 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518100058/http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=187090 |archivedate = 18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate over whether recycling is [[Economic efficiency|economically efficient]]. According to a [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] study, waste collection and landfill disposal creates less than one job per 1,000 tons of waste material managed; in contrast, the collection, processing, and manufacturing of recycled materials creates 6–13 or more jobs per 1,000 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/green-jobs-ca-recycling-report.pdf |title=From Waste to Jobs: What Achieving 75 Percent Recycling Means for California |last=|first= |date=March 2014|website=|page=2|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the cost effectiveness of creating the additional jobs remains unproven. According to the U.S. Recycling Economic Informational Study, there are over 50,000 recycling establishments that have created over a million jobs in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = No Author |first = No Author |title = Recycling Benefits to the Economy |url = http://www.all-recycling-facts.com/recycling-benefits.html |publisher = www.all-recycling-facts.com |accessdate = 1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after New York City declared that implementing recycling programs would be "a drain on the city", New York City leaders realized that an efficient recycling system could save the city over $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = A Recycling Revolution |url = http://www.recycling-revolution.com/recycling-benefits.html |publisher = www.recycling-revolution.com |accessdate = 1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities often see [[finance|fiscal]] benefits from implementing recycling programs, largely due to the reduced [[landfill]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;Lavee D. (2007). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r461lju585760316/ "Is Municipal Solid Waste Recycling Economically Efficient?"] ''Environmental Management''.&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[Technical University of Denmark]] according to the Economist found that in 83 percent of cases, recycling is the most efficient method to dispose of household waste.&lt;ref name="economisttruth"&gt;{{cite news |title = The truth about recycling |date = 7 June 2007 |url = http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9249262 |work = The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economistrecycle"&gt;{{cite news |title = The price of virtue |date = 7 June 2007 |url = http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9302727 |work = The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2004 assessment by the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute concluded that incineration was the most effective method for disposing of drink containers, even aluminium ones.&lt;ref name=Vigso2004&gt;{{cite journal |last = Vigso |first = Dorte |year = 2004 |title = Deposits on single use containers&amp;nbsp;— a social cost–benefit analysis of the Danish deposit system for single use drink containers |journal = Waste Management &amp; Research |volume = 22 |issue = 6 |pages = 477–87 |doi = 10.1177/0734242X04049252 |url = http://wmr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/22/6/477 |pmid = 15666450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiscal efficiency is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling does not include what economists call [[externality|externalities]], which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced [[hazardous waste]] leaching from landfills, reduced [[energy (society)|energy]] consumption, and reduced waste and [[resource consumption]], which leads to a reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of which only a few hundred are relatively common.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://faculty.uml.edu/Nelson_Eby/89.215/Assignments/Mineral%20Identification.pdf Minerals and Forensic Science]" (PDF).

''[[Reason Magazine]]''. 27 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies to internalize externalities, businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant, advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country's [[carbon emissions]] by a net 49 million [[metric tonnes]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[Waste and Resources Action Programme]] stated that Great Britain's recycling efforts reduce [[Greenhouse gas|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]] by 10–15 million tonnes a year.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt; Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas, as there are [[economies of scale]] involved.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

[[File:PILE OF WRECKED AUTOS AT KLEAN STEEL CO - NARA - 542660.jpg|thumb|upright|Wrecked automobiles gathered for smelting]]

Certain requirements must be met for recycling to be economically feasible and environmentally effective. These include an adequate source of recyclates, a system to extract those recyclates from the [[waste stream]], a nearby factory capable of reprocessing the recyclates, and a potential demand for the recycled products. These last two requirements are often overlooked—without both an industrial market for production using the collected materials and a consumer market for the manufactured goods, recycling is incomplete and in fact only "collection".&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

Free-market economist [[Julian Simon]] remarked "There are three ways society can organize waste disposal: (a) commanding, (b) guiding by tax and subsidy, and (c) leaving it to the individual and the market". These principles appear to divide economic thinkers today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Do Economists Reach a Conclusion on Household and Municipal Recycling? |url = http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ejwjournl/v_3a4_3ay_3a2007_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a83-111.htm |journal = Econ Journal Watch |date = 1 January 2007 |pages = 83–111 |volume = 4 |issue = 1 |first = Matthew |last = Gunter |archive-url = http://www.viewdocsonline.com/document/6eyfmh |archive-date = 31 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Ackerman]] favours a high level of government intervention to provide recycling services. He believes that recycling's benefit cannot be effectively quantified by traditional ''laissez-faire'' economics. [[Allen Hershkowitz]] supports intervention, saying that it is a public service equal to education and policing. He argues that manufacturers should shoulder more of the burden of waste disposal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Paul Calcott and Margaret Walls advocate the second option. A deposit refund scheme and a small refuse charge would encourage recycling but not at the expense of fly-tipping. Thomas C. Kinnaman concludes that a landfill tax would force consumers, companies and councils to recycle more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most free-market thinkers detest subsidy and intervention because they waste resources. [[Terry L. Anderson|Terry Anderson]] and Donald Leal think that all recycling programmes should be privately operated, and therefore would only operate if the money saved by recycling exceeds its costs. [[Daniel Benjamin|Daniel K. Benjamin]] argues that it wastes people's resources and lowers the wealth of a population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Trade in recyclates ===
Certain countries trade in unprocessed [[wikt:recyclate|recyclates]]. Some have complained that the ultimate fate of recyclates sold to another country is unknown and they may end up in landfills instead of being reprocessed. According to one report, in America, 50–80 percent of computers destined for recycling are actually not recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/02/25/computer-waste.htm |title = Much toxic computer waste lands in Third World |website = USA Today |date = 25 February 2002 |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://svtc.igc.org/media/articles/2002/time_march.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031109231707/http://svtc.igc.org/media/articles/2002/time_march.htm |archivedate = 9 November 2003 |title = Environmental and health damage in China |publisher = svtc.igc.org |date = 9 November 2003 |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are reports of illegal-waste imports to China being dismantled and recycled solely for monetary gain, without consideration for workers' health or environmental damage. Although the Chinese government has banned these practices, it has not been able to eradicate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cbc.ca/mrl3/23745/thenational/archive/ewaste-102208.wmv |title = Illegal dumping and damage to health and environment |date =  |accessdate = 6 November 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121109004831/http://www.cbc.ca/mrl3/23745/thenational/archive/ewaste-102208.wmv |archivedate = 9 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the prices of recyclable waste plummeted before rebounding in 2009. Cardboard averaged about £53/tonne from 2004 to 2008, dropped to £19/tonne, and then went up to £59/tonne in May 2009. PET plastic averaged about £156/tonne, dropped to £75/tonne and then moved up to £195/tonne in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg M.

Certain regions have difficulty using or exporting as much of a material as they recycle. This problem is most prevalent with glass: both Britain and the U.S. import large quantities of wine bottled in green glass. Though much of this glass is sent to be recycled, outside the [[American Midwest]] there is not enough wine production to use all of the reprocessed material. The extra must be downcycled into building materials or re-inserted into the regular waste stream.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

Similarly, the northwestern United States has difficulty finding markets for recycled newspaper, given the large number of [[pulp mill]]s in the region as well as the proximity to Asian markets. In other areas of the U.S., however, demand for used newsprint has seen wide fluctuation.&lt;ref name="gar" /&gt;

In some U.S. states, a program called [[RecycleBank]] pays people to recycle, receiving money from local municipalities for the reduction in landfill space which must be purchased. It uses a single stream process in which all material is automatically sorted.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie DeSimone (February 21, 2006). [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/business/businessspecial2/21recycle.html "Rewarding Recyclers, and Finding Gold in the Garbage"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms and responses ==
{{anchor|Criticism}}

Much of the difficulty inherent in recycling comes from the fact that most products are not designed with recycling in mind. The concept of [[sustainable design]] aims to solve this problem, and was laid out in the book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' by architect [[William McDonough]] and chemist [[Michael Braungart]]. They suggest that every product (and all packaging it requires) should have a complete "closed-loop" cycle mapped out for each component—a way in which every component will either return to the natural ecosystem through [[biodegradation]] or be recycled indefinitely.&lt;ref name="economisttruth" /&gt;

{{quote| quote = Complete recycling is impossible from a practical standpoint. In summary, substitution and recycling strategies only delay the depletion of non-renewable stocks and therefore may buy time in the transition to true or strong [[sustainability]], which ultimately is only guaranteed in an economy based on renewable resources.&lt;ref name="Huesemann03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Huesemann |first1 = M.

While recycling diverts waste from entering directly into landfill sites, current recycling misses the dissipative components. Complete recycling is impracticable as highly dispersed wastes become so diluted that the energy needed for their recovery becomes increasingly excessive. "For example, how will it ever be possible to recycle the numerous chlorinated organic hydrocarbons that have bioaccumulated in animal and human tissues across the globe, the copper dispersed in fungicides, the lead in widely applied paints, or the zinc oxides present in the finely dispersed rubber powder that is abraded from automobile tires?"&lt;ref name="limits of science"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Huesemann |first1 = M.&amp;nbsp;H. |year = 2003 |title = Recognizing the limits of environmental science and technology |journal = Environ.

As with [[environmental economics]], care must be taken to ensure a complete view of the costs and benefits involved. For example, [[paperboard]] packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic, but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from spoilage.&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite news |first = John |last = Tierney |title = Recycling Is Garbage |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DF1339F933A05755C0A960958260&amp;pagewanted=all |work = The New York Times |page = 3 |date = 30 June 1996 |accessdate = 28 February 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081206160552/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DF1339F933A05755C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |archivedate = 6 December 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy and material flows ===
{{anchor|Saves energy}}
[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Bales of crushed steel ready for transport to the smelter]]

The amount of energy saved through recycling depends upon the material being recycled and the type of energy accounting that is used. Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with [[life-cycle analysis]] using real energy values, and in addition, [[exergy]], which is a measure of useful energy can be used. In general, it takes far less energy to produce a unit mass of recycled materials than it does to make the same mass of virgin materials.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J. (2005). "Comparative LCAs for curbside recycling versus either landfilling or incineration with energy recovery" (12 pp).

Some scholars use [[emergy]] (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, budgets for the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics-based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by [[adaptive reuse]] systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.&lt;ref name="Brown03" /&gt;

The [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) states on its website that "a paper mill uses 40 percent less energy to make paper from recycled paper than it does to make paper from fresh lumber."&lt;ref&gt;Energy Information Administration [http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/saving/recycling/solidwaste/paperandglass.html#SavingEnergy "Recycling Paper &amp; Glass"]. Retrieved 18 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products than it does to dispose of them in traditional landfill methods, since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However, recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling, so the net energy consumption is the same. An emergy life-cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash, aluminum, recycled concrete aggregate, recycled plastic, and steel yield higher efficiency ratios, whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence, the specific nature of the recycling process, the methods used to analyse the process, and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets.&lt;ref name="Brown03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Brown |first1 = M.

It is difficult to determine the amount of energy consumed or produced in waste disposal processes in broader ecological terms, where causal relations dissipate into complex networks of material and energy flow. For example, "cities do not follow all the strategies of ecosystem development. Biogeochemical paths become fairly straight relative to wild ecosystems, with very reduced recycling, resulting in large flows of waste and low total energy efficiencies. By contrast, in wild ecosystems, one population's wastes are another population's resources, and succession results in efficient exploitation of available resources. However, even modernized cities may still be in the earliest stages of a succession that may take centuries or millennia to complete."&lt;ref name="Decker00"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Energy and Material flow through the urban Ecosystem |first1 = Ethan H. |last1 = Decker |first2 = Scott |last2 = Elliott |first3 = Felisa A. |last3 = Smith |first4 = Donald R. |last4 = Blake |first5 = F.

=== Costs ===
The amount of money actually saved through recycling depends on the efficiency of the recycling program used to do it. The [[Institute for Local Self-Reliance]] argues that the cost of recycling depends on various factors, such as [[gate fee|landfill fees]] and the amount of disposal that the community recycles. It states that communities begin to save money when they treat recycling as a replacement for their traditional waste system rather than an add-on to it and by "redesigning their collection schedules and/or trucks".&lt;ref&gt;Waste to Wealth [http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/wrrs/fivemyths.html The Five Most Dangerous Myths About Recycling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529062928/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/wrrs/fivemyths.html |date=29 May 2009 }}. Retrieved 18 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the cost of recyclable materials also exceeds the cost of raw materials. Virgin plastic resin costs 40 percent less than recycled resin.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Energy [http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/saving/recycling/solidwaste/plastics.html Conserving Energy&amp;nbsp;– Recycling Plastics]. Retrieved 10 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) study that tracked the price of clear glass from 15 July to 2 August 1991, found that the average cost per ton ranged from $40 to $60&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection Agency [https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/10001B00.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1986%20Thru%201990&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C86THRU90%5CTXT%5C00000004%5C10001B00.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=2 Markets for Recovered Glass].&lt;/ref&gt; while a [[USGS]] report shows that the cost per ton of raw silica sand from years 1993 to 1997 fell between $17.33 and $18.10.&lt;ref&gt;United States Geological Survey [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silica/780398.pdf Mineral Commodity Summaries]. Retrieved 10 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the market cost of recyclable material with the cost of new raw materials ignores economic [[externalities]]—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A [[life cycle assessment]] can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a [[carbon tax]]) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.

=== Environmental impact ===

Economist [[Steven Landsburg]], author of a paper entitled "Why I Am Not an Environmentalist",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://finddumpsterrental.com/why-i-am-not-an-environmentalist.pdf |title = Why I Am Not An Environmentalist: The Science of Economics Versus the Religion of Ecology: Excerpt from The Armchair Economist: Economics &amp; Everyday Life |author = Steven E.

He argues that because paper companies have incentives to replenish their forests, large demands for paper lead to large forests while reduced demand for paper leads to fewer "farmed" forests.&lt;ref name="armchair economist"&gt;Landsburg, Steven A. ''The Armchair Economist''. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

When foresting companies cut down trees, more are planted in their place; however, such "farmed" forests are inferior to virgin forests in several ways. Farmed forests are not able to fix the soil as quickly as virgin forests, causing widespread [[soil erosion]] and often requiring large amounts of [[fertilizer]] to maintain while containing little tree and wild-life [[biodiversity]] compared to virgin forests.&lt;ref name="baird"&gt;Baird, Colin (2004). ''Environmental Chemistry'' (3rd ed.). W. H. Freeman. {{ISBN|0-7167-4877-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the new trees planted are not as big as the trees that were cut down, and the argument that there will be "more trees" is not compelling to forestry advocates when they are counting saplings.

In particular, wood from tropical rainforests is rarely harvested for paper because of their heterogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/f7795e/f7795e02.htm |title = How to make paper in the tropics |last = de Jesus |first = Simeon |date = 1975 |journal = Unasylva |doi =  |pmid =  |access-date =  |issue = 3 |volume = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is [[subsistence farming]] (48% of deforestation) and [[commercial agriculture]] (32%), which is linked to food, not paper production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/pub_07_financial_flows.pdf |author = UNFCCC |title = Investment and financial flows to address climate change |website = unfccc.int |publisher = UNFCCC |page = 81 |year = 2007 |accessdate = 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible income loss and social costs ===

In some countries, recycling is performed by the entrepreneurial poor such as the [[karung guni]], [[zabbaleen]], the [[rag-and-bone man]], [[waste picker]], and [[junk man]]. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or [[economies of scale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nrdc.org/cities/recycling/recyc/appenda.asp |title = Too Good To Throw Away – Appendix A |publisher = NRDC |date = 30 June 1996 |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/police/stations/ParkStation/2007/07feb08%20park%20newsletter.pdf Mission Police Station]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513094320/http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/police/stations/ParkStation/2007/07feb08%20park%20newsletter.pdf |date=13 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the poor are more likely to be driven out of the recycling and the [[remanufacturing]] market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor.&lt;ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010"&gt;''PBS NewsHour'', 16 February 2010. Report on the Zabaleen&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[parable of the broken window]], there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable, e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.&lt;ref name="Medina, M. 2000 51–69"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Medina, M. |year = 2000 |title = Scavenger cooperatives in Asia and Latin America |journal = Resources |volume = 31 |pages = 51–69 |doi = 10.1016/s0921-3449(00)00071-9 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.579.6981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the social support of a country is likely to be less than the loss of income to the poor undertaking recycling, there is a greater chance the poor will come in conflict with the large recycling organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16878461&amp;BRD=1698&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=21849&amp;rfi=6 |title = The News-Herald – Scrap metal a steal |publisher = Zwire.com |date =  |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=Balon Greyjoy |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92705125 |title = Raids On Recycling Bins Costly To Bay Area |publisher = NPR |date = 19 July 2008 |accessdate = 6 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means fewer people can decide if certain waste is more economically reusable in its current form rather than being reprocessed. Contrasted to the recycling poor, the efficiency of their recycling may actually be higher for some materials because individuals have greater control over what is considered "waste".&lt;ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010" /&gt;

One labor-intensive underused waste is electronic and computer waste. Because this waste may still be functional and wanted mostly by those on lower incomes, who may sell or use it at a greater efficiency than large recyclers.

Some recycling advocates believe that [[laissez-faire]] individual-based recycling does not cover all of society's recycling needs. Thus, it does not negate the need for an organized recycling program.&lt;ref name="PBS NewsHour 2010" /&gt; Local government can consider the activities of the recycling poor as contributing to property blight.

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schackelford | first=T.K. | year=2006 | title=Recycling, evolution and the structure of human personality | journal=Personality and Individual Differences | volume=41 | issue=8 | pages=1551–1556 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; that recycling behaviour is not natural because it requires a focus and appreciation for long-term planning, whereas humans have evolved to be sensitive to short-term survival goals; and that to overcome this innate predisposition, the best solution would be to use social pressure to compel participation in recycling programmes. However, recent studies have concluded that social pressure is unviable in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://sapiens.revues.org/index905.html |title = Pratarelli, M.E.

Surveys and Perspectives Integrating Environment and Society |issue = 3.1 |date =  2010-02-04|accessdate = 6 November 2012 |last1 = Pratarelli |first1 = Marc E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is that social pressure functions well in small group sizes of 50 to 150 individuals (common to nomadic hunter–gatherer peoples) but not in communities numbering in the millions, as we see today. Another reason is that individual recycling does not take place in the public view.

In a study done by social psychologist Shawn Burn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burn | first1 = Shawn | year = 2006 | title = Social Psychology and the Stimulation of Recycling Behaviors: The Block Leader Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 611–629 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00539.x| citeseerx = 10.1.1.462.1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is the most effective way to increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oskamp | first1 = Stuart | year = 1995 | title = Resource Conservation and Recycling: Behavior and Policy | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 157–177 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01353.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.

Many schools have created recycling awareness clubs in order to give young students an insight on recycling. These schools believe that the clubs actually encourage students to not only recycle at school but at home as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3752">'''Sand dune ecology''' describes the  biological and physico-chemical interactions that are a characteristic of [[sand dune]]s.

Sand dune systems are excellent places for biodiversity, partly because they are not very productive for agriculture, and partly because disturbed, stressful and stable habitats are present in proximity to each other. Many of them are protected as nature reserves, and some are parts of larger conservation areas, incorporating other coastal habitats like salt marches, mud flats, grasslands, scrub and woodland.

==Plant habitat==
Sand dunes provide a range of habitats for a range of unusual, interesting and characteristic plants that can cope with  [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbed]] habitats. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] these may include restharrow ''[[Ononis repens]]'', sand spurge ''Euphorbia arenaria'' and ragwort ''Senecio vulgaris'' - such plants are termed ruderals.

Other very specialised plants are adapted to the accretion of sand, surviving the continual burial of their shoots by sending up very rapid vertical growth.  Marram grass, ''[[Ammophila arenaria]]''  specialises in this, and is largely responsible for the formation and stabilisation of many dunes by binding sand grains together. The sand couch-grass ''Elytrigia juncea'' also performs this function on the seaward edge of the dunes, and is responsible, with some other pioneers like the sea rocket ''[[Cakile maritima]]'', for initiating the process of dune building by trapping wind blown sand.

In accreting situations  small mounds of vegetation or tide-washed debris form  and tend to enlarge as the wind-speed drops in the lee of the mound, allowing blowing sand (picked up from the off-shore banks) to fall out of the air stream.  The pioneering plants are physiologically adapted to withstand the problems of high salt contents in the air and soil, and are good examples of stress tolerators, as well as having some ruderal characteristics.

==Inland side==
On the inland side of dunes conditions are less severe, and [[links (golf)|links]] type grasslands develop with a range of grassland herbs which benefit from the reasonable nutrient status and moderately high pH of the more stable soils, especially when enough humus has accumulated in stabilised soils for water retention to be improved. Species like red fescue and lady's bedstraw are adapted to compete with each other - for nutrients, growing space and light, and are known as CSR plants - i.e. having features of Competitors, Stress tolerators and Ruderals in more or less equal proportions.

There may also be areas in old [[blowout (geology)|blow-outs]] where [[groundwater]] is near the surface, and often rises to cause flooding in the winter.  Frequent, but intermittent waterlogging of the roots requires adaptations to stress, so the proportions of stress tolerators are increased here.

In nutrient-rich water, however there are some plants with very competitive strategies, like the reed (''[[Phragmites australis]]'').  This is an example of a plant which makes rapid growth and suppresses other species by monopolising root and shoot space and shading out the opposition.  Even its own seedlings are prevented from establishing within the existing population, but seeds are blown for long distances in copious quantities to start new colonies, whilst mature populations extend by rapid vegetative growth of lateral underground shoots - rhizomes.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], '''scattering theory''' is a framework for studying and understanding the [[scattering]] of [[wave|waves]] and [[Elementary particle|particles]]. Wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object, for instance [[sunlight]] scattered by [[rain drop]]s to form a [[rainbow]]. Scattering also includes the interaction of [[billiard balls]] on a table, the [[Rutherford scattering]] (or angle change) of [[alpha particle]]s by [[gold]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], the Bragg scattering (or diffraction) of electrons and X-rays by a cluster of atoms, and the [[inelastic scattering]] of a fission fragment as it traverses a thin foil. More precisely, scattering consists of the study of how solutions of [[partial differential equations]], propagating freely "in the distant past", come together and interact with one another or with a [[boundary condition]], and then propagate away "to the distant future".  The '''direct scattering problem''' is the problem of determining the distribution of scattered radiation/particle flux basing on the characteristics of the [[scattering|scatterer]]. The [[inverse scattering problem]] is the problem of determining the characteristics of an object (e.g., its shape, internal constitution) from measurement data of radiation or particles scattered from the object.

Since its early statement for [[radar|radiolocation]], the problem has found vast number of applications, such as [[acoustic location|echolocation]], [[geophysical]] survey, [[nondestructive testing]], [[medical imaging]] and [[quantum field theory]], to name just a few.

==Conceptual underpinnings==

The concepts used in scattering theory go by different names in 
different fields.  The object of this section is to point the reader 
to common threads.

===Composite targets and range equations===

[[Image:Xsection2.png|288px|thumb|left|Equivalent quantities used in the theory of scattering from composite specimens, but with a variety of units.]]

When the target is a set of many scattering centers whose relative position varies unpredictably, it is customary to think of a range equation whose arguments take different forms in different application areas.  In the simplest case consider an interaction that removes particles from the "unscattered beam" at a uniform rate that is proportional to the incident flux &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of particles per unit area per unit time, i.e. that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dx}=-QI \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is an interaction coefficient and ''x'' is the distance traveled in the target.

The above ordinary first-order [[differential equation]] has solutions of the form:

: &lt;math&gt;I = I_o e^{-Q \Delta x} = I_o e^{-\frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}} = I_o e^{-\sigma (\eta \Delta x)} = I_o e^{-\frac{\rho \Delta x}{\tau}} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial flux, path length Δx&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the second equality defines an interaction [[mean free path]] λ, the third uses the number of targets per unit volume η to define an area [[cross section (physics)|cross-section]] σ, and the last uses the target mass density ρ to define a density mean free path τ.   Hence one converts between these quantities via ''Q'' =&amp;nbsp;1/''&amp;lambda;'' =&amp;nbsp;''&amp;eta;&amp;sigma;'' =&amp;nbsp;''&amp;rho;/&amp;tau;'', as shown in the figure at left.

In electromagnetic absorption spectroscopy, for example, interaction coefficient (e.g. Q in cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is variously called [[opacity (optics)|opacity]], [[absorption coefficient]], and [[attenuation coefficient]].  In nuclear physics, area cross-sections (e.g. σ in [[barn (unit)|barn]]s or units of 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;24&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), density mean free path (e.g. τ in grams/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and its reciprocal the [[mass attenuation coefficient]] (e.g. in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/gram) or ''area per nucleon'' are all popular, while in electron microscopy the [[inelastic mean free path]]&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Egerton (1996) ''Electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the electron microscope'' (Second Edition, Plenum Press, NY) {{ISBN|0-306-45223-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. λ in nanometers) is often discussed&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Reimer (1997) ''Transmission electron microscopy: Physics of image formation and microanalysis'' (Fourth Edition, Springer, Berlin) {{ISBN|3-540-62568-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead.

==In theoretical physics==
In [[mathematical physics]], '''scattering theory''' is a framework for studying and understanding the interaction or [[scattering]] of solutions to [[partial differential equation]]s. In [[acoustics]], the differential equation is the [[wave equation]], and scattering studies how its solutions, the [[sound wave]]s, scatter from solid objects or propagate through non-uniform media (such as sound waves, in [[sea water]], coming from a [[submarine]]). In the case of classical [[electrodynamics]], the differential equation is again the wave equation, and the scattering of [[light]] or [[radio wave]]s is studied. In [[particle physics]], the equations are those of [[Quantum electrodynamics]], [[Quantum chromodynamics]] and the [[Standard Model]], the solutions of which correspond to  [[fundamental particle]]s.

In regular [[quantum mechanics]], which includes [[quantum chemistry]], the relevant equation is the [[Schrödinger equation]], although equivalent formulations, such as the [[Lippmann-Schwinger equation]] and the [[Faddeev equation]]s, are also largely used. The solutions of interest describe the long-term motion of free atoms, molecules, photons, electrons, and protons. The scenario is that several particles come together from an infinite distance away. These reagents then collide, optionally reacting, getting destroyed or creating new particles. The products and unused reagents then fly away to infinity again. (The atoms and molecules are effectively particles for our purposes. Also, under everyday circumstances, only photons are being created and destroyed.) The solutions reveal which directions the products are most likely to fly off to and how quickly. They also reveal the probability of various reactions, creations, and decays occurring. There are two predominant techniques of finding solutions to scattering problems: [[partial wave analysis]], and the [[Born approximation]].

==Elastic and inelastic scattering==

The term "elastic scattering" implies that the internal states of the scattering particles do not change, and hence they emerge unchanged from the scattering process.  In inelastic scattering, by contrast, the particles' internal state is changed, which may amount to exciting some of the electrons of a scattering atom, or the complete annihilation of a scattering particle and the creation of entirely new particles.

The example of scattering in [[quantum chemistry]] is particularly instructive, as the theory is reasonably complex while still having a good foundation on which to build an intuitive understanding. When two atoms are scattered off one another, one can understand them as being the [[bound state]] solutions of some differential equation.  Thus, for example, the [[hydrogen atom]] corresponds to a solution to the [[Schrödinger equation]] with a negative inverse-power (i.e., attractive Coulombic) [[central potential]].  The scattering of two hydrogen atoms will disturb the state of each atom, resulting in one or both becoming excited, or even [[ionization|ionized]], representing an inelastic scattering process.

The term "[[deep inelastic scattering]]" refers to a special kind of scattering experiment in particle physics.

==The mathematical framework==
In [[mathematics]], scattering theory deals with a more abstract formulation of the same set of concepts. For example, if a [[differential equation]] is known to have some simple, localized solutions, and the solutions are a function of a single parameter, that parameter can take the conceptual role of [[time]].  One then asks what might happen if two such solutions are set up far away from each other, in the "distant past", and are made  to move towards each other, interact (under the constraint of the differential equation) and then move apart in the "future".  The scattering matrix then pairs solutions in the "distant past" to those in the "distant future".

Solutions to differential equations are often posed on [[manifold]]s. Frequently, the means to the solution requires the study of the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of an [[operator theory|operator]] on the manifold. As a result, the solutions often have a spectrum that can be identified with a [[Hilbert space]], and scattering is described by a certain map, the [[S matrix]], on Hilbert spaces.  Spaces with a [[discrete spectrum (physics)|discrete spectrum]] correspond to [[bound state]]s in quantum mechanics, while a [[continuous spectrum]] is associated with scattering states.  The study of inelastic scattering then asks how discrete and continuous spectra are mixed together.

An important, notable development is the [[inverse scattering transform]], central to the solution of many [[exactly solvable model]]s.

The '''South Atlantic Anomaly''' (SAA) is an area where the Earth's inner [[Van Allen radiation belt]] comes closest to the [[Earth]]'s surface, dipping down to an altitude of {{convert|200|km|mi|-1}}.  This leads to an increased [[flux]] of energetic particles in this region and exposes orbiting [[satellite]]s to higher-than-usual levels of radiation.

The effect is caused by the [[Concentric|non-concentricity]] of the Earth and its magnetic [[dipole]]. The SAA is the near-Earth region where the [[Earth's magnetic field]] is weakest relative to an idealized Earth-centered dipole field.

==Definition==
The area of the SAA is confined by the intensity of [[Earth's magnetic field]] at less than 32,000 [[nanotesla]] at sea level,&lt;ref name="Pavon-Carrasco2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The South Atlantic Anomaly: The Key for a Possible Geomagnetic Reversal |journal=Frontiers in Earth Science |first1=F.

==Position and shape==
[[Image:South Atlantic Anomaly.svg|thumb|left|A cross-sectional view of the Van Allen radiation belts, noting the point where the South Atlantic Anomaly occurs]]
The Van Allen radiation belts are symmetrical about the Earth's magnetic axis, which is tilted with respect to the Earth's rotational axis by an angle of approximately 11°. The intersection between the magnetic and rotation axes of the Earth is located not at the Earth's center, but some {{convert|450|to|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. Because of this asymmetry, the inner Van Allen belt is closest to the Earth's surface over the south Atlantic Ocean where it dips down to {{convert|200|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} in altitude, and farthest from the Earth's surface over the north Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160003393 |title=Forty-Year 'Drift' and Change of the SAA |publisher=NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center |first1=Epaminondas G. |last1=Stassinopoulos |first2=Michael A. |last2=Xapsos |first3=Craig A. |last3=Stauffer |date=December 2015 |id=NASA/TM-2015-217547, GSFC-E-DAA-TN28435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crotts2014"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0pCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168 |title=The New Moon: Water, Exploration, and Future Habitation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |first=Arlin |last=Crotts |page=168 |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-521-76224-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Earth's magnetism is represented by a bar magnet of small size but strong intensity ("[[magnetic dipole]]"), the SAA variation can be illustrated by placing the magnet not in the plane of the Equator, but some small distance North, shifted more or less in the direction of [[Singapore]]. As a result, over northern South America and the south Atlantic, near Singapore's [[antipodal point]], the magnetic field is relatively weak, resulting in a lower [[magnetism|repulsion]] to trapped particles of the radiation belts there, and as a result these particles reach deeper into the upper atmosphere than they otherwise would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/earthmag/magnQ&amp;A1.htm#q15 |title=FAQ: "The Great Magnet, the Earth" |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of the SAA changes over time. Since its initial discovery in 1958,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/05/science/dip-on-earth-is-big-trouble-in-space.html |title='Dip' on Earth is Big Trouble in Space |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Broad |first=William J. |date=5 June 1990 |access-date=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the southern limits of the SAA have remained roughly constant while a long-term expansion has been measured to the northwest, the north, the northeast, and the east. Additionally, the shape and particle density of the SAA varies on a [[Day|diurnal]] basis, with greatest particle density corresponding roughly to local noon. At an altitude of approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the SAA spans from {{nowrap|−50° to 0°}} geographic latitude and from {{nowrap|−90° to +40°}} longitude.&lt;ref name="Ask"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/961004.html |title=The South Atlantic Anomaly |series=Ask an Astrophysicist |publisher=NASA |date=4 October 1996 |access-date=16 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105042835/http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/961004.html |archivedate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest intensity portion of the SAA drifts to the west at a speed of about 0.3° per year, and is noticeable in the references listed below. The drift rate of the SAA is very close to the [[Structure of the Earth#Core|rotation differential between the Earth's core]] and its surface, estimated to be between 0.3° and 0.5° per year.

Current literature suggests that a slow weakening of the [[geomagnetic field]] is one of several causes for the changes in the borders of the SAA since its discovery. As the geomagnetic field continues to weaken, the inner Van Allen belt gets closer to the Earth, with a commensurate enlargement of the SAA at given altitudes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Effects==
The South Atlantic Anomaly is of great significance to astronomical [[satellite]]s and other [[spacecraft]] that [[orbit]] the Earth at several hundred kilometers altitude; these orbits take satellites through the anomaly periodically, exposing them to several minutes of strong radiation, caused by the trapped protons in the inner Van Allen belt. The [[International Space Station]], orbiting with an [[inclination]] of 51.6°, requires extra shielding to deal with this problem. The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] does not take observations while passing through the SAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/25/text/ |title=Hubble Achieves Milestone: 100,000th Exposure |publisher=[[Space Telescope Science Institute]] |date=July 18, 1996 |accessdate=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Astronauts are also affected by this region, which is said to be the cause of peculiar "shooting stars" ([[phosphene]]s) seen in the visual field of astronauts, an effect termed the [[cosmic ray visual phenomena]].&lt;ref name="AskA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q525.html |title=What is the South Atlantic Anomaly? |work=Ask the Astronomer |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly is thought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ascendworldwide.com/content/spacetrak/sinsample.pdf |title=Space Intelligence News |publisher=Ascend |format=PDF |date=March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214142051/http://www.ascendworldwide.com/content/spacetrak/sinsample.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the reason for the [[Globalstar#First-Generation satellite problems|failures of the Globalstar network's satellites]] in 2007.

The [[PAMELA detector|PAMELA]] experiment, while passing through the SAA, detected [[antiproton]] levels that were orders of magnitude higher than expected. This suggests the Van Allen belt confines antiparticles produced by the interaction of the Earth's upper atmosphere with [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Discovery of Geomagnetically Trapped Cosmic-Ray Antiprotons |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |last1=Adriani |first1=O. |last2=Barbarino |first2=G.

The SAA is believed to have started a series of events leading to the destruction of the [[Hitomi (satellite)|Hitomi]], Japan's most powerful X-ray observatory.

[[File:Bay of Fundy.jpg|400px|thumb|High and low tide in the [[Bay of Fundy]]]]

The '''theory of tides''' is the application of [[continuum mechanics]] to interpret and predict the [[tide|tidal]] deformations of planetary and satellite bodies and their atmospheres and [[ocean]]s (especially Earth's Ocean) under the gravitational loading of another astronomical body or bodies (especially the [[Moon]]).

== Kepler ==

In 1609 [[Johannes Kepler]] correctly suggested that the gravitation of the Moon causes the tides,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Astronomia nova …'' (1609), p. 5 of the Introductio in hoc opus&lt;/ref&gt; basing his argument upon ancient observations and correlations. The influence of the Moon on tides was mentioned in Ptolemy's ''Tetrabiblos'' as having derived from ancient observation.

==Galileo's attempt to explain the tides==
[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|thumb|left|Justus Sustermans – Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636]]
[[File:Galileo Theory of Tides.gif|thumb|right|"The greater circle represents the orbit of the Earth around the Sun...while the smaller one is the rotating Earth itself" (Palmeri 1998, p. 229).]]

In 1616, [[Galileo Galilei]] wrote ''[[Discourse on the Tides]]'' (''Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare''),&lt;ref name="Galileo's Theory of the Tides"&gt;[[Rice University]]: [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/tides.html Galileo's Theory of the Tides], by Rossella Gigli, retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in a letter to [[Alessandro Orsini (cardinal)|Cardinal Orsini]]. In this discourse, he tried to explain the occurrence of the tides as the result of the [[Earth]]'s rotation and [[heliocentrism|revolution around the Sun]]. Galileo believed that the oceans moved like water in a large basin: as the basin moves, so does the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyson|first=Peter|title=Galileo's Big Mistake|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/galileo-big-mistake.html|website=NOVA|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, as the Earth revolves, the force of the Earth's rotation causes the oceans to "alternately accelerate and retardate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmieri|first=Paolo|title=Re-examining Galileo's Theory of Tides|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view on the oscillation and "alternately accelerated and retardated" motion of the Earth's rotation is a "dynamic process" that deviated from the previous dogma, which proposed "a process of expansion and contraction of seawater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmeri|first=Paolo|title=Re-examining Galileo's Theory of Tides|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Galileo's theory was erroneous.&lt;ref name="Galileo's Theory of the Tides"/&gt;  In subsequent centuries, [[Tide#Analysis|further analysis]] led to the current tidal physics. Galileo rejected Kepler's explanation of the tides.

== Newton ==

Newton, in the ''Principia'', provided a correct explanation for the [[tidal force]], which can be used to explain tides on a planet covered by a uniform ocean, but which takes no account of the distribution of the continents or ocean bathymetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/static.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410173511/http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/static.htm |archivedate=10 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The dynamic theory of Laplace==
The dynamic theory of tides describes and predicts the actual real behavior of ocean tides.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearsonhighered.com/samplechapter/0132401223.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Newton's three-body diagram.PNG|400px|right|Newton's three-body model]]
While [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] explained the tides by describing the tide-generating forces and [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] gave a description of the static reaction of the waters on Earth to the tidal potential, the ''dynamic theory of tides'', developed by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1775,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/2011112017524/short-notes-on-the-dynamical-theory-of-laplace.html&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ocean's real reaction to [[Tidal force|tidal forces]].&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/luanne/pages/ocean420/notes/tidedynamics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Laplace's theory of ocean tides took into account [[friction]], [[resonance]] and natural periods of ocean basins. It predicted the large [[amphidromic]] systems in the world's ocean basins and explains the oceanic tides that are actually observed.&lt;ref&gt;http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kess/JGGHBA/2009/v30n5/JGGHBA_2009_v30n5_671.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium theory, based on the gravitational gradient from the Sun and Moon but ignoring the Earth's rotation, the effects of continents, and other important effects, could not explain the real ocean tides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanho.co.za/tides/tide_theory.pdf Tidal theory] website South African Navy Hydrographic Office&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/swojtal/SFWpage/161Stuff/161Lect17/sld012.htm |title=Dynamic theory for tides |publisher=Oberlin.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/645fall2003_web.dir/ellie_boyce/dynamic.htm|title=  Dynamic Theory of Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/dynamic.htm |title=Dynamic Tides – In contrast to "static" theory, the dynamic theory of tides recognizes that water covers only three-quarters o |publisher=Web.vims.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113022202/http://web.vims.edu/physical/research/TCTutorial/dynamic.htm |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coa.edu/stodd/oceanweb/oceanography/Oceanlectures02/Lecture8/sld014.htm |title=The Dynamic Theory of Tides |publisher=Coa.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219161027/http://www.coa.edu/stodd/oceanweb/oceanography/Oceanlectures02/Lecture8/sld014.htm |archivedate=19 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beacon.salemstate.edu/~lhanson/gls214/gls214_tides{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/St-Ts/Tides.html |title=Tides – building, river, sea, depth, oceans, effects, important, largest, system, wave, effect, marine, Pacific |publisher=Waterencyclopedia.com |date=2010-06-27 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocean.tamu.edu/wormuth/tidestxt.html |title=TIDES |publisher=Ocean.tamu.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since measurements have confirmed the theory, many things have possible explanations now, like how the tides interact with deep sea ridges and chains of seamounts give rise to deep eddies that transport nutrients from the deep to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Floor Anthoni |url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/tides.htm |title=Tides |publisher=Seafriends.org.nz |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The equilibrium tide theory calculates the height of the tide wave of less than half a meter, while the dynamic theory explains why tides are up to 15 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/tidal-info/tidal-intro/cause-nature|title=  The Cause &amp; Nature of Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Satellite observations confirm the accuracy of the dynamic theory, and the tides worldwide are now measured to within a few centimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/stories/topex/tides.html |title=Scientific Visualization Studio TOPEX/Poseidon images |publisher=Svs.gsfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SVS-1333 |title=TOPEX/Poseidon Western Hemisphere: Tide Height Model : NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements from the [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]] satellite closely match the models based on the [[TOPEX]] data.&lt;ref&gt;TOPEX data used to model actual tides for 15 days from the year 2000 |url=http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a001300/a001332/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geomag.us/info/Ocean/m2_CHAMP+longwave_SSH.swf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/ |title=OSU Tidal Data Inversion |publisher=Volkov.oce.orst.edu |accessdate=2012-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accurate models of tides worldwide are essential for research since the variations due to tides must be removed from measurements when calculating gravity and changes in sea levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.dgfi.tum.de/en/news/baroclinic-tides/|title=   Dynamic and residual ocean tide analysis for improved GRACE de-aliasing (DAROTA)|deadurl=   yes|archiveurl=   https://web.archive.org/web/20150402194935/http://www.dgfi.tum.de/en/news/baroclinic-tides/|archivedate=   2 April 2015|df=   dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] formulated a single set of linear [[partial differential equation]]s, for tidal flow described as a [[barotropic]] two-dimensional sheet flow. [[Coriolis effect]]s are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace obtained these equations by simplifying the [[fluid dynamic]] equations. But they can also be derived from energy integrals via [[Lagrange's equation]].

For a fluid sheet of [[average]] thickness ''D'', the vertical tidal elevation ''ζ'', as well as the horizontal velocity components ''u'' and ''v'' (in the [[latitude]] ''φ'' and [[longitude]] ''λ'' directions, respectively) satisfy '''Laplace's tidal equations''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://kiwi.atmos.colostate.edu/group/dave/pdf/LTE.frame.pdf|title= The Laplace Tidal Equations and Atmospheric Tides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  \begin{align} 
    \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t}
    &amp;+ \frac{1}{a \cos( \varphi )} \left[
           \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} (uD)
         + \frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi} \left(vD \cos( \varphi )\right)  
       \right]
     = 0,
     \\[2ex]
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
   &amp;- v \left( 2 \Omega \sin( \varphi ) \right)
    + \frac{1}{a \cos( \varphi )} \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda} \left( g \zeta + U \right)
    =0 
    \qquad \text{and} \\[2ex]
   \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}
   &amp;+ u \left( 2 \Omega \sin( \varphi ) \right)
    + \frac{1}{a} \frac{\partial}{\partial \varphi} \left( g \zeta + U \right)
    =0,
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Ω'' is the [[angular frequency]] of the planet's rotation, ''g'' is the planet's gravitational acceleration at the mean ocean surface, ''a'' is the planetary radius, and ''U'' is the external gravitational tidal-forcing [[potential]].

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] rewrote Laplace's momentum terms using the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] to find an equation for [[vorticity]]. Under certain conditions this can be further rewritten as a conservation of vorticity.

==Tidal analysis and prediction==

===Harmonic analysis===
[[File:Tides Fourier Transform.png|300px|thumb|Fourier transform of tides measured at Ft. Pulaski in 2012.  Data downloaded from http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datums.html?id=8670870 Fourier transform computed with https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/]]

Laplace's improvements in theory were substantial, but they still left prediction in an approximate state. This position changed in the 1860s when the local circumstances of tidal phenomena were more fully brought into account by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]]'s application of [[Fourier analysis]] to the tidal motions as [[harmonic analysis]].

Thomson's work in this field was then further developed and extended by [[George Darwin]], applying the lunar theory current in his time. Darwin's symbols for the tidal harmonic constituents are still used.

Darwin's harmonic developments of the tide-generating forces were later improved when [[Arthur Thomas Doodson|A T Doodson]], applying the [[lunar theory]] of [[Ernest William Brown|E W Brown]],&lt;ref name=dec2001&gt;D E Cartwright, "Tides: a scientific history", Cambridge University Press 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sSesNjG96JYC&amp;pg=PA163 at pages 163-4].&lt;/ref&gt; developed the tide-generating potential (TGP) in harmonic form, distinguishing 388 tidal frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;S Casotto, F Biscani, "A fully analytical approach to the harmonic development of the tide-generating potential accounting for precession, nutation, and perturbations due to figure and planetary terms", AAS Division on Dynamical Astronomy, April 2004, vol.36(2), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Doodson's work was carried out and published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;A T Doodson (1921), "The Harmonic Development of the Tide-Generating Potential", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Vol. 100, No. 704 (Dec. 1, 1921), pp. 305-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doodson devised a practical system for specifying the different harmonic components of the tide-generating potential, the [[Arthur Thomas Doodson#Doodson numbers|Doodson numbers]], a system still in use.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. T D Moyer (2003), "Formulation for observed and computed values of Deep Space Network data types for navigation", vol.3 in Deep-space communications and navigation series, Wiley (2003), e.g. at pp.126-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-twentieth century further analysis has generated many more terms than Doodson's 388.  About 62 constituents are of sufficient size to be considered for possible use in marine tide prediction, but sometimes many fewer can predict tides to useful accuracy.  The calculations of tide predictions using the harmonic constituents are laborious, and from the 1870s to about the 1960s they were carried out using a mechanical [[tide-predicting machine]], a special-purpose form of [[analog computer]] now superseded in this work by digital electronic computers that can be programmed to carry out the same computations.

===Tidal constituents===
Tidal constituents combine to give an endlessly varying aggregate because of their different and incommensurable frequencies: the effect is visualized in an [http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/tidesIII3.html animation of the American Mathematical Society] illustrating the way in which the components used to be mechanically combined in the [[tide-predicting machine]].  Amplitudes of tidal constituents are given below for six example locations:

The '''Top End''' of [[Australia]]'s Northern Territory is a geographical region encompassing the northernmost section of the [[Northern Territory]], which aside from the [[Cape York Peninsula]] is the northernmost part of the Australian continent. It covers a rather vaguely defined area of perhaps {{convert|245000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} behind the northern coast from the [[Northern Territory]] capital of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] across to [[Arnhem Land]] with the [[Indian Ocean]] on the west, the [[Arafura Sea]] to the north, and the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] to the east, and with the almost waterless semi-arid interior of Australia to the south, beyond the huge [[Kakadu National Park]].&lt;ref name="TopEnd"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosauer |first1=D.F. |last2=Blom |first2=M.P.K. |last3=Bourke |first3=G. |last4=Catalano |first4=S. |last5=Donnellan |first5=S. |last6=Gillespie |first6=G. |last7=Mulder |first7=E. |last8=Oliver |first8=P.M. |last9=Potter |first9=S. |last10=Pratt |first10=R.C. |last11=Rabosky |first11=D.L. |last12=Skipwith |first12=P.L. |last13=Moritz |first13=C. |title=Phylogeography, hotspots and conservation priorities: an example from the Top End of Australia |journal=Biological Conservation |date=December 2016 |volume=204 |pages=83–93 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2016.05.002 |url=http://moritzlab.anu.edu.au/DiversityWorkshop_Nov2016/Readings/Rosauer%20et%20al%202016%20Top%20End%20Lizards.pdf |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Top End contains both of the Territory's cities and one of its major towns, [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] and [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]].  The well-known town of [[Alice Springs]] is located further south, in the arid southern part of the [[Northern Territory]], sometimes referred to by Australians as the ''[[Outback|Red Centre]]''.

The landscape is relatively flat with river floodplains and grasslands with [[eucalyptus]] trees along with rocky areas and patches of rainforest, and in western Arnhem Land a high rugged sandstone plateau cut through with gorges, much of which is in Kakadu National Park. The rivers that form the wetlands include the South and East [[Alligator Rivers]], [[Mary River (Northern Territory)|Mary River]], and the [[Glyde River]]. The climate is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season, bringing the highest rainfall in northern Australia (over {{convert|1200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year). Temperatures do not fluctuate widely throughout the year.

There are a number of islands off the Top End coast including the  [[Tiwi Islands]] ([[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and  [[Melville Island (Northern Territory)|Melville Island]]), and [[Groote Eylandt]] as well as many smaller ones.

==Flora==
Most [[savanna]] in Australia is used for grazing livestock, but in this far north, vast areas of grassland are in their original state and dotted with [[Eucalyptus tetrodonta|Darwin stringybark]] and [[Eucalyptus miniata|Darwin woollybutt]]  eucalyptus trees; these grasslands are a unique and highly important ecoregion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flannigan|first=Mike|date=2007|title=Editorial|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/wfv16n1_ed|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|volume=16|issue=1|pages=769|doi=10.1071/wfv16n1_ed|issn=1049-8001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sandstone plateau area of the ecoregion is a particularly rich centre of biodiversity supporting a unique [[heathland]] flora. Much of the Top End is within the Arnhem Land tropical savanna [[ecoregion]], which to the south merges into the semi-arid [[Acacia aneura|mulga]] [[scrubland]], [[mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee]], and [[sand dune]]s of the centre  (see [[Gulf Country|Carpentaria]], [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]], and [[Ord Victoria Plain]]). The transition is gradual, and the demarcation line that divides the Top End from the centre is arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0701|name=Arnhem Land tropical savanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
This area is home to unique wildlife. The rivers and estuaries are home to large populations of both [[saltwater crocodile|saltwater]] and [[freshwater crocodile]]s, as well as [[bull shark]]s, [[sawfish]], and [[dugong]]s. The wetlands are a rich habitat vital to bird migration and home to large populations of birds, including the world's largest breeding colony of [[Magpie goose|magpie geese]], as well as large numbers of rodents and snakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leseberg |first1=Nick |last2=Campbell |first2=Iain |title=Birds and Animals of Australia's Top End: Darwin, Kakadu, Katherine, and Kununurra |date=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=9780691161464 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endemic species of the Top End include the [[Woodward's wallaroo]], [[Morelia oenpelliensis|Oenpelli python]], [[chestnut-quilled rock-pigeon]], [[Arnhem Land rock rat]], and several species of [[skink]]s. Other reptiles include [[frill-necked lizard]]s and large [[monitor lizard]]s (known locally as [[goanna]]s). Snakes include the [[olive python]], [[Acanthophis|death adder (''Acanthophis'')]], [[Pseudechis australis|mulga]], water python (''[[Liasis fuscus]]''), and various others. The plateau is home to many of these endemics, especially invertebrates, fish, and frogs, including, for example, hundreds of species of ants. The offshore islands are home to unique subspecies of some of this wildlife.

==Threats and preservation==
The landscape is well preserved and most of the area is traditionally managed by [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976|Aboriginal land trusts]], including [[Kakadu National Park]], which is Australia's largest national park and a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="TopEnd" /&gt; Although some populations have declined, there have been no major extinctions of wildlife in this area. Darwin, though, is a growing city and a base for agriculture and mining, both of which threaten habitats. Introduced plants and animals, such as the [[water buffalo]], are also changing natural habitats, and there has been criticism of the way the local population has changed the [[fire regime]]s used to control the bush foliage, in which large areas are burnt each year and allowed to renew. Also there was a large aboriginal trade in that area which has mostly settled down.

[[Image:Tyche Antioch Vatican Inv2672.jpg|thumb|upright|The Tyche of [[Antioch]], Roman copy of a bronze by [[Eutychides]] (Galleria dei Candelabri, [[Vatican Museums]])]]

'''Tyche''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|t|aɪ|k|i}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Τύχη}} {{IPA-el|tý.kʰɛː|anc}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forvo.com/word/%CF%84%CF%8D%CF%87%CE%B7/ Ancient Greek pronunciation]&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-el|ˈti.çi|mod}} "luck"; [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent: [[Fortuna]]) was the presiding [[tutelary deity]] who governed the fortune and prosperity of a city, its [[destiny]]. In Classical Greek mythology, she is the daughter of [[Aphrodite]] and [[Zeus]] or [[Hermes]].

In literature, she might be given various genealogies, as a daughter of Hermes and Aphrodite, or considered as one of the [[Oceanids]], daughters of [[Oceanus]], and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]], or of Zeus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], Twelfth Olympian Ode.&lt;/ref&gt; She was connected with [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]&lt;ref&gt;As on an Attic amphora, fifth century BCE, [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], [http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Tykhe.html illustrated at Theoi.com].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Agathodaemon|Agathos Daimon]] ("good spirit").

The Greek historian [[Polybius]] believed that when no cause can be discovered to events such as floods, droughts, frosts, or even in politics, then the cause of these events may be fairly attributed to Tyche.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius. ''The Rise Of The Roman Empire'', Page 29, Penguin, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
[[File:Şans Tapınağı sütunlar detayı.JPG|thumb|left|The remains of a Greek temple of Tyche]]
Increasingly during the [[Hellenistic period]], cities venerated their own specific iconic version of Tyche, wearing a [[mural crown]] (a crown like the walls of the city).

Tyche had temples at [[Caesarea Maritima]], [[Antioch]], [[Alexandria]], and [[Constantinople]]. In [[Alexandria]] the ''Tychaeon'', the Greek temple of Tyche, was described by [[Libanius]] as one of the most magnificent of the entire Hellenistic world.&lt;ref&gt;Libanius, in ''Progymnasmata'' 1114R, noted by Spyridakis 1969:45.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was uniquely venerated at [[Itanos]] in [[History of Crete|Crete]], as ''Tyche Protogeneia'', linked with the Athenian [[Protogeneia]] ("firstborn"), daughter of [[Erechtheus]], whose self-sacrifice saved the city.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Spyridakis, who demonstrated that earlier suggestions of a source in Fortuna Primigenia of Praeneste was anachronistic.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!--In a similar way, according to [[William Robertson Smith]] the Tyche of [[Antioch]] was originally a young virgin sacrificed at the time of the founding of the city to ensure its continued prosperity and good fortune.--&gt;

Stylianos Spyridacis &lt;ref&gt;[http://history.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Spyridakis_Stylianos University of California Davis faculty: Stylianos Spyridakis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516061656/http://history.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Spyridakis_Stylianos |date=2010-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concisely expressed Tyche's appeal in a Hellenistic world of arbitrary violence and unmeaning reverses: "In the turbulent years of the [[Diadochi|Epigoni of Alexander]], an awareness of the instability of human affairs led people to believe that Tyche, the blind mistress of Fortune, governed mankind with an inconstancy which explained the vicissitudes of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Spyridakis, Stylianos. "The [[Itanos|Itanian]] cult of Tyche Protogeneia", ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte'' '''18'''.1 (January 1969:42-48) p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions==
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Tyche e Plutone - sec. II d.C. - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|Polychrome marble statue depicting the goddess Tyche holding the infant [[Plutus]] in her arms, second century CE, [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]]]]
[[Image:Bronze-Gordian III and Tranquillina-l1parthica-singara AE33 BMC 7.jpg|thumb|right|Tyche on the reverse of this [[base metal]] coin by [[Gordian III]], 238-244 CE]]
Tyche appears on many [[numismatics|coins]] of the Hellenistic period in the three centuries before the [[Anno Domini|Christian era]], especially from [[Aegean civilizations|cities in the Aegean]]. Unpredictable turns of fortune drive the complicated plotlines of [[Hellenistic romance]]s, such as, ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon]]'' or ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]''. She experienced a resurgence in another era of uneasy change, the final days of publicly sanctioned [[Paganism]], between the late-fourth-century emperors [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] and [[Theodosius I]], who definitively closed the temples. The effectiveness of her capricious power even achieved respectability in philosophical circles during that generation, although among poets it was a commonplace to revile her for a fickle harlot.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. M. Bowra]], "Palladas on Tyche" ''The Classical Quarterly'' New Series, '''10'''.1 (May 1960:118-128).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval art]], she was depicted as carrying a [[cornucopia]] (horn of plenty), an [[emblem]]atic [[Gubernaculum (classical)|gubernaculum]] (ship's rudder), and the [[Rota Fortunae|wheel of fortune]], or she may stand on the wheel, presiding over the entire circle of fate.

The constellation of [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] is sometimes identified as the heavenly figure of Tyche,&lt;ref&gt;DK Multimedia: Eyewitness Encyclopedia, ''Stardome, Virgo: miscellaneous section''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other goddesses such as [[Demeter]] and [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]].

** To provide civil and criminal penalties for illegal acts
* Surveillance
** To protect the marine environment by conducting:
*** Pollution overflights
*** Vessel boardings
*** Harbor patrols
*** Transfer monitoring
*** Facility inspections
* Response
** Cleanup and impact limitation of an oil or chemical discharge
* In-house abatement
** Ensure that Coast Guard vessels and facilities comply with federal pollution laws and regulations

[[File:Wild Animals Tannerey.jpg|thumb|Illustration from [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]'s ''Wild Animals I Have Known'' (1898)]] 
'''''Wild Animals I Have Known''''' is an 1898 book by [[naturalist]] and author [[Ernest Thompson Seton]].  The first entry in a new genre of realistic wild-animal fiction, Seton's first collection of short stories quickly became one of the most popular books of its day.  "[[Lobo the King of Currumpaw]]", the first story in the collection, was based upon Seton's experience hunting wolves in the southwestern United States.  It became a classic, setting the tone for his future works that would similarly depict animals—especially predators who were often demonized in literature—as compassionate, individualistic beings.

Several years after its publication, Seton and his works came under fire during the [[nature fakers controversy]], which began in 1903 when naturalist [[John Burroughs]] published an essay called "Real and Sham Natural History" in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.   In particular Burroughs blamed Seton's collection of stories for founding the sentimental animal story genre, which he felt featured fabricated events and wild animal behaviors; he even amended the title of the collection to ''Wild Animals I'' Alone ''Have Known''.&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, John. (March 1903.) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=hZAGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA298#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Real and Sham Natural History]". ''The Atlantic Monthly''. Retrieved on May 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
