The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in March 2021.

ADRON-RM is a near copy of ADRO-EM on the stationary [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]] and  the [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) neutron detector on board NASA's [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]], all designed by Igor Mitrofanov from the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI).  

==Overview==

ADRON-RM is a [[Neutron spectroscopy|neutron spectrometer]] that will search for hydrogen in the form of bound water or water ice, and hydrogen-bearing compounds. It will be used in combination with WISDOM instrument (a [[ground-penetrating radar]]) to study the subsurface beneath the rover and to search for optimal sites for drilling and sample collection.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'&gt; [https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2016.1566 The ADRON-RM Instrument Onboard the ExoMars Rover].

The [[Principal Investigator]] is Igor Mitrofanov from the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI).&lt;ref name="2018-iki"/&gt; The instrument is almost a reproduction of the [[Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons]] (DAN) neutron detector on board NASA's ''[[Curiosity rover]]'' also developed in Russia.&lt;ref name="Mars Science Laboratory: Mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/radiationdetectors/dan/ |title=Mars Science Laboratory: Mission |publisher=NASA/JPL |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20130408"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1461 |title=Remaining Martian Atmosphere Still Dynamic |publisher=NASA |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=April 8, 2013 |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitrofanov is also developing the active gamma and neutron spectrometer, '''ADRON-EM''' (Active Detection of Radiation of Nuclei-ExoMars) for the stationary [[ExoMars 2020 surface platform]] —the primary goal of which will be to measure water distribution in the Martian subsurface.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt; Measurements by ADRON-RM and ADRON-EM will work in synergy with other ExoMars instruments.

ADRON-RM uses two [[Helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]] [[proportional counter]]s with a cylindrical shape of about 25  mm in diameter and 55  mm in total length. Each counter is filled with &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He gas under 4 atmospheres of pressure.&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt; Each neutron detector will measure two 32-channel spectra. The data will be obtained as routine and passive measurements, which will not be saved but will be immediately transmitted from the instrument to the rover computer. This means that all ADRON-RM measurements will be performed only when the 'Rover Compute Element' is active (daytime).&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt;

ADRON-RM is installed inside the ExoMars rover body at the rear balcony. The height above the surface is 0.8 m (2.6 ft)

==Objectives==

The stated objectives of the ADRON-RM scientific investigation include:&lt;ref name='Mitrofanov 2017'/&gt;
*Measurement of the distribution of bulk hydrogen content in the form of free or bound water.
*Evaluation of the bulk composition of major soil neutron absorption elements ([[Chlorine|Cl]], [[Iron|Fe]], [[Titanium|Ti]] [[Sulfur|S]], etc.)
*Monitoring of the neutron component of the natural radiation background and estimation of neutron radiation dose at the [[Martian surface]] from [[Galactic cosmic ray]]s and [[solar particle event]]s.
*The potential to monitor seasonal changes of the neutron environment due to variations of atmospheric and subsurface properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">'''Aramaic studies''' is the study of the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Syriac Christianity]]. A specialist in Aramaic studies is known as a '''Aramaicist'''. British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by the designation Syriacist (a scholar of [[Syriac studies]], at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christian]] and [[Maronite Christian]] communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between ''Aramaistik'' (Aramaic studies) and ''Neuaramaistik'' (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies).

Aramaic studies is the term used at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Leiden]], and [[University of Detroit Mercy]]. At some other universities, Aramaic studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as [[Eastern Christianity]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], as [[Eastern Christianity]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Crossroads: Essays on Medieval Christian Legacy - Page 391 Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala - 2007 "Not because this list would be very long, but since Syriac Studies are mostly incorporated into a more general field of studies, e.g. Aramaic studies (as is the case, e.g. at the Universities of Oxford or Leiden), or Eastern Christianity, as in Duke, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[Semitic studies]] at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. Most students learn the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Syriac language]] within a [[biblical studies]] program.

Aramaic academic journals include the annual ''Aramaic Studies'', a leading journal for Aramaic language and literature published by Brill Academic Publishers. The journal incorporates the previous ''Journal for the Aramaic Bible'' for a more inclusive scope, to include all aspects of Aramaic language and literature, even when not, or only indirectly, related to Biblical texts.

'''Arts administration''' (alternatively '''arts management''') is the field that concerns [[business operations]] around an [[arts]] organization.  Arts administrators are responsible for facilitating the day-to-day operations of the [[organization]] and fulfilling its mission. Arts organizations include professional non-profit entities (e.g. theaters, museums, symphonies, jazz organizations, opera houses, and ballet companies) and many smaller professional and non-professional for-profit arts-related organizations (e.g. auction houses, art galleries, music companies, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of an arts administrator can include [[staff management]], marketing, budget management, public relations, fundraising, program development and evaluation, and board relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/artsadministrator.aspx|title = Job profiles: Arts administrator|date = |accessdate = April 5, 2015|website = National Careers Service|publisher = Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, UK|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/careers/management-arts-administrators|title = Career: Arts Administrators|date = |accessdate = April 5, 2015|website = Big Future|publisher = College Board|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts administrators==
Art administrators (alternatively '''arts managers''') work for arts and cultural organizations such as theatres, symphonies, "...art [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museums]], arts festivals, arts centers, arts councils, regional arts boards, [[dance]] companies, community arts organizations, disability arts organizations, and local authorities."&lt;ref name="prospects.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&amp;idno=61&amp;pageno=1 Arts administrator: Job description and activities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An arts administrator in a small organization may do [[marketing]], event booking, and handle financial issues. An arts administrator for a larger arts organization may be responsible for buildings and facilities, creative staff (e.g., performers/artists), other administrative staff, [[public relations]], marketing, and writing reports.

A senior-level arts administrator may advise the [[board of directors]] or other senior managers on "strategic planning and management decisions. An effective arts administrator must also be knowledgeable in local, state and federal [[public policy]] as it relates to [[human resources]], [[health insurance]], [[labor laws]] and volunteer risk management."&lt;ref name="prospects.ac.uk"/&gt;

There are several notable professionals in the field. [[Philippe de Montebello]] was curator of New York City's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1977-2008. On his retirement, he was both the longest-serving director in the institution's history and the longest-serving director of any major art museum in the world. [[Michael Maddox]] co-founded the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow, home to [[Bolshoi Ballet]] and [[Bolshoi Opera]], which are amongst the oldest and grandest ballet and opera companies in the world.  Another notable figure in arts administration is John Lane of John Lane's Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine.  Lane acquired the playhouse in 1950 and successfully ran the organization, still considered to be "America's foremost summer theatre," until his retirement in 1994.

==Issues in arts administration==
Like any business, arts organizations must work within changing external and internal environments.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.

Although a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times.

==Academic programs==
Arts administration programs are available at a number of universities and colleges in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;!-- No others? --&gt;   In the United States, these programs began in the 1970s at several schools after meetings with the National Endowment for the Arts on how the next generations of arts leaders would be educated.  Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.

Arts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.

At some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arts Management Degree Programs &amp; Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|url = http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|website = www.american.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|url = https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.depaul.edu|accessdate = 2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|url = http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|website = theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while it's undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.

Though curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent "in the field", applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual &amp; Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual &amp; performing arts centers.

Most programs require two years in residence, though [http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/business-degrees/arts-administration/index.aspx Drexel University], [http://universitycollege.du.edu/mals/degree/masters/arts-development-and-program-management-online/degreeid/423 University of Denver], and [[Goucher College]] offer online options with limited residency. The [http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program University of Kentucky] and [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] offer fully online degrees in arts administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online M.A. Program {{!}} College of Fine Arts|url = http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program|website = finearts.uky.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arts administration|url = https://www.scad.edu/academics/programs/arts-administration|accessdate = 2015-04-06|website = SCAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to accommodate full-time employment, provide strong networking opportunities, and many teamwork opportunities, programs such as [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University] have adopted a cohort model and offer classes on evenings and weekends.

Some programs offer dual degrees.  For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the [[St. John International University]] [http://www.sjiu.it/] offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl.

Other programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.

Some programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs.

Several universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management. New York University's MA in Arts Administration program allows students to choose a visual arts or a performing arts focus.

Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues.  As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.

Arts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators.  &lt;ref&gt;Gates, Leslie. “Professional Development: Through Collaborative Inquiry for an Art Education Archipelago.” Vol. 52, no. 1, 2010, pp. 6–17., {{jstor|25746078}} Accessed 16 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9775">[[File:Australasian strewnfield.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=An approximate map of the strewnfield.|Australasian [[strewnfield]]. Shaded areas represent [[tektite]] finds.]]

The '''Australasian strewnfield''' is the youngest and largest of the [[tektite]] [[strewnfield]]s, with recent estimates suggesting it may cover 10%-30% of the [[Earth]]'s surface.&lt;ref name=povenmire/&gt;
   
==Details==
[[File:French Indochina map.jpg|thumb|150px|The impact crater is proposed to be somewhere in Thailand, Laos, or Cambodia.]]
The c. 790,000-year-old strewnfield (Schneider, 1992)&lt;ref name=schneider/&gt;&lt;ref name=pillans/&gt; includes most of [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Southern China]]). The material from the impact stretches across the ocean to include the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Java]]. It also reaches far west out into the [[Indian Ocean]], and south to [[Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. Since the 1960s, it has been accepted that the strewn field included [[Hainan]] in southern China to Australia or about 10% of the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=povenmire/&gt; This was later extended by finds in Africa and Tasmania to 20%. Recent additional finds in northern [[Tibet]] and [[Guangxi]] increased the strewnfield to about 30% of the [[Earth#Surface area|Earth's surface]], or almost 150 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=povenmire/&gt;

==Impact crater==
The [http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/Agesort.html Earth Impact Database] lists about 26 known craters younger than a million years old, almost all of which are less than 2&amp;nbsp;km in diameter (except the 3 km Agoudal and 4 km [[Rio Cuarto craters|Rio Cuarto]]). Very close to this time frame is the 14-km [[Zhamanshin crater]] in [[Kazakhstan]] which at one time (Glass, 1979) was proposed as the source of the Australasian strewn field.&lt;ref name=glass1979a/&gt;

However, due to the enormous size of the Australasian strewn field, the impact crater has been conjectured to be significantly larger than the known ones.&lt;ref name=povenmire/&gt;&lt;ref name=glass1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=hartung/&gt; Schmidt and Wasson (1993) suggested it could be a 14–17&amp;nbsp;km crater beneath the [[Mekong|Mekong Valley]],&lt;ref name=schmidt/&gt; Schnetzler (1996) considered a 35–40&amp;nbsp;km structure in southern Laos,&lt;ref name=schnetzler/&gt; Hartung and Koeberl (1994) proposed the elongated 100&amp;nbsp;km x 35&amp;nbsp;km [[Tonlé Sap|Tonlé Sap lake]] in [[Cambodia]] (visible in the map at the side),&lt;ref name=hartung/&gt; while Glass (1994) estimated it to be between 32 and 114&amp;nbsp;km in diameter in Cambodia.&lt;ref name=glass1994/&gt; Glass (1999) also suggested southern Laos or an adjacent area as a possible source.&lt;ref name=glass1999/&gt; More recently, Lee and Wei (2000) gave its size as 90 to 116&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; and P. Ma et al. (2001) using [[beryllium-10]] postulated the crater as between southern Laos and [[Hainan]], possibly within the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].&lt;ref name=ma/&gt;&lt;ref name=whymark/&gt;

Alternatively, Wasson, who found layered tektites in central Thailand,&lt;ref name=wasson1995/&gt; conjectured it could have been a multiple impact event spread out over the region,&lt;ref name=wasson1991/&gt; though it seems this scenario also raises substantial problems.&lt;ref name=hartung/&gt;

The [[Wilkes Land crater]] in Antarctica has been proposed as a possible source.&lt;ref name="s62"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=RA |date=1962 |title=Australites and Antarctica |journal=Science |volume=138 |issue=3538 |pages=443–444 |id=[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/3538/443 Abstract] |doi=10.1126/science.138.3538.443 |pmid=17794921 |bibcode=1962Sci...138..443S}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the impact may have triggered the [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal]].&lt;ref name=glass1967/&gt;&lt;ref name=glass1979b/&gt;

==Homo erectus==
[[File:Guangxi in China.svg|thumb|150px|[[Guangxi]] in southern China]]
Archeological artifacts found with these tektites in [[Baise]], [[Guangxi]] in southern China indicates that a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' population was living in the area during and after the impact.&lt;ref name=guangxi/&gt;&lt;ref name=paine/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcaxe/&gt;&lt;ref name=anthro/&gt;
 
[[Homo erectus#Use of tools|Stone tools]] have been found within the debris field along with a charcoal layer likely caused by fires from the impact. It has been suggested that the subsequent local deforestation after the fires allowed this population easier access to stones useful for tool-making.&lt;ref name=guangxi/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">In the year 616 an anonymous scholar extended [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table]] to an Easter table covering the years 532 up to and including 721.   Dionysius' table was published in 525 and only a century later accepted by the church of Rome, which from the third century up till then had given preference to go on using her own, relatively inadequate, Easter tables.   From about the middle of the seventh century all controversy between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date of Easter ceased, as both churches were now using identical tables.   

In the year 725 [[Bede#Scientific writings|Bede]] (Latin name Beda Venerabilis) published a new extension of Dionysius’ Easter table to a great '''Easter cycle''', which is periodic in its entirety and in which consequently not only the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Paschal full moon]] but also the sequence of (Julian calendar) dates of Alexandrian [[Easter Sunday]] is periodic. Bede’s Easter cycle contains lunar cycles (of 19 years) as well as solar cycles (of 28 years), and therefore it has a period of 532 years. In the [[Byzantine empire]] thanks to the Paschal cycle of [[Annianus of Alexandria]] at all times the churches were acquainted with the correct date of the next Easter Sunday. It is Beda Venerabilis’ Easter cycle by means of which also the churches in the part of Europe outside the Byzantine empire got that possibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5392">The '''Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute''' (later the '''Göring Institute''') was founded in 1920 to further the science of [[psychoanalysis]] in [[Berlin]].  Its founding members included [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Max Eitingon]].  The scientists at the institute furthered [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work but also challenged many of his ideas.

==History==
The Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute grew from the Psychoanalytic Polyclinic (''psychoanalytische Poliklinik'') founded in February 1920. The Polyclinic allowed access to psychoanalysis by low-income patients. Only some 10% of its income came from patients' fees; the rest was provided personally by Max Eitingon. It introduced the three-column model or 'Eitingon model' for the training of analysts (theoretical courses, personal analysis, first patients under supervision) which was later adopted by most other training centers. In 1925, Eitingon became chair of the new International Training Committee of the [[International Psychoanalytic Association]]. The Eitingon model remains standard today.&lt;ref name="Rolnik"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |title=Freud in Zion |first=Eran J. |last=Rolnik |publisher=Karnak |location=London |year=2012 |isbn=978 1 78049 053 3 |page=73 |origyear=2007 in Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute itself was founded in 1923. [[Ernst Simmel]], [[Hanns Sachs]], [[Franz Alexander]], [[Sándor Radó (psychoanalyst)|Sándor Radó]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Siegfried Bernfeld]], [[Otto Fenichel]], [[Theodor Reik]], [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Melanie Klein]] were among the many psychoanalysts who worked at the Institute.

As a Jew, Eitingon's position became precarious after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ascent to power in 1933. Freud's books were burned in Berlin. By then some members had already left Berlin for the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Rolnik (2012), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Eitingon resigned in August 1933; he later moved to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and founded the [[Palestine Psychoanalytic Association]] in 1934 in [[Jerusalem]]. The Palestine Association saw itself as the heir of the Berlin Institute; even the furniture from the Berlin Institute ended up in Jerusalem.

[[File:Gedenktafel Berliner Psychoanalytisches Institut.jpg|thumb|Gedenktafel am ehemaligen Standort des Instituts in der Potsdamer Straße in [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Tiergarten]]]]

On 23 August 1933, [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote to [[Ernest Jones]], "Berlin is lost".&lt;ref&gt;Rolnik (2012), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Jacobson]] was arrested by the Nazis in 1935; one of her patients was a known Communist. {{Interlanguage link multi|Felix Boehm|de|3=Felix Boehm (Psychoanalytiker)}}, who with fellow non-Jew {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Müller-Braunschweig|de}} had taken control of the Institute after Eitingon's departure, refused to intervene on Jacobson's behalf, on the grounds that by associating herself with Communism she had endangered the Institute's survival. In 1936 the Institute was annexed to the "Deutsches Institut für psychologische Forschung und Psychotherapie e.v." (the so-called '''Göring Institute'''). Its director [[Matthias Göring]] was a cousin of Field Marshal [[Hermann Göring]]. Göring, Boehm and Müller-Braunschweig collaborated for a number of years; fourteen non-Jewish German psychoanalysts continued to operate within the new Institute. The one remaining copy of Freud's works was kept in a locked cupboard referred to as the "poison cabinet".&lt;ref&gt;Rolnik (2012), pp. 88-91&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Interlanguage link multi|John Rittmeister|de}}, a physician and psychoanalyst associated with the Institute, as well as [[German resistance to Nazism|resistance fighter against Nazism]], was sentenced to death and executed in May 1943.

'''Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction''' (CORI) was developed in 1993 by Dr. [[John T. Guthrie]] with a team of elementary teachers and graduate students. The project designed and implemented a framework of conceptually oriented reading instruction to improve students' amount and breadth of reading, intrinsic motivations for reading, and strategies of search and [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]]. The framework emphasized five phases of reading instruction in a content domain: observing and personalizing, searching and retrieving, comprehending and integrating, communicating to others, and interacting with peers to construct meaning. CORI instruction was contrasted to experience-based teaching and strategy instruction in terms of its support for motivational and cognitive development.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;

==History==
[[File:CORI Hands-on Experience.jpg|thumb]]
CORI’s aims are to support:

*'''''Reading Comprehension''''' via activating background knowledge, questioning, summarizing, searching, [[Graphic organizer|organizing graphically]], and interpreting stories
*'''''Science Inquiry''''' via observation, using knowledge, questioning, designing investigations, collecting data, drawing conclusions, and explaining results conceptually. The science theme was the survival concepts (ecology) of feeding, [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]], defense, predation, respiration, reproduction, [[competition]], communication, and adjustment to habitat. 
*'''''Motivation''''' via knowledge goals for reading, hands-on experiences, interesting books, choices about learning, and [[collaboration]] with classmates
*'''''Reading and Science Integration''''' via relating observations in hands-on science activities to contents and characters in literary and information books and connecting students' interests in the environment to their motivations for book reading
*'''''Student Writing''''' via writing entries in portfolios that demonstrated the following: information text reading, literary text reading, science concepts, science processes, and motivation for reading.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;

“For nearly 20 years, Guthrie and colleagues have been refining CORI, a program designed to promote a number of literacy goals through the use of broad interdisciplinary themes, primarily drawn from science curricula, such as exploring the impact of humans on animal habitats. CORI provides explicit instruction in reading strategies, such a questioning, activating background knowledge, searching for information, summarizing, and synthesizing information in order to communicate with others. Instruction involves hands-on investigations, inquiry with text, strategy instruction, working in collaborative inquiry teams, and writing to publish and present findings. CORI has been shown to increase students’ science inquiry strategies, and overall text comprehension compared to control classrooms with separate science and literacy curricula and/or strategy instruction in reading alone. Of particular interest in the CORI research is the pivotal role that motivation, in all of its instantiations (interest, self-efficacy, and achievement motivation), plays in learning both science and literacy.” &lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

[[File:CORI Reading.jpg|thumb|left]]
CORI investigated the motivations, cognitive competencies, and instructional support needed to increase reading comprehension and engagement of middle school students in science concepts (ecology) and social studies ([[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]]) through the '''Reading Engagement for Adolescent Learning (REAL) Project'''. Reading comprehension strategies included: activating background knowledge, questioning, summarizing, [[Inference|inferencing]], and concept mapping. Intrinsic motivations included involvement, challenge, curiosity, social interactions, and the teaching of concepts and inquiry skills. Books, educational videos, websites, and other supplemental materials were used to aid students’ learning and teachers’ instruction.&lt;ref name=ref11 /&gt;

The CORI program equipped participating teachers with the skills to accomplish these classroom goals through interactive professional development workshops. These workshops were given several times during the school year with these teacher-desired outcomes in the following areas:&lt;ref name=ref10 /&gt;

'''Classroom practices''': support for motivation; foster engagement with text; sustain reading engagement across the year; energize learning from information text; connect Common Core State Standards to motivation; use research-based approaches

'''Motivation and engagement practices''': setting up partnerships, collaborations, and teams; providing productive choices, large and small; building relevance into reading and writing; encouraging reading values; enabling students to develop their identities; increasing learning in [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]]&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;

'''Integrating cognitive strategy instruction includes guidance to''': teach higher-order reading skills, improve students' information text comprehension, integrate reading in content domains, provide strategy instruction in subject matters, target digital literacies and traditional textbooks

The objective of CORI is to increase the amount of engaged reading through the use of explicit cognitive and motivational supports or scaffolds. Cognitively, the CORI program stresses the learning of conceptual ideas.

==Program Specifics==
[[File:CORI Middle School Reading.jpg|thumb]]
CORI instruction can take place within the domain of any subject matter at any grade level. Lessons are developed for the express purpose of increasing student engagement.  In turn, students’ amount of reading increases, and ultimately, their use of reading strategies, intrinsic motivation, and achievement increase. Texts on a topic are made available to the students, and along with strategy instruction and motivational support, deep understanding of a concept develops.This shows CORI’s emphasis on thematic learning.&lt;ref name=ref7 /&gt;

In keeping with a guided reading model of instruction, lessons were provided for small groups at the struggling reader, on-grade level, and advanced reader levels. Writing and independent reading are part of the CORI program, as is a culminating activity for a unit of study.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6 /&gt;

Teacher training modules, classroom videos, related research articles and books, and research findings in elementary and middle schools on the CORI website www.corilearning.com provide necessary information to become further informed about this program.

The '''Dana/Spicer Model 30''' is an automotive axle manufactured by [[Dana Holding Corporation]], has a history that dates back to the 1930s and can still be seen in [[Jeep]] front ends today.  The Dana 30 has been manufactured as a [[beam axle]] and [[independent suspension]] axle setups.   There are different variations of the Dana 30.

==General specifications==
* Ring Gear measures {{convert|7.12|in|0}}
* OEM Inner axle shaft spline count: 27
* [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] up to 2770 lbs.

==Dana 30 solid axle history==
===Dana 23===
The Dana Spicer 23 is the axle the Dana 30 is loosely based on today, with improvements throughout time. This axle was only made for the rear of vehicles.  [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating| Full floating and semi floating]] variations were produced.
===Dana 25===
The Dana Spicer 25 was based on the Dana 23 and was made only as a front axle for [[Four-wheel drive]] vehicles.  This was the company's first front drive axle.

===Dana 27===
The Dana Spicer 27 unit phased out Dana 23 and Dana 25 units in the 1960s

==Independent front suspension (IFS) Dana 30 axle==
[[Jeep Liberty]] 4x4 models use the Dana 30 in the form of [[Independent suspension]]

In [[concurrent computing]], a '''deadlock''' is a state in which each member of a group is waiting for some other member to take action, such as sending a message or more commonly releasing a [[Lock (computer science)|lock]].&lt;ref name=coulouris&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulouris|first=George|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|title=Distributed Systems Concepts and Design|page=716|isbn=978-0-273-76059-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deadlock is a common problem in [[multiprocessing]] systems, [[parallel computing]], and [[Distributed computing|distributed systems]], where software and hardware locks are used to arbitrate shared resources and implement [[Synchronization (computer science)|process synchronization]].&lt;ref name=para_enclo&gt;{{cite book |last=Padua |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hm6LaufVKFEC&amp;pg=PA524#v=onepage&amp;q=deadlock&amp;f=false |publisher=Springer |year=2011 |title=Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing |page=524 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |isbn=9780387097657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[operating system]], a deadlock occurs when a [[process (computing)|process]] or [[thread (computing)|thread]] enters a waiting [[Process state|state]] because a requested [[system resource]] is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process. If a process is unable to change its state indefinitely because the resources requested by it are being used by another waiting process, then the system is said to be in a deadlock.&lt;ref name="os_galvin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberschatz| first=Abraham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjvX0HmVTlMC&amp;dq=deadlock+operating+systems|publisher=Wiley-India| year=2006 |title=Operating System Principles| edition=7th |page=237 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |isbn=9788126509621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[communications system]], deadlocks occur mainly due to lost or corrupt signals rather than resource contention.&lt;ref name=invi_comp&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=G.

(C) A deadlock occurs when the first process locks the first resource at the same time as the second process locks the second resource. &lt;br /&gt;
(D) The deadlock can be resolved by cancelling and restarting the first process.]]

==Necessary conditions==
A deadlock situation on a resource can arise if and only if all of the following conditions hold simultaneously in a system:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberschatz| first=Abraham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjvX0HmVTlMC&amp;dq=deadlock+operating+systems|publisher=Wiley-India| year=2006 |title=Operating System Principles| edition=7 |page=239 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |isbn=9788126509621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Mutual exclusion]]:'' At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode. Otherwise, the processes would not be prevented from using the resource when necessary. Only one process can use the resource at any given instant of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/classes/ecs150-1999-02/dl-cond.html|title=ECS 150 Spring 1999: Four Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Deadlock|author=|date=|website=nob.cs.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429180831/http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/classes/ecs150-1999-02/dl-cond.html|archivedate=29 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Hold and wait'' or ''resource holding:'' a process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes.
# ''No [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]]:'' a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it. 
# ''Circular wait:'' each process must be waiting for a resource which is being held by another process, which in turn is waiting for the first process to release the resource. In general, there is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of waiting processes, ''P'' = {''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}, such that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for a resource held by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for a resource held by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and so on until ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is waiting for a resource held by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="os_galvin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=embb&gt;{{cite book |last=Shibu |first=K. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hfn4gwR90MC&amp;pg=PA446#v=onepage&amp;q=%22waiting%20for%20a%20resource%22&amp;f=false |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |year=2009 |title=Intro To Embedded Systems |edition=1st |page=446 |accessdate=28 January 2012 |isbn=9780070145894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four conditions are known as the ''Coffman conditions'' from their first description in a 1971 article by [[Edward G. Coffman, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="embb"/&gt;

==Deadlock handling==
Most current operating systems cannot prevent deadlocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberschatz| first=Abraham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjvX0HmVTlMC&amp;dq=deadlock+operating+systems|publisher=Wiley-India |year=2006 |title=Operating System Principles| edition=7 |page=237 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |isbn=9788126509621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a deadlock occurs, different operating systems respond to them in different non-standard manners. Most approaches work by preventing one of the four Coffman conditions from occurring, especially the fourth one.&lt;ref name=pric_os&gt;{{cite book |last=Stuart |first=Brian L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5NC5-UfMMwC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q=coffman%20conditions&amp;f=false |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |title=Principles of operating systems |edition=1st |page=446 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major approaches are as follows.

===Ignoring deadlock===
In this approach, it is assumed that a deadlock will never occur. This is also an application of the [[Ostrich algorithm]].&lt;ref name="pric_os" /&gt;&lt;ref name="distri_tanen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tanenbaum| first=Andrew S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l6sDRvKvCQ0C&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=Tanenbaum%20ostrich&amp;f=false |publisher=Pearson Education |year=1995 |title=Distributed Operating Systems |edition=1st |page=117 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was initially used by [[MINIX]] and [[UNIX]].&lt;ref name="embb"/&gt; This is used when the time intervals between occurrences of deadlocks are large and the data loss incurred each time is tolerable.

===Detection===
Under the deadlock detection, deadlocks are allowed to occur. Then the state of the system is examined to detect that a deadlock has occurred and subsequently it is corrected. An algorithm is employed that tracks resource allocation and process states, it rolls back and restarts one or more of the processes in order to remove the detected deadlock. Detecting a deadlock that has already occurred is easily possible since the resources that each process has locked and/or currently requested are known to the resource scheduler of the operating system.&lt;ref name=distri_tanen /&gt;

After a deadlock is detected, it can be corrected by using one of the following methods:{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}
# ''Process termination:'' one or more processes involved in the deadlock may be aborted. One could choose to abort all competing [[Process (computing)|processes]] involved in the deadlock. This ensures that deadlock is resolved with certainty and speed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} But the expense is high as partial computations will be lost. Or, one could choose to abort one process at a time until the deadlock is resolved. This approach has high overhead because after each abort an algorithm must determine whether the system is still in deadlock.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Several factors must be considered while choosing a candidate for termination, such as priority and age of the process.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}
# ''Resource preemption:'' resources allocated to various processes may be successively preempted and allocated to other processes until the deadlock is broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETD4_9.1.2/lsf_admin/resource_preemption_about.html|title=IBM Knowledge Center|author=|date=|website=www.ibm.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319112925/https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSETD4_9.1.2/lsf_admin/resource_preemption_about.html|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention===
{{main|Deadlock prevention algorithms}}
[[File:Avoiding deadlock.gif|380px|thumbnail|right|
(A) Two processes competing for one resource, following a first-come, first-served policy.

(B) Deadlock occurs when both processes lock the resource simultaneously.

(C) The deadlock can be ''resolved'' by breaking the symmetry of the locks.

(D) The deadlock can be ''prevented'' by breaking the symmetry of the locking mechanism.]]
Deadlock prevention works by preventing one of the four Coffman conditions from occurring.
* Removing the ''mutual exclusion'' condition means that no process will have exclusive access to a resource. This proves impossible for resources that cannot be [[Spooling|spooled]]. But even with spooled resources, deadlock could still occur. Algorithms that avoid mutual exclusion are called [[non-blocking synchronization]] algorithms.
* The ''hold and wait'' or ''resource holding'' conditions may be removed by requiring processes to request all the resources they will need before starting up (or before embarking upon a particular set of operations). This advance knowledge is frequently difficult to satisfy and, in any case, is an inefficient use of resources. Another way is to require processes to request resources only when it has none. Thus, first they must release all their currently held resources before requesting all the resources they will need from scratch. This too is often impractical. It is so because resources may be allocated and remain unused for long periods. Also, a process requiring a popular resource may have to wait indefinitely, as such a resource may always be allocated to some process, resulting in [[resource starvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silberschatz| first=Abraham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjvX0HmVTlMC&amp;dq=deadlock+operating+systems|publisher=Wiley-India| year=2006 |title=Operating System Principles| edition=7 |page=244 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (These algorithms, such as [[serializing tokens]], are known as the ''all-or-none algorithms''.)
* The ''no [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]]'' condition may also be difficult or impossible to avoid as a process has to be able to have a resource for a certain amount of time, or the processing outcome may be inconsistent or [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] may occur. However, inability to enforce preemption may interfere with a ''priority'' algorithm. Preemption of a "locked out" resource generally implies a [[Rollback (data management)|rollback]], and is to be avoided, since it is very costly in overhead. Algorithms that allow preemption include [[lock-free and wait-free algorithms]] and [[optimistic concurrency control]]. If a process holding some resources and requests for some another resource(s) that cannot be immediately allocated to it, the condition may be removed by releasing all the currently being held resources of that process. 
* The final condition is the ''circular wait'' condition. Approaches that avoid circular waits include disabling interrupts during critical sections and using a hierarchy to determine a [[partial order]]ing of resources. If no obvious hierarchy exists, even the memory address of resources has been used to determine ordering and resources are requested in the increasing order of the enumeration.&lt;ref name="os_galvin"/&gt; [[Dining philosophers problem#Resource hierarchy solution|Dijkstra's solution]] can also be used.

== Livelock ==
A ''livelock'' is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing.

The term was defined formally at some time during the 1970s. An early sighting in the published literature is in Babich's 1979 article on program correctness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1979.230192|first=A.F.|last=Babich|title=Proving Total Correctness of Parallel Programs|year=1979|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|volume=SE-5|issue=6|pages=558–574|doi=10.1109/tse.1979.230192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livelock is a special case of [[resource starvation]]; the general definition only states that a specific process is not progressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/anderson01sharedmemory.html|first=James H.|last=Anderson|author2=Yong-jik Kim|title=Shared-memory mutual exclusion: Major research trends since 1986|year=2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525013335/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/anderson01sharedmemory.html|archivedate=25 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livelock is a risk with some [[algorithm]]s that detect and recover from ''deadlock''. If more than one process takes action, the [[deadlock detection algorithm]] can be repeatedly triggered. This can be avoided by ensuring that only one process (chosen arbitrarily or by priority) takes action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/850752.850753 |title=The Deadlock problem: a classifying bibliography | first = Dieter |last = Zöbel | journal = ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review |volume=17 |issue=4 |date=October 1983 |issn=0163-5980 |pages = 6–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distributed deadlock==
Distributed deadlocks can occur in [[distributed systems]] when [[distributed transaction]]s or [[concurrency control]] is being used. Distributed deadlocks can be detected either by constructing a global [[wait-for graph]] from local wait-for graphs at a deadlock detector or by a [[distributed algorithm]] like [[edge chasing]].

''Phantom deadlocks'' are deadlocks that are falsely detected in a distributed system due to system internal delays but don't actually exist. For example, if a process releases a resource ''R1'' and issues a request for ''R2'', and the first message is lost or delayed, a coordinator (detector of deadlocks) could falsely conclude a deadlock (if the request for ''R2'' while having ''R1'' would cause a deadlock).

'''Decoding''', in '''[[semiotics]]''', is the [[wikt:process|process]] of interpreting a [[message]] sent by an addresser to an addressee. The complementary process{{spaced ndash}}creating a message for transmission to an addressee{{spaced ndash}}is called [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoding]].

==Discussion==
All communication depends on the use of [[code (Semiotics)|codes]]. When the message is received, the addressee is not passive, but decoding is more than simply recognising the content of the message. Over time, each [[individual]] in the [[audience]] develops a [[cognitive]] framework of codes which will recall the [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] meaning and suggest possible [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings for each signifier. But the actual meaning for each message is context-dependent: the codified relations between the signifiers in the particular context must be interpreted according to the [[syntactic]], [[semantic]] and social codes so that the most appropriate meaning is attributed (for labelling usages by reference to national characteristics, see [[Americanism (semiotics)|Americanism]]).

Although the addresser may have a very clearly defined intention when encoding and wish to manipulate the audience into accepting the preferred meaning, the reality is not that of textual [[determinism]]. What is decoded does not follow inevitably from an interpretation of the message. Not infrequently, the addressees find different levels of meaning. [[Umberto Eco]] called this mismatch between the intended meaning and interpreted meaning [[aberrant decoding]].  This apparent failure of [[communication]] may result from the fact that the parties use different codes because they are of a different [[social class]] or because they have different training or ability, because they have different [[world view]]s or [[ideologies]], or because they are from different [[culture]]s.  David Morley argues that the outcome of decoding will be influenced by [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] issues, i.e. whether: 
*the addressee has the ability to comprehend the message in its entirety; 
*the message is relevant to the addressee; 
*the addressee is enjoying the experience of receiving the message; and 
*the addressee accepts or rejects the addresser's [[value (Semiotics)|values]].
Further, [[Umberto Eco]] suggests a distinction between ''closed'' texts which predispose a dominant interpretation and more ''open'' texts which may have latent meanings or be encoded in a way that encourages the possibility of alternative interpretations.

'''Degenerate matter'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22952145|title=Academic Press dictionary of science and technology|last=|first=|date=1992|publisher=Academic Press|others=Morris, Christopher G., Academic Press.|year=|isbn=0122004000|location=San Diego|pages=662|oclc=22952145}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a highly dense [[state of matter|state]] of [[Fermion|fermionic]] matter in which particles must occupy high states of kinetic energy in order to satisfy the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. The description applies to matter composed of [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s or other fermions. The term is mainly used in [[astrophysics]] to refer to dense stellar objects where gravitational pressure is so extreme that [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects are significant. This type of matter is naturally found in stars in their final evolutionary states, like [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s, where thermal pressure alone is not enough to avoid gravitational collapse.

Degenerate matter is usually modelled as an ideal [[Fermi gas]], an ensemble of non-interacting fermions. In a quantum mechanical description, particles limited to a finite volume may take only a discrete set of energies, called [[quantum state]]s. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prevents identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state. At lowest total energy (when the thermal energy of the particles is negligible), all the lowest energy quantum states are filled. This state is referred to as full degeneracy. This '''degeneracy pressure''' remains non-zero even at absolute zero temperature.&lt;ref name="apod.nasa.gov"&gt;see http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100228.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Andrew G. Truscott, Kevin E. Strecker, William I. McAlexander, Guthrie Partridge, and Randall G. Hulet, "Observation of Fermi Pressure in a Gas of Trapped Atoms", Science, 2 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Adding particles or reducing the volume forces the particles into higher-energy quantum states. In this situation, a compression force is required, and is made manifest as a resisting pressure. The key feature is that this degeneracy pressure does not depend on the temperature but only on the density of the fermions. Degeneracy pressure keeps dense stars in equilibrium, independent of the thermal structure of the star.

A degenerate mass whose fermions have velocities close to the speed of light (particle energy larger than its [[rest mass energy]]) is called '''relativistic degenerate matter'''.

The concept of '''degenerate stars''', stellar objects composed of degenerate matter, was originally developed in a joint effort between [[Arthur Eddington]], [[Ralph Fowler]] and [[Arthur Milne]]. Eddington had suggested that the atoms in [[Sirius|Sirius B]] were almost completely ionised and closely packed. Fowler described white dwarfs as composed of a gas of particles that became degenerate at low temperature. Milne proposed that degenerate matter is found in most of the nucleus of stars, not only in [[compact star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=R.

==Concept==
{{Main|Fermi gas}}
If a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is cooled and under increasing pressure, it will eventually not be possible to compress the plasma any further. This constraint is due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two fermions cannot share the same quantum state. When in this highly compressed state, since there is no extra space for any particles, a particle's location is extremely defined. Since the locations of the particles of a highly compressed plasma have very low uncertainty, their momentum is extremely uncertain. The Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] states 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p \Delta x \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where Δ''p'' is the uncertainty in the particle's momentum and Δ''x'' is the uncertainty in position. Therefore, even though the plasma is cold, such particles must on average be moving very fast. Large kinetic energies lead to the conclusion that, in order to compress an object into a very small space, tremendous force is required to control its particles' momentum.

Unlike a classical [[ideal gas]], whose pressure is proportional to its [[temperature]]
:&lt;math&gt;PV=Nk_{\rm B}T &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is the volume, ''N'' is the number of particles—typically atoms or molecules—''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and ''T'' is temperature), the pressure exerted by degenerate matter depends only weakly on its temperature. In particular, the pressure remains nonzero even at [[absolute zero]] temperature. At relatively low densities, the pressure of a fully degenerate gas can be derived by treating the system as an ideal Fermi gas, in this way
:&lt;math&gt;P=K\left(\frac{N}{V}\right)^{5/3}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''K'' depends on the properties of the particles making up the gas. At very high densities, where most of the particles are forced into quantum states with [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|relativistic energies]], the pressure is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P=K\left(\frac{N}{V}\right)^{4/3}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where ''K'' again depends on the properties of the particles making up the gas.&lt;ref&gt;''Stellar Structure and Evolution'' section 15.3 – R Kippenhahn &amp; A. Weigert, 1990, 3rd printing 1994. {{ISBN|0-387-58013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All matter experiences both normal thermal pressure and degeneracy pressure, but in commonly encountered gases, thermal pressure dominates so much that degeneracy pressure can be ignored. Likewise, degenerate matter still has normal thermal pressure, but at extremely high densities, the degeneracy pressure usually dominates.

Exotic examples of degenerate matter include neutron degenerate matter, [[strange matter]], [[metallic hydrogen]] and white dwarf matter. Degeneracy pressure contributes to the pressure of conventional solids, but these are not usually considered to be degenerate matter because a significant contribution to their pressure is provided by electrical repulsion of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the screening of nuclei from each other by electrons. In metals it is useful to treat the [[Conductor (material)|conduction]] electrons alone as a degenerate [[Free electron model|free electron gas]], while the majority of the electrons are regarded as occupying bound quantum states. This solid state contrasts with degenerate matter that forms the body of a white dwarf, where most of the electrons would be treated as occupying free particle momentum states.

== Degenerate gases ==

Degenerate gases are gases composed of fermions such as electrons, protons, and neutrons rather than molecules of ordinary matter. The electron gas in ordinary metals and in the interior of white dwarfs are two examples. Following the Pauli exclusion principle, there can be only one fermion occupying each quantum state. In a degenerate gas, all quantum states are filled up to the Fermi energy. Most stars are supported against their own gravitation by normal thermal gas pressure, while in white dwarf stars the supporting force comes from the degeneracy pressure of the electron gas in their interior. In neutron stars, the degenerate particles are neutrons.

A fermion gas in which all quantum states below a given energy level are filled is called a fully degenerate fermion gas. The difference between this energy level and the lowest energy level is known as the Fermi energy.

=== Electron degeneracy ===
{{Main|Electron degeneracy pressure}}
In an ordinary fermion gas in which thermal effects dominate, most of the available electron energy levels are unfilled and the electrons are free to move to these states. As particle density is increased, electrons progressively fill the lower energy states and additional electrons are forced to occupy states of higher energy even at low temperatures. Degenerate gases strongly resist further compression because the electrons cannot move to already filled lower energy levels due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Since electrons cannot give up energy by moving to lower energy states, no thermal energy can be extracted. The momentum of the fermions in the fermion gas nevertheless generates pressure, termed 'degeneracy pressure'.

Under high densities the matter becomes a degenerate gas when the electrons are all stripped from their parent atoms. In the core of a star, once hydrogen burning in [[nuclear fusion]] reactions stops, it becomes a collection of positively charged [[ion]]s, largely helium and carbon nuclei, floating in a sea of electrons, which have been stripped from the nuclei. Degenerate gas is an almost perfect conductor of heat and does not obey the ordinary gas laws. [[White dwarf]]s are luminous not because they are generating any energy but rather because they have trapped a large amount of heat which is gradually radiated away. Normal gas exerts higher pressure when it is heated and expands, but the pressure in a degenerate gas does not depend on the temperature. When gas becomes super-compressed, particles position right up against each other to produce degenerate gas that behaves more like a solid. In degenerate gases the [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] of electrons are quite high and the rate of collision between electrons and other particles is quite low, therefore degenerate electrons can travel great distances at velocities that approach the speed of light. Instead of temperature, the pressure in a degenerate gas depends only on the speed of the degenerate particles; however, adding heat does not increase the speed of most of the electrons, because they are stuck in fully occupied quantum states. Pressure is increased only by the mass of the particles, which increases the gravitational force pulling the particles closer together. Therefore, the phenomenon is the opposite of that normally found in matter where if the mass of the matter is increased, the object becomes bigger. In degenerate gas, when the mass is increased, the pressure is increased, and the particles become spaced closer together, so the object becomes smaller. Degenerate gas can be compressed to very high densities, typical values being in the range of 10,000 kilograms per cubic centimeter.

There is an upper limit to the mass of an electron-degenerate object, the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], beyond which [[electron degeneracy pressure]] cannot support the object against collapse. The limit is approximately 1.44&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105468/Chandrasekhar-limit ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[solar mass]]es for objects with typical compositions expected for white dwarf stars (carbon and oxygen with 2 baryons per electron). This mass cutoff is appropriate only for a star supported by ideal electron degeneracy pressure under Newtonian gravity; in [[general relativity]] and with realistic Coulomb corrections, the corresponding mass limit is around 1.38 solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;Rotondo, M. et al. 2010, Phys. Rev. D, 84, 084007, https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0154&lt;/ref&gt; The limit may also change with the chemical composition of the object, as it affects the ratio of mass to number of electrons present. Celestial objects below this limit are [[white dwarf]] stars, formed by the gradual shrinking of the cores of [[star]]s that run out of fuel. During this shrinking, an electron-degenerate gas forms in the core, providing sufficient degeneracy pressure as it is compressed to resist further collapse. Above this mass limit, a [[neutron star]] (partially supported by neutron degeneracy pressure) or a [[black hole]] may be formed instead.

=== Neutron degeneracy === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Neutronium]] --&gt;

Neutron degeneracy is analogous to electron degeneracy and is demonstrated in neutron stars, which are partially supported by the pressure from a degenerate neutron gas.&lt;ref name="physics-of-neutron-stars"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Physics of Neutron Stars |first=A. Y. |last=Potekhin |year=2011 |journal= Physics-Uspekhi|volume=53 |issue=12 |pages=1235 |arxiv=1102.5735 |bibcode = 2010PhyU...53.1235Y |doi = 10.3367/UFNe.0180.201012c.1279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse may happen when the core of a white dwarf is above the vicinity of 1.4 [[solar mass]]es, which is the Chandrasekhar limit, and the collapse is not halted by the pressure of degenerate electrons. As the star collapses, the Fermi energy of the electrons increases to the point where it is energetically favorable for them to combine with protons to produce neutrons (via inverse [[beta decay]], also termed [[electron capture]] and "neutronization"). The result is an extremely compact star composed of [[nuclear matter]], which is predominantly a degenerate neutron gas, sometimes called [[neutronium]], with a small admixture of degenerate proton and electron gases (and at higher densities, muons).

Neutrons in a degenerate neutron gas are spaced much more closely than electrons in an electron-degenerate gas because the more massive neutron has a much shorter [[Matter wave|wavelength]] at a given energy. Typical separations are comparable with the size of the neutron and the range of the strong nuclear force, and it is actually the repulsive nature of the latter at small separations that primarily supports neutron stars more massive than 0.7 solar masses (which includes all measured neutron stars). In the case of neutron stars and white dwarfs, this phenomenon is compounded by the fact that the pressures within neutron stars are much higher than those in white dwarfs. The pressure increase is caused by the fact that the compactness of a neutron star causes gravitational forces to be much higher than in a less compact body with similar mass. The result is a star with a diameter on the order of a thousandth that of a white dwarf.

There is an upper limit to the mass of a neutron-degenerate object, the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]], which is analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit for electron-degenerate objects. The limit for objects supported by ideal neutron degeneracy pressure is only 0.75 solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, J.R., Volkoff, G.M., 1939, Phys. Rev. 55, 374, http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.55.374&lt;/ref&gt; For more realistic models including baryon interaction, the precise limit is unknown, as it depends on the [[equation of state|equations of state]] of nuclear matter, for which a highly accurate model is not yet available. Above this limit, a neutron star may collapse into a black hole or into other, denser forms of degenerate matter (such as [[QCD matter|quark matter]]) if these forms exist and have suitable properties (mainly related to degree of compressibility, or "stiffness", described by the equations of state).

=== Proton degeneracy ===

Sufficiently dense matter containing protons experiences proton degeneracy pressure, in a manner similar to the electron degeneracy pressure in electron-degenerate matter: protons confined to a sufficiently small volume have a large uncertainty in their momentum due to the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. However, because protons are much more massive than electrons, the same momentum represents a much smaller velocity for protons than for electrons. As a result, in matter with approximately equal numbers of protons and electrons, proton degeneracy pressure is much smaller than electron degeneracy pressure, and proton degeneracy is usually modelled as a correction to the [[equations of state]] of electron-degenerate matter.

=== Quark degeneracy ===

At densities greater than those supported by neutron degeneracy, [[QCD matter|quark matter]] is expected to occur. Several variations of this hypothesis have been proposed that represent quark-degenerate states. [[Strange matter]] is a degenerate gas of quarks that is often assumed to contain [[strange quark]]s in addition to the usual [[up quark|up]] and [[down quark|down]] quarks. [[color superconductivity|Color superconductor]] materials are degenerate gases of quarks in which quarks pair up in a manner similar to [[Cooper pair]]ing in electrical [[superconductor]]s. The equations of state for the various proposed forms of quark-degenerate matter vary widely, and are usually also poorly defined, due to the difficulty of modeling [[strong interaction|strong force]] interactions.

Quark-degenerate matter may occur in the cores of neutron stars, depending on the equations of state of neutron-degenerate matter. It may also occur in hypothetical [[quark star]]s, formed by the collapse of objects above the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit|Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff mass limit]] for neutron-degenerate objects. Whether quark-degenerate matter forms at all in these situations depends on the equations of state of both neutron-degenerate matter and quark-degenerate matter, both of which are poorly known. Quark stars are considered to be an intermediate category among neutron stars and black holes. Few scientists claim that quark stars and black holes are one and the same. Not enough data exist to support any hypothesis but neutron stars with awkward spectrums have been used in arguments.{{explanation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Singularity ===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
{{original research section|date=October 2017}}

At densities greater than those supported by any degeneracy, gravity overwhelms all other forces. The stellar body collapses to form a [[black hole]], though this is not well modeled by quantum mechanics. At the same time, the material must be converted from [[fermion]]s, subject to degeneracy pressure, to [[boson]]s, which are not. Current hypothesis suggest gluons as the most likely boson thought possible.

In the [[frame of reference]] that is co-moving with the collapsing matter, [[General Relativity|general relativity]] models without [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum mechanics]] have all the matter ending up in an infinitely dense [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the center of the [[event horizon]]. (If one uses the [[unified field theory|UFT]] [[Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations|Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac system]] or its generalizations, then the singularity is avoided and one ends up with a quark star, possibly surrounded by an event horizon.) It is a general result of quantum mechanics that no fermion can be confined in a space smaller than its own wavelength, making such a singularity impossible, unless only bosons are present, but there is no widely accepted theory that combines general relativity and quantum mechanics sufficiently to tell us what the structure inside a black hole might be. If bosons can be conclusively ruled out, one possible theory is that constituent particles decompose into [[string (physics)|strings]], forming a structure called a [[fuzzball (string theory)|fuzzball]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2172">In [[telecommunication]], '''degradation''' is the loss of quality of an electronic signal, which may be categorized as either "''[[graceful degradation|graceful]]''" or "''catastrophic''", and has the following meanings: 

#The deterioration in quality, level, or standard of performance of a [[functional unit]]. 
#In [[telecommunication|communications]], a condition in which one or more of the required performance parameters fall outside predetermined limits, resulting in a lower [[quality of service]]. 

There are several forms and causes of degradation in electric signals, both in the [[time domain]] and in the physical domain, including [[runt pulse]], [[voltage spike]], [[jitter]], [[wander]], swim, [[Drift (telecommunication)|drift]], [[glitch]], [[ringing (signal)|ringing]], [[crosstalk]], antenna effect (not the same [[antenna effect]] as in IC manufacturing), and [[phase noise]].

Degradation usually refers to reduction in quality of an analog or digital signal. When a signal is being transmitted or received, it undergoes changes which are undesirable. These changes are called degradation. Degradation is usually caused by:

# Weather or environmental conditions.
# Terrain
# Other signals.
# Faulty or poor quality equipment.

==Weather conditions==
{{Confusing section|reason=transmitter frequency is usually not changed in response to temperature changes.|date=August 2014}}
A signal has two important factors: frequency and wavelength. If weather is fine and temperature is normal, the signal can be transmitted within given frequency and wavelength limits. The signal travels with velocity ''c'' ≤ 3*10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s, which is equal to the speed of light. For frequency ''f'' Hz and wavelength ''λ'' m, we have
:                                       ''f'' = ''c''/''λ''.
As such, when weather conditions deteriorate, frequency ''f'' has to be increased. This causes the wavelength ''λ'' to decrease, which means that the signal then travels lesser distance.

The '''Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə ˈoːʁi̯ɛnt ɡəˈzɛlʃaft|lang}}, ''German Oriental Society''), abbreviated '''DOG''', is a [[Germany|German]] [[Eingetragener Verein|voluntary association]] based in [[Berlin]] dedicated to the study of the [[Near East]].

The DOG was officially founded in January 1898 to foster public interest in [[orient]]al [[antiquities]], and to promote related [[archaeology|archaeological]] research. It competed with similar bodies in France and England, and reflected an increased enthusiasm to learn about the [[Bible lands]] in the late 19th century.  DOG focused on the cultures of the [[Middle East]] from early times to the [[Islam]]ic period.

The founders of the DOG included a number of powerful, well-connected and wealthy members of German society, including [[Henri James Simon]] and banker [[Franz von Mendelssohn]].  Their wealth enabled the DOG to undertake expensive excavations in the Middle East.  [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] developed an interest in archaeology, and took the DOG under his protection from 1901, funding excavations with grants from Imperial funds.  It was officially a subsidiary of the German museum administration, so its finds automatically belonged to the [[Prussia]]n state.  Its work was aided by friendly relations established between the German and [[Ottoman Empire]]s.
 
Work was interrupted by the [[World Wars]].  The DOG was reestablished in 1947, and celebrated its centennial at the [[Pergamon Museum]] in 1998.

==Excavations==
DOG undertook excavations in [[Babylon]] from 1899 to 1917, directed by [[Robert Koldewey]], uncovering the [[Ishtar Gate]], the palaces of [[Nebuchadnezzar]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]].  Koldewey also claimed to have discovered the [[Tower of Babel]].

[[Ludwig Borchardt]] led DOG excavations in [[Egypt]] in 1902 at the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[necropolis]] of [[Abusir]] and then, from 1911 to 1914, at the ruins of [[Tell el-Amarna]], where the famous [[bust of Nefertiti]], now in Berlin's [[Ägyptisches Museum]], was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]].

[[Walter Andrae]] led DOG excavations at [[Assyria]]n capital of [[Assur]] from 1903 to 1914, and [[Hugo Winckler]] excavated at [[Boğazköy]] in Turkey from 1906 to 1911, uncovering the capital of the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Hattuša]].  Other excavations before the First World War took place at sites at across the [[Fertile Crescent]] - in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Turkey]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]] - including [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Capernaum]], [[Borsippa]], [[Hatra]], [[Jericho]], [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]], and [[Uruk]], but the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in August 1914 terminated DOG's excavations.

After the DOG was reestablished following the Second World War, more recent excavations have taken place at [[Habuba Kabira]] from 1969 to 1975, at Tall Munbāqa (also Ekalte ([[Mumbaqat]])) in northern [[Syria]] from 1969 to 2012, near Bogazköy from 1996 to 1999, [[Kuşaklı|Sarissa]] in 1995, [[Urkesh]] in 1998, and [[Qatna]] in 1999.

The DOG produces the annual publications, ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft'' (''MDOG'') and ''Alter Orient aktuell''.

'''Earth mysteries''' are a wide range of [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[Pseudoreligion|quasi-religious]] and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] ideas focusing on cultural and religious beliefs about the [[Earth]], generally with regard to particular geographical locations of historical significance.&lt;ref name=hutton&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|first=Ronald |last=Hutton |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1993 |pages=118–9, 123, 125, 340|isbn=0631189467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in Earth mysteries generally consider certain locations to be "sacred",  or  that certain spiritual "energies" may be active at those locations.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv&gt;{{cite book|title=Claiming Sacred Ground: Pilgrims and Politics at Glastonbury and Sedona |first=Adrian J. |last=Ivakhiv|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=22, 24, 32|year= 2001|isbn=0253338999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[alternative archaeology]]" has also been used to describe the study of Earth mystery beliefs.&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt;

The study of [[ley line]]s originates in the 1920s with [[Alfred Watkins]]. The term "Earth mysteries" for this field of interest was coined about 1970 in ''The Ley Hunter'' journal,&lt;ref&gt;earlier use of the term "earth-mysteries" mostly refers to actual [[mystery religion|mysteries]] dedicated to [[chthonic]] deities in classical antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; and the associated concepts have been embraced and reinvented by movements such as the [[New Age Movement]] and [[neopaganism|modern paganism]] during the 1970s to 1980s.&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;

Some New Age believers engage in travel to locations they consider important according to their beliefs; for example, [[Stonehenge]] is a popular destination among New Age seekers.&lt;ref name=hetherington&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Travellers: Vanloads of Uproarious Humanity |first=Kevin |last=Hetherington |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |pages=143|year=2000|isbn=0304339784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macdonald &gt;{{cite book|title=Theorizing Museums: Representing Identity and Diversity in a Changing World|first=Sharon |last=Macdonald|author2=Gordon Fyfe |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0631201513|pages=156,164–6,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Earth mysteries can be traced back to two 17th-century [[antiquarians]]: [[John Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley]], who both believed that [[Stonehenge]] was associated with the [[druids]]. Stukeley mixed together ancient [[monuments]] and [[mythology]] towards an "idealized vision" of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzmwsF-O3fIC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxL0TcO2GI618QOhnNyPBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;f=false|title=The Cultures of Celebrations|first1=Ray Broadus|last1=Browne|first2=Michael T.|last2=Marsden|date=31 December 1994|publisher=Popular Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ley lines" were postulated by  [[Alfred Watkins]] in 1921 at a presentation at the [[Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club]], later published in ''Early British Trackways'' (1922) and ''The Old Straight Track'' (1925). Watkins formed the ''Old Straight Track Club'' in 1927, which was active until 1935 but became defunct during the World War II period.{{Citation needed|reason=Mention of organization becoming defunct, but no date or source are provided|date=February 2017}}

A revival of interest in the topic began in the 1960s, now associated with [[neopagan]] currents like [[Wicca]], and with [[ufology]]. Watkins' Straight Track Club was revived in 1962 by [[Philip Heselton]] and others as the Ley Hunters' Club. The new club's journal ''The Ley Hunter'' was issued from 1965 to 1970, subtitled "the Magazine of Earth Mysteries".{{Citation needed|reason=Reference to a journal and its content, without sources or external links|date=February 2017}}

British writer John Ivimy wrote a book in 1975 called ''The Sphinx and the Megaliths'' in which he linked the Egyptian [[Sphinx]] to the British [[Stonehenge]] and other [[megalith|megalithic structures]] claiming they were all built by a group of "elite trained" people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ex3FSCaY_4C&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SiH1TaCLO5C38QO8q5yzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=29 August 1974|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Age boom]] of the 1980s expanded the scope of the "Earth mysteries" field beyond the British landscape, and Earth mysteries as a "New Age invented tradition" by the 1990s could include the study of ancient sites and landscapes (including [[archaeology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], and [[ley lines]]), Chinese [[geomancy]] or [[feng shui]], western magical concepts of [[gematria]], and [[dowsing]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=1053-4202&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=4&amp;doubleissueno=0&amp;article=237261&amp;suppno=0&amp;jstor=False| journal=Anthropology of Consciousness |volume= 6| issue = 4. |date=December 1995 |pages=31–45|title=Inventing Traditions for the New Age: A Case Study of the Earth Energy Tradition |author=JEFFERY L. MACDONALD|doi=10.1525/ac.1995.6.4.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important writer combining these fields during the 1970s to 2000s was [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]. Michell's book ''The View Over Atlantis'' mixed [[ley lines]] with [[folklore]] and [[archeology]]; these ideas became popularised as "earth mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;Danny Sullivan, Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery, Publisher Green Magic, 2005, p. 11 {{ISBN|0954296346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other 1980s authors on the subject of Earth mysteries include [[Paul Devereux]] and [[Nigel Pennick]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews, Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus, Publisher: Inner Traditions, 2004, p. 55 {{ISBN|9780892810918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include the "[[landscape archaeology]]" advocated by German author Kurt Derungs from about 1990, and the wider field of "[[Forteana]]", a term taken to include [[paranormal]] phenomena more generally.{{Citation needed|reason=Assertion of connection to [[Forteana]], which makes no references to either archaelogy or paranormal locations. |date=February 2017}}

==Publication history==

Books on Earth mysteries first appeared in the 1970s, discussing topics such as [[ley lines]], [[earth energy|earth energies]], [[astro-archaeology]], [[Sacred natural site|sacred landscapes]], [[megalithic monuments]], [[shamanism]], [[paganism]], [[dowsing]] and [[folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Moorey, Earth Mysteries: A Beginner's Guide, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daren Kemp, James R. Lewis, Handbook of New Age, 2007, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Proponents consider the Earth mysteries to be "[[sacred]]" and "[[Mythopoeic thought|mythopoeic]]" rather than scientific.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The ley lines idea has been generally ignored by the academic establishment in the field of archaeology.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The work of researchers who support the paranormal aspects of Earth mysteries have been extensively criticized by "professional debunkers" such as [[James Randi]], [[Martin Gardner]], and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]]).&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt;

The Earth mysteries movement in Great Britain embraced the term "ritual landscapes" that was used in British archaeology starting in the 1980s, with regards to "sacred" locations apparently used for mainly ceremonial purposes in the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] and the early [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]; the concept has been both adopted and criticized in the field of academic archaeology.&lt;ref name= Robb&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 'ritual landscape' concept in archaeology: a heritage construction| url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a769326307~db=all |author=John G.

The '''endosperm''' is a tissue produced inside the [[seed]]s of most of the [[flowering plant]]s following fertilization. It surrounds the [[embryo]] and provides nutrition in the form of [[starch]], though it can also contain [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s and [[protein]]. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in animal diet. For example, [[wheat]] endosperm is ground into flour for [[bread]] (the rest of the grain is included as well in [[whole wheat flour]]), while [[barley]] endosperm is the main source of sugars for [[beer]] production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are [[coconut]] "meat" and coconut "water",&lt;ref&gt;[http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph10.htm retrieved 14 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maize|corn]]. Some plants, such as [[orchid]]s, lack endosperm in their [[seed]]s.

==Origin of endosperm==

Ancestral flowering plants have seeds with small embryos and abundant endosperm, and the evolutionary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with mature seeds with little or no endosperm. In more derived flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is non developed or consumed before the seed matures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seedbiology.de/dormancy.asp#evolution |title=The Seed Biology Place - Seed Dormancy |publisher=Seedbiology.de |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman1998&gt;{{citation | author = Friedman, William E. | year = 1998 | title = The evolution of double fertilization and endosperm: an "historical" perspective | journal = Sexual Plant Reproduction | volume = 11 | page = 6 | doi = 10.1007/s004970050114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double fertilization===
Endosperm is formed when the two [[sperm|sperm nuclei]] inside a [[pollen]] grain reach the interior of a female gametophyte (sometimes called the [[ovule|embryo sac]]). One sperm nucleus fertilizes the [[egg cell]], forming a [[zygote]], while the other sperm nucleus usually fuses with the binucleate central cell, forming a primary endosperm cell (its nucleus is often called the ''triple fusion nucleus''). That cell created in the process of [[double fertilisation|double fertilization]] develops into the endosperm. Because it is formed by a separate fertilization, the endosperm constitutes an organism separate from the growing embryo.

About 70% of angiosperm species have endosperm cells that are [[polyploid]].&lt;ref name=Olsen2007&gt;{{citation | author = Olsen, By Odd-Arne| year = 2007 | title = Endosperm: Developmental and Molecular Biology | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFEA8Gg5_hAC|journal = | isbn = 9783540712350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are typically [[triploid]] (containing three sets of chromosomes), but can vary widely from [[diploid]] (2n) to 15n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/9/rEVIEWS/1026/figure/F1 |title=Figure 1 |doi=10.1186/gb-2002-3-9-reviews1026 |publisher=genomebiology.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One species of flowering plant, ''[[Nuphar|Nuphar polysepala]]'', has been shown to have endosperm that is diploid, resulting from the fusion of a pollen nucleus with one, rather than two, maternal nuclei. The same is supposed for some other basal angiosperms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Identification of diploid endosperm in an early angiosperm lineage |author=Williams J. H., Friedman W. E. |journal=Letters to Nature |volume=415 |issue=6871 |pages=522 |date=2002 |doi=10.1038/415522a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that early in the development of angiosperm lineages, there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction, producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes, and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio.&lt;ref name=Friedman2003&gt;{{citation | last = Friedman | first =  William E. | year = 2003 | title = Modularity of the Angiosperm Female Gametophyte and Its Bearing on the Early Evolution of Endosperm in Flowering Plants| journal = Evolution| volume = 57| pages = 216–30| doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00257.x| url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118867819/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 | pmid = 12683519 | last2 = Williams | first2 = JH | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endosperm formation===
There are three types of Endosperm development:

'''Nuclear endosperm formation''' - where repeated free-nuclear divisions take place; if a cell wall is formed it will form after free-nuclear divisions. Commonly referred to as liquid endosperm. Coconut water is an example of this.

'''Cellular endosperm formation''' - where a cell-wall formation is coincident with nuclear divisions. Coconut meat is cellular endosperm. Acoraceae has cellular endosperm development while other monocots are helobial.

'''Helobial endosperm formation''' - Where a cell wall is laid down between the first two nuclei, after which one half develops endosperm along the cellular pattern and the other half along the nuclear pattern.

== Evolutionary origins ==
The evolutionary origins of double fertilization and endosperm are unclear, attracting researcher attention for over a century. There are the two major hypotheses:&lt;ref&gt;[http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/9/reviews/1026 Célia Baroux, Charles Spillane, Ueli Grossniklaus (2002)]. Evolutionary origins of the endosperm in flowering plants. Genome Biol. 3(9)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The double fertilization initially used to produce two identical, independent embryos ("twins"). Later these embryos acquired different roles, one growing into the mature organism, and another merely supporting it. Thus the early endosperm was probably diploid, like the embryo. Some [[gymnosperms]], such as ''[[Ephedra (genus)]]'', may produce twin embryos by double fertilization. Either of these two embryos is capable of filling in the seed, but normally only one develops further (the other eventually aborts). Also, most basal angiosperms still contain the four-cell embryo sac and produce diploid endosperms.
* Endosperm is the evolutionary remnant of the actual [[gametophyte]], similar to the complex multicellular gametophytes found in gymnosperms. In this case, acquisition of the additional nucleus from the sperm cell is a later evolutionary step. This nucleus may provide the parental (not only maternal) organism with some control over endosperm development. Becoming triploid or polyploid are later evolutionary steps of this "primary gametophyte". Nonflowering seed plants (conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, Ephedra) form a large homozygous female gametophyte to nourish the embryo within a seed.&lt;ref&gt;[Friedman WE (1995)] Organismal duplication, inclusive fitness theory, and altruism: understanding the evolution of endosperm and the angiosperm reproductive syndrome. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Apr 25;92(9):3913-7.{{PMID|11607532}}[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC42072/pdf/pnas01493-0289.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of endosperm in seed development==
In some groups (e.g. grains of the family [[Poaceae]]) the endosperm persists to the mature seed stage as a storage tissue, in which case the seeds are called "albuminous" or "endospermous", and in others it is absorbed during embryo development (e.g., most members of the family [[Fabaceae]], including the [[common bean]], ''Phaseolus vulgaris''), in which case the seeds are called "exalbuminous" or "cotyledonous" and the function of storage tissue is performed by enlarged [[cotyledons]] ("seed leaves"). In certain species (e.g. corn, ''Zea mays''); the storage function is distributed between both endosperm and the embryo.  Some mature endosperm tissue stores fats (e.g. [[castor bean]], ''Ricinus communis'') and others (including grains, such as wheat and corn) store mainly starches.

The dust-like seeds of [[orchid]]s have no endosperm. Orchid seedlings are [[mycoheterotrophy|mycoheterotrophic]] in their early development. In some other species, such as [[coffee]], the endosperm also does not develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Houk | first1 = W. G. | title = Endosperm and Perisperm of Coffee with Notes on the Morphology of the Ovule and Seed Development | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–61 | doi = 10.2307/2436631 | year = 1938 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 2436631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the [[nucellus]] produces a nutritive tissue termed "perisperm". The endosperm of some species is responsible for [[seed dormancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Mechanisms of plant growth and improved productivity: modern approaches edited by  Amarjit S. Basra 1994.
{{ISBN|0-8247-9192-4}} p.&lt;/ref&gt; Endosperm tissue also mediates the transfer of nutrients from the mother plant to the embryo, it acts as a location for gene imprinting, and is responsible for aborting seeds produced from genetically mismatched parents.&lt;ref name="Olsen2007"/&gt; In angiosperms, the endosperm contain hormones such as [[cytokinin]]s, which regulate cellular differentiation and embryonic organ formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Pearson, Lorentz C. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The diversity and evolution of plants | year=1995 | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton  | isbn=0-8493-2483-1 | page=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cereal grains==
[[Cereal]] crops are grown for their edible [[fruit]] ([[cereal|grains]] or [[caryopsis|caryopses]]), which are primarily endosperm. In the caryopsis, the thin fruit wall is fused to the seed coat. Therefore, the nutritious part of the grain is the seed and its endosperm. In some cases (e.g. wheat, rice) the endosperm is selectively retained in food processing (commonly called white flour), and the embryo (germ) and seed coat (bran) removed. The processed grain has a lower quality of nutrition. Endosperm thus has an important role within the human diet worldwide.

The [[aleurone]] is the outer layer of endosperm cells, present in all small grains and retained in many dicots with transient endosperm. The cereal aleurone functions for both storage and digestion.

'''Escapist fiction''' is [[fiction]] that provides a psychological escape from thoughts of everyday life by immersing the reader in exotic situations or activities.

The term is not used favorably, though the condemnation contained in it may be slight. Those who defend works described as escapist from the charge either assert that they are not escapist—such as that a [[science fiction]] novel's satiric aspects address real life—or defend the notion of "escape" as such, not "escapism"—as in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s "[[On Fairy-Stories]]" and [[C. S. Lewis]]'s quotation, in his "On Science Fiction" of Tolkien's question of who would be most hostile to the idea of escape, and his answer: jailers.

Genres that can include elements of escapist fiction include:
* [[Bodice ripper]]s/[[Romance novel]]s
* [[Detective novel]]s
* [[Fantasy fiction]]
* [[Horror fiction]]
* [[Pulp magazines|Pulp fiction]]
* [[Science fiction]]
* [[Spy novel]]s
* [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]s

The '''Fisheries Research and Development Corporation''' (FRDC) is a statutory authority that manages research and development investment by the [[Australian Government]] and the Australian fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Investing for tomorrow's fish: the FRDC's research, development and extension plan 2010–2015 | year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9808007-1-5 | publisher=FRDC |url = http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/RDE_plan_2010-2015_final.pdf |location=Canberra |p=i }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==

The FRDC is one of fifteen Australian rural research and development corporations managing investment by the [[Australian Government]] and primary industries that during the past 25 years has been crucial to the doubling of the productivity of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rural R&amp;D corporations |url=http://www.ruralrdc.com.au/Page/Home.aspx |accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its inception in 1992, the Corporation's major focus was on research concerning the management of commercial wild-catch fisheries and, to a lesser extent, aquaculture. Since then, the scope has widened greatly to encompass economic, environmental and social aspects of the entire fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors – that is, the recreational and indigenous customary sectors in addition to the commercial wild-catch and aquaculture sectors.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=4}} The Corporation’s strategic investments in research, development and extension activities benefit all its stakeholders (listed below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Fisheries Research and Development Corporation annual report 2012–2013 | date=2013| url = http://frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Annual_Report/FRDC_Annual_Report_2013.pdf | publisher=FRDC |location=Canberra |p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FRDC is unique among the corporations in balancing its investment between natural resource management and industry productivity and development. Therefore, a significant proportion of funding is directed at research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=17}}

In fulfilling its role of planning, investing in and managing fisheries research, development and extension (RD&amp;E) activities in Australia, the FRDC provides leadership and coordination of the monitoring, evaluating and reporting on RD&amp;E activities and facilitates the dissemination, extension and commercialisation of research results to end-users. The FRDC achieves this through coordinating investment by government and industry, and involving stakeholders to set and address RD&amp;E priorities. The FRDC also monitors and evaluates the adoption of RD&amp;E outputs to inform future decisions.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=ix}}

== Governance ==

Formed as a statutory corporation on 2 July 1991 under the provisions of the ''Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989'' (the PIERD Act), the FRDC is responsible to the [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)]].

A Chairman and a board of directors govern the FRDC; the Executive Director leads the corporation’s business activities on a day-to-day basis. The board oversees corporate governance, sets strategic direction and monitors the ongoing performance of the Corporation and the Executive Director. The board and the Executive Director are responsible for managing and evaluating the Corporation and its investments, and for reporting to government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors. During 2012-13 the focus for the FRDC Board was on:
* implementing the National Framework for Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension
* developing strategic investment options to ensure delivery of outcomes against the FRDC RD&amp;E Plan
* responding to findings of the Productivity Commission inquiry into the rural research and development corporations and the Rural Research and Development Council’s National Strategic Investment Plan
* developing a plan to improve the perception of the fishing and aquaculture through making research results more publicly available and addressing factually incorrect media (and similar) reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= FRDC annual operational plan 2012–13 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/AOP-2012-13.pdf |location=Canberra |p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRDC supports a network of Research Advisory Committees (RACs) located in each state and the Northern Territory. The RACs have an extremely important role in maximising the efficiency of the FRDC's planning and funding process.
== Investment ==

=== Revenue sources ===

[[File:Entrance to Fisheries Research House, Canberra, Australia.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Canberra, Australia]]
The primary revenue for the FRDC comes from the Australian Government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, based on:

* the Australian Government providing unmatched funds equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the average gross value of Australian fisheries production (AGVP);
* fishers and [[aquaculturist]]s providing contributions of at least 0.25 per cent of AGVP; and
* the Australian Government matching contributions by fishers and aquaculturists up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of AGVP.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}

The Corporation also manages significant contributions by stakeholders in FRDC-funded projects. 
The FRDC’s strategic investments in RD&amp;E activities benefit the three sectors of fishing: commercial (wild catch and aquaculture), recreational and indigenous customary.
The FRDC has a significant responsibility in ensuring, on behalf of the Australian Government, that research is undertaken to assist in the management of the fisheries and aquaculture resource for ongoing sustainability. A significant proportion of funding is therefore directed to research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}

===Investment strategy===
The FRDC invests in RD&amp;E across the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, and for the benefit of both recreational and indigenous customary fishers. The FRDC seeks to achieve maximum leverage from its investment by providing research administration and services using a value-adding model in which research projects are tailored to deliver a specific outcome and are actively managed and monitored. 
The FRDC commissions RD&amp;E through a variety of flexible investment approaches, including an open call for project applications; formal partnership agreements with industry sectors; subprograms and coordination programs that are tailored to a specific industry sector or activity; short-term tactical research investment; and specifically targeted commissioned RD&amp;E, especially where there is market failure by private investment.
The focus for FRDC investment aligns with the following 14 themes, as outlined in the Corporation’s 2010-2015 Strategic RD&amp;E Plan.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=8}} The investment balance between themes, which may vary depending on strategic needs, is reported in each annual report.{{sfn| FRDC annual report 2012–2013 | p=9}}

== Relationships with stakeholders ==
In developing projects addressing the Corporation’s five programs, strategic directions are established in association with the FRDC’s stakeholders, which are:
* the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors
* the federal, state and territory governments (including their fisheries managers and other natural resource managers)
* research partners (including universities, fisheries research organisations, industry and private sector research providers, and investors)
* the people of Australia (on whose behalf aquatic natural resources are managed, and as consumers).{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=5}}

The FRDC works with its partners to undertake program management effectively, to disseminate the results, and to assist with their adoption and, when appropriate, commercialisation.

=== Stakeholder research priorities ===

One of the primary challenges for the FRDC is to gain a solid understanding of the needs and priorities of its stakeholders, many of whom come from a diverse range of sectors and operations. There are many common, national issues, but each sector faces unique challenges and has specific RD&amp;E needs, which vary greatly around Australia. In developing the National RD&amp;E Strategy and the Corporation’s RD&amp;E Plan, the FRDC has consulted widely with a majority of these groups and has undertaken industry research to build on knowledge gained through consultation. 
To ensure a balanced portfolio, and to align with industry research priorities, the large majority of project applications are reviewed by the RACs. Where possible, industry and fisheries management are directly engaged and integrated into the delivery of each project.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Australian Government priorities===
The federal [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)|Minister for Agriculture]], the [[Abbott Ministry|Parliamentary Secretary]] and the [[Department of Agriculture (Australia)|Department of Agriculture]] set priorities that the Corporation is required to address. In 2009 the Australian Primary Industries Ministerial Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mincos.gov.au/pages/background.aspx Primary Industries Ministerial Council]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed a “statement of intent” to implement a ''National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework''  through 14 primary industry sectors and 7 cross-industry sectors. Within the framework, each industry sector and cross-sectoral issue was to be assessed for its RD&amp;E capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework|url=http://www.npirdef.org/strategies|accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As its contribution to the framework, the FRDC and its stakeholders developed a landmark document setting out future directions for fishing and aquaculture RD&amp;E: the ''National Fishing and Aquaculture RD&amp;E Strategy 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Fishing and Aquaculture RD&amp;E Strategy 2010 |url=http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/National_RDandE_Strategy_for_Fishing_and_Aquaculture.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consultation and collaboration==

===Australian Fisheries Management Forum===
The Australian Fisheries Management Forum comprises the heads of the federal, state and territory government agencies responsible for management of fisheries, who discuss strategic issues relating to fisheries and aquaculture management. The FRDC works with the forum, sitting as an invited representative to meetings, providing advice and ensuring forum priorities are incorporated into the Corporation’s RD&amp;E planning processes.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Representative organisations===

Four representative organisations have been appointed under the PIERD Act, with which the FRDC consults and reports formally at their annual general meetings:
* Australian Recreational and Sport Fishing Industry Confederation Inc. (trading as Recfish Australia)&lt;ref&gt;[http://recfishaustralia.org.au Recfish Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Aquaculture Council Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquaculture.org.au National Aquaculture Council]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonwealth Fisheries Association Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comfish.com.au Commonwealth Fisheries Association]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Seafood Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodforaustralia.com.au National Seafood Industry Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Levy organisation: Australian Prawn Farmers Association===

The FRDC administers a research and development levy on behalf of the Australian Prawn Farmers Association (APFA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfa.com.au Australian Prawn Farmers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; a levy organisation, which has a leading role with FRDC in ensuring its priorities are met. FRDC investments in prawn farming research and development is driven by the APFA’s RD&amp;E Plan. The two entities enjoy a very close working relationship. The APFA has nominated that the majority of its investment is to be through co-investment with the Australian Seafood CRC.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=15}}

===Industry sector bodies===
The FRDC also has a close relationship with the National Seafood Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodforaustralia.com.au National Seafood Industry Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance represents the commercial fishing, pearling and aquaculture industries through state industry councils and peak sector associations to build on the partnerships established with individual industry sectors.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

The FRDC also invests in, and partners, entities such as Southern Rocklobster Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernrocklobster.com Southern Rocklobster Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbtia.com.au Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmanian Salmonid Growers’ Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsga.com.au Tasmanian Salmonid Growers’ Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Pearl Producers Association, Australian Prawn Farmers’ Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfa.com.au Australian Prawn Farmers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian Barramundi Farmers’ Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abfa.org.au/index.html Australian Barramundi Farmers’ Association]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

===Other rural research and development corporations===
The FRDC joins with other rural research and development corporations – at the project level and more broadly in functional areas – on a range of activities to enhance joint strategic outcomes. Most significant are climate change projects, evaluation of RD&amp;E, and the “Appetite for Excellence” primary producers tour – a competition for chefs, waiters and restaurateurs. The FRDC is a member of the Council of Rural Research and Development Corporations, participating in meetings of R&amp;D corporations' executive directors, business managers and communications managers. The FRDC also provides advice and services in project management and the FRDC-developed project management software, OmniFish.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

===Industry development===
The FRDC works with various entities to develop the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors in such matters as market development; strengthening trade and market access; developing standards, e.g. for responsible fishing; standardising names for Australian fish; developing quality management systems; and reaching agreement on sustainability. To that end, in 2001 the Corporation and a now defunct peak body of the commercial sector incorporated a not-for-profit company, Seafood Services Australia Ltd, with the mission “to enhance the profitability, international competitiveness, sustainability and resilience of the Australian seafood industry”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Evolution of the FRDC to 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/Evolution_of_the_FRDC_Sep_2012.pdf |location=Canberra |p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry development activities suffered a setback in 2013, when the company ceased trading after "a significant reduction in the availability of funding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seafood Services Australia closes its doors|url=https://seafood.net.au|accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre===
The FRDC initiated, and is a core participant in, the Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodcrc.com Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's research program aims to increase the profitability and value of the Australian seafood industry, increase access to premium markets and increase demand for Australian seafood – priorities aligned with the FRDC’s RD&amp;E programs, in particular Program 2: Industry.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

==Research partners==
In any given year, the Corporation has under management about 300 active projects. Investment in research is the FRDC’s core business. As a result, it is vital to the FRDC’s success that it has excellent relationships with its research partners. The key research partners are:
* [[Department of Agriculture (Australia)|Department of Agriculture]]
* [[Australian Fisheries Management Authority]]
* state fisheries research centres
* [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]
* universities
* [[Cooperative Research Centre]]s
* other rural research and development corporations and companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruralrdc.com.au Rural research and development corporations]&lt;/ref&gt;
* industry groups
* co-investors from the private sector.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

== The Australian fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors ==

The fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors is one of the most complex of Australia’s primary industries in terms of both its structure and the natural resources on which it depends. Most of the industry’s business environments are made more complex by their dependence on access to natural resources that are publicly managed in the interests of present and future generations. Australian fishing comprises three main sectors:
* commercial sector, consisting of wild catch fishing, aquaculture and through-chain activities undertaken by seafood importers, processors, manufacturers, handlers and retailers
* recreational fishing, which includes the tackle, tour guides and charter sectors
* indigenous customary fishers.{{sfn|FRDC RD&amp;E plan, 2010|p=13}}
Legislatively, the "fishing industry" is defined in the FRDC Regulations 1991, issued under the PIERD Act 1989, as "any industry or activity carried on in or from Australia concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing, or selling of fish or fish products".

The commercial sector comprises approximately 120 wild-catch fisheries and 70 aquaculture species. Commercial seafood and marine products (e.g., pearls) were valued at $2.2 billion in 2008–09. The recreational sector has 3.4 million participants, who were estimated in a 2001 survey to expend $1.9&amp;nbsp;billion annually on their fishing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participate in commercial and recreational fishing, as well practising customary fishing. The legal rights around indigenous customary fishing are being refined over time and some aspects are now part of existing legislation and court decisions.
In 2009–10, 11,431 people were employed in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry, with 7646 employed in the fishing, hunting and trapping sector and 3785 in aquaculture enterprises. Compared with 2008–09, total employment in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry increased by 24 per cent (2208 people) following a 30 per cent increase (1931 people) in full-time employment and a 10 per cent (277 people) increase in people engaged in part-time employment in 2009–10.
Demand for seafood is rising in Australia because of increasing affluence and increasing awareness of seafood’s prominent role in a healthy diet. In Asian markets consumption is also increasing with the growth of the middle class, especially in China and India. This will place demands on the supply of the limited resource, leading to increases in price.
Currently Australia’s commercial seafood production only provides about 28 per cent of domestic demand. In part because of the rising value of the Australian dollar, the commercial sector is now re-orienting towards better serving the Australian market. Increasingly, value chains will encompass both domestic and imported product. Other factors, such as further improvements in fisheries management and better utilisation of catch, will also be important in meeting domestic demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=ABARES | title= Australian fisheries statistics 2010 | date=2011| url =http://data.daff.gov.au/brs/data/warehouse/pe_abares20110830.01/AustFishStats_2010.pdf | publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences |location=Canberra |pp=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not only seafood for consumption that the Australian industry produces. Pearls are a high value consumer item that is produced at the highest level of quality through advanced technology and environmental credentials, making it one of Australia’s most valuable and sustainable fishing sectors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11294">In [[computer science]], '''formal specifications''' are mathematically based techniques whose purpose are to help with the implementation of systems and software. They are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest through rigorous and effective reasoning tools.&lt;ref name="a9-hierons"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hierons | first1 = R.

== Motivation ==
In each passing decade computer systems have become increasingly more powerful and as a result they have become more impactful to society. Because of this, better techniques are needed to assist in the design and implementation of reliable software. Established engineering disciplines use mathematical analysis as the foundation of creating and validating product design. Formal specifications are one such way to achieve this in software engineering reliability as once predicted. Other methods such as  [[Software_testing|testing]] are more commonly used to enhance code quality.&lt;ref name=a9-hierons /&gt;

== Uses ==
Given such a [[specification]], it is possible to use [[formal verification]] techniques to demonstrate that a system design is correct with respect to its specification. This allows incorrect system designs to be revised before any major investments have been made into an actual implementation. Another approach is to use probably correct [[Program refinement|refinement]] steps to transform a specification into a design, which is ultimately transformed into an implementation that is ''correct by construction''.

It is important to note that a formal specification is ''not'' an implementation, but rather it may be used to develop an [[implementation]]. Formal specifications describe ''what'' a system should do, not ''how'' the system should do it.

A good specification must have some of the following attributes: adequate, internally consistent, unambiguous, complete, satisfied, minimal&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;

A good specification will have:&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Constructability, manageability and evolvability
* Usability
* Communicability
* Powerful and efficient analysis

One of the main reasons there is interest in formal specifications is that they will provide an ability to perform proofs on software implementations.&lt;ref name=p223-gaudel /&gt; These proofs may be used to validate a specification, verify correctness of design, or to prove that a program satisfies a specification.&lt;ref name=p223-gaudel /&gt;

== Limitations ==
A design (or implementation) cannot ever be declared “correct” on its own. It can only ever be “correct with respect to a given specification”. Whether the formal specification correctly describes the problem to be solved is a separate issue. It is also a difficult issue to address, since it ultimately concerns the problem constructing abstracted formal representations of an informal concrete [[problem domain]], and such an abstraction step is not amenable to formal proof. However, it is possible to [[verification and validation|validate]] a specification by proving “challenge” [[theorem]]s concerning properties that the specification is expected to exhibit. If correct, these theorems reinforce the specifier's understanding of the specification and its relationship with the underlying problem domain. If not, the specification probably needs to be changed to better reflect the domain understanding of those involved with producing (and implementing) the specification.

Formal methods of software development are not widely used in industry. Most companies do not consider it cost-effective to apply them in their software development processes.&lt;ref name=Ch_27_Formal_spec&gt;{{cite web|last=Sommerville|first=Ian|title=Formal Specification|url=http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ifs/Books/SE9/WebChapters/PDF/Ch_27_Formal_spec.pdf|work=Software Engineering|accessdate=3 February 2013|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be for a variety of reasons, some of which are:

* Time
** High initial start up cost with low measurable returns
* Flexibility 
** A lot of software companies use [[Agile software development|agile methodologies]] that focus on flexibility. Doing a formal specification of the whole system up front is often perceived as being the opposite of flexible.  However, there is some research into the benefits of using formal specifications with "agile" development&lt;ref name="p14-nummenmaasen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nummenmaa|first=Timo|author2=Tiensuu, Aleksi |author3=Berki, Eleni |author4=Mikkonen, Tommi |author5=Kuittinen, Jussi |author6= Kultima, Annakaisa |title=Supporting agile development by facilitating natural user interaction with executable formal specifications|journal=ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes|date=4 August 2011|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1–10|doi=10.1145/1988997.2003643}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Complexity
** They require a high level of mathematical expertise and the analytical skills to understand and apply them effectively&lt;ref name=p14-nummenmaasen/&gt; 
** A solution to this would be to develop tools and models that allow for these techniques to be implemented but hide the underlying mathematics&lt;ref name=p223-gaudel /&gt;&lt;ref name=p14-nummenmaasen /&gt;
* Limited scope&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** They do not capture properties of interest for all [[Requirements_analysis#Stakeholder_identification|stakeholders]] in the project&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** They do not do a good job of specifying user interfaces and user interaction&lt;ref name=Ch_27_Formal_spec /&gt;
* Not cost-effective
** This is not entirely true, by limiting their use to only core parts of critical systems they have shown to be cost-effective&lt;ref name=Ch_27_Formal_spec /&gt;

Other limitations:&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Isolation
* Low-level ontologies
* Poor guidance
* Poor separation of concerns
* Poor tool feedback

== Paradigms ==
Formal specification techniques have existed in various domains and on various scales for quite some time.&lt;ref name="p179-vanderpoll"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Poll|first=John A.|author2=Paula Kotze|title=What design heuristics may enhance the utility of a formal specification?|journal=Proceedings of the 2002 annual research conference of the South African institute of computer scientists and information technologists on Enablement through technology|year=2002|series=SAICSIT '02|pages=179–194|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=581506.581533}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Implementations of formal specifications will differ depending on what kind of system they are attempting to model, how they are applied and at what point in the software life cycle they have been introduced.&lt;ref name=p223-gaudel /&gt; These types of models can be categorized into the following specification paradigms:

* History-based specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** behavior based on system histories
** assertions are interpreted over time
* State-based Specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** behavior based on system states
** series of sequential steps, (e.g. a financial transaction)
** languages such as [[Z notation|Z]], [[Vienna Development Method|VDM]] or [[B-Method|B]] rely on this paradigm&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Transition-based specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** behavior based on transitions from state-to-state of the system
** best used with a reactive system
** languages such as Statecharts, PROMELA, STeP-SPL, RSML or SCR rely on this paradigm&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Functional specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** specify a system as a structure of mathematical functions
** OBJ, ASL, PLUSS, LARCH, HOL or PVS rely on this paradigm&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
* Operational Specification&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;
** early languages such as [[Paisley (programming language)|Paisley]], GIST, Petri nets or process algebras rely on this paradigm&lt;ref name=lamsweerde-roadmap /&gt;

In addition to the above paradigms there are ways to apply certain heuristics to help improve the creation of these specifications. The paper referenced here best discusses heuristics to use when designing a specification.&lt;ref name=p179-vanderpoll /&gt; They do so by applying a [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]] approach.

== Software tools ==
The [[Z notation]] is an example of a leading formal [[specification language]]. Others include the Specification Language(VDM-SL) of the [[Vienna Development Method]] and the [[Abstract Machine Notation]] (AMN) of the [[B-Method]]. In the [[Web services]] area, formal specification is often used to describe non-functional properties&lt;ref&gt;S-Cube Knowledge Model: [http://www.s-cube-network.eu/km/terms/f/formal-specification Formal Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; (Web services [[Quality of Service]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5706">The '''French Institute of Administrative Sciences''' was created in 1947 by [[René Cassin]].
The association was recognized of public utility and is a member of the International Institute of Administrative Sciences. Linked to the French Conseil d'Etat, the president of IFSA is traditionally the vice-president of the Conseil d'Etat.

==Description==
The French Institute of Administrative Sciences aims at developing administrative law in France.

Since its creation in 1947, the Institute organized numerous conferences and participated to the works of the French doctrine in administrative law.

The Institute has more than 300 members with different backgrounds: high civil servants (French State Councillors, Members of the Supreme financial court, Inspectors), university professors but also representatives of private companies.

The Institute is located in the French Council of State, place du Palais-Royal in Paris.

==Activities==
The IFSA organizes each year two conferences:
* an actuality conference,
* an historical conference.

===Actuality conferences===
Here are examples of themes of actuality conferences:
* The theme of the 2009 actuality conference organized by the IFSA is ''"Public security: partnership between public power and private actors"''
* ''Management delegations in the public service''
* ''France-Télécom-la Poste : new public firms? A new public service?''
* ''The administration of national education''
* ''Administration and new tools to help decision-makers''
* ''Expectations and demands of citizens towards the administration''
* ''State and private firms''

=== Historical conferences===
IFSA in partnership with the French Practical School of High Studies organizes each year an historical conference on diverse themes :
* ''Administration and justice''
* ''State and theater''
* ''State and sport''
* ''State and crime''

==International activities ==
IFSA participates actively in the works of the International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IISA).
A delegation of the IFSA participated for instance in the third international conference of the IISA in Beijing. IFSA also participated in the meeting in Quebec on “General states of public administration.”
In 1998, IFSA organized in Paris the 24th International Congress of administrative sciences on the theme : “citizen and administration.” The Congress took place in Paris in the [[UNESCO]] palace.

== Board of directors==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7289">The '''Frenkel line''' is a line of change{{ambig|date=May 2017}} of thermodynamics, dynamics and structure of fluids. Below the Frenkel line the fluids are "rigid" and "solid-like", whereas above it, fluids are "soft" and "gas-like".

==Overview==
Two types of approaches to the behavior of liquids are present in the literature. The most common one is due to [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|van der Waals]]. It treats the liquids as dense structureless gases. Although this approach allows one to explain many principal features of fluids, in particular the liquid-gas [[phase transition]], it fails to explain other important issues such as, for example, the existence in liquids of transverse collective excitations such as [[phonons]].

Another approach to fluid properties was proposed by [[Yakov Frenkel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacov Frenkel "Kinetic Theory of Liquids", Oxford University Press (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the assumption that at moderate [[temperature]]s, the particles of liquid behave in a manner similar to a crystal, ''i.e.'' the particles demonstrate oscillatory motions. However, while in crystals they oscillate around their nodes, in liquids, after several periods, the particles change their nodes. This approach is based on postulation of some similarity between crystals and liquids, providing insight into many important properties of the latter: transverse collective excitations, large [[heat capacity]], and so on.

From the discussion above, one can see that the microscopic behavior of particles of moderate and high temperature fluids is qualitatively different. If one [[heat]]s a fluid from a temperature close to the [[melting point]] to some high temperature, a crossover from the solid-like to the gas-like regime occurs. The line of this crossover was named the Frenkel line, after Yakov Frenkel.

Several methods to locate the Frenkel line are proposed in the literature.&lt;ref name="ufn"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.3367/UFNe.0182.201211a.1137 Vadim V. Brazhkin, Aleksandr G Lyapin, Valentin N. Ryzhov, Kostya Trachenko, Yurii D. Fomin and Elena N. Tsiok "Where is the supercritical fluid on the phase diagram?", Physics-Uspekhi '''55''' pp. 1061-1079 (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frpre"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.85.031203 V. V. Brazhkin, Yu. D. Fomin, A. G. Lyapin, V. N. Ryzhov, and K. Trachenko "Two liquid states of matter: A dynamic line on a phase diagram", Physical Review E '''85''' 031203 (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; The exact criterion defining the Frenkel line is the one based on a comparison of characteristic times in fluids. One can define a 'jump time' via

:&lt;math&gt; \tau_0=\frac{a^2}{6D} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the particles size and &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Diffusion|diffusion coefficient]]. This is the time necessary for a particle to move a distance comparable to its own size. The second characteristic time corresponds to the shortest period of transverse oscillations of particles within the fluid, &lt;math&gt; \tau^* &lt;/math&gt;. When these two time scales are roughly equal, one cannot distinguish between the oscillations of the particles and their jumps to another position. Thus the criterion for the Frenkel line is given by &lt;math&gt; \tau_0 \approx \tau^* &lt;/math&gt;.

There exist several approximate criteria to locate the Frenkel line on the [[phase diagram|pressure-temperature plane]].&lt;ref name="ufn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frpre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="frprl"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.145901 V. V. Brazhkin, Yu. D. Fomin, A. G. Lyapin, V. N. Ryzhov, E. N. Tsiok, and Kostya Trachenko ""Liquid-Gas" Transition in the Supercritical Region: Fundamental Changes in the Particle Dynamics", Physical Review Letters '''111''' 145901 (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; One of these criteria is based on the velocity [[autocorrelation]] function (vacf): below the Frenkel line, the vacf demonstrates oscillatory behaviour, while above it, the vacf monotonically decays to zero. The second criterion is based on the fact that at moderate temperatures, liquids can sustain transverse excitations, which disappear upon heating. One further criterion is based on [[Heat capacity#At constant volume|isochoric heat capacity]] measurements. The isochoric heat capacity per particle of a monatomic liquid near the melting line is close to &lt;math&gt; 3 k_B &lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt; k_B &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]). The contribution to the heat capacity due to the potential part of transverse excitations is &lt;math&gt; 1 k_B &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, at the Frenkel line, where transverse excitations vanish, the isochoric heat capacity per particle should be &lt;math&gt; c_V=2 k_B &lt;/math&gt;, a direct prediction from the phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120524/srep00421/full/srep00421.html D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Gerontechnology''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic and professional field combining [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[House|housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]] and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of  ages.

==Description==
Gerontechnology, which has also been called '''''gerotechnology''''' is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the [[life-span]]. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the [[cost of care]].

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of '''domains of human activity''': (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, and (2) '''technology interventions''' or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research. Such research supports the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

==Gerontological design==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization.  Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population.

By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond.

Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

== Publications ==
An international academic journal with delayed open-access, '''''Gerontechnology''''' [http://www.gerontechjournal.net], is published by the '''International Society for Gerontechnology (ISG)''' [http://www.gerontechnology.org].

A comprehensive edited book "'''''Gerontechnology'''''" [http://www.springerpub.com/gerontechnology-9780826128881.html]has been published in 2016.

== Education ==
[[Image:SetupResearch.jpg|thumb]] The first ISG Masterclass [http://www.phe.bwk.tue.nl/ISGMasterClass/Main_mclass.htm] for PhD students in 2006 produced a scheme to support gerontechnological research.

The concept of '''hisba''' (حِسْبة [ḥisba], calculation; verification) is an [[Islam]]ic practice not explicitly in the [[Qur'an]] or in the corpus of [[sahih]] [[hadith]]. In a book review, Mohammad Umar Memon explains that "the institution of the hisba has been generally understood as one seeking to ensure correct economic and commercial practices among the Muslim ''[[ummah|umma]]''". &lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Umar Memon. Review of ''Public Duties in Islam: The Institution of the Hisba''. by [[Ibn Taymiya]]; [[Muhtar Holland]] (trans.) International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 17, No. 1. (Feb., 1985), pp. 141-142. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/163324 Stable URL]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
In the beginning, under [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], it was a civic institution intended to supervise the course of economic and commercial affairs as well as the legality of contracts. Its foundation is based on a verse which makes a list of major interdicts.

: "And come not nigh to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he attain the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice;- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfil the covenant of Allah: thus doth He command you, that ye may remember." (6:152, trans. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]])

'''Hormonal imprinting''' (HI) is a  phenomenon which takes place at the first encounter between a [[hormone]] and its developing [[hormone receptor|receptor]] in the critical periods of life (in unicellulars during the whole life) and determines the later [[signal transduction]] capacity of the cell. The most important period in [[mammals]] is the [[perinatal]] one, however this system can be imprinted at [[weaning]], at [[puberty]] and in case of continuously dividing cells during the whole life. Faulty imprinting is caused by [[drugs]], environmental [[pollutants]] and other hormone-like molecules  present in excess at the critical periods with lifelong receptorial, morphological, biochemical and behavioral consequences. HI is transmitted to the hundreds of progeny generations in unicellulars and (as proved) to a few generations also in mammals.

A '''hydroid''' is a type of vascular [[Cell (biology)|cell]] that occurs in certain [[bryophyte]]s. In some [[moss]]es such as members of the [[Polytrichaceae]] family, hydroids form the innermost layer of cells in the stem. At maturity they are long, colourless, thin walled cells of small diameter, containing water but no living [[protoplasm]]. Collectively, hydroids function as a conducting tissue, known as the hydrome, transporting water and minerals drawn from the soil. They are surrounded by bundles of living cells known as [[leptoid]]s which carry sugars and other nutrients in solution. The hydroids are analogous to the [[tracheid]]s of vascular plants but there is no [[lignin]] present in the cell walls to provide structural support.&lt;ref name=mishler1984&gt;{{Cite journal

Hydroids have been found in some fossilised plants from the [[Rhynie chert]], including ''[[Aglaophyton]]'', where they were initially mistaken for [[xylem]] tracheids.

In communications and [[electronic engineering]], an '''intermediate frequency''' ('''IF''') is a [[frequency]] to which a [[carrier wave]] is shifted as an intermediate step in [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] or reception.&lt;ref name=Smith46/&gt; The intermediate frequency is created by mixing the carrier signal with a [[local oscillator]] signal in a process called [[heterodyning]], resulting in a signal at the difference or [[beat frequency]].   Intermediate frequencies are used in [[Superheterodyne receiver|superheterodyne]] [[radio receiver]]s, in which an incoming signal is shifted to an IF for [[Amplifier|amplification]] before final [[Detector (radio)|detection]] is done.

Conversion to an intermediate frequency is useful for several reasons. When several stages of filters are used, they can all be set to a fixed frequency, which makes them easier to build and to tune. Lower frequency transistors generally have higher gains so fewer stages are required.  It's easier to make sharply selective filters at lower fixed frequencies.

There may be several such stages of intermediate frequency in a superheterodyne receiver; two or three stages are called  ''double'' (alternatively, ''dual'') or ''triple'' ''conversion'', respectively.

==Reasons for using IF==
Intermediate frequencies are used for three general reasons.&lt;ref name="ArmyManual"&gt;{{cite book

Active devices such as [[transistor]]s cannot deliver much amplification ([[Gain (electronics)|gain]]).&lt;ref name="Smith46"&gt;F. Langford Smith (ed) ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'', 3rd Edition (Wireless Press 1946) Page 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1946 ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'' observes on page 159 that some short-wave receivers operate with an IF of 1600 kHz and that "At such a high frequency one or two additional IF stages are required are necessary to provide sufficient gain."&lt;/ref&gt;  Ordinary circuits using [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s must be replaced with cumbersome high frequency techniques such as [[stripline]]s and [[waveguide]]s. So a high frequency signal is converted to a lower IF for more convenient processing.  For example, in [[satellite dish]]es, the microwave downlink signal received by the dish is converted to a much lower IF at the dish, to allow a relatively inexpensive [[coaxial cable]] to carry the signal to the receiver inside the building.  Bringing the signal in at the original microwave frequency would require an expensive [[waveguide]].

A second reason, in receivers that can be tuned to different frequencies, is to convert the various different frequencies of the stations to a common frequency for processing. It is difficult to build multistage [[amplifier]]s, [[Electronic filter|filters]], and [[detector (radio)|detector]]s that can have all stages track in tuning different frequencies, but it is comparatively easy to build tunable [[Electronic oscillator|oscillators]]. Superheterodyne receivers tune in different frequencies by adjusting the frequency of the local oscillator on the input stage, and all processing after that is done at the same fixed frequency, the IF.   Without using an IF, all the complicated filters and detectors in a radio or television would have to be tuned in unison each time the frequency  was changed, as was necessary in the early [[tuned radio frequency receiver]]s.   A more important advantage is that it gives the receiver a constant bandwidth over its tuning range.  The bandwidth of a filter is proportional to its center frequency.  In receivers like the TRF in which the filtering is done at the incoming RF frequency, as the receiver is tuned to higher frequencies its bandwidth increases.

The main reason for using an intermediate frequency is to improve frequency [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].&lt;ref name="Smith46" /&gt; In communication circuits, a very common task is to separate out or extract signals or components of a signal that are close together in frequency. This is called [[Filter (signal processing)|filtering]]. Some examples are, picking up a radio station among several that are close in frequency, or extracting the [[chrominance]] subcarrier from a TV signal. With all known filtering techniques the filter's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] increases proportionately with the  frequency. So a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity can be achieved by converting the signal to a lower IF and performing the filtering at that frequency.  [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[television broadcasting]] with their narrow channel widths, as well as more modern telecommunications services such as [[cell phone]]s and [[cable television]], would be impossible without using frequency conversion.&lt;ref name="Dixon"&gt;{{cite book

==Uses==
Perhaps the most commonly used intermediate frequencies for broadcast receivers are around 455&amp;nbsp;kHz for AM receivers and 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz for FM receivers. In special purpose receivers other frequencies can be used. A dual-conversion receiver may have two intermediate frequencies, a higher one to improve image rejection and a second, lower one, for desired selectivity. A first intermediate frequency may even be higher than the input signal, so that all undesired responses can be easily filtered out by a fixed-tuned RF stage.&lt;ref name=ARRL77&gt;Wes Hayward, Doug De Maw (ed),''Solid state design for the radio amateur'', (American Radio Relay League, 1977) pp. 82-87&lt;/ref&gt;

In a digital receiver, the analog to digital converter ([[analog to digital converter|ADC]]) operates at low sampling rates, so input RF must be mixed down to IF to be processed. Intermediate frequency tends to be lower frequency range compared to the transmitted RF frequency.   However, the choices for the IF are most dependent on the available components such as mixer, filters, amplifiers and others that can operate at lower frequency. There are other factors involved in deciding the IF frequency, because lower IF is susceptible to noise and higher IF can cause clock jitters.

Modern [[satellite television]] receivers use several intermediate frequencies.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom"&gt;{{cite book

The downlink signal is received by a [[satellite dish]].  In the box at the focus of the dish, called a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB), each block of frequencies is converted to the IF range of 950 - 2150&amp;nbsp;MHz by two fixed frequency local oscillators at 9.75 and 10.6&amp;nbsp;GHz.  One of the two blocks is selected by a control signal from the set top box inside, which switches on one of the local oscillators.   This IF is carried into the building to the television receiver on a coaxial cable.  At the cable company's [[set top box]], the signal is converted to a lower IF of 480&amp;nbsp;MHz for filtering, by a variable frequency oscillator.&lt;ref name="Lundstrom" /&gt;  This is sent through a 30&amp;nbsp;MHz bandpass filter, which selects the signal from one of the [[transponder]]s on the satellite, which carries several channels.  Further processing selects the channel desired, demodulates it and sends the signal to the television.

==History==

An intermediate frequency was first used in the superheterodyne radio receiver, invented by American scientist Major [[Edwin Armstrong]] in 1918, during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A member of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]], Armstrong was building radio [[direction finding]] equipment to track German military signals at the then-very high frequencies of 500 to 3500&amp;nbsp;kHz. The [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers of the day would not amplify stably above 500&amp;nbsp;kHz, however, it was easy to get them to [[Electronic oscillator|oscillate]] above that frequency.   Armstrong's solution was to set up an oscillator tube that would create a frequency near the incoming signal, and mix it with the incoming signal in a 'mixer' tube, creating a 'heterodyne' or signal at the lower difference frequency, where it could be amplified easily. For example, to pick up a signal at 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz the local oscillator would be tuned to 1450&amp;nbsp;kHz. Mixing the two created an intermediate frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz, which was well within the capability of the tubes.

After the war, in 1920, Armstrong sold the patent for the superheterodyne to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], who subsequently sold it to [[RCA]]. The increased complexity of the superheterodyne circuit compared to earlier [[Regenerative receiver|regenerative]] or [[tuned radio frequency receiver]] designs slowed its use, but the advantages of the intermediate frequency for selectivity and static rejection eventually won out; by 1930, most radios sold were 'superhets'. During the development of [[radar]] in [[World War II]], the superheterodyne principle was essential for downconversion of the very high radar frequencies to intermediate frequencies. Since then, the superheterodyne circuit, with its intermediate frequency, has been used in virtually all radio receivers.

==Commonly used intermediate frequencies==
* 110&amp;nbsp;kHz was used in [[Long wave]] broadcast receivers.&lt;ref name="Smith46"/&gt;{{rp|159}}
*[[Analog transmission|Analogue]] television receivers using system M: 41.25&amp;nbsp;MHz (audio) and 45.75&amp;nbsp;MHz (video). Note, the channel is flipped over in the conversion process in an [[intercarrier method|intercarrier]] system, so the audio IF frequency is lower than the video IF frequency. Also, there is no audio local oscillator, the injected video carrier serves that purpose.
*[[Analog transmission|Analogue]] television receivers using system B and similar systems: 33.4&amp;nbsp;MHz. for aural and 38.9&amp;nbsp;MHz. for visual signal. (The discussion about the frequency conversion is the same as in system M).
*[[FM radio]] receivers: 262&amp;nbsp;kHz, 455&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz, 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 10.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.2&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 11.8&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz, 75&amp;nbsp;MHz and 98&amp;nbsp;MHz. In double-conversion superheterodyne receivers, a first intermediate frequency of 10.7&amp;nbsp;MHz is often used, followed by a second intermediate frequency of 470&amp;nbsp;kHz. There are triple conversion designs used in police scanner receivers, high-end communications receivers, and many point-to-point microwave systems. Modern DSP chip consumer radios often use a 'low-IF' of 128kHz for FM.
*[[AM radio]] receivers: 450&amp;nbsp;kHz, 455&amp;nbsp;kHz, 460&amp;nbsp;kHz, 465&amp;nbsp;kHz, 467&amp;nbsp;kHz, 470&amp;nbsp;kHz, 475&amp;nbsp;kHz, 480&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;Ravalico D. E., ''Radioelementi'', Milan, Hoepli, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Satellite [[uplink]]-[[downlink]] equipment: 70&amp;nbsp;MHz, 950–1450&amp;nbsp;MHz (L-band) downlink first IF.
*Terrestrial [[microwave]] equipment: 250&amp;nbsp;MHz, 70&amp;nbsp;MHz or 75&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*[[Radar]]: 30&amp;nbsp;MHz.
*[[Radio frequency|RF]] Test Equipment: 310.7&amp;nbsp;MHz, 160&amp;nbsp;MHz, 21.4&amp;nbsp;MHz.

In [[mathematics]], an '''interval contractor''' (or '''contractor''' for short) 
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Jaulin|first1=Luc|last2=Kieffer|first2=Michel|last3=Didrit|first3=Olivier|last4=Walter|first4=Eric|
title=Applied Interval Analysis|year=2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=1-85233-219-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
associated to a set ''X'' is 
an operator ''C'' which associates to a box
[''x''] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; another box ''C''([''x'']) of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  such that the two following properties are always satisfied

* &lt;math&gt;
C([x])\subset [x]
&lt;/math&gt; (contractance property)

* &lt;math&gt;
C([x])\cap X=[x]\cap X
&lt;/math&gt; (completeness property)

A ''contractor associated to a [[Constraint algorithm|constraint]]'' (such as an equation or an inequality) is a 
contractor associated to the set ''X'' of all ''x'' which satisfy the constraint.  
Contractors make it possible to improve the efficiency of [[branch and bound|branch-and-bound]]
algorithms classically used in [[Interval arithmetic|interval analysis]].

==Properties of contractors==

A contractor ''C'' is [[Monotonic_function|monotonic]] if we have 
&lt;math&gt;
[x] \subset [y] \Rightarrow C([x])\subset C([y])
&lt;/math&gt;

It is ''minimal'' if for all boxes [''x''], we have 
&lt;math&gt;
C([x])=[[x]\cap X]
&lt;/math&gt;,
where [''A''] is the ''interval hull'' of the set ''A'', i.e., the smallest
box enclosing ''A''.

The contractor ''C'' is ''thin'' if for all points ''x'',
&lt;math&gt;
C(\{x\})=\{x\}\cap X
&lt;/math&gt;
where {''x''} denotes the degenerated box enclosing ''x'' as a single point.

The contractor ''C'' is ''[[Idempotence|idempotent]]'' if for all boxes [''x''], we have
&lt;math&gt;
  C \circ C([x]) = C([x]).
&lt;/math&gt;

The contractor ''C'' is ''[[Convergent matrix|convergent]]'' if for all sequences [''x''](''k'') of boxes containing ''x'', we have
&lt;math&gt;
[x](k)\rightarrow x \Rightarrow C([x](k))\rightarrow \{x\}\cap X.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Illustration==

Figure 1 represents the set ''X'' painted grey and some boxes. Some of them of degenerated, i.e., they correspond to singletons. Figure 2 represents these boxes 
after [[contraction mapping|contraction]]. Note that no point of ''X'' has been removed by the contractor. The contractor
is minimal for the cyan box but is pessimistic for the green one. All degenerated blue boxes are contracted to
the empty box. The magenta box and the red box cannot be contracted.

==Contractor algebra==

Some operations can be performed on contractors to build more complex contractors.
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[intersection]], [[Union (set theory)|the union]], the [[Composition algebra|composition]] and the repetition are defined as follows.

: &lt;math&gt;
( C_1 \cap C_2)( [x]) =C_1 ( [x]) \cap
C_2 ( [x]) 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
( C_1 \cup C_2 ) ( [x]) = [ C_1 ([x]) \cup C_2 ( [x]) ] 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
( C_1 \circ C_2) ( [x]) =C_1 ( C_2 ([x]) ) 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; C^\infty ( [x])=C\circ C\circ C\circ \cdots \circ C ([x])&lt;/math&gt;

== Building contractors ==

There exist different ways to build contractors associated to [[Equation|equations]] and [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]],
say, ''f''(''x'') in [''y'']. Most of them are based on interval arithmetic.
One of the most efficient and most simple is the ''forward/backward contractor'' (also 
called as HC4-revise). 
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Messine|first1=F.|
title=Méthode d’optimisation globale basée sur l’analyse d’intervalles pour la résolution de problèmes avec contraintes|year=1997|publisher=Thèse de doctorat, Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse|

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Benhamou|first1=F.|

&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle is to evaluate ''f''(''x'') using [[interval arithmetic]] (this is the forward step).
The resulting [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] is [[Intersection (set theory)|intersected]] with [''y'']. A backward evaluation of ''f''(''x'') is then performed 
in order to contract the intervals for the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (this is the backward step). We now illustrate the principle on a simple example.

Consider the constraint
&lt;math&gt;
(x_1+x_2)\cdot x_3 \in [1,2].
&lt;/math&gt;
We can evaluate the function ''f''(''x'') by introducing the two intermediate
[[Dependent and independent variables|variables]] ''a'' and ''b'', as follows

: &lt;math&gt;
a =x_1+x_2
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
b =a\cdot x_3
&lt;/math&gt;

The two previous constraints are called ''forward constraints''. We get the ''backward constraints'' 
by taking each forward constraint in the reverse order and isolating each variable on the right hand side.  We get

: &lt;math&gt;
x_3 =\frac{b}{a} 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
a =\frac{b}{x_3} 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
x_1=a-x_2
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
x_2=a-x_1
&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting forward/backward contractor 
&lt;math&gt; 
C([x_1],[x_2],[x_3])
&lt;/math&gt;
is obtained by
evaluating the forward and the backward constraints using [[Interval arithmetic|interval analysis]].

: &lt;math&gt;
[a] =[x_1]+[x_2]
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
[b] =[a]\cdot [x_3] 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
[b] =[b]\cap [1,2]
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
[x_3] =[x_3]\ \cap \ \frac{[b]}{[a]} 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
[a] =[a]\cap \frac{[b]}{[x_3]} 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
[x_1] =[x_1]\ \cap \ \ [a]-[x_2] 
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
[x_2] =[x_2]\ \cap \ \ [a]-[x_1]
&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies''' is an interfaculty interdisciplinary research centre of the Humanities and Social Sciences at [[KU Leuven]], Belgium. It carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, and has been recognized as a KU Leuven Centre of Excellence.

== History and Research ==
The Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, with a particular focus on the following areas, taking the many cross-cutting issues into account: (i) the European Union and global governance, (ii) human rights, democracy and rule of law, (iii) trade and sustainable development, (iv) peace and security, (v) emerging powers, (vi) federalism and multi-level governance, (vii) global commons and outer space, and (viii) non-state actors.

In full recognition of the complex issues involved, the Centre approaches global governance from a multilevel and multi-actor perspective. The Centre considers non-European perspectives to global governance of great importance. It also hosts the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/eu_china_chair|title=– InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; which engages in interdisciplinary research and education on EU-China relations in close synergy with the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair at the Université catholique de Louvain, and the Leuven India Focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/india_focus|title=– Leuven India Focus|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which aims at developing knowledge and expertise on India and South Asia by organizing conferences, lectures and seminars and interdisciplinary research. The Centre regularly organizes transatlantic conferences and events focusing on Latin America and Asia, and takes a keen interest in the Global South.

In addition to its fundamental research, the Centre carries out independent applied research and advises policy-makers on multilateral governance and global public policy issues. It works with academic and policy partners from all over the world, including the [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], [[European External Action Service]], [[Committee of the Regions]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[World Bank]] and [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). The Centre publishes the Leuven Global Governance Series&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-elgar.com/search_results.lasso?series_title=Leuven%20Global%20Governance%20series&amp;series_search=Yes&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Edward Elgar Publishing|Edward Elgar Publishers]], makes it research available through academic journal articles, working papers, policy briefs and global governance opinions on its web site and regularly publishes a newsletter.

Since March 2011, the Centre is located in the historical house de Dorlodot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/contact.html|title=Contact Information|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the Centre of Leuven. The house is named after {{ill|Henry de Dorlodot|nl}}, a Belgian theologian and paleontologist (1855–1929).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7141">The '''maximum theorem''' provides conditions for the [[continuous function|continuity]] of an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]] function and the set of its maximizers as a parameter changes. The statement was first proven by [[Claude Berge]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Ok, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem is primarily used in [[mathematical economics]].

==Statement of theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; be metric spaces, &lt;math&gt;f:X\times\Theta\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a function jointly continuous in its two arguments, and &lt;math&gt;C:\Theta\twoheadrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; be a compact-valued [[Multivalued function|correspondence]].

For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, let
: &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)=\max\{f(x,\theta)|x\in C(\theta)\}&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)=\mathrm{arg}\max\{f(x,\theta)|x\in C(\theta)\}=\{x\in C(\theta)\,|\,f(x,\theta)=f^*(\theta)\}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is continuous (i.e. both upper and lower [[hemicontinuity|hemicontinuous]]) at some &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, compact-valued, and upper hemicontinuous at &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Interpretation==
The theorem is typically interpreted as providing conditions for a parametric optimization problem to have continuous solutions with regard to the parameter. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter space, &lt;math&gt;f(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the function to be maximized, and &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; gives the constraint set that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is maximized over. Then, &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the maximized value of the function and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points that maximize &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

The result is that if the elements of an optimization problem are sufficiently continuous, then some, but not all, of that continuity is preserved in the solutions.

==Proof==
The proof relies primarily on the sequential definitions of upper and lower [[hemicontinuity]].

Because &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is compact-valued and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, the [[extreme value theorem]] guarantees the constrained maximum of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty for all &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then, let &lt;math&gt;\theta_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence converging to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n \in C^*(\theta_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is upper hemicontinuous, there exists a convergent subsequence &lt;math&gt;x_{n_k}\to x \in C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. 

If it is shown that &lt;math&gt;x \in C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, then
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty} f^*(\theta_{n_k}) = \lim_{k \to \infty} f(x_{n_k},\theta_{n_k}) = f(x,\theta) = f^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
which would simultaneously prove the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; and the upper hemicontinuity of &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose to the contrary that &lt;math&gt;x \not\in C^*(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. there exists an &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\in C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(\hat{x},\theta) &gt; f(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is lower hemicontinuous, there is a further subsequence of &lt;math&gt;n_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_{n_j} \in C(\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}_{n_j} \to \hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;. By the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the contradiction hypothesis,
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} f(\hat{x}_{n_j},\theta_{n_j}) = f(\hat{x},\theta) &gt; f(x,\theta) = \lim_{j \to \infty} f(x_{n_j},\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt;.
But this implies that for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;f(\hat{x}_{n_j},\theta_{n_j}) &gt; f(x_{n_j},\theta_{n_j})&lt;/math&gt;
which would mean &lt;math&gt;x_{n_j}&lt;/math&gt; is not a maximizer, a contradiction of &lt;math&gt;x_n \in C^*(\theta_n)&lt;/math&gt;. This establishes the continuity of &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; and the upper hemicontinuity of &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Because &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta) \subset C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is compact, it is sufficient to show &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is closed-valued for it to be compact-valued. This can be done by contradiction using sequences similar to above.

==Variants and generalizations==
If in addition to the conditions above, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[quasiconcave]] in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is also convex-valued. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly quasiconcave in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is single-valued, and thus is a continuous function rather than a correspondence.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Concave function|concave]] and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Convex set|convex]] graph, then &lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is concave and &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is convex-valued. Similarly to above, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is strictly concave, then &lt;math&gt;C^*&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function.&lt;ref&gt;Sundaram, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to generalize Berge's theorem to non-compact set-valued correspondences if the objective function is K-inf-compact.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Zadoianchuk, Kasyanov, Theorem 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Consider a [[utility maximization problem]] where a consumer makes a choice from their budget set. Translating from the notation above to the standard consumer theory notation,
* &lt;math&gt;X=\mathbb{R}_+^l&lt;/math&gt; is the space of all bundles of &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; commodities,
* &lt;math&gt;\Theta=\mathbb{R}_{++}^l \times \mathbb{R}_{++}&lt;/math&gt; represents the price vector of the commodities &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the consumer's wealth &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;f(x,\theta)=u(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the consumer's [[utility function]], and
* &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)=B(p,w)=\{x \,|\, px \leq w\}&lt;/math&gt; is the consumer's [[budget set]].

Then, 
* &lt;math&gt;f^*(\theta)=v(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indirect utility function]] and
* &lt;math&gt;C^*(\theta)=x(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Marshallian demand]].

Proofs in [[general equilibrium theory]] often apply the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem|Brouwer]] or [[Kakutani fixed point theorem]]s to the consumer's demand, which require compactness and continuity, and the maximum theorem provides the sufficient conditions to do so.

[[File:MedicalExaminerVan.jpg|right|thumb|Medical examiner van]]

A '''medical examiner''' is a person trained in medicine or a medical organization that investigates deaths and injuries that occur under unusual or suspicious circumstances, to perform [[post-mortem]] examinations, and in some jurisdictions to initiate [[inquest]]s.&lt;ref name=CvM&gt;{{cite web|title=Coroner vs. medical examiner|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/examiner.html|website=Visible Proofs|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical examiners, [[coroner]]s and [[forensic pathologist]]s are often thought to be the same, but they are different professions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/medical-examiner/|title=Forensic Medical Examiner Jobs in Forensic Criminal Investigations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}} Coroners have a completely different role as well as having differing responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some parts of the United States, unlike a medical examiner or forensic pathologist, coroners are elected officials and may not require the extensive medical training that the former must go through.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Job roles==
A medical examiner's duties may vary depending on location. The medical examiners’ job is usually extensive and has a lot that goes into it. Typically, a medical examiner's duties may include:

* investigating human organs like the stomach, liver, brain,
* determining cause of death,
* examining the condition of the body&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* studying tissue, organs, cells, and bodily fluids&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* issuing [[death certificates]],
* maintaining [[Death Records|death records]],
* responding to deaths in mass disasters,
* working closely with [[law enforcement]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/forensic-science/forensic-pathologist/|title=Forensic Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* identifying unknown dead, or
* performing other functions depending on local law.

In some [[jurisdictions]],  a [[coroner]] performs these and other duties. It’s not uncommon for a medical examiner to visit [[crime scene]]s or to testify in [[court]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This takes a certain amount of confidence in which the medical examiner has to rely on their expertise to make a true [[testimony]] and accurately testify the facts of their findings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Medical examiners specialize in [[Forensic science|forensic]] knowledge and rely on this during their work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to studying [[cadaver]]s, they are also trained in [[toxicology]], DNA technology and [[forensic serology]] (blood analysis).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pulling from each area of knowledge, a medical examiner can accurately determine a cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This information can help law enforcement crack a case and is crucial to their ability to track criminals in the event of a [[homicide]] or other related events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Within the United States, there is a mixture of coroner and medical examiner systems, and in some states, [[Dual systems model|dual systems]].  The requirements to hold office vary widely between jurisdictions.

==Qualifications==

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|formal medical training]] is required for medical examiners. Many employers also request training in [[pathology]] while others do not. In the UK, a medical examiner is always a medically trained professional, whereas a [[Coroner#England and Wales|coroner]] is a [[judicial officer]].

Pilot studies in Sheffield and seven other areas, which involved medical examiners looking at more than 27,000 deaths since 2008, found 25% of hospital death certificates were inaccurate and 20% of causes of death were wrong. [[Suzy Lishman]], president of the [[Royal College of Pathologists]], said it was crucial there was "independent scrutiny of causes of death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical examiners help expose patient safety risks|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-medical-examiners-help-expose-patient-safety-risks/5081968.article#.VP9HiPzkdc4|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Qualifications for medical examiners in the US vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  In Wisconsin, for example, some counties do not require individuals to have any special educational or medical training to hold this office.&lt;ref&gt;Coroners and Medical Examiners: A Comparison of Options Offered by Both Systems in Wisconsin Jenifer Keach, Rock (WI) County Coroner, April 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In most jurisdictions, a medical examiner is required to have a [[medical degree]], although in many this need not be in pathology. Other jurisdictions have stricter requirements, including additional education in [[pathology]], law, and [[forensic pathology]]. Medical examiners are typically appointed officers.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, (2009), pp 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In the United States, the road to becoming a medical examiner is a long and hard one. They require a lot of extensive training in order to become experts in their field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After high school, the additional schooling may take 11–18 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They must attend a [[college]] or [[university]] to receive a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor’s degree]] in the sciences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Biology]] is usually the most common.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/Medical_Examiner_How_to_Become_a_Medical_Examiner_in_5_Steps.html|title=How to Become a Medical Examiner in 5 Steps|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, it takes four years to complete a bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A medical degree (Doctor of Medicine, MD) is required to become a medical examiner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forensicsciencecareers.net/medical-examiner.html|title=Medical Examiner - Forensic Science Careers|work=Forensic Science Careers|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To prepare for medical school, the [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] (Medical College Admissions Test) must be taken and passed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Medical school]] is another four years with the first two dedicated to academics and the rest of the two used to gain [[clinic]]al experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additional training is required after medical school. The first step is to complete pathological forensic training.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This usually consists of anatomic and clinical pathology training which takes anywhere from four to five years to complete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After this, an anatomic pathology [[residency (medicine)|residency]] and/or a [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in forensic pathology should be completed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before practicing, they must also become certified through the [[American Board of Pathology]];&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this certificate is good for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learningpath.org/articles/Becoming_a_Medical_Examiner_Salary_Info_Job_Description.html|title=Becoming a Medical Examiner: Salary Info &amp; Job Description|website=learningpath.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job outlook ==
The general job outlook for medical examiners in the United States is considered to be excellent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Salary varies greatly by state and location, but it is estimated to average between $105,000 and $500,000 a year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Modulor''' is an [[anthropometric]] [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s devised by the [[List of Swiss people|Swiss-born]] [[List of French people|French]] [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]] (1887–1965).

It was developed as a visual bridge between two incompatible scales, the [[Imperial units|imperial]] and the [[metric system]]. It is based on the height of a man with his arm raised.

It was used as a system to set out a number of Le Corbusier's buildings and was later codified into two books.

==History==
Le Corbusier developed the Modulor in the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci's]] [[Vitruvian Man]], the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and other attempts to discover mathematical proportions in the human body and then to use that knowledge to improve both the appearance and function of [[architecture]].{{sfnp|Ostwald|2001|p=146}}  The system is based on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], the double unit, the [[Fibonacci numbers]], and the [[golden ratio]].  Le Corbusier described it as a "range of harmonious measurements to suit the human scale, universally applicable to architecture and to mechanical things".

With the Modulor, Le Corbusier sought to introduce a scale of visual measures that would unite two virtually incompatible systems: the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo Saxon]] [[Foot (length)|foot]] and [[inch]] and the French metric system.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=17}} Whilst he was intrigued by ancient civilisations who used measuring systems linked to the human body: elbow ([[cubit]]), finger ([[Digit (length)|digit]]), thumb (inch) etc., he was troubled by the [[metre]] as a measure that was a forty-millionth part of the meridian of the earth.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=20}}

In 1943, in response to the French National Organisation for Standardisation's ([[AFNOR]]) requirement for standardising all the objects involved in the construction process, Le Corbusier asked an apprentice to consider a scale based upon a man with his arm raised to 2.20&amp;nbsp;m in height.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=36}} The result, in August 1943 was the first graphical representation of the derivation of the scale. This was refined after a visit to the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences in Sorbonne on 7 February 1945 which resulted in the inclusion of a golden section into the representation.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=43}}

Whilst initially the Modulor Man's height was based on a French man's height of {{convert|1.75|m|ftin}} it was changed to 1.83&amp;nbsp;m in 1946 because "in English detective novels, the good-looking men, such as policemen, are always six feet tall!"{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=56}} The dimensions were refined to give round numbers and the overall height of the raised arm was set at 2.262&amp;nbsp;m.

Of the works leading to the creation of the Modulor, Robin Evans notes that the female body "was only belatedly considered and rejected as a source of proportional harmony".{{sfnp|Ostwald|2001|p=146}}

==Promotion==
On the 10 January 1946, Le Corbusier on a visit to New York met with [[Henry J. Kaiser]], an American industrialist whose [[Kaiser Shipyard]] had built [[Liberty ship|Liberty Ships]] during [[World War II]]. Kaiser's project was to build ten thousand new houses a day, but he had changed his mind and decided to build cars instead.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=52}} During the interview, Le Corbusier sympathised with Kaiser's problems of coordinating the adoption of equipment between the American and British armies because of the differences in units of length and promoted his own ''harmonious scale''.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=115}}

On the same trip he met with [[David E. Lilienthal]] of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] to promote the use of his ''harmonious scale'' on further civil engineering projects.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=53}}

He also applied the principle of the Modulor to the efficient design of distribution crates in post war France.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=122}}

==Graphic representation==
The graphic representation of the Modulor, a stylised human figure with one arm raised, stands next to two vertical measurements, a red series based on the figure's navel height (1.08&amp;nbsp;m in the original version, 1.13&amp;nbsp;m in the revised version) then segmented according to [[Phi]], and a blue series based on the figure's entire height, double the navel height (2.16&amp;nbsp;m in the original version, 2.26&amp;nbsp;m in the revised), segmented similarly.  A [[spiral]], graphically developed between the red and blue segments, seems to mimic the volume of the human figure.

The Modulor 2 was drawn by [[André Maissonier]] and [[Justino Serralta]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Nudelman, [http://www.farq.edu.uy/patio/institucion/en-recuerdo.html "En recuerdo: Justino Serralta, 'arquitecto de comunidades', 1919–2011"], ''Boletín Facultad de Arquitectura UDELAR'' (30 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical application==
Le Corbusier used his Modulor scale in the design of many [[Le Corbusier#Key buildings|buildings]], including:

===Unité d'Habitation à Marseille===

In his first book on the subject ''The Modulor'', Le Corbusier has a chapter on the use of the modular in the [[Unité d'Habitation]]. The modular governs: the plan, section and elevations; the [[Brise soleil|brise-soleil]]; the roof; the supporting columns and the plan and section of the apartments. It was also used for the dimensions of the commemorative stone laid on 14 October 1947.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=131}} A version of the Modulor Man was [[casting|cast]] in [[concrete]] near the entrance.

===Church of Sainte Marie de La Tourette===

In the Church of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] Le Corbusier floors the majority of the church in pale concrete panels set to Modulor dimensions.{{sfnp|Samuel|2007|p=62}} Also, the engineer [[Iannis Xenakis]] applied the Modulor system to the design of the exterior vertical ventilators or "ondulatoires".{{sfnp|Samuel|2007|p=83}}

===Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts===

In the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts|Carpenter Center]] the Modulor system was used for the brise-soleil distances, the floor to floor heights, the bay distances and the column thicknesses.{{sfnp|Sekler|Curtis|1978|p=158}} Le Corbusier conceived that the dimensioning of the entrance ramp would be "''visible essay on the mathematics of the human body''".{{sfnp|Sekler|Curtis|1978|p=182}}

==Publication==
Le Corbusier published ''Le Modulor'' in 1948, followed by ''Modulor 2'' in 1955.  These works were first published in English as ''The Modulor'' in 1954 and ''Modulor 2 (Let the User Speak Next)'' in 1958.

The 2004 reprinted box set including both books was printed in a square format using the Modulor with the series twenty seven to one hundred and forty reduced in size to one tenth.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=back cover}}

==Commemorative Usage==
[[File:CHF10 8 back horizontal.jpg|thumb|250px|Back side of the Swiss 10 CHF banknote, showing the Modulor]]
* A picture of the Modulor appears on the eighth banknote series on the 10 CHF [[Banknotes of the Swiss franc|Swiss banknote]] dedicated to Le Corbusier.

Set in [[Chiswick]] in west London, it stars [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]] as Ben Harper, [[Zoë Wanamaker]] as his wife Susan, and [[Kris Marshall]], [[Daniela Denby-Ashe]], and [[Gabriel Thomson]] as their children Nick, Janey and Michael. Since the show’s debut, several characters have left and others have been introduced. The character of Janey left in 2002, then returned in 2004 and remained until the end. Kris Marshall's character, Nick, left in 2005 and returned for occasional brief guest appearances, though he was frequently mentioned by other characters. The character of Abi, as played by [[Siobhan Hayes]], was introduced in 2002 and left in 2008. The characters of Roger and Alfie were introduced in 2003 and 2005, played by [[Keiron Self]] and [[Rhodri Meilir]].

==Background==
In 1999, Fred Barron was considering producing a British sitcom the same way sitcoms were produced in the U.S. ''My Family'' was to feature a group of writers rather than the standard one or two, something that had been attempted in the UK with shows including ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'' and ''[[On the Buses]]'', but was nevertheless atypical. ''My Family'' was consciously designed to have wide appeal, with characters viewers could build a relationship with in the same way as previous BBC sitcom ''[[2point4 Children]]'' which focuses around a similar family unit.

The show chronicles the lives of the Harpers, a fictional middle-class British family who live at 78 Lancaster Road, [[Chiswick]], [[London]]. Dentist Ben and his wife Susan, a tour guide who later works for an art gallery, have three children: Nick, Janey, and Michael, who complicate their lives. Susan is a control freak, but Ben prefers to leave the children to it and stay as uninvolved as possible. Janey later goes to University, but drops out and moves back in later, while Nick finally gets his own place.

Mainly focusing on Ben and Susan, the show featured sub-stories ranging from Nick's harebrained schemes to Abi and Roger's love life. It is described as a "[[dysfunctional family]]"-style sitcom; however, many of the episodes feature the family working together to get one another out of trouble. Nick's bizarre jobs became a major feature of the first four series. After the departure of Nick then more prominence was given to Abi and Roger's love life, Michael's schemes, Janey's endless list of boyfriends, and Alfie's dream of musical stardom.

The show saw considerable development and change in its characters' lives, seeing Janey turn from teenage rebel to mother, Nick turn from prat to responsible prat, Abi marry Roger, and Michael go through and beyond school days. Meanwhile, Ben remained the same self-absorbed dentist, Susan remained the same control freak, and Alfie remained the same dimwitted layabout lodger.

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of My Family characters}}
The series featured eight main cast members throughout its run, with numerous characters recurring throughout the 10 series. The main cast members were familiar to television viewers before their roles on ''My Family'', but not all were considered stars. During the tenth series' run, the actors all achieved household-name celebrity status.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Main characters===
*'''[[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]]''' (2000–11) portrays '''[[Ben Harper (My Family)|Ben Harper]]'''. Ben Harper is an overly-[[misanthropy|misanthropic]] and [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] dentist. When he is not at work sacking another assistant or trying to avoid fellow-dentist Roger, he is at home trying to relax (which never works). Ben isn't a bad man; behind his sardonic exterior he does really love his family and has to put up with being bossed about and manipulated by his wife Susan and continually fleeced for money by his children.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/my_family/characters/|title=My Family|work=comedy.org.uk|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Zoë Wanamaker]]''' (2000–11) portrays '''[[Susan Harper (My Family)|Susan Harper]]'''. Susan Harper is a control freak and very good at getting her way. She is constantly worried about her three children and often forces Ben to go out of his way to monitor or look after them. Susan is a [[tour guide]] but seems to spend most of her time at home. She is a terrible [[cooking|cook]]. This is a homage to ''[[Butterflies (TV series)|Butterflies]]'', in which the male lead is also a dentist called Ben and the rest of the family often have to sneak the food she has prepared into the bin without her noticing.
*'''[[Kris Marshall]]''' (2000–05) portrays '''[[Nick Harper (My Family)|Nick Harper]]'''. Nick Harper is the oldest sibling. He is a complete layabout who is constantly changing jobs – a self-employed stuntman one minute, a gorilla-o-gram the next, at one point a sperm-donor. Extremely laid-back, Nick cannot be trusted to look after money or handle important tasks. He was last seen moving into his own flat, and from phone conversations Ben and Susan have with him, he seems to be coping with living on his own.
*'''[[Daniela Denby-Ashe]]''' (2000–02; 2004–11) portrays '''[[Janey Harper]]'''. Fashion-conscious, money-loving, boy-mad Janey spends all her time on the phone, switching boyfriends, or pestering Ben for shopping money. Whilst at [[Manchester University]] (spending yet more of her dad's money) Janey got pregnant. She was expelled and returned home to once again take advantage of her parents. Susan does not seem to mind, as it means she now has [[List of My Family characters#Kenzo Harper|Kenzo Harper]] to look after.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"/&gt;
*'''[[Gabriel Thomson]]''' (2000–11) portrays '''[[Michael Harper (My Family)|Michael Harper]]'''. Michael (or "Mikey" as Ben calls him) is Susan and Ben's youngest, a smart, geeky adolescent. He looks down on his family, thinking he is more sensible than the rest of them put together, and often ends up getting them out of trouble. Since starting university he has experimented with bleached hair and [[piercings]]. In series 10 Michael comes out and tells his family that he is gay; he is relieved when they accept this.
*'''[[Siobhan Hayes]]''' (2002–08) portrays '''[[Abi Harper (My Family)|Abi Harper]]'''. Abi moved into the Harper household in the third series. She is Ben's first cousin once removed, very clumsy and very dim, and often seen telling off Ben or Susan. When she finally realized that Roger was madly in love with her, they married in series seven, but she later left him to become a nun.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"/&gt;
*'''[[Keiron Self]]''' (2002–11) portrays '''[[Roger Bailey (My Family)|Roger Bailey]]'''. Roger is the over-enthusiastic dentist who works in the same building as Ben. He often turns up at the Harper household uninvited and proceeds to unintentionally annoy Ben. For a long [[Period of time|period]] Roger was trying to build up the courage to ask Abi out. They were, after all, ideally suited – like Abi, Roger possesses no common sense and is [[gullible]]. Eventually they did marry but have since split as Abi has decided to become a nun. He's now a part-time policeman as well a dentist.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"/&gt;
*'''[[Rhodri Meilir]]''' (2005–09) portrays '''[[List of My Family characters#Alfie Butts|Alfie Butts]]'''. Alfie is a friend of Nick's who turned up at the Harper household at Christmas 2005. Alfie comes from a small community in Wales which, based on his stories, has some rather backwards traditions. Also, there weren't many girls where he came from, so he savors spending time at the Harpers' and meeting Michael's friends. Most of the family have turned to him at various times for advice. He's a struggling musician who is very laid-back about life despite not having a home or a steady income.&lt;ref name="comedy.org.uk"/&gt; He did not appear in the 2009 Christmas special and was completely absent from the whole of series 10 and 11, with no explanation.
*'''[[Tayler Marshall]]''' (2006–11; character introduced in 2003) portrays '''[[List of My Family characters#Kenzo Harper|Kenzo Harper]]'''. Kenzo is the youngest member of the Harper household, son of Janey, grandson of Ben and Susan and nephew of Michael and Nick. Even at such a young age, he's shown a massive [[intelligence]] which at times even rivals, and at times even beats, Michael's. At the end of series nine, he has done a project about his family and he tells them his teachers want him to see a [[psychologist]]. As portrayed by Tayler Marshall, Kenzo bears a striking resemblance to his uncle Nick (Kris Marshall).&lt;ref&gt;Tayler and Kris Marshall are not related.&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming Kenzo in 2006, Tayler Marshall portrayed a guest at Kenzo's third-birthday party in 2005.

===Other characters===
*'''[[Daisy Donovan]]''' portrays '''Brigitte McKay''', Ben Harper's dental assistant for the entire first series. She was known for her unique way of thinking and living, and often tried to offer Ben and his patients spiritual guidance. She often forgot to take phone messages for Ben and irritated him while he worked. She and Nick appeared to be attracted to each other.
*'''Chloe Bale''' portrays '''Sasha''', Janey's best friend in series 8–11. Storylines focused on the pair getting into trouble (usually instigated by Sasha). She was disliked by Ben, then by Janey until they became friends again.
*'''Maxine''' an [[unseen character]] was Janey's best friend from school. Although she was never seen, it was hinted that Maxine was very much like Janey: popular, and fashion-conscious. Janey once admitted to Susan that she hung out with Maxine because Maxine's alleged "ugliness" made Janey look more beautiful. Janey was also jealous that Maxine's parents treated her with expensive designer labels. It is unknown if they kept in touch.
*'''[[Rosemary Leach]]''' portrays '''Grace Riggs''', Susan Harper's mother, known for her addiction to alcohol, especially [[Martini (cocktail)|martinis]]. She and Susan have a cold relationship, and are locked in a constant psychological battle. Grace has had various boyfriends in the show and was the one who told Ben that Susan was married before she married him. She likes to make Susan feel guilty for not visiting her and often uses deceitful tactics to lure her over. Her own late mother, Mary, owned a highly-successful [[brothel]] in London's West End. She first appeared in series two, played by Avril Elgar and credited as "Rebecca" (although she was not referred to by name in the episode). She did not reappear until Leach took up the role in series four. It was announced in the episode "A Decent Proposal" that she had died.
*'''[[Kevin Bishop]]''' portrays '''Stupid Brian''', Janey's boyfriend in the show's second series when he and Janey were still at school but he was getting into decorating. Although he lived up to the nickname 'Stupid Brian,' he was surprising apt at building a bookshelf for the Harpers' kitchen.
*'''Alex Dawson''' portrays '''Hubert''', Michael's best friend (it's unknown whether they're still in touch). Hubert was known for being very square but very smart. He once created a television remote that could gain 'free' access channels that required PINs for them.
*'''Andy Taylor''' portrays '''Hotel Receptionist''', appearing in five episodes. He appears in different hotels across the country as a hotel receptionist. Each time he encountered the Harper family he became more familiar with their dysfunctional antics. He once suspected that Susan was an escort and that Ben had a mistress.
*'''[[Nickolas Grace]]''' portrays '''Mr. Casey''', the Harpers' next-door neighbour, although he doesn't get along with them. Viewers first met him as a recent widower who had adopted a dog and named her Gemma. He also tried to scam Ben for money after Ben ran over this dog.
*'''[[Rachel Hyde-Harvey]]''' portrays '''Fiona''', Michael's girlfriend throughout the fourth series. She and Michael are caught in bed together but never had sex. They are also caught kissing in the airing cupboard, and in another scene they begin to take their clothes off but Susan is listening and says they should stop.
*'''Nathan Brine''' portrays '''Scott Marsh''' in series 10. Scott is Michael's first boyfriend. In his first appearance, Ben accidentally outed him to his homophobic father and he was forced to leave home. Susan invited him to live at the house, but Michael and Scott moved into a new flat instead. A few episodes later, it was revealed that Scott and Michael had split up, although they got back together in the same episode.

[[File:Peter Capaldi 2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Capaldi]] portrays movie-star "Colin Judd" who visits Ben for dental health. Capaldi appeared in episode "[[List of My Family episodes#Series Five (2004)|Dentist To The Stars]]" which is the tenth episode of series five.]]

The '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series One (2000)|first series]]''', Ben, a dentist, and Susan, the worst cook in the world, are certainly loving, caring parents; they just have a problem showing it. Ben seems to be confused as to how much time and money his kids demand from him. Susan has to juggle motherhood, a career, and a husband and hasn't enough time to manage everything, including improving her cooking skills. Nick is always working on his next hair-brained scheme to keep him amused. Janey, like any normal teenage daughter, feels that her parents are seriously embarrassing whilst Michael keeps his head in his books to get away from the noise.

The '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Two (2001)|second series]]''', Ben Harper, husband and father to three different and often difficult children, has spent his working life as a dentist. Just as well as most of his life seems rather like pulling teeth. His wife Susan is usually busy showing foreign tourists around London, a place she knows much better than her own kitchen. Ben and Susan have been married happily enough to have three children. However, Ben has the feeling that most of the time his children seem to speak a different language. Nick (20) has persuaded his parents he would benefit from a gap year to see something of the world, but he has hardly seen anything beyond the confines of the sofa. Janey (17) is into boys, fashion labels (expensive ones), and getting her own way. Michael (14) is the brightest of the trio. He is seriously into computers and not so seriously (yet) into girls.

[[File:Anthony Head Cleveland Vulkon Slayercon cropped.jpg|left|thumb|135px|upright|[[Anthony Head]], portrays Ben's cousin and the father of Abi Harper. Head appeared in episode "[[List of My Family episodes#Series Four (2003)|May the Best Man Win]]", which is the twelfth episode of the fourth series. He appears again in the 2009 Christmas special, played by Nathaniel Parker.]]

In '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Three (2002)|series three]]''', life in the Harper household is as hectic as ever, Janey has left for university but the seriously accident-prone Cousin Abi has moved in. Ben sees this new addition to their home as a threat to the peace and quiet he's wanted throughout his married life, while Susan is happy to have another woman in the house. As for Michael, he is now spending as much time thinking about girls now as his schoolwork. Furthermore, Nick continued to work on his next hair-brained scheme, whether that means starring as Jesus in the local nativity play or dressing up as a drag queen!

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Four (2003)|fourth series]]''', Susan looks forward to the birth of her first grandchild, but dreads being a grandmother. Nick is getting fed up with living in his ghastly flat and trying to think of a way to move back into the family home. The gap between Michael's IQ and the rest of the family's seems to be increasing, but so is his libido. And Abi is still Abi, only more so! As for perennially put-upon Ben, what with a new arrival causing chaos in the surgery, being forced to take tango lessons and being officially declared dead, life is just one long major-league cirsis.

In '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Five (2004)|Series five]]''', Ben and Susan are enjoying some new-found tranquility, Nick has moved into his own flat, Janey is at university and Abi is usually out at evening class. Naturally the peace is not to last! Janey comes back home with baby Kenzo and Michael has been "born again" and is holding Bible study sessions in the living room. With Ben's famous dental patients, Susan's election ambitions and an unheathly obsession with Inspector Morse – not to mention the unlikely perils of house-sitting in a luxury modern apartment – domestic life will soon be back to Harper-Normal. So when Ben and Susan start being nice to each other, it's no wonder Abi's suspicious; they could not be getting a divorce, could they?

[[File:John Barrowman 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Barrowman]], portrays a man called "The Doctor" that Susan begins to fall for at an airport. He appeared in episode "[[List of My Family episodes#Series Nine (2009)|The Guru]]", which is the eighth episode of series nine.]]

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Six (2006)|sixth series]]''', Janey and son Kenzo spend much more time at the Harper house than is good for Ben, and Michael moves from scam to scam with alarming ease. Add to that the ever-so-slowly blossoming of the Abi-Roger romance and the new cuckoo in the nest, wiser-than-he-looks Alfie Butts and the problems multiply. The family's hurdles include Ben joining a secret society (The Brotherhood of the Cockerel), Susan's new job leading her to a dinner date with a new man and an encounter with squatters. In other words, as usual, problems and situations constantly conspire to remind Ben and Susan that "family" is an "F" word.

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Seven (2007)|seventh series]]''', a mystery man arrives asking for Janey – Susan finally discovers the identity of Kenzo's father. Roger and Abi's marriage announcement gives Susan the idea to renew her marriage vows despite protests from Ben. A death in the dentist's chair is not very good for business, but Ben discovers it's not good for his private life either. Michael succeeds in placing the whole family on ''The Weakest Link'', but Anne Robinson raises more difficult questions than might have been expected.

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Eight (2008)|eighth series]]''', love is in the air in the Harper house. Ben is in love with an extremely large television; Janey is in love with a new man; and Michael's current love has announced that she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Ben and Susan's credit-card statement highlights each of their secret vices, and an armed robbery at the local bank leads to Ben and Janey being taken as hostages. Michael and Alfie investigate the world of internet dating with mixed results, and Abi realises her true vocation in life is to become a nun!

In '''[[List of My Family episodes#Series Nine (2009)|series nine]]''', chaos, paranoia and misunderstanding – yes, it's life as usual in the Harper household. Ben stands up to – and gets put down by – his own school bully and gets a little jealous as a rich businessman falls for Susan – or is that Janey? There are new worries as they discover that Michael's seeing a therapist and Ben fails his retraining exam – and, while the family is divided over mean Uncle Norris' inheritance and the acquisition of a puppy, Ben's delighted to discover he's the inspiration for a wealthy if unhappy, celebrity dentist!

In the '''[[List of My Family episodes|tenth series]]''', in the second episode ("The Son'll Come Out") Michael comes out as gay to his parents, first to his father after coming home drunk, then later to his mother. He then tells them that he has been in a relationship with a guy for some time, 25-year-old solicitor Scott Marsh, who later moves into the Harper residence, though he is later seen in gay clubs picking up guys and giving out his number, suggesting that he and Scott have broken up, but they later get back together. These consist of a nine-part tenth series and a seven-part eleventh series.

Finally, in the '''[[List of My Family episodes|eleventh series]]''', Ben and Susan trial separating following some extensive humiliation of each other! Michael wrestles with taking care of Kenzo and Janey's fed up with being a grown up... At last, Roger is back on the dating scene but with Ben suddenly becoming attached to his sworn enemy, he might find it more difficult than he expects. Susan is back to her career and in classic Harper style, she's going after her boss from day one!

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:My Family.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''My Family'' title card from the third series. (2002)|{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 12 October 2009}}]] --&gt;
The first episode aired on 19 September 2000, and ten series have so far been aired with seven specials, including nine Christmas specials. The eleventh series began airing on Friday 17 June 2011. A [[Comic Relief]] special short-episode has also aired.

The BBC and UKTV refuse to re-broadcast the series four episode "Blind Justice", due to the receipt of 4 complaints (from a viewing public of 12m). Although no reason was given, as this was not subject to any Ofcom procedure, it is likely that was considered offensive to blind people. This episode is banned from British TV, but it is still on the series four UK DVD release and has been screened on [[BBC America]].

The episodes are recorded in front of a live audience in [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Iver]], Buckinghamshire, except where the set used is too large, this is then filmed, and played out to an invited audience 'as-live'. Also, the show, unlike most British sitcoms but in common with most American television comedies, has no location footage. Scenes taking place outdoors were actually sets.

The series is scripted by a team of writers, following the American model. Historically, British sitcoms were more generally written by one or two writers. By employing a wider number of writers to brainstorm jokes for each episode, DLT Entertainment UK Ltd, the production company, has been able to maintain a consistent and relatively long-lived product without having to wait for a single writer to produce more material.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MyFamilyopeningtitles2007.png|thumb|right|205px|''My Family'' title card from the seventh (2007) and eight (2008) series.]] --&gt;
At the start of the first two series, it slides across four boxes with each character's face in them. The first box stands alone with Ben and Susan in it. The other three are lapped over each other with a photo of Michael, Janey and Nick from left to right in them. While it slides across at the start, each character's face turns with Janey and Nick smiling and the others being fairly plain faced. Once the boxes are placed, the boxes with youngsters in them drop to the bottom of the screen and are replaced with the show's logo.

At the start of the third series, four rectangle blocks fall onto a completely white screen to create Ben's face. Those blocks are then replaced with blocks that create Susan's face; each block then shows different parts of the other characters to finally reveal Nick's face. It continues to do this for Janey, Michael and (starting from the fourth episode entitled "Of Mice and Ben") the new character to the show Abi. Abi's (for the first three episodes, Michael's) face then falls into the bottom right corner while the previous faces spread across to other places of the white screen. It reveals that Nick, Janey and Michael are next to Abi and Ben and Susan are with each other at the top left of the screen.  The logo fades on the top right of the screen.

The fourth series is similar to the third series opening sequence.  Only difference is that the photo of each character is changed, each block does not show different parts of each character when it transitions; instead it transitions in various styles, for example in an opening in a window blind style. Series five titles still remain similar; the photos are changed again and there are eleven rectangles instead of four. Nick is almost completely absent from the opening titles in series five except in episode six of series five titled "My Will Be Done"; he was missing in some episodes from series four and a few from series three.

The series six opening titles have cut-outs of each character, as they fade into the white screen and zoom in and out and eventually stop moving. The line-up from left to right is Abi, Michael, Susan, Ben, Janey and Roger. The titles remain the same for series seven and eight; the one difference is that Janey's clothes are changed. In series nine, the line-up changes due to Abi's departure at the end of the previous series. Her place is taken by Alfie, who has been a regular since series six but never appeared in the titles until the ninth series. Starting in the 2009 Christmas Special, Alfie has been replaced by Kenzo.

==Writers==
The first writer of My Family was its creator, [[Fred Barron (producer)|Fred Barron]] with British writer, [[Penny Croft]]. Barron wrote eight episodes up until the fourth series. Other major writers include James Hendrie and Ian Brown who wrote numerous episodes, including the first episode together up until the 2004 Christmas Special.  Steven and Jim Armogida are the only writers to remain on the show throughout its run.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Myfamily ben susan.jpg|thumb|right|212px|Robert Lindsay and Zoë Wanamaker as Ben and Susan.]] --&gt;Writers such as  Sophie Hetherington, Georgia Pritchett, James Cary and Tess Morris have all written at least one episode for the sitcom at one point. None of these writers have written more than five episodes. Andrea Solomons has written many episodes for My Family, she wrote from the second series to the sixth series. Meanwhile, Darin Henry has written one episode for the fifth series before returning for the eighth series onwards.

Paul Minett and Brian Leveson are the sitcom's current main writers. Credited for most of the specials, at least three episodes from every series since 2005. Bert-Tyler Moore and George Jeffrie both have written a few episodes for the sitcom in its sixth and seventh series and returned for series ten. Tom Leopold wrote two episodes for the sixth series only. Tom Anderson, currently ''My Family's'' executive producer and [[showrunner]], wrote his first episode for series seven and wrote until series ten, but remained showrunner for series eleven. Ed Dyson and David Cantor have written episodes for the seventh, eighth, ninth and eleventh series. Table correct as of episode 120.

==Reception==
Initially, the show received a poor critical response, and many dismissed its humour as mundane and dated. In spite of this, the programme received above average audience ratings, and further series were commissioned, with critical approval gradually improving as the series progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leigh Holmwood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/27/bbc.television |title=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |date= 27 March 2008|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Dessau, writing on the 100th episode, noted that it was a comedy that "the critics hate, but the public love", on the basis of ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sam Coates and Jenny Booth Updated 14 minutes ago |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6221021.ece |title=The Times May 5, 2009 |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoë Wanamaker said in 2007 that she was no longer happy with the quality of the writing, claiming she and co-star Robert Lindsay even refused to film one episode because it was so poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a44676/wanamaker-criticises-my-family.html|title=Wanamaker criticises "My Family"|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, the two stars revealed they were still unhappy with the writing quality, with Lindsay stating "There's some real dross (in the scripts) and we're aware of it". He later admitted that the eleventh series might be the last stating "As far as Zoë (Wanamaker) and I are concerned, we will do a tenth series of 16 episodes, which the BBC will probably split into a tenth and eleventh, then that will be it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/my_family/about/ My Family - Article - British Comedy Guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the show came 24th in ''[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]''.

==Cancellation==
[[BBC One]] controller [[Danny Cohen (television executive)|Danny Cohen]], when commenting on the decision to axe the series, said "Now that all the Harper children have flown the nest we feel it's time to make room for new comedies". [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]] said in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'': "I'm amazed by the public's love for the series [...] When [[Kris Marshall]] left in 2005 I was convinced that was it. But somehow Zoë and I have kept the essence of it together."&lt;ref name="My Family dropped after 11 years"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12859085 My Family dropped after 11 years] BBC News, 25 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Organisational semiotics''' examines the nature, characteristics and features of [[information]], and studies how information can be best used in the context of organised activities and business domains. Organisational semiotics treats organisations as [[information systems]] in which information is created, processed, distributed, stored and used. It benefits from the research of [[semiotics]] in various schools, and further develops its theoretical frameworks, methods and techniques for understanding, analysing, modelling, designing and implementing of information systems.

==History==

Organizational semiotics started around 1973 with [[Ronald Stamper]]’s seminal book on Information (Stamper, 1973), a book that was intended to be the first chapter of a book on information systems design called ‘organizational semiotics’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | first = Henk W. M.

  | date = 2004-03-23
  | url = http://www.semioticon.com/semiotix/semiotix1/sem-1-05.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Featured as an interdisciplinary undertaking, researchers working in the community of organisational semiotics come from different backgrounds and work together on the theoretical and practical issues relating to organisational and technical problems. From the first international meeting on organisational semiotics in 1995, the community aims to develop the subject into a science of information systems, as claimed at the IFIP 8.1 Working Conference.&lt;ref&gt;“Organisational Semiotics: Evolving a science of information systems”, book edited by [[Kecheng Liu]], Rodney J. Clarke, Peter B Andersen and Ronald Stamper, with El-Sayed Abou-Zeid, 2002 {{ISBN|1-4020-7189-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Conference on Informatics and Semiotics in Organisations is the flagship conference of the community of which [[Kecheng Liu]] and the Informatics Research Centre &lt;ref&gt; Informatics Research Centre, Henley Business School, University of Reading [https://www.henley.ac.uk/research/research-centres/informatics-research-centre/]&lt;/ref&gt; have been convening over the past years.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to artificial intelligence:

'''[[Artificial intelligence|Artificial intelligence (AI)]]''' – intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is also the name of the academic field which studies how to create computers and computer software that are capable of intelligent behaviour.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is artificial intelligence? ==

* A form of [[intelligence]]
** [[Synthetic intelligence]] – intelligence of a man-made yet real quality: actual, not fake, not simulated
* A type of [[technology]]
** A type of [[computer technology]]
*** A computer system that performs some intellectual function
** An [[emerging technology]]
* A field:
** An [[academic discipline]]
** A branch of [[science]]
*** A branch of [[applied science]]
**** A branch of [[computer science]]

==Types of artificial intelligence==
* [[Weak AI]] (narrow AI) – non-sentient machine intelligence, typically focused on a narrow task (narrow AI).
* [[Artificial general intelligence|Strong AI / artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) – (hypothetical) machine with the ability to apply intelligence to any problem, rather than just one specific problem, typically meaning "at least as smart as a typical human". It's future potential creation is referred to as a [[technological singularity]], and constitutes a [[global catastrophic risk]] (''see Superintelligence, below'').
* [[Superintelligence]] – (hypothetical) artificial intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. Due to [[recursive self-improvement]], superintelligence is expected to be a rapid outcome of creating artificial general intelligence.

=== by period or events ===

* [[Progress in artificial intelligence]]
* [[Timeline of artificial intelligence]]
* [[Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI]] (2017)

=== by region ===

=== by subject ===

* [[AI effect]] – as soon as AI successfully solves a problem, the problem is no longer considered by the public to be a part of AI. This phenomenon has occurred in relation to every AI application produced, so far, throughout the history of development of AI. 
* [[AI winter]] – 
* [[GOFAI]]
* [[History of machine learning]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Timeline of machine learning|timeline]])
* [[History of machine translation]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Timeline of machine translation|timeline]])
* [[Moore's Law]] – observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. One way this relates to AI is that hypothetically a computer would need at least as much capacity as a human brain to be able to be programmed to be as smart as a human.  So as long as the aforementioned rate of development met or beat the 2-year doubling time, one could roughly forecast when a computer would have as much memory and calculation capacity as a human brain, a milestone which was reached in 2010. Though it may take as much as 3 magnitudes (1000 times) more computer capacity (since computers calculate things in a much more linear fashion) to emulate the massively parallel structure of the human brain. At a doubling time of 2 years, an increase in capacity by 1000-fold would take a little less than 18 years (9 doublings), if reaching the limit of integrated circuit technology did not pose an obstacle before then.

== AI hazards and safety ==
* [[Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence]] 
** [[Artificial intelligence as a global catastrophic risk]]
** [[AI takeover]] – point at which humans are no longer the dominant form of intelligence on Earth and machine intelligence is
** [[Intelligence explosion]] – through recursive self-improvement and self-replication, the magnitude of intelligent machinery could achieve superintelligence, surpassing human ability to resist it.
** [[Superintelligence]] – AI may grow to such an advanced state to become as proportionately superior to humans as humans are to ants.  Theoretically, there would be little humans could do to prevent such an intelligence from reaching its goals.
** [[Ethics of artificial intelligence#Weaponization of artificial intelligence|Weaponization of artificial intelligence]]
*** [[Artificial intelligence arms race]] &amp;ndash; competition between two or more states to have its military forces equipped with the best "artificial intelligence" (AI).
*** [[Lethal autonomous weapon]]
*** [[Military robot]]
*** [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle]]
* [[Friendly AI]] – hypothetical AI that is designed not to harm humans and to prevent unfriendly AI from being developed

== AI and the future ==
* [[Artificial general intelligence]] (Strong AI) – hypothetical artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence — an intelligent machine that could perform intellectual tasks at least as well as a human
** Aspects or features
*** [[Self-replicating machine]]s – smart computers and robots would be able to make more of themselves, in a geometric progression or via mass production.  Or smart programs may be uploaded into hardware existing at the time (because linear architecture of sufficient speeds could be used to emulate massively parallel analog systems such as human brains).
*** [[Recursive self improvement]] (aka seed AI) – speculative ability of strong artificial intelligence to reprogram itself to make itself even more intelligent. The more intelligent it got, the more capable it would be of further improving itself, in successively more rapid iterations, potentially resulting in an intelligence explosion leading to the emergence of a superintelligence.
*** [[Group mind (science fiction)|Hive mind]] –
*** [[Swarm intelligence#In popular culture|Robot swarm]] –
** [[Technological singularity]] – the development of strong AI may cause an intelligence explosion in which greater-than-human intelligence emerges, radically changing civilization, and perhaps even human nature. The TS has been identified by {{Harvtxt|Berglas|2012}} and others to be an existential risk.
*** [[Singularitarianism]] –
*** [[Human enhancement]] – humans may be enhanced, either by the efforts of AI or by merging with it.
**** [[Transhumanism]] – philosophy of human transformation
**** [[Posthumanism]] – people may survive, but not be recognizable in comparison to present modern-day humans.
***** [[Cyborg]]s –
***** [[Mind uploading]] –
** [[Intelligence explosion]] – through recursive self-improvement and self-replication, the magnitude of intelligent machinery could achieve superintelligence, surpassing human ability to resist it.

'''Parasitic computing''' is programming technique where a program in normal authorized interactions with another program manages to get the other program to perform computations of a complex nature. It is, in a sense, a security exploit in that the program implementing the parasitic computing has no authority to consume resources made available to the other program.

It was first proposed by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Vincent W. Freeh, Hawoong Jeong &amp; Jay B. Brockman from University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA, in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nd.edu/~parasite/ Parasitic Computing]&lt;/ref&gt; The example given by the original paper was two computers communicating over the [[Internet]], under disguise of a standard communications session. The first computer is attempting to solve a large and extremely difficult [[3-SAT]] problem; it has decomposed the original 3-SAT problem in a considerable number of smaller problems. Each of these smaller problems is then encoded as a relation between a [[checksum]] and a [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] such that whether the checksum is accurate or not is also the answer to that smaller problem. The packet/checksum is then sent to another computer. This computer will, as part of receiving the packet and deciding whether it is valid and [[well-formed element|well-formed]], create a checksum of the packet and see whether it is identical to the provided checksum. If the checksum is invalid, it will then request a new packet from the original computer. The original computer now knows the answer to that smaller problem based on the second computer's response, and can transmit a fresh packet embodying a different sub-problem. Eventually, all the sub-problems will be answered and the final answer easily calculated.

The example is based on an exploit of the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), used for internet connections, so in the end, the target computer(s) is unaware that it has performed computation for the benefit of the other computer, or even done anything besides have a normal [[TCP/IP]] session.

The proof-of-concept is obviously extremely inefficient as the amount of computation necessary to merely send the packets in the first place easily exceeds the computations leeched from the other program; and the 3-SAT problem would be solved much more quickly if just analyzed locally. In addition, in practice packets would probably have to be retransmitted occasionally when real checksum errors and network problems occur. However, parasitic computing on the level of checksums is a demonstration of the concept. The authors suggest that as one moves up the [[application stack]], there might come a point where there is a net computational gain to the parasite - perhaps one could break down interesting problems into queries of complex [[cryptographic protocol]]s using [[public key cryptography|public keys]]. If there was a net gain, one could in theory use a number of control nodes for which many hosts on the Internet form a [[distributed computing]] network completely unawares.

Students of the University of Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland, extended this concept into a programmable [[virtual machine]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szene.ch/parasit/index.html Diploma thesis on Parasitic Computing]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10180">'''PhD in management''' is the highest academic degree awarded in the study of [[management|management science]]. The degree was designed for those seeking academic research and teaching careers as faculty or professors in the study of management at business schools worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ph.D. in Management Degree==

===Business doctoral programs===

A [[PhD]] degree is a [[doctor of philosophy]] which can be obtained in many areas of study, while a '''PhD in management''' is specific to the study of research questions with potential relevance to the business world. Areas of specialization for the PhD in business often include, but are not limited to:

* [[Accounting]]
* Decision sciences ([[decision theory]] and [[decision analysis]])
* [[Economics]]
* [[Entrepreneurship]]
* [[Ethics]] and [[legal studies]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Health care management]]
* [[People management]] or Human Resource management
* [[Leadership]]
* [[Marketing]]
* [[Organizational behavior]]
* [[Operations management]] / [[Operations research]]
* [[Management information systems]] / [[Information technology management]]
* [[Statistics]]
* [[Strategy]]

A '''PhD in management''' or '''business''' is often required for those interested in pursuing an academic career as a professor at a business school.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB "Becoming a Business Professor" article {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business schools often require faculty to hold a Ph.D. and to engage in research.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB "Becoming a Business Professor" {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business school rankings are often heavily influenced by the proportion of faculty with Ph.D. degrees or doctorates.&lt;ref&gt;2009 FT rankings table and criteria list http://rankings.ft.com/exportranking/global-mba-rankings/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Research is fundamental to the integrity of a graduate educational institution.  Through research, professors gain the expertise required to teach advanced courses and to ensure that they remain current in his or her chosen field.

===Brief history===

In the 1950s and 1960s, leading '''business schools''' made a transition from vocational training to scientific research, rooted in social sciences, such as economics, [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[systems engineering]], and [[mathematics]].  Since then, Ph.D. programs in business prepare candidates to conduct scholarly research based on rigorous methods and applied to business.  For example, such research might aim to develop new theory and empirical knowledge about business and management problems by combining methods from economics, psychology and mathematical decision theory.  By combining methods from multiple social sciences, business research has developed its own subfields of research, published in business application oriented journals as well as in social sciences journals.&lt;ref&gt;Ph.D. Project http://www.phdproject.org/downloads/What_is_a_PhD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business research===

Research with regard to the study of business encompasses a wide range of activities.  There are many research methodologies or "tools" one must learn before being able to conduct research.  A PhD program in business will teach one of these various methods.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/phd/overview/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;INSEAD http://www.insead.edu/phd/program/program_structure.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/whycolumbia/&lt;/ref&gt;
http://www5.google.columbia.phd/wikipedia/&lt;/net&gt;

===Research methodologies===

Common research methodologies used in studying business are: Modeling, [[Econometrics]], [[Experiment]]s, descriptive and Field Studies.

==Program structure==

Typically, the PhD in management takes 4–5 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB article about a PhD in Business and Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure is usually 2 years of intensive coursework (core courses and seminars) followed by a comprehensive examination.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dissertation phase is typically 2–3 years.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt;

==Careers==

Becoming a professor of business means investing years of study before obtaining the desired degree, but academia offers many benefits, including: attractive salaries, the combination of varied activities in one career, intellectual stimulation as well as professional autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;PhD Project {{cite web |url=http://www.phdproject.org/faqs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219110256/http://www.phdproject.org/faqs.html |archivedate=2014-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following through with a PhD degree can be challenging not only because of the academic rigour but also due to the pressure and stress that comes from conducting research and defending a dissertation.  Moreover, once a person obtains a PhD, there is no guarantee that even with an offer from a business school, that the PhD student will go on to publish his or her research in a top journal, will be able to teach effectively, or will receive a tenured faculty position.

Still, for those who have the motivation, drive and stamina to be successful in this field, there are many benefits.  The life of a business professor is markedly different from a corporate career. An academic has more time to explore his or her own interests, pursues research, and rarely has a 'nine to five' type of career. Being a professor is much like being an entrepreneur (bad link – ).&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/SYOA/page2.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Success is based on the individual, and faculty are often their own bosses. Beyond being intellectually bright and able to conduct research, professors in business also need to be able to perform in the classroom.  Teaching is a fundamental component of being a professor, though most faculty may only teach around 100 hours per year, the classroom setting can be challenging and often involve debate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/SYOA/page1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone can be a professor, but for those that have the skills required, it provides an excellent standard of living, with salaries comparable to the corporate world.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;  Consulting, book publishing and speaking engagements can also further add to overall compensation.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;  Academic institutions are often less vulnerable than corporations to forces like global economic downturns.  Academia offers much in the way of financial stability.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;

===PhD versus DBA===
The PhD in Business Administration is equivalent to the [[Doctor of Business Administration]] (DBA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Both doctorates are research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business in the U.S. education system. As such, both PhD and DBA programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;FAQs AACSB {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009023410/http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions.

In some cases, as in that of Harvard University, the distinction is solely administrative (Harvard Business School is not authorized to issue PhDs; only the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may do so).&lt;ref&gt;Admissions FAQs Harvard http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/faqs/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, however, the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The PhD is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the DBA emphasizes applied research leading to the practical application of theoretical knowledge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Upon completion, graduates of PhD programs generally migrate to academia, while those of DBA programs reemerge in industry as executives in leading organizations often teaching part-time in undergraduate and graduate programs.

'''Pratt Institute School of Information''' (SI or iSchool), previously '''School of Information and Library Science''' (SILS), administers the oldest [[Library and Information Science]] program in [[North America]]. It was created in [[Brooklyn]] in 1890 shortly after [[Melvil Dewey]] created such a program at [[Columbia University]] in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Adams Rathbone, Josephine.

Based in [[Manhattan]], the school administers a [[Master's degree|master]] of [[Information science|information]] and [[library science]] degree program that has been accredited by the [[American Library Association]] since the 1924/1925 academic year.&lt;ref name="ala_accredit"&gt;[http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/directory/historicallist Accredited Library and Information Studies Master's Programs from 1925 through Present, American Library Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pratt Institute - Report of students enrolled for Library Department for 1890.jpg|thumb|right|A listing of the students from 1890 enrolled in the morning and afternoon cataloging classes, as well as a list of students enrolled in the Library training class.]]
[[Charles Pratt]], founder of [[Pratt Institute]], recognized the need for a library that served both the faculty and students of the Institute as well as [[Brooklyn]] residents. He also recognized the need to have a facility for training of library staff. In June 1890, Pratt Institute offered courses in cataloging and library economics.&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;Richardson Jr., John V. "History of American Library Science: Its Origins and Early Development." In ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences'', 3rd Ed.

Chicago, Illinois: American Library Association, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, a regular faculty, chosen for its aptitude in teaching, was organized.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;White, Carl M. ''The Origins of the American Library School.'' New York: Scarecrow Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mary Wright Plummer]], who was a graduate of [[Melvil Dewey]]’s class of 1888 from [[Columbia University]], led it.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt; In 1896, the Library School relocated to Pratt's new library building designed by [[William Tubby]], which continues to act as Pratt Institute’s primary library.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;

Under Plummer's leadership, the school enacted a stiff entrance exam and exams in German and French.&lt;ref name="brand"&gt;Brand, Barbara B.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcT2xjeOEQoC&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;ots=tuZGPdabTR&amp;dq=margaret%20healy%20pratt&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Pratt Institute Library School: The Perils of Professionalization."]  In Suzanne Hildenbrand (Ed.), ''Reclaiming the American Library Past: Writing the Women In'', pp. 251-278.  Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  The entering class was consistently around 25 students.&lt;ref name="brand" /&gt; In 1911 when Plummer left to direct the Training School at New York Public Library, [[Josephine Adams Rathbone]] was appointed vice-director. Both Plummer and Rathbone were elected as presidents of the [[American Library Association]].

Notable alumni from this early period include [[Anne Carroll Moore]], who was a student of [[Mary Wright Plummer]], and became a faculty member and the first children’s librarian at [[New York Public Library]], serving in that position for 35 years (1906–1941).&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;

''Encyclopædia Britannica. '' http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/647365/Mary-Elizabeth-Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Pratt began to grant the degree of [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor of science]] in library science and, in 1950, the master of library science degree.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt; Notable figures from the twentieth century include [[Nasser Sharify]], who worked to develop the field of international librarianship as dean and professor from 1968 to 1987.&lt;ref name="sharify_papers"&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf309n99dt/entire_text/ Scope and content of collection], Nasser Sharify papers, Hoover Institution Archives. Accessed March 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Nasser Sharify stepped into the role of Dean in 1968, the school’s name changed to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS).  This would reflect the advances in technology and information science and Pratt’s embrace of these changes.  “This action went far beyond a mere change in nomenclature,” Dean Sharify wrote in his 1978 history of the school. “Rather, the new designation gave recognition to an emerging and important new discipline [Information Science].”&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;

In the aftermath of Pratt’s name change, the school rewrote its goals and objectives and began to expand its technology holdings.  In need of more space for computer labs, GSLIS moved from the library on the Brooklyn campus to its own building, the Information Science Center (ISC), in 1974.  It included laboratories built for more hands-on technical computer study, including an instructional materials lab, an information science lab, and a technical processes lab.

[[File:A class in the Pratt Institute Library School, 1897.jpg|thumb|A class in the Pratt Institute Library School, 1897.]]The school celebrated its centennial in 1990. In the [[United States House of Representatives]], New York Congressman [[Major Owens]] (first librarian to serve in Congress) gave a salute to Pratt Institute's library school "both for its 100th anniversary, and for being the oldest such library program in the country."&lt;ref&gt;101st Congress, 2nd Session, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:E16OC0-431:/ A Salute to Pratt Institute's Library Science Department on Its 100th Anniversary]. Accessed January 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt Institute School of Information relocated to the Pratt Manhattan Center at 144 West 14th Street in [[Manhattan]] in Fall 2002, and it continues to operate from that location.&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;"[http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2002/09/ljarchives/pratt-sils-now-anchored-in-manhattan/ Pratt SILS Now Anchored in Manhattan]."

{{short description|How to reconcile the existence of evil with a benevolent God}}

The '''problem of evil''' refers to the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] [[God]] (see [[theism]]).&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt; An '''argument from evil''' claims that because evil exists, either God does not exist or does not have all three of those properties. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of [[theodicy]]. Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of [[theology]] and [[ethics]].

The problem of evil is often formulated in two forms: the logical problem of evil and the evidential problem of evil. The logical form of the argument tries to show a logical impossibility in the coexistence of God and evil,&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"/&gt; while the evidential form tries to show that given the evil in the world, it is improbable that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good God.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; The problem of evil has been extended to non-human life forms, to include animal suffering from natural evils and human [[animal cruelty|cruelty]] against them.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;

Responses to various versions of the problem of evil, meanwhile, come in three forms: refutations, defenses, and theodicies. A wide range of responses have been made against these arguments. There are also many discussions of evil and associated problems in other philosophical fields, such as [[secular ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Rengger, ''Moral Evil and International Relations'', in ''[[SAIS Review]]'' 25:1, Winter/Spring 2005, pp. 3–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kivy, ''Melville's Billy and the Secular Problem of Evil: the Worm in the Bud'', in ''[[The Monist]]'' (1980), 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kekes |first=John |authorlink=John Kekes |title=Facing Evil |publisher=Princeton UP |year=1990 |location=Princeton |url= |id= |isbn=0-691-07370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[evolutionary ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anders, ''The Evolution of Evil'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence C. Becker |author2=Charlotte B. Becker |title= Encyclopedia of Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfeOAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-35096-3|pages=147–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as usually understood, the "problem of evil" is posed in a [[theological]] context.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The problem of evil acutely applies to monotheistic religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]] that believe in a monotheistic God who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent;&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/evil.html Problem of Evil], Paul Brians, Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen D. O'Leary|title=Arguing the Apocalypse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slB8WHY9B6QC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-535296-2 |pages=34–35 }}, Quote: "As Max Weber notes, however, it is in monotheistic religions that this problem becomes acute."&lt;/ref&gt; but the question of "why does evil exist?" has also been studied in religions that are non-theistic or polytheistic, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name=arthurhermanp5/&gt;

==Formulation and detailed arguments==
{{see|Existence of God}}
The problem of evil refers to the challenge of reconciling belief in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God, with the existence of evil and suffering in the world.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name=boydp56&gt;Gregory A.

===Logical problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' redirects here--&gt;===
Originating with Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref&gt;The formulation may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]]. According to Mark Joseph Larrimore, (2001), ''The Problem of Evil'', pp. xix–xxi. Wiley-Blackwell. According to [[Reinhold F. Glei]], it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not epicurean, but even anti-epicurean. Reinhold F. Glei, ''Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20–21'', in: ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 42 (1988), pp. 47–58&lt;/ref&gt; the '''logical argument from evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is as follows:

# If an [[omnipotent]], [[omnibenevolent]] and [[omniscient]] god exists, then evil does not.
# There is evil in the world.
# Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient god does not exist.

This argument is of the form [[modus tollens]], and is [[logically valid]]: If its premises are true, the conclusion follows of necessity.  To show that the first premise is plausible, subsequent versions tend to expand on it, such as this modern example:&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;
# God exists.
# God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient.
# An omnipotent being has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence.
# An omnibenevolent being would want to prevent all evils.
# An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence, and knows every way in which those evils could be prevented.
# A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.
# If there exists an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient God, then no evil exists.
# Evil exists (logical contradiction).

Both of these arguments are understood to be presenting two forms of the ''logical'' problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed [[proposition]]s lead to a [[logical]] [[contradiction]] and therefore cannot all be correct. Most philosophical debate has focused on the propositions stating that God cannot exist with, or would want to prevent, all evils (premises 3 and 6), with defenders of theism (for example, Leibniz) arguing that God could very well exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good.

If God lacks any one of these qualities—omniscience, omnipotence, or omnibenevolence—then the logical problem of evil can be resolved. [[Process theology]] and [[open theism]] are other positions that limit God's omnipotence and/or omniscience (as defined in traditional theology). [[Dystheism]] is the belief that God is not wholly good.

===Evidential problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' and 'Evidential argument from evil' redirect here--&gt;===
[[File:Deerfire high res edit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William L. Rowe]]'s example of [[natural evil]]: "In some distant forest lightning strikes a dead tree, resulting in a forest fire. In the fire a fawn is trapped, horribly burned, and lies in terrible agony for several days before death relieves its suffering."&lt;ref name=rowe336&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William L.|authorlink=William L. Rowe|year=1979|title=The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=16|pages=336–37|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe also cites the example of human evil where an innocent child is a victim of violence and thereby suffers.&lt;ref name=rowe336/&gt;]]

The '''evidential problem of evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also referred to as the probabilistic or inductive version of the problem) seeks to show that the existence of evil, although logically consistent with the existence of God, counts against or lowers the [[probability]] of the truth of theism. As an example, a critic of Plantinga's idea of "a mighty nonhuman spirit" causing natural evils may concede that the existence of such a being is not logically impossible but argue that due to lacking scientific evidence for its existence this is very unlikely and thus it is an unconvincing explanation for the presence of natural evils. Both absolute versions and relative versions of the evidential problems of evil are presented below.

A version by [[William L. Rowe]]:
# There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# (Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

Another by [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]]:
# Gratuitous evils exist.
# The hypothesis of indifference, ''i.e.'', that if there are supernatural beings they are indifferent to gratuitous evils, is a better explanation for (1) than theism.
# Therefore, evidence prefers that no god, as commonly understood by theists, exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Draper |title=Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists |journal=Noûs |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=331–50 | year=1989 |doi=10.2307/2215486 |publisher=Noûs, Vol. 23, No. 3 |ref=harv |jstor=2215486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of evil and animal suffering===
{{See also|Wild animal suffering}}

The problem of evil has also been extended beyond human suffering, to include suffering of animals from cruelty, disease and evil.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter van Inwagen|title=The Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQhUrE8BYFIC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-954397-7 |pages=120, 123–26, context: 120–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of this problem includes animal suffering from natural evil, such as the violence and fear faced by animals from predators, natural disasters, over the history of evolution.&lt;ref name=Creeganp44&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9 |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also referred to as the Darwinian problem of evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Murray |title=Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZFNf9EwSSYC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-155327-1 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=almeidap193/&gt; after Charles Darwin who expressed it as follows:&lt;ref name="Murray2008"/&gt;

The second version of the problem of evil applied to animals, and avoidable suffering experienced by them, is one caused by some human beings, such as from animal cruelty or when they are shot or slaughtered. This version of the problem of evil has been used by scholars including [[John Hick]] to counter the responses and defenses to the problem of evil such as suffering being a means to perfect the morals and greater good because animals are innocent, helpless, amoral but sentient victims.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diogenes Allen |editor=Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert Merrihew Adams|title=The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqNwUSj7U7QC |year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824866-8 |pages=204–06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L.

== Responses, defences and theodicies ==
Responses to the problem of evil have occasionally been classified as ''defences'' or ''theodicies;'' however, authors disagree on the exact definitions.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Ted |last=Honderich |authorlink=Ted Honderich |year=2005 |title=theodicy |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |quote=[[John Hick]], for example, proposes a theodicy, while [[Alvin Plantinga]] formulates a defence. The idea of human free will often appears in a both of these strategies, but in different ways.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a ''defense'' against the problem of evil may refer to attempts to defuse the logical problem of evil by showing that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. This task does not require the identification of a plausible explanation of evil, and is successful if the explanation provided shows that the existence of God and the existence of evil are logically compatible. It need not even be true, since a false though coherent explanation would be sufficient to show logical compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;For more explanation regarding contradictory propositions and possible worlds, see Plantinga's "God, Freedom and Evil" (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans 1974), 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[theodicy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Coined by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] θεός (theós), "god" and δίκη (díkē), "justice", may refer to the project of "justifying God"—showing that God's existence is compatible with the existence of evil.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, is more ambitious, since it attempts to provide a plausible justification—a morally or philosophically sufficient reason—for the existence of evil and thereby rebut the "evidential" argument from evil.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; [[Richard Swinburne]] maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods that justify the evil's presence in the world unless we know what they are—without knowledge of what the greater goods could be, one cannot have a successful theodicy.&lt;ref name=swinburne05&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Richard |last=Swinburne |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |year=2005 |title=evil, the problem of |editor=Ted Honderich |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |editor-link=Ted Honderich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors see arguments appealing to [[demon]]s or the [[fall of man]] as indeed logically possible, but not very ''plausible'' given our knowledge about the world, and so see those arguments as providing defences but not good theodicies.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The above argument is set against numerous versions of the problem of evil that have been formulated.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-log.htm The Logical Problem of Evil]", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; These versions have included philosophical and theological formulations.

===Skeptical theism===
{{Main|Skeptical theism}}
Skeptical theism defends the problem of evil by asserting that God allows an evil to happen in order to prevent a greater evil or to encourage a response that will lead to a greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Wilks |editor=Justin P. McBrayer and Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Blackwell Companion to The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0ScAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-60797-8 |chapter=Chapter 31, for context see Chapters 29 and 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a rape or a murder of an innocent child is defended as having a God's purpose that a human being may not comprehend, but which may lead to lesser evil or greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31/&gt; This is called skeptical theism because the argument aims to encourage self-skepticism, either by trying to rationalize God's possible hidden motives, or by trying to explain it as a limitation of human ability to know.&lt;ref name=wilks31/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoughertyMcBrayer2014"/&gt; The greater good defense is more often argued in religious studies in response to the evidential version of the problem of evil,&lt;ref name="DoughertyMcBrayer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trent Dougherty|author2=Justin P.

==== "Greater good" responses ====
The [[omnipotence paradox]]es, where evil persists in the presence of an all powerful God, raise questions as to the nature of God's omnipotence. There is the further question of how an interference would negate and subjugate the concept of free will, or in other words result in a totalitarian system that creates a lack of freedom. Some solutions propose that omnipotence does not require the ability to actualize the logically impossible. "Greater good" responses to the problem make use of this insight by arguing for the existence of goods of great value which God cannot actualize without also permitting evil, and thus that there are evils he cannot be expected to prevent despite being omnipotent. Among the most popular versions of the "greater good" response are appeals to the apologetics of free will. Theologians will argue that since no one can fully understand God's ultimate plan, no one can assume that evil actions do not have some sort of greater purpose. Therefore, they say nature of evil has a necessary role to play in God's plan for a better world.&lt;ref name=WhitneyTheodicy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=B|title=Theodicy|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Gale|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will====
{{main|Free will}}

The problem of evil is sometimes explained as a consequence of [[free will]], an ability granted by God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Free will is both a source of good and of evil, and with free will also comes the potential for abuse, as when individuals act immorally. People with free will "decide to cause suffering and act in other evil ways", states Boyd, and it is they who make that choice, not God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt; Further, the free will argument asserts that it would be logically inconsistent for God to prevent evil by coercion and curtailing free will, because that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, ''Is God to Blame?'' (InterVarsity Press, 2003) {{ISBN|978-0830823949}}, pp. 55–58, 69–70, 76, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt;

Critics of the free will response have questioned whether it accounts for the degree of evil seen in this world. One point in this regard is that while the value of free will may be thought sufficient to counterbalance minor evils, it is less obvious that it outweighs the negative attributes of evils such as rape and murder. Particularly egregious cases known as horrendous evils, which "[constitute] [[prima facie]] reason to doubt whether the participant’s life could (given their inclusion in it) be a great good to him/her on the whole," have been the focus of recent work in the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Cornell University, 2000), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Another point is that those actions of free beings which bring about evil very often diminish the freedom of those who suffer the evil; for example the murder of a young child prevents the child from ever exercising their free will. In such a case the freedom of an innocent child is pitted against the freedom of the evil-doer, it is not clear why God would remain unresponsive and passive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Melbourne University Press, 1999), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the potential for evil inherent in free will may be limited by means which do not impinge on that free will. God could accomplish this by making moral actions especially pleasurable, or evil action and suffering impossible by allowing free will but not allowing the ability to enact evil or impose suffering.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis writes: "We can, perhaps, conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon, and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults. But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; nay, if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion, evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them." C.S. Lewis ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'' (HarperCollins, 1996) pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the free will explanation state that that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Critics respond that this view seems to imply it would be similarly wrong to try to reduce suffering and evil in these ways, a position which few would advocate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', s.v. "The Problem of Evil," Michael Tooley at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third challenge to the free will defence is [[natural evil]], which is the result of natural causes (e.g. a child suffering from a disease, mass casualties from a volcano).&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil," at http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml. Accessed 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The "natural evil" criticism posits that even if for some reason an all-powerful and all-benevolent God tolerated evil human actions in order to allow free will, such a God would not be expected to also tolerate natural evils because they have no apparent connection to free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Lacewing|title=Philosophy for AS: Epistemology and Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoA9BAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-63583-3 |pages=239–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the free will response to evil propose various explanations of natural evils. [[Alvin Plantinga]],&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Freedom, and Evil |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |year=1974 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-8028-1731-9 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''God, Freedom, and Evil'' (Eerdmans, 1989), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued that natural evils are caused by the free choices of supernatural beings such as [[demon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued
:• that natural evils are the result of the [[fall of man]], which corrupted the perfect world created by God&lt;ref&gt;Linda Edwards, ''A Brief Guide'' (Westminster John Knox, 2001), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are the result of [[natural laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polkinghorne | first = John | authorlink = John Polkinghorne | title = Belief in God in an Age of Science | publisher=Yale Nota Bene | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-300-09949-2 }} and also See esp. ch. 5 of his ''Science and Providence''. {{ISBN|978-0-87773-490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils provide us with a knowledge of evil which makes our free choices more significant than they would otherwise be, and so our free will more valuable&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne]] in "Is There a God?" writes that "the operation of natural laws producing evils gives humans knowledge (if they choose to seek it) of how to bring about such evils themselves. Observing you can catch some disease by the operation of natural processes gives me the power either to use those processes to give that disease to other people, or through negligence to allow others to catch it, or to take measures to prevent others from catching the disease." In this way, "it increases the range of significant choice... The actions which natural evil makes possible are ones which allow us to perform at our best and interact with our fellows at the deepest level" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are a mechanism of divine punishment for moral evils that humans have committed, and so the natural evil is justified.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars agree that Plantinga's free will of human and non-human spirits (demons) argument successfully solves the logical problem of evil, proving that God and evil are logically compatible&lt;ref name=meisterp134&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion |last=Meister |first=Chad |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-40327-8 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars explicitly dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, J.H. Logic and Theism. Cambridge University Press (2004) pp. 436–37&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenters state that while explaining infectious diseases, cancer, hurricanes and other nature-caused suffering as something that is caused by the free will of supernatural beings solves the logical version of the problem of evil, it is highly unlikely that these natural evils do not have natural causes that an omnipotent God could prevent, but instead are caused by the immoral actions of supernatural beings with free will whom God created.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; According to Michael Tooley, this defense is also highly implausible because suffering from natural evil is localized, rational causes and cures for major diseases have been found, and it is unclear why anyone, including a supernatural being whom God created would choose to inflict localized evil and suffering to innocent children for example, and why God fails to stop such suffering if he is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvin Plantinga|author2=Michael Tooley|title=Knowledge of God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xfjbwDoPj8C |year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0131-1 |pages=101–05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Free will and animal suffering
One of the weaknesses of the free will defense is its inapplicability or contradictory applicability with respect to evils faced by animals and the consequent animal suffering. Some scholars, such as [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]], state that the free will, or the assumption of greater good through free will, does not apply to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ray Griffin|title=Evil Revisited: Responses and Reconsiderations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NMm1lXb4SgC |year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0612-0 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John S.

The "free creatures" defense has also been criticized, in the case of caged, domesticated and farmed animals who are not free and many of whom have historically experienced evil and suffering from abuse by their owners. Further, even animals and living creatures in the wild face horrendous evils and suffering—such as burn and slow death after natural fires or other natural disasters or from predatory injuries—and it is unclear, state Bishop and Perszyk, why an all-loving God would create such free creatures prone to intense suffering.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"/&gt; 

; Heaven and free will

There is also debate regarding the compatibility of moral free will (to select good or evil action) with the absence of evil from heaven,&lt;ref&gt;Oppy, Graham. ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 314–39. Cambridge University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |title=Evil, Freedom and the Heaven Dilemma |author=Simon Cushing |year=2010 |work=Challenging Evil: Time, Society and Changing Concepts of the Meaning of Evil |publisher=Inter-Disciplinary Press |deadurl=yes |accessdate=10 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181511/http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with God's omniscience and with his omnibenevolence.&lt;ref name="IepLogical" /&gt;

One line of extended criticism of free will defense has been that if God is perfectly powerful, knowing and loving, then he could have actualized a world with free creatures without moral evil where everyone chooses good, is always full of loving-kindness, is compassionate, always non-violent and full of joy, where earth were just like the monotheistic concept of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. If God did create a heaven with his love, an all-loving and always-loving God could have created an earth without evil and suffering for animals and human beings just like heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process theodicy====
"Process theodicy reframes the debate on the problem of evil by denying one of its key premises: divine omnipotence."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}  It integrates philosophical and theological commitments while shifting theological metaphors.  For example, God becomes the Great Companion and Fellow-Sufferer where the future is realized hand-in-hand with the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

===Soul-making or Irenaean theodicy===
{{main|Irenaean theodicy}}

The soul-making or Irenaean theodicy is named after the 2nd-century Greek theologian [[Irenaeus]], whose ideas were adopted in Eastern Christianity.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201/&gt; It has been discussed by [[John Hick]], and the Irenaean theodicy asserts that evil and [[suffering]] are necessary for spiritual growth, for man to discover his soul, and God allows evil for spiritual growth of human beings.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=201–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irenaean theodicy has been challenged with the assertion that many evils do not seem to promote spiritual growth, and can be positively destructive of the human spirit. Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; A second issue concerns the distribution of evils suffered: were it true that God permitted evil in order to facilitate spiritual growth, then we would expect evil to disproportionately befall those in poor spiritual health. This does not seem to be the case, as the decadent enjoy lives of luxury which insulate them from evil, whereas many of the pious are poor, and are well acquainted with worldly evils.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "The Problem of Evil", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, states Kane, human character can be developed directly or in constructive and nurturing loving ways, and it is unclear why God would consider or allow evil and suffering to be necessary or the preferred way to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=376–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, horrendous suffering often leads to dehumanization, its victims in truth do not grow spiritually but become vindictive and spiritually worse.&lt;ref name=Creeganp185/&gt;

This reconciliation of the problem of evil and God, states Creegan, also fails to explain the need or rationale for evil inflicted on animals and resultant animal suffering, because "there is no evidence at all that suffering improves the character of animals, or is evidence of soul-making in them".&lt;ref name=Creeganp185&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan |title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWSL-zZ5x4QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-993184-2 |page=185 with footnote 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more fundamental level, the soul-making theodicy assumes that the virtues developed through suffering are intrinsically, as opposed to instrumentally, good. The virtues identified as "soul-making" only appear to be valuable in a world where evil and suffering already exist. A willingness to sacrifice oneself in order to save others from persecution, for example, is virtuous precisely because persecution exists. Likewise, we value the willingness to donate one's meal to those who are starving because starvation exists. If persecution and starvation did not occur, there would be no reason to consider these acts virtuous. If the virtues developed through soul-making are only valuable where suffering exists, then it is not clear that we would lose anything if suffering did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rationalrealm.com/downloads/philosophy/ProblemOfEvil.pdf|website=Rational Realm|title=The Problem of Evil|first=Leslie|last=Allan|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruciform theodicy====
Soul-making theodicy and Process theodicy are full theodical systems with distinctive cosmologies, theologies and perspectives on the problem of evil; cruciform theodicy is not a system but is a thematic trajectory within them.  As a result, it does not address all the questions of "the origin, nature, problem, reason and end of evil,"&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|145}} but it does represent an important change. "On July 16, 1944 awaiting execution in a [[Nazi]] prison and reflecting on Christ's experience of powerlessness and pain, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] penned six words that became the clarion call for the modern theological paradigm shift: 'Only the suffering God can help."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146}}  Classic theism includes "impassability" (God cannot suffer personally) as a necessary characteristic of God. Cruciform theodicy begins with Jesus' suffering "the entire spectrum of human sorrow, including economic exploitation, political disenfranchisement, social ostracism, rejection and betrayal by friends, even alienation from his own family...deep psychological distress... [grief]..." ridicule, humiliation, abandonment, beating, torture, despair, and death.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146,148}}

Theologian [[Jürgen Moltmann]] asserts the "passibility" of God saying "A God who cannot suffer cannot love."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|150}} Philosopher and Christian priest [[Marilyn McCord Adams]] offers a theodicy of "redemptive suffering" which proposes that innocent suffering shows the "transformative power of redemption" rather than that God is not omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|158–168}}

===Afterlife===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] suggested the [[afterlife]] theodicy to address the problem of evil and to justifying the existence of evil.&lt;ref name="stump2008p49"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 | title=The Evidential Argument from Evil | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Eleonore Stump | editor=Daniel Howard-Snyder | year=2008 | pages=49–52 | isbn=0-253-11409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise behind this theodicy is that the afterlife is unending, human life is short, and God allows evil and suffering in order to judge and grant everlasting heaven or hell based on human moral actions and human suffering.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W. McCraw|author2=Robert Arp|title=The Problem of Evil: New Philosophical Directions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUA1CwAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Lexington|isbn=978-1-4985-1208-4 |pages=132–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas says that the afterlife is the greater good that justifies the evil and suffering in current life.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt; Christian author [[Randy Alcorn]] argues that the joys of [[heaven]] will compensate for the sufferings on earth.&lt;ref&gt;If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil, published by Random House of Canada, 2009, p. 294; Quote: Without this eternal perspective, we assume that people who die young, who have handicaps, who suffer poor health, who don't get married or have children, or who don't do this or that will miss out on the best life has to offer.  But the theology underlying these assumptions have a fatal flaw.  It presumes that our present Earth, bodies, culture, relationships and lives are all there is... [but] Heaven will bring far more than compensation for our present sufferings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Maitzen has called this the "Heaven Swamps Everything" theodicy, and argues that it is false because it conflates compensation and justification.&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Goetz|title=Freedom, Teleology, and Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZmvAwAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-7183-2 |pages=139–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_OMIA.pdf "Ordinary Morality Implies Atheism"], European Journal for Philosophy of Religion 1:2 (2009), 107–26, Quote: "... may stem from imagining an ecstatic or forgiving state of mind on the part of the blissful: in heaven no one bears grudges, even the most horrific earthly suffering is as nothing compared to infinite bliss, all past wrongs are forgiven. But "are forgiven" doesn’t mean "were justified"; the blissful person’s disinclination to dwell on his or her earthly suffering doesn’t imply that a perfect being was justified in permitting the suffering all along. By the same token, our ordinary moral practice recognizes a legitimate complaint about child abuse even if, as adults, its victims should happen to be on drugs that make them uninterested in complaining. Even if heaven swamps everything, it doesn’t thereby justify everything."&lt;/ref&gt;

A second objection to the afterlife theodicy is that it does not reconcile the suffering of small babies and innocent children from diseases, abuse, and injury in war or terror attacks, since "human moral actions" are not to be expected from babies and uneducated/mentored children.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66/&gt; Similarly, moral actions and the concept of choice do not apply to the problem of evil applied to animal suffering caused by natural evil or the actions of human beings.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|editor=Larry M. Jorgensen and Samuel Newlands|title=New Essays on Leibniz's Theodicy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNPQAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966003-2 |pages=64–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Chignell|author2=Terence Cuneo|author3=Matthew C.

===Deny evil exists===
In the second century, Christian theologists attempted to reconcile the problem of evil with an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God, by denying that evil exists. Among these theologians, [[Clement of Alexandria]] offered several theodicies, of which one was called "privation theory of evil" which was adopted thereafter.&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is a more modern version of "deny evil", suggested by Christian Science, wherein the perception of evil is described as a form of illusion.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt;

====Evil as the absence of good (privation theory)====
{{Main|Absence of good}}

The early version of "deny evil" is called the "privation theory of evil", so named because it described evil as a form of "lack, loss or privation". One of the earliest proponents of this theory was the 2nd-century Clement of Alexandria, who according to Joseph Kelly,&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; stated that "since God is completely good, he could not have created evil; but if God did not create evil, then it cannot exist". Evil, according to Clement, does not exist as a positive, but exists as a negative or as a "lack of good".&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; Clement's idea was criticised for its inability to explain suffering in the world, if evil did not exist. He was also pressed by Gnostics scholars with the question as to why God did not create creatures that "did not lack the good". Clement attempted to answer these questions ontologically through dualism, an idea found in the Platonic school,&lt;ref name=jeffrey49&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Jeffery |title=Evil and International Relations: Human Suffering in an Age of Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WyADAAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-61035-4 |page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is by presenting two realities, one of God and Truth, another of human and perceived experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth-century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]] adopted the privation theory, and in his ''Enchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love'', maintained that evil exists only as "absence of the good", that vices are nothing but the privations of natural good.&lt;ref name=jeffrey49/&gt; Evil is not a substance, states Augustine, it is nothing more than "loss of good".&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; God does not participate in evil, God is perfection, His creation is perfection, stated Augustine.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; According to the privation theory, it is the absence of the good, that explains sin and moral evil.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |pages=54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been criticized as merely substituting definition, of evil with "loss of good", of "problem of evil and suffering" with the "problem of loss of good and suffering", but it neither addresses the issue from the theoretical point of view nor from the experiential point of view.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |page=56 with footnote 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who criticize the privation theory state that murder, rape, terror, pain and suffering are real life events for the victim, and cannot be denied as mere "lack of good".&lt;ref&gt;Todd C. Calder (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20464387 Is the Privation Theory of Evil Dead?], American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 371–81&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine, states Pereira, accepted suffering exists and was aware that the privation theory was not a solution to the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56/&gt;

====Evil as illusory====
An alternative modern version of the privation theory is by [[Christian Science]], which asserts that evils such as suffering and disease only appear to be real, but in truth are illusions, and in reality evil does not exist.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"&gt;Millard J. Erickson, Christian Theology, Second Edition, Baker Academic, 2007, pp. 445–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologists of Christian Science, states Stephen Gottschalk, posit that the Spirit is of infinite might, mortal human beings fail to grasp this and focus instead on evil and suffering that have no real existence as "a power, person or principle opposed to God".&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Gottschalk |title=Christian Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-FYQv75w7kC |year=1978|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03718-2|pages=65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion version of privation theory theodicy has been critiqued for denying the reality of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain to the victim.&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65/&gt; Further, adds Millard Erickson, the illusion argument merely shifts the problem to a new problem, as to why God would create this "illusion" of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain; and why God does not stop this "illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Millard J. Erickson|title=Christian Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z5zBQAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2182-4 |pages=446–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turning the tables===
A different approach to the problem of evil is to turn the tables by suggesting that any argument from evil is self-refuting, in that its conclusion would necessitate the falsity of one of its premises. One response—called the defensive response&lt;ref name=russell625/&gt;—has been to assert the opposite, and to point out that the assertion "evil exists" implies an ethical standard against which moral value is determined, and then to argue that this standard implies the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard criticism of this view is that an argument from evil is not necessarily a presentation of the views of its proponent, but is instead intended to show how premises which the theist is inclined to believe lead him or her to the conclusion that God does not exist. A second criticism is that the existence of evil can be inferred from the suffering of its victims, rather than by the actions of the evil actor, so no "ethical standard" is implied.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2006), ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 17, 296. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Evidential Argument from Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11409-8 |pages= 305–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was expounded upon by David Hume.&lt;ref name=russell625&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Russell| title=The Oxford Handbook of Hume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMLmCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974284-4 |pages=625–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hidden reasons===
A variant of above defenses is that the problem of evil is derived from probability judgments since they rest on the claim that, even after careful reflection, one can see no good reason for co-existence of God and of evil. The [[inference]] from this claim to the general statement that there exists unnecessary evil is [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] in nature and it is this inductive step that sets the evidential argument apart from the logical argument.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The hidden reasons defense asserts that there exists the logical possibility of hidden or unknown reasons for the existence of evil along with the existence of an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful God. Not knowing the reason does not necessarily mean that the reason does not exist.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; This argument has been challenged with the assertion that the hidden reasons premise is as plausible as the premise that God does not exist or is not "an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful". Similarly, for every hidden argument that completely or partially justifies observed evils it is equally likely that there is a hidden argument that actually makes the observed evils worse than they appear without hidden arguments, or that the hidden reasons may result in additional contradictions.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; As such, from an inductive viewpoint hidden arguments will neutralize one another.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

A sub-variant of the "hidden reasons" defense is called the "PHOG"—profoundly hidden outweighing goods—defense.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; The PHOG defense, states Bryan Frances, not only leaves the co-existence of God and human suffering unanswered, but raises questions about why animals and other life forms have to suffer from natural evil, or from abuse (animal slaughter, animal cruelty) by some human beings, where hidden moral lessons, hidden social good and such hidden reasons to reconcile God with the problem of evil do not apply.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Frances |title=Gratuitous Suffering and the Problem of Evil: A Comprehensive Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngeIkSJnh4kC&amp;pg=PA110|date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-66295-6 |pages=110–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous lives and karma===
The theory of [[karma]] refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530–48&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th-century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–55&lt;/ref&gt; Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347–64&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their god(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P.

===Pandeism===
[[Pandeism]] is a modern theory that unites deism and pantheism, and asserts that God created the universe but during creation became the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism#ref1042352 Deism], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above," God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. God, in pandeism, was omnipotent and omnibenevolent, but in the form of universe is no longer omnipotent, omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

====The Bible====
Sociologist [[Walter Brueggemann]] says theodicy is "a constant concern of the entire Bible" and needs to "include the category of social evil as well as moral, natural (physical) and religious evil".&lt;ref name="Anthony J.Tambasco"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tambasco|editor1-first=Anthony J.|title=The Bible on Suffering: Social and Political Implications|date=2001|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8091-4048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref name="Mark S.

Philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] says that, as it stands in its classic form, the argument from evil is unanswerable, yet there may be contrary reasons for not reaching its conclusion that there is no God.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons are of three kinds: other strong reasons for affirming that there is a God; general reasons for doubting the force of the argument itself; and specific reasons for doubting the criteria of any of the argument's premises; "in other words, a theodicy."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity has responded with multiple traditional theodicies: the Punishment theodicy (Augustine), the Soul-making theodicy (Irenaeus), Process theodicy (Rabbi Harold Kushner), Cruciform theodicy (Moltmann), and the free-will defense (Plantinga) among them.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;

There are, essentially, four representations of evil in the Bible: chaos, human sin, Satanic/demonic forces, and suffering.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|14}} The biblical language of chaos and chaos monsters such as Leviathan remind us order and harmony in our world are constantly assailed by forces "inimical to God's good creation."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|17}} The Bible primarily speaks of sin as moral evil rather than natural or metaphysical evil with an accent on the breaking of God's moral laws, his covenant, the teachings of Christ and the injunctions of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name="Mark S.

While the post-Enlightenment world does not, the "dark spiritual forces" can be seen as "symbols of the darkest recesses of human nature."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|25,28}} Suffering and misfortune are sometimes represented as evil in the Bible, though theologian Brian Han Gregg says, suffering in the Bible is represented twelve different ways.&lt;ref name="Mark S.

*Deuteronomy 30 and Hebrews 12 open the possibilities that suffering may be punishment, natural consequences, or God's loving discipline. 
*Genesis 4:1-8 and the first murder suggests much suffering is the result of certain people's choices. 
*Genesis 45 says God's redemptive power is stronger than suffering and can be used to further good purposes. 
*Luke 22:31-34 says resist the fear and despair that accompany suffering, instead remember/believe God has the power to help. 
*Job 40 says God is not like humans but wants a relationship with all of them, which requires some surrender to God and acceptance of suffering.
*Romans 8:18-30 sets present temporary suffering within the context of God's eternal purposes. 
*Hebrews 12:1-6 sets suffering within the concept of "soul-making" as do 2 Peter 1:5-8, James 1, and others. 
*Exodus 17:1-7 and the whole book of Job characterize suffering as testing and speak of God's right to test human loyalty. 
*2 Corinthians 4:7-12 says human weakness during suffering reveals God's strength and that it is part of the believer's calling to embrace suffering in solidarity with Christ. 
*2 Corinthians 1:3-7 says God is the comforter and that people learn how to better comfort others when they have personal experience of suffering.  
*The great hymn in Philippians 2, along with Colossians 1:24, combine to claim Christ redeems suffering itself.  Believers are invited to share in that by emulating his good thoughts, words and deeds. All New Testament teachings on suffering are all grounded in and circle back to the fall of mankind and the possible redemptive power to individuals of the cross.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|160,161}}

Jewish theodicy is experiencing extensive revision in light of the Holocaust while still asserting the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil. It remains rooted in the nature of creation itself and the limitation inherent in matter's capacity to be perfected; the action of freewill includes the potential for perfection from individual effort and leaves evil in human hands.&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-41724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}}

In the Bible, all characterizations of evil and suffering reveal "a God who is greater than suffering [who] is powerful, creative and committed to His creation [who] always has the last word."  God's commitment to the greater good is assumed in all cases.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|162,168}}

====Judgment Day====
John Joseph Haldane's Wittgenstinian-Thomistic account of concept formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haldane|first1=J.J.|title=Atheism and Theism|date=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23259-1|pages=102–05|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Heidegger's observation of temporality's thrown nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidegger|first1=Martin|title=Being and Time|origyear=1962|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0-631-19770-2|pages=426–27 (H 374) 458–72 (H 406–21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; imply that God's act of creation and God's act of judgment are the same act. God's condemnation of evil is subsequently believed to be executed and expressed in his created world; a judgement that is unstoppable due to God's all powerful will; a constant and eternal judgement that becomes announced and communicated to other people on [[Judgment Day]]. In this explanation, God's condemnation of evil is declared to be a good judgement.

====Irenaean theodicy====
[[Irenaean theodicy]], posited by [[Irenaeus]] (2nd century CE–c. 202), has been reformulated by [[John Hick]]. It holds that one cannot achieve moral goodness or love for God if there is no evil and suffering in the world. Evil is [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]-making and leads one to be truly moral and close to God. God created an [[epistemic]] distance (such that God is not immediately knowable) so that we may strive to know him and by doing so become truly good. Evil is a means to good for three main reasons:

# ''Means of knowledge'' – Hunger leads to pain, and causes a desire to feed. Knowledge of pain prompts humans to seek to help others in pain.
# ''Character building'' – Evil offers the opportunity to grow morally. "We would never learn the art of goodness in a world designed as a hedonistic paradise" (''Richard Swinburne'')
# ''Predictable environment'' – The world runs to a series of natural laws. These are independent of any inhabitants of the universe. Natural Evil only occurs when these natural laws conflict with our own perceived needs. This is not immoral in any way

====Augustinian theodicy====
St [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 CE) in his [[Augustinian theodicy]], as presented in John Hick's book ''Evil and the God of Love'', focuses on the Genesis story that essentially dictates that God created the world and that it was good; evil is merely a consequence of [[the fall of man]] (The story of the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve disobeyed God and caused inherent sin for man). Augustine stated that [[natural evil]] (evil present in the natural world such as natural disasters etc.) is caused by fallen angels, whereas [[moral evil]] (evil caused by the will of human beings) is as a result of man having become estranged from God and choosing to deviate from his chosen path. Augustine argued that God could not have created evil in the world, as it was created good, and that all notions of evil are simply a deviation or privation of goodness. Evil cannot be a separate and unique substance. For example, Blindness is not a separate entity, but is merely a lack or privation of sight. Thus the Augustinian theodicist would argue that the problem of evil and suffering is void because God did not create evil; it was man who chose to deviate from the path of perfect goodness.

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Saint Thomas systematized the Augustinian conception of evil, supplementing it with his own musings. Evil, according to St. Thomas, is a privation, or the absence of some good which belongs properly to the nature of the creature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/ContraGentiles3a.htm#7 ''Summa Contra Gentiles'' III c. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; There is therefore no positive source of evil, corresponding to the greater good, which is God;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article3|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; evil being not real but rational—i.e. it exists not as an objective fact, but as a subjective conception; things are evil not in themselves, but by reason of their relation to other things or persons. All realities are in themselves good; they produce bad results only incidentally; and consequently the ultimate cause of evil is fundamentally good, as well as the objects in which evil is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article1|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Luther and Calvin ====
{{main|Original sin}}
Both [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] explained evil as a consequence of the [[fall of man]] and the [[original sin]]. Calvin, however, held to the belief in [[predestination]] and omnipotence, the fall is part of God's plan. Luther saw evil and original sin as an inheritance from Adam and Eve, passed on to all mankind from their conception and bound the will of man to serving sin, which God's just nature allowed as consequence for their distrust, though God planned mankind's redemption through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Bondage of the Will|last=Luther|first=Martin|publisher=|year=1525|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately humans may not be able to understand and explain this plan.&lt;ref&gt;The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics, Joseph F. Kelly, p. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberal Christianity ====
Some modern [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]], including French Calvinist theologian André Gounelle and Pastor Marc Pernot of [[L'Oratoire du Louvre]], believe that God is not omnipotent, and that the Bible only describes God as "almighty" in passages concerning the [[End Times]].&lt;ref name="andregounelle.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andregounelle.fr/dieu/quelle-puissance-l-impossible-toute-puissance.php|title=Quelle puissance ?|website=andregounelle.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oratoiredulouvre.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/dictionnaire/puissant-tout-puissant.php|title=Puissant - Tout-Puissant - Oratoire du Louvre|first=|last=Stereoweb|date=1 July 2018|website=Oratoire du Louvre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
{{see also|Christian Science#Evil}}
[[Christian Science]] views evil as having no ultimate reality and as being due to false beliefs, consciously or unconsciously held. Evils such as illness and death may be banished by correct understanding. This view has been questioned, aside from the general criticisms of the concept of evil as an illusion discussed earlier, since the presumably correct understanding by Christian Science members, including the founder, has not prevented illness and death.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt; However, Christian Scientists believe that the many instances of spiritual healing (as recounted e.g. in the Christian Science periodicals and in the textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy) are [[anecdotal evidence]] of the correctness of the teaching of the unreality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, 1987, Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age, San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author, the denial by Christian Scientists that evil ultimately exists neatly solves the problem of evil; however, most people cannot accept that solution&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil," 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that [[Satan]] is the original cause of evil.&lt;ref&gt;"Why All Suffering Is Soon to End", ''The Watchtower'', 15 May 2007, p. 21, "For some, the obstacle [to believing in God] involves what is often called the ''problem of evil''. They feel that if God exists and is almighty and loving, the evil and suffering in the world cannot be explained. No God who tolerates evil could exist, they reason... Satan has surely proved adept at blinding human minds. ...God is not responsible for the wickedness so prevalent in the world." [emphasis added] [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007366]&lt;/ref&gt; Though once a perfect angel, Satan developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship, and eventually challenged God's right to rule. Satan caused [[Adam and Eve]] to disobey God, and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of Jehovah and Satan to universal sovereignty.&lt;ref name="pentonsatan"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 189–90 | isbn = 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other angels who sided with Satan became [[demon]]s.

God's subsequent tolerance of evil is explained in part by the value of free will. But Jehovah's Witnesses also hold that this period of suffering is one of non-interference from God, which serves to demonstrate that [[Jehovah]]'s "right to rule" is both correct and in the best interests of all intelligent beings, settling the "issue of universal sovereignty". Further, it gives individual humans the opportunity to show their willingness to submit to God's rulership.

At some future time known to him, God will consider his right to universal sovereignty to have been settled for all time. The [[Justification (theology)|reconciliation of "faithful" humankind]] will have been accomplished through [[Christ]], and nonconforming humans and demons will have been destroyed. Thereafter, evil (any failure to submit to God's rulership) will be summarily executed.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Does God Allow Evil and Suffering?", ''The Watchtower'', 1 May 2011, p. 16, [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011331]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201107/why-so-much-suffering/ "Why Is There So Much Suffering?", ''Awake'', July 2011, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) introduces a concept similar to [[Problem of evil#Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean theodicy]], that experiencing evil is a necessary part of the development of the soul. Specifically, the laws of nature prevent an individual from fully comprehending or experiencing good without experiencing its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Mormon]], [[Second Book of Nephi|2 Nephi]] {{lds||2-ne|2|11|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Latter-day Saints do not regard [[fall of man|the fall]] of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] as a tragic, unplanned cancellation of an eternal paradise; rather they see it as an essential element of God's plan. By allowing opposition and temptations in mortality, God created an environment for people to learn, to develop their freedom to choose, and to appreciate and understand the light, with a comparison to darkness &lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_27_2015c1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-4-freedom-to-choose?lang=eng |title=Gospel Principles Chapter 4: Freedom to Choose |newspaper= |date=  |author= |accessdate= 27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Doctrines of the Gospel, Student Manual |year= 2000 |chapter= Chapter 10: The Purpose of Earth Life |chapter-url= https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-10-the-purpose-of-earth-life?lang=eng |publisher= [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]], [[Church Educational System]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a departure from the mainstream Christian definition of [[omnipotence]] and [[omniscience]], which Mormons believe was changed by post-apostolic theologians in the centuries after Christ. The writings of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], [[Augustine]], and others indicate a merging of Christian principles with Greek metaphysical philosophies such as [[Neoplatonism]], which described divinity as an [[divine simplicity|utterly simple]], immaterial, formless substance/essence ([[ousia]]) that was the absolute causality and creative source of all that existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Bickmore |first= Barry R. |authorlink= Barry R.

==Other religions==
===Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt===
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian religion, according to {{proper name|Roland Enmarch}}, potentially absolved their gods from any blame for evil, and used a negative cosmology and the negative concept of human nature to explain evil.&lt;ref name=enmarch2&gt;Roland Enmarch (2008), [http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=1700601 Theodicy], UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Editors: Dieleman and Wendrich&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Pharaoh was seen as an agent of the gods and his actions as a king were aimed to prevent evil and curb evilness in human nature.&lt;ref name=enmarch2/&gt;

===Ancient Greek religion===
The gods in [[Ancient Greek religion]] were seen as superior, but shared similar traits with humans and often interacted with them.&lt;ref name=Homer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Iliad|date=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=NewYork}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Greeks didn't believe in any "evil" gods, the Greeks still acknowledged the fact that evil was present in the world.&lt;ref name="Greek/Gods"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=John|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R7&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3035100157&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3035100157&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gods often meddled in the affairs of men, and sometimes their actions consisted of bringing misery to people, for example gods would sometimes be a direct cause of death for people.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; However, the Greeks did not consider the gods to be evil as a result of their actions, instead the answer for most situations in Greek mythology was the power of [[fate]].&lt;ref name=Fate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolle|first1=Kees|title=Fate|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R12&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424501004&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3424501004&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fate is considered to be more powerful than the gods themselves and for this reason no one can escape it.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt; For this reason the Greeks recognized that unfortunate events were justifiable by the idea of fate.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt;

Later Greek and Roman theologians and philosophers discussed the problem of evil in depth. Starting at least with Plato, philosophers tended to reject or de-emphasize literal interpretations of mythology in favor of a more [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[natural theology]] based on reasoned arguments. In this framework, stories that seemed to impute dishonorable conduct to the gods were often simply dismissed as false, and as being nothing more than the "imagination of poets."  Greek and Roman thinkers continued to wrestle, however, with the problems of [[natural evil]] and of evil that we observe in our day-to-day experience.  Influential Roman writers such as [[De Natura Deorum|Cicero]] and [[De Providentia|Seneca]], drawing on earlier work by the Greek philosophers such as the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], developed many arguments in defense of the righteousness of the gods, and many of the answers they provided were later absorbed into Christian [[theodicy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] neither denies the existence of evil, nor does it attempt to reconcile evil in a way attempted by monotheistic religions that assert the existence of an almighty, all powerful, all knowing, all benevolent God.&lt;ref name=koslowski10&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

Buddhism accepts that there is evil in the world, as well as [[Dukkha]] (suffering) that is caused by evil or because of natural causes (aging, disease, rebirth). The precepts and practices of Buddhism, such as [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Noble Eightfold Path]] aim to empower a follower in gaining insights and liberation ([[nirvana]]) from the cycle of such suffering as well as rebirth.&lt;ref name=koslowski10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams|author2=Anthony Tribe|author3=Alexander Wynne|title=Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-52087-7 |pages=30–52 |chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strands of Mahayana Buddhism developed a theory of [[Buddha-nature]] in texts such as the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' composed in 3rd-century south India, which is very similar to the "soul, self" theory found in classical Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=103–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

Further, the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' are atypical texts of Buddhism, because they contradict the [[Anatta]] doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists, and that they do not represent mainstream Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–05, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–02|quote=Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term.

The mainstream Buddhism, from its early days, did not need to address the theological problem of evil as it saw no need for a creator of the universe and asserted instead, like many Indian traditions, that the universe never had a beginning and all existence is an endless cycle of rebirths (samsara).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;

Further, [[Deity|deities]] in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] are mortal and subject to [[samsara]].

For that would lead to the possibility of partiality and cruelty. For it can be reasonably concluded that God has passion and hatred like some ignoble persons... Hence there will be a nullification of God's nature of extreme purity, (unchangeability), etc., [...] And owing to infliction of misery and destruction on all creatures, God will be open to the charge of pitilessness and extreme cruelty, abhorred even by a villain. Thus on account of the possibility of partiality and cruelty, God is not an agent.

A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century.

Madhvacharya asserted, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva's reply does not address the problem of evil, state Dasti and Bryant, as to how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R.

According to Sharma, "Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=270, 370–71, ''Quote:'' The problem of evil and suffering in the world is the most difficult one in Theism. We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The earliest statement of the problem of evil is attributed to Epicurus, but this is uncertain.&lt;ref name=mcbrayer26/&gt;]]

===Epicurus===
[[Epicurus]] is generally credited with first expounding the problem of evil, and it is sometimes called the "[[Epicurean paradox]]", the "riddle of Epicurus", or the "Epicurus' [[trilemma]]":

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?
&lt;/poem&gt;
|The Epicurean paradox|~300 BCE&lt;ref&gt;Hospers, John. ''An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis''. 3rd Ed. Routledge, 1990, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is no surviving written text of Epicurus that establishes that he actually formulated the problem of evil in this way, and it is uncertain that he was the author.&lt;ref name=mcbrayer26&gt;{{cite book|author1=Justin P.

{{quote|But if this account is true, which the Stoics were in no manner able to see, that argument also of Epicurus is done away. God, he says, either wishes to take away evils, and is unable; or He is able and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He is both willing and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is able and unwilling, He is envious, which is equally at variance with God; if He is neither willing or able, He is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if He is both willing and able, which alone is suitable to God,
from what source then are evils or why does He not remove them?

}} where Lactantius critiques the argument. Epicurus's argument as presented by Lactantius actually argues that a god that is all-powerful and all-good does not exist and that the gods are distant and uninvolved with man's concerns. The gods are neither our friends nor enemies.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume]]'s formulation of the problem of evil in ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is he [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hume, David |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4583 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[God's] power we allow [is] infinite: Whatever he wills is executed: But neither man nor any other animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gottfried Leibniz===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gottfried Leibniz]]

In his ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'', the [[scepticism|sceptic]] [[Pierre Bayle]] denied the goodness and omnipotence of God on account of the [[suffering]]s experienced in this earthly life. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] introduced the term theodicy in his 1710 work ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' ("Theodicic Essays on the Benevolence of God, the Free will of man, and the Origin of Evil") which was directed mainly against Bayle. He argued that this is the [[best of all possible worlds]] that God could have created.

Imitating the example of Leibniz, other philosophers also called their treatises on the problem of evil theodicies. [[Voltaire]]'s popular novel ''[[Candide]]'' mocked Leibnizian optimism through the fictional tale of a naive youth.

=== Thomas Robert Malthus ===
The population and economic theorist [[Thomas Malthus]] stated in a 1798 essay that people with health problems or disease are not suffering, and should not viewed as such. Malthus argued, "Nothing can appear more consonant to our reason than that those beings which come out of the creative process of the world in lovely and beautiful forms should be crowned with immortality, while those which come out misshapen, those whose minds are not suited to a purer and happier state of existence, should perish and be condemned to mix again with their original clay. Eternal condemnation of this kind may be considered as a species of eternal punishment, and it is not wonderful that it should be represented, sometimes, under images of suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the principle of population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. p158&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus believed in the Supreme Creator, considered suffering as justified, and suggested that God should be considered "as pursuing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, instead of merely condemning to their original insensibility those beings that, by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities suited to a purer state of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus (1798), [http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf An essay on the principle of population], Oxford Classics, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote an essay on theodicy.&lt;ref name=dembski11&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, states William Dembski, that any successful theodicy must prove one of three things: [1] what one deems contrary to the purposefulness of world is not so; [2] if one deems it is contrary, then one must consider it not as a positive fact, but inevitable consequence of the nature of things; [3] if one accepts that it is a positive fact, then one must posit that it is not the work of God, but of some other beings such as man or superior spirits, good or evil.&lt;ref name=dembski11/&gt;

Kant did not attempt or exhaust all theodicies to help address the problem of evil. He claimed there is a reason all possible theodicies must fail.&lt;ref&gt;See Kant's essay, "Concerning the Possibility of a Theodicy and the Failure of All Previous Philosophical Attempts in the Field" (1791). Stephen Palmquist explains why Kant refuses to solve the problem of evil in "Faith in the Face of Evil", Appendix VI of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; While a successful philosophical theodicy has not been achieved in his time, added Kant, there is no basis for a successful anti-theodicy either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of good===
Several philosophers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327264] Cahn, Stephen M. (1977). Cacodaemony. Analysis, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7247672&amp;jid=RES&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=7247664&amp;fromPage=cupadmin&amp;pdftype=6316268&amp;repository=authInst]  Law, Stephen (2010). The Evil-God Challenge. Religious Studies 46 (3): 353–73&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that just as there exists a problem of evil for theists who believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, so too is there a problem of good for anyone who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent (or perfectly evil) being. As it appears that the defenses and theodicies which might allow the theist to resist the problem of evil can be inverted and used to defend belief in the omnimalevolent being, this suggests that we should draw similar conclusions about the success of these defensive strategies. In that case, the theist appears to face a dilemma: either to accept that both sets of responses are equally bad, and so that the theist does not have an adequate response to the problem of evil; or to accept that both sets of responses are equally good, and so to commit to the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnimalevolent being as plausible.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Critics have noted that theodicies and defenses are often addressed to the logical problem of evil. As such, they are intended only to demonstrate that it is ''possible'' that evil can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Since the relevant parallel commitment is only that good can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnimalevolent being, not that it is plausible that they should do so, the theist who is responding to the problem of evil need not be committing himself to something he is likely to think is false.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327697 Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism], King-Farlow, J. (1978), Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism, Analysis, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; This reply, however, leaves the evidential problem of evil untouched.

===Morality===
Another general criticism is that though a theodicy may harmonize God with the existence of evil, it does so at the cost of nullifying morality. This is because most theodicies assume that whatever evil there is exists because it is required for the sake of some greater good. But if an evil is necessary because it secures a greater good, then it appears we humans have no duty to prevent it, for in doing so we would also prevent the greater good for which the evil is required. Even worse, it seems that any action can be rationalized, as if one succeeds in performing it, then God has permitted it, and so it must be for the greater good. From this line of thought one may conclude that, as these conclusions violate our basic moral intuitions, no greater good theodicy is true, and God does not exist. Alternatively, one may point out that greater good theodicies lead us to see every conceivable state of affairs as compatible with the existence of God, and in that case the notion of God's goodness is rendered meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Dittman, Volker and Tremblay, François {{cite web|title=The Immorality of Theodicies

[[File:2009-0725-CA-ReedleyCollege.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Reedley College]]
'''Reedley College''' often referred to as '''Reedley''', or '''RC''', is a public [[community college]] located in [[Reedley, California]], [[United States|USA]] {{convert|20|mi|km}} southeast of metropolitan [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and a three-hour drive south to [[Los Angeles]] or three-hour drive north to [[San Francisco]]. Reedley College is a part of the [[California Community Colleges system]], within the [[State Center Community College District]] (SCCCD), and fully accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]][https://web.archive.org/web/20080509172834/http://www.accjc.org/list_accred_coll.htm].  The school offers [[Associate's Degree]]s, and students can earn a Certificate of Completion, or transfer to a 4-year university of their choice. Reedley College students can choose to either pursue their AA (Associates in Arts) or their AS (Associates in Science), or obtain their GED (General Education Degree). Reedley College offers more than 80 major degrees and certificates for students to choose from.

==History==
Reedley College was founded in May 1926, as Reedley Junior College on the campus of [[Reedley High School]].  It became a full community college on July 1, 1946. In 1954, the school district voted to move Reedley College to its own campus and in 1956 it moved to its present location on {{convert|420|acre|km2}} of what was once a part of the historic Thomas Law Reed Ranch, {{convert|300|acre|km2}} remain used as farmland.  In 1963 the college joined the SCCCD and was renamed Kings River Community College in 1980. However, by popular demand, the name Reedley College was restored in July 1998.

==College Centers==
Reedley College has two college centers, Madera Community College Center and Oakhurst Community College Center.

The Madera Community College Center is located in [[Madera, California]] on {{convert|114|acre|km2}} of donated land. It was originally opened at its current site in 1996 and has slowly continued to expand since. The newest addition to the campus was the construction of the {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. academic village which houses state of the art computer and science labs as well as additional classroom and office space. Future expansion projects are being planned. The campus currently offers some associate degree majors as well as general education courses transferable to four-year universities.

The Oakhurst Community College Center is located in [[Oakhurst, California]] and opened at its current location in 1996 on {{convert|2.6|acre|m2}} of land. The center is housed in four buildings adjacent to the town's library.

[[Clovis Community College (California)|Clovis Community College]], formerly known as the Willow International Center, was a Reedley College Center until July 1, 2015, when it became a separate campus of the State Center Community College District.&lt;ref name=roundup&gt;{{cite news |last=Shelton |first=Valerie |date=2015-07-15 |title=Clovis now boasts the 113th community college in California |url=http://theclovisroundup.com/clovis-now-boasts-the-113th-community-college-in-california/ |newspaper=Clovis Roundup |location= |access-date=2015-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing==
Reedley College is one of the only [[community colleges]] in the state of [[California]] to house students on campus. Sequoia Hall houses 40 women and 100 men. Sequoia Hall is located on the southern corner of the campus. One wing is for women and the other wing is for men. Construction of a new Sequoia Hall to replace the original aging facility started during the summer of 2008 and was completed in spring of 2010. The original building was razed.

==Athletics==
The Reedley College Athletic Department fields teams in 12 intercollegiate sports with five men's teams and seven women's teams. The Tigers are a member of the Central Valley Conference in all sports except for football, which is a member of the Northern California Football Alliance (NCFA). The Reedley College football team won the Northern California Football Championship, the COA State Championship, and finished #1 in the nation in 2002 with a 12-0 record. The women's basketball team has been to the COA [[Final (competition)|Final]] 16 more than 4 of the last 10 years. The women's tennis team has become a state power with an undefeated conference record since 2007 and various championship titles in recent years. Tiger athletes have gone on to four-year colleges such as [[California Golden Bears|Cal]], [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Texas Tech]], [[Fresno State Bulldogs|Fresno State]], [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], [[Boise State Broncos|Boise State]], [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Minnesota]], [[Texas State University–San Marcos|Texas State]], and [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]], to name a few.

'''Self-anointing in animals''', sometimes called '''anointing''' or '''anting''', is a behaviour whereby a non-human animal smears odoriferous substances over themselves.  These substances are often the secretions, parts, or entire bodies of other animals or plants.  The animal may chew these substances and then spread the resulting saliva mixture over their body, or they may apply the source of the odour directly with an appendage, tool or by rubbing their body on the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=P.J.|last=Weldon|journal=Chemeoecology|year=2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–4|title=Defensive anointing: Extended chemical phenotype and unorthodox ecology.|doi=10.1007/s00049-003-0259-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of self-anointing differ between species, but it may act as self-medication, repel parasites, provide camouflage, aid in communication, or make the animal poisonous.

==Primates==
Several primate species self-anoint with various items such as [[millipedes]], leaves and fruit.  They sometimes [[Drooling|drool]] while doing this.&lt;ref name="Buchanan-Smith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/Images/capuchin_squirrel_monkeys_tcm4-669209.pdf|title=Living together - capuchin and squirrel monkeys|author=Buchanan-Smith, H.M.|year=2008|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[capuchin monkey]]s and [[squirrel monkey]]s perform urine washing, when they deposit a small quantity of urine onto the palm of a hand and then rub it on the sole of the opposite foot. It is thought to have multiple functions including hygiene, thermoregulation and response to irritation from biting [[ectoparasite]]s (such as ticks and botfly).&lt;ref name="Buchanan-Smith" /&gt; Some [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]] and [[New World monkey]]s also self-anoint the body with urine to communicate.&lt;ref name="Estes1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Estes|title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g977LsZHpcsC&amp;pg=PA464&amp;dq=urine+marking+penis#v=onepage&amp;q=urine%20marking%20penis&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 December 2012|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08085-0|pages=464–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Nowak | editor1-first = R.

===Capuchins===
Wild [[wedge-capped capuchin]] monkeys (''Cebus olivaceus'') self-anoint with millipedes (''Orthoporus dorsovittatus''). Chemical analysis revealed these millipedes secrete two [[benzoquinones]], compounds known to be potently repellent to insects&lt;ref name="Weldon"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Naturwissenschaften|year=2003|volume=90|issue=7|pages=301–304|doi=10.1007/s00114-003-0427-2|pmid=12883771|first1=P.J.|last1=Weldon|first2=J.R.|last2=Aldrich|first3=J.A.|last3=Klun|first4=J.E.|last4=Oliver|first5=
M.|last5=Debboun|title=Benzoquinones from millipedes deter mosquitoes and elicit self-anointing in capuchin monkeys (Cebus spp)|url=http://www.living-links.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Research-Article-2-Short-Communication.pdf|bibcode=2003NW.....90..301W}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the secretions are thought to provide protection against insects, particularly [[mosquito]]es (and the bot flies they transmit) during the rainy season. Millipede secretion is so avidly sought by the monkeys that up to four of them will share a single millipede. The anointment must also involve risks, since benzoquinones are [[toxic]] and [[carcinogenic]], however, it is likely that for capuchins, the immediate benefits of self-anointment outweigh the long-term costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=X.|last1=Valderrama|first2=J.G.|last2=Robinson|first3=A.B.|last3=Attygalle|first4=T.|last4= Eisner|title=Seasonal anointment with millipedes in a wild primate: A chemical defense against insects?|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|year=2000|volume=26|issue=12|pages=2781–2790|doi=10.1023/A:1026489826714}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secretions from these millipedes also elicit self-anointing in captive male and female [[tufted capuchin]] (''C. apella'') and [[white-faced capuchin]] (''C. capucinus'') monkeys.&lt;ref name="Weldon" /&gt;

Wild ''Cebus'' anoint more with plant parts, including fruits, whereas wild ''Sapajus'' anoint more with ants and other arthropods. White-faced capuchins in particular use more plant species at each site for anointing compared with other capuchins and may specialize in anointing as an activity independent from foraging, whereas most other capuchin species tend to eat the substances they use for anointing. Wild ''Cebus'' anoint at a higher frequency than ''Sapajus'' as occurs in captive groups.  However, contrary data from captive animals there no difference in the range of sociality for anointing between ''Cebus'' and ''Sapajus'' in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anointing variation across wild capuchin populations: a review of material preferences, bout frequency and anointing sociality in ''Cebus'' and ''Sapajus''|first=J.W.|last=Lynch Alfaro|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=74|issue=4|pages=299–314|year=2012|doi=10.1002/ajp.20971|pmid=21769906|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capuchin monkeys at the [[Edinburgh Zoo]] rub onions and limes on their skin and into their fur as an antiseptic and insect repellent.&lt;ref name="self-medication"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorendreier.com/what-can-we-learn-from-natures-self-medicators/|author=Dreier, S.|title=What can we learn from nature's self-medicators?|year=2013|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5TDlG441gA] Video of capuchins self-anointing.&lt;/ref&gt;

White-faced capuchin monkeys sometimes anoint their bodies with mud and plant matter, a natural insect repellent.  With their heads and faces slathered in this mixture, these highly social primates lose their ability to recognise each other and previously friendly monkeys can become fighting foes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2013/march/7-monkey-face#.UoVMECcV8YI|title=How evolution made the monkey face|author=Abbasi, J.|year=2013|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spider monkeys===
[[Mexican spider monkey]]s (''Ateles geoffroyi'') self-anoint with the leaves of three species of plants;
the Alamos pea tree (''Brongniartia alamosana''), the trumpet tree (''Cecropia obtusifolia'') and wild celery  (''Apium graveolens''). In one study, only two males in a group of 10 individuals displayed self-anointing.  Only the [[Sternum|sternal]] and [[axilla]]ry regions of the body were rubbed with the mix of saliva and plant material.  There was a lack of correlation between the occurrence of self-anointing and time of day, season of the year, ambient temperature or humidity, indicating that this behaviour does not function in repelling insects and/or mitigating topical skin infections in this species. Rather, the three plant species spread an intensive and aromatic odour when crushed, indicating that self-anointing in Mexican spider monkeys may play a role in the context of social communication, possibly for signalling of social status or to increase [[sexual attractiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=M.|last1=Laska|first2=V.|last2=Bauer|first3=L.T.H.|last3=Salazar|journal=Primates|year=2007|volume=48|issue=2|pages=160–163|title=Self-anointing behavior in free-ranging spider monkeys (''Ateles geoffroyi'') in Mexico|doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0019-9|pmid=17103123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lemurs===
{{main|Ring-tailed lemur#Olfactory communication}}
Male ring-tailed lemurs have scent glands on their wrists, chests, and in the genital area. During encounters with rival males they may perform ritualised aggression by having a "stink fight". The males anoint their tails by rubbing the ends of their tails on the inside of their wrists and on their chests. They then arch their tails over their bodies and wave them at their opponent. The male toward which this is directed either responds with a display of his own, physical aggression, or flees. "Stink fights" can last from 10 minutes to one hour.&lt;ref name="Cawthon Lang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/ring-tailed_lemur/behav|author=Cawthon Lang, K.A.|year=2005|title=Primate Factsheets: Ring-tailed lemur (''Lemur catta'') Behavior |publisher=Wisconsin Primate Research Center (WPRC)|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black lemurs have also been observed self-anointing with millipedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birkinshaw|first=C.R.|title=Use of millipedes by black lemurs to anoint their bodies|journal=Folia Primatologica, Basileia (Suíça)|volume=70|issue=3|pages=170–171|year=1999|doi=10.1159/000021691|pmid=10394067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ungulates==
Several ungulates self-anoint with their own urine.&lt;ref&gt;Gosling, L. M. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonard_Gosling/publication/230317056_A_Reassessment_of_the_Function_of_Scent_Marking_in_Territories/links/59dcd8b4a6fdcca56e35e24c/A-Reassessment-of-the-Function-of-Scent-Marking-in-Territories.pdf A reassessment of the function of scent marking in territories]."

In [[Nile lechwe]], a unique form of marking is seen with the start of [[mating]]. The male bends his head to the ground and urinates on his throat and cheek hair. He then rubs his dripping beard on the female's forehead and [[Rump (animal)|rump]].&lt;ref name=adw&gt;{{cite web|last=Corrie|first=Julia|title=Kobus megaceros|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Kobus_megaceros.html|work=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|publisher=Animal Diversity Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Falchetti|first=E.|author2=Ceccarelli, A. |title=A peculiar behaviour of the dominant males of Nile lechwes (''Kobus megaceros'', Bovidae Reduncinae): urination on the neck|journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=1 September 1993|volume=5|issue=3|pages=392–393|doi=10.1080/08927014.1993.9523048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deer===

====Elk====
[[File:Elk.webm|thumb|A self-anointing male elk]]
Bull elk often dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{cite web | title = Elk | work = Living with Wildlife | publisher = Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife | url = http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/elk.html | accessdate = 2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some deer species, including elk, can mark themselves by spraying urine on their bodies from an erect penis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural History Bulletin of the Siam Society|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWRMAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=deer+penis+urine+spraying&amp;dq=deer+penis+urine+spraying|accessdate=5 July 2013|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Towsley2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryce Towsley|title=Big Bucks The Benoit Way: Secrets From America's First Family of Whitetail Hunting|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DX8Jknvz7FAC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=deer+penis+urinating#v=onepage&amp;q=deer%20penis%20urinating&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 July 2013|date=13 August 2008|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=978-1-4402-2631-1|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walther1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fritz R.

When urine marking, the male [[elk]] advertises this with a specialised vocalisation called the "bugle".  During  the last phase of the bugle, the bull rubs (palpates) his belly in rhythm with "yelps".  He then directs a spray of urine towards his stomach or the ground.  The hair on his stomach in front of the [[External urethral orifice (male)|penis]] becomes soaked with urine and gains a dark brown tint.

Urine spraying is a variable behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling a few drops of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis.  A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be  sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow.  When urine spraying, the bull lowers his head towards the ground.  In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs. Once the wallow has been created, the male elk lowers himself into the area, rolls on his side and rub his mane on the soaked area of the wallow. He rubs the side of his face, his chest, stomach, legs, and flanks, which all become caked with mud. During wallowing, the [[deer penis|elk's penis]] may remain erect and he may continue to spray urine.&lt;ref name="Terry et al. 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowhunting.net/NAspecies/elk3.html#adver |author=Keck, S. |title=Elk (Cervus Canadensis) |accessdate=November 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002031259/http://www.bowhunting.net/naspecies/elk3.html |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BowyerKitchen1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowyer|first=R.

====Red deer====
Male [[red deer]] anoint their wallows with urine and roll in these in a very similar way to elk.&lt;ref name="Elk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lincoln | first1 = G. A. | year = 1971 | title = The seasonal reproductive changes in the red deer stag (Cervus elaphus) | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 163 | issue = 1| pages = 105–123 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1971.tb04527.x| bibcode = 2010JZoo..281..263G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goats===
Male goats self-anoint with their urine.  This is done by extending the penis, bending the haunches and
extending the head backwards causing the urine to hit the mouth, throat, face and beard. This type of urination is possibly an indicator of rank and physical condition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3d.htm|title=Behavioural profiles of domestic animals - Goats|first=J.K.|last=Blackshaw|publisher=AnimalBehaviour.net|accessdate=November 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031119203946/http://www.animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3d.htm#|archive-date=2003-11-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plays an important role in [[Goat#Reproduction|goat reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shank|first=C.C.|year=1972|title=Some aspects of social behaviour in a population of feral goats (Capra hircus L.)|journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie|volume=30|issue=5|pages=488–528|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1972.tb00876.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rodents==
The [[rice-field rat]] (''Rattus rattoides'') displays self-anointing behaviour in response to the anal-gland secretions of the weasel ''[[Mustela sibirica]]'', however, they do not respond to the faeces and urine of the [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'').  Juvenile rats born in the laboratory with no experience of weasels also display self-anointing behaviour.  In this species, the self-anointing behaviour is not sex-specific or age-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Self-anointing behavior in the rice-field rat ''Rattus rattoides''|first1=Z.|last1=Xu|first2=D.M.|last2=Stoddart|first3=H.|last3=Ding|first4=J.|last4=Zhang|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=6|issue=4|year=1995|pages=1238–1241|doi=10.2307/1382617|jstor=1382617|bibcode=2007JMamm..88..275L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ground squirrel]]s chew rattlesnake skins and then lick their fur, a behaviour likely to deter that particular predator.&lt;ref name="self-medication" /&gt;

==Hedgehogs==
[[File:Riccio autosputo.jpg|thumb|200px|Frothy saliva visible on the head of a juvenile male European hedgehog after self-anointing.]]
[[European hedgehog]]s (''Erinaceus europaeus'') have been widely reported to self-anoint with a range of toxic and irritating substances, particularly when introduced to a new or strong-smelling substance.  These substances include toad skin, tobacco, soap and faecal matter.&lt;ref name="Brodie1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodie|first1=E.D.|last2=Brodie|first2=E.D.|last3=Johnson|first3=J.A.|title=Breeding the African hedgehog in captivity|journal=  |volume=  |pages=  |year=1982|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/brodie/files/publications/Hedgehog.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hedgehog chews and licks at these substances when it encounters them which produces frothy saliva-substance mix that the hedgehog then spreads onto its spines. 
Young hedgehogs will react to these substances and sometimes also lick substances on the spines of their mothers and self-anoint.  Self-anointing has been observed in hedgehogs as young as 15 days of age, before their eyes open.

In one study, indications of self-anointing were observed in more than 11% of all observations. First-year, independent young self-anointed more than adults, and male hedgehogs had more indications of self-anointing than females. Self-anointing in adults displayed a peak in the summer, while no clear pattern was observed for young. It was concluded that self-anointing is dependent on gender, age and season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1=H.|last1=D'Havé|first2=
J.|last2=Scheirs|first3=R.|last3=Verhagen|first4=W.|last4=De Coen|title=Gender, age and seasonal dependent self-anointing in the European hedgehog ''Erinaceus europaeus''|journal=Acta Theriologica|year=2005|volume=50|issue=2|pages=167–173|doi=10.1007/bf03194480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of self-anointing in hedgehogs. It may function as a form of scent camouflage, to mask their own scent with the new scent in the environment.  Hedgehogs are resistant to many toxins and one theory is that hedgehogs spread toxins on their quills as added protection.  Hedgehogs will sometimes kill toads (''[[Bufo]]''), bite into the toads' poison glands and smear the toxic mixture on their spines.&lt;ref name="Frontiers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science-frontiers.com/sf002/sf002p05.htm|title=Hedgehogs use toad venom for defense|publisher=science-frontiers.com|year=1978|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|first=E.D.|last=Brodie|year=1977|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v268/n5621/abs/268627a0.html|title=Hedgehogs use toad venom in their own defence|journal=Nature|volume=268|pages=627–628|doi=10.1038/268627a0|issue=5621|bibcode=1977Natur.268..627B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canines==
Several canines self-anoint.  In these species, it is sometimes known as '''scent rolling'''.

===Domestic dogs===
Domestic dogs often roll in odoriferous substances, choosing items such as cow manure, a road kill, or rotten fish.&lt;ref name="Yin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/scent-rolling-why-do-dogs-like-rolling-in-smelly-scents|title=Scent rolling: Why do dogs like to roll in smelly scents?|author=Yin, S.|year=2011|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolves===
{{further|Gray wolf#Olfactory|l1=Olfactory communication in wolves}}
Captive wolves will scent roll in a wide range of substances including animal feces, carrion (elk, mouse, pig, badger), mint extract, perfume, animal repellant, fly repellent, etc.&lt;ref name="Yin" /&gt;

==Bears==
North American brown bears (''[[Ursos arctos]]'') make a paste of Osha roots (''[[Ligusticum porteri]]'') and saliva and rub it through their fur to repel insects or soothe bites. This plant, locally known as bear root, contains 105 active compounds, such as [[coumarin]]s that may repel insects when topically applied. [[Navajo people|Navajo Indians]] are said to have learned to use this root medicinally from the bear for treating stomach aches and infections.&lt;ref name="Costa-Neto"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zoopharmacognosy, the self-medication behavior of animals.|journal=Interfaces Científicas-Saúde e Ambiente|volume=1|issue=1|pages=61–72|year=2012|author=Costa-Neto, E.M.|url=https://periodicos.set.edu.br/index.php/saude/article/download/152/105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birds==

[[File:Black Drongo I2 IMG 5683.jpg|thumb|A [[black drongo]] in a typical "anting" posture]]
The use of millipedes in self-anointing by birds has been reported for the [[strong-billed woodcreeper]] (''Xiphocolaptes promeropirhyncus'') in Belize, the [[little shrike-thrush]] (''Colluricincla megarhyncha parvula'') in Australia, the [[black-throated shrikebill]] (''Clytorhynchus nigrogularis'') and the [[jungle mynah]] (''Acridotheres fuscus'') in the Fiji Islands, the [[European robin]] (''Erithacus rubecula'') in England and the [[grey-winged trumpeter]] (''Psophia crepitans'') and the [[pale-winged trumpeter]] (''P. leucoptera'') in northern South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parkes|first1=K.C.|last2=Weldon|first2=P.J.|last3=Hoffman|first3=R.L.|year=2003|title=Polydesmidan millipede used in self-anointing by a strong-billed woodcreeper (Xiphocolaptes promeropirhyncus) from Belize.|journal=Ornitologia Neo-tropical|volume=14|pages=285–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, mothballs (which contain [[napthalene]]) were placed in a flowerbed.  A [[common grackle]] picked one out, extended its left wing and rubbed the mothball up and down the length of the shaft of each of the secondary feathers.  The grackle went on to rub the mothball over its secondary [[coverts]] on the [[ventral]] side and onto the pro[[patagium]] area.  The grackle then repeated the same rubbing actions on its right wing.  The entire rubbing behaviour lasted approximately 10 minutes. European starlings also performed a similar behaviour with mothballs.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal|title="Anting" Behavior by Common Grackles and European Starlings|first1=C.C.|last1=Clark|first2=L.|last2=Clark|first3=L.|last3=Clark|journal=The Wilson Bulletin|volume=102|issue=1|year=1990|pages=167–169|jstor=4162839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During  [[Anting (bird activity)|anting]], birds rub insects on their feathers, usually [[ant]]s, which secrete liquids containing chemicals such as [[formic acid]].  These can act as an [[insecticide]], [[miticide]], [[fungicide]], [[bactericide]], or to make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid. It possibly also supplements the bird's own [[Uropygial gland|preen oil]].  Although it has been suggested that anting acts as a way of reducing feather parasites such as mites or in controlling fungi or bacteria, there has been little convincing support for any of the theories.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Revis, H.C.  |author2=Waller, D.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004|title= Bactericidal and fungicidal ctivity of ant chemicals on feather parasites: an evaluation of anting behavior as a method of self-medication in songbirds|jstor=4090493|journal= The Auk |volume=121|issue=4|pages =1262–1268|doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[1262:BAFAOA]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lunt, N, P.E.Hulley, A.

Another suggested function, based on observation of [[blue jay]]s, is that the bird makes the insects edible, by discharging the harmful acid onto their feathers. The birds were found to show anting behaviour only if the ants had a full acid sac, and with subjects whose acid sacs had been experimentally removed, the behaviour was absent.&lt;ref name=j3&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eisner, T. |year=2008|title="Anting" in Blue Jays, evidence in support of a food-preparatory function|journal=Chemoecology|volume=18|issue=4|pages=197–203|doi=10.1007/s00049-008-0406-3|pmid=19169379|last2=Aneshansley|first2=D|pmc=2630239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it has also been suggested that anting is related to feather [[Moulting#In birds|moulting]].  The metabolic products of the ants may soothe skin irritated by unusually rapid feather replacement.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;  However, the correlation may also be attributed to the greater activity of ants in summer.&lt;ref name=j4&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Power|first1=E.E.|first2=D.C.|last2=Hauser|year=1974|title=Relationship of anting and sunbathing to molting in wild birds|journal=The Auk|volume=91|issue=3|pages=537–563|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v091n03/p0537-p0563.pdf|doi=10.2307/4084474|jstor=4084474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some birds like [[Antbird#Behaviour|antbird]]s and [[Northern Flicker#Diet|flicker]]s not only ant, but also consume the ants as an important part of their diet.

===Social anointing===
[[Owl monkey]]s (''Aotus'' spp.) will anoint each other in groups of two or more by rubbing their bodies against one another while self-anointing with millipedes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zito|first1=M.|last2=Evans|first2=S.|last3=Welson|first3=P.|year=2003|title=Owl Monkeys (Aotus spp.) self-anoint with plants and millipedes.|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=74|issue=3|pages=159–161|doi=10.1159/000070649|pmid=12826735}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social anointing has been observed anecdotally in a captive colony for almost ten years.

'''The Lacassane Company''' is a land management company, with a goal of [[sustainable land management]] using an [[environmental management scheme]] that involves a host of tools including [[holistic management]]. Located primarily in [[Jefferson Davis Parish|Jefferson Davis]] and [[Cameron Parish|Cameron]] [[parish]], with property in [[Ragley, Louisiana]], the company headquarters is in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]].

== History ==
Founded in 1929, by eight [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] area businessmen, with land purchased from Jim Gardiner.
