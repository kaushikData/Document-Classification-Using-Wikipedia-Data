'''Agfa-Commando''' is the widely used name for the München-Giesing - Agfa Kamerawerke [[List of subcamps of Dachau|satellite camp]] of the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. By October 1944, the camp housed about five hundred women. They were used as [[Slave labor in Germany during World War II|slave laborers]] in the [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]] camera factory (part of the [[IG Farben]] group) in München-Giesing, a suburb on the S.W. side of [[Munich]] 14 miles (23&amp;nbsp;km) from the main camp of Dachau. The women assembled [[ignition timing]] devices for bombs, artillery ammunition and [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 flying bomb|V-2]] rockets; they used every opportunity to sabotage the production. In January 1945, citing the lack of food, the prisoners conducted a strike, an unheard-of action in a concentration camp.  Production ended on 23 April 1945 and the women marched toward [[Wolfratshausen]], where their commander eventually surrendered to advancing American troops.

==Creation of subcamps==
{{main article|Subcamp (SS)}}
Dachau was the first concentration camp (known as a "KZ") that [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] had built. It was already in existence in 1933 and developed into a prototype for subsequent concentration camps such as [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], which appeared in 1937. The concentration camp was not geographically restricted to [[Dachau]] itself. At the onset of war, the [[SS]] increasingly employed concentration camp prisoners in [[arms industry|armaments factories]] and these specific labor commands created a network of subcamps throughout Germany.  In some cases the prisoners were accommodated in diverse, makeshift sleeping areas; in other cases the SS had them erect their own camp with watchtowers and fences. Many such subcamps, called the ''KZ-Außenlager'', were laid out in similar fashion to the concentration camps. There were also SS camp commanders (''SS-Lagerführer'') and [[prisoner functionaries]] such as the "camp senior" (''Lagerältester'') or "block senior" (''Blockältester'').&lt;ref&gt;Stanislav Zámečník: ''Das war Dachau''. Luxemburg, 2002, {{ISBN|2-87996-948-4}}. p. 150, and p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1927 and 1945, Agfa was the principal photographic equipment producer, and the largest photographic manufacturer in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Sachsse, ''AGFA'', &lt;u&gt;Encyclopedia of 19th Century Photography&lt;/u&gt;, John Hannavy (ed). Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|9781135873264}} p 20.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941, Agfa Camera works produced exclusively for the [[Wehrmacht]] and employed a growing number of prisoners from Dachau.&lt;ref&gt;Silke Fengler, [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45872 Agfa AG], in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, version 19.12.2011.  Accessed 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely they were returned to the main camp in the evenings during the first years, and the subcamp in München-Giesing, where the laborers&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The mean population was 500. See Pierre Moulin, '' American Samurais&amp;mdash; WWII Camps: From USA Concentration Camps to the Nazi Death Camps in Europe'', AuthorHouse, 2012, {{ISBN|9781477213353}} p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  assembled timing devices, was not established until September 1944.

==Prisoners==
About five hundred prisoners from Eastern and Southeastern Europe, mainly Poland, arrived from [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] on 13 September 1944. Little is known about the Polish women except that many of them were taken as slave labor in reprisal for the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. [[Ludwig Eiber]] mentions a forty-year old Polish women who died on 7 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Eiber, L. (1996). ''KZ-Außenlager in München''&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1944, after a Christmas party, two of these prisoners escaped, dressed as Josef and Maria in some borrowed clothing.&lt;ref&gt;Jack van Ommen, ''The Mastmaker's Daughters,'' [http://www.themastmakersdaughters.us/ ''Christmas in Dachau'']. Accessed 17 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an unconfirmed account of Leni Leuvenberg, twenty Polish women were killed during a bombing on 25 February 1945.

In October 1944, 250 Polish prisoners were sent back to Ravensbrück, in exchange for 193 Dutch women, ten women from other West European countries and fifty women from Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Among the latter were twenty-one [[Slovenia]]n political prisoners, mostly (communist) [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. The Dutch women arrived on October 15, 1944 from Ravensbrück where they had arrived in September from the Dutch [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|concentration camp Vught]]. Most had been active in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] and had formed bonds already in Vught. They were a cohesive, supportive group; they marched singing into the [[cattle cars]] in Vught and walked singing into Ravensbrück concentration camp.

Out of the 193 Dutch women, ''only'' two died just before the war's end. In comparison, a third of the Dutch women that stayed behind in Ravensbrück did not survive.

==Prison life==
Very little has been published and most facts were collected from written memoirs and oral testimony of the Dutch survivors.&lt;ref&gt;For his book ''The Mastmakers' Daughters'' Jack van Ommen relied mainly on the unpublished memoirs of Tiny (Ettina) van Delft-Boosman, Kiky Heinsius and his mother Renny van Ommen-de Vries.&lt;/ref&gt; [[:de:Ella Lingens-Reiner|Ella Lingens]] spent a few months as a prisoner-doctor in the camp dispensary, from December 1944. Her book ''Gefangene der Angst'' was published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Lingens, Ella. ''Gefangene der Angst, ein Leben im Zeichen des Widerstandes'', Deuticke Verlag, 2003, {{ISBN|3216307123}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is critical of the Dutch prisoners and calls them naive. Her views became a thorny issue with the Dutch ex-prisoners, in the long drawn-out compensation claims against [[IG Farben]]. French prisoner [[:fr:Marie Bartette|Marie Bartette]] published her memoirs in the ''Journal d’Arcachon'' in 1946-1947.&lt;ref name=Bartette&gt;Marie Bartette [https://web.archive.org/web/20160701202526/http://shaa.fr/pb/?p=649 ''Les étapes d’une déportée'', Société historique et archéologique d'Arcachon et du Pays de Buch], 27 June 2014. Accessed 25 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, 2015, the stories of a number of Dutch Dachau political prisoners were published as ''Geen nummers maar namen''. The publication contains input for Renny van Ommen-de Vries, Kiky Heinsius and Loes Bueninck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verzetsmuseum.org/museum/nl/exposities/expositie-geen-nummers-maar-namen/publicatie Verzetsmuseum: ''Names instead of Numbers''] en [http://gedaechtnisbuch.de/namen-statt-nummern/english/index-engl.html ''Dachau Memorial Museum initiative'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The women were housed in an apartment block in München-Giesing. Part of the apartment had been bombed out before it was completed. The complex was surrounded by a high barbed wire fence with watch towers on the four corners. In the center court of the U-shaped building stood a wooden barrack mess hall. Six or seven prisoners slept in each small room. [[Reveille]] was at 0500 hours. The prisoners were counted, and marched to the Agfa factory. They returned to the subcamp compound at 1700 hours.

Religious meetings that had been held in Vught continued in secrecy in Dachau. One of the Dutch prisoners, ''Blockälteste'' Rennie van Ommen-de Vries, recalls the strength they obtained in these encounters in her biography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.TheMastmakersDaughters.us ''The Mastmakers' Daughters'']&lt;/ref&gt; Since the women were not under guard in their rooms, they held regular devotions and produced their own song books. They translated parts of the [[Old Testament]] from a German Bible that was lent to them by a civilian factory worker.

==The Strike==
In January, 1945 the {{convert|14|mi|km|0|adj=on|sp=us}} road from the main camp in Dachau had become impassable as a result of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings. The meals now became the responsibility of the Agfa management. The soup deteriorated by the day, and few women were spared digestive problems and complications from undernourishment. Disease was rampant: there were outbreaks of [[typhoid fever]], [[scarlet fever]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Conditions at the main camp were no better; as the war drew to a close, Dachau became increasingly overcrowded with prisoners evacuated from other concentration camps.  Consequently, transfer from the Agfa subcamp to the main camp's dispensary was close to a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Bazyler, Frank M. Tuerkheimer, ''Forgotten Trials of the Holocaust,'' NYU Press, 2014, {{ISBN|9781479849932}}, pp. 77&amp;ndash;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the factory took over the distribution of the soup and started watering it down, while at the same time trying to raise the production quotas, the Dutch women spontaneously crossed their arms and stopped their work.&lt;ref name=Bartette /&gt; The Slovenian women joined the protest. Strikes were unheard of in the concentration camps, so this would lead to severe punishments. In the end the women made their point that they just could not work under the conditions of a starvation diet and constant bombing raids. The chief [[Gestapo]] agent Willy Bach&lt;ref&gt;Bavarian Historical Society, [http://www.hdbg.de/dachau/pdfs/13/13_02/13_02_01.PDF ''Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte: Dachau Trials''].&lt;/ref&gt; came down from the headquarters in Dachau and tried to find the instigators, but no one came forward. In the end, Mary Vaders, who had arrived from Ravensbrück on October 15, 1944,&lt;ref&gt;"Miscellaneous Lists and Registers of German Concentration Camp Inmates, "Originated or Collected by the International Tracing Service.

The remaining Dutch and Slovenian women were punished with hours standing in formation in the court yard.

==The Liberation==
[[File:Gruenwald 2 BW.jpg|300px|thumb|Munich Airport: going home from Munich, pilot Lt. Col. Jay Vessels, Nel Niemantsverdriet and Rennie van Ommen-de Vries]]
[[File:Gruenwald14 BW.jpg|300px|thumb|Grünwald: Nel Niemantsverdriet, Harry Cowe, Rennie van Ommen-de Vries, Sgt. Nathan Asch]]
As the war drew to a close and American personnel began to encircle the region, production at the factory  halted on 23 April 1945. The Allied bombings and the advance of the Allied forces had cut off the supplies of raw material and distribution of the products. The camp commander was ordered to evacuate the prisoners and begin their [[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]] in a southerly direction.&lt;ref name=Stirnweistrial/&gt; The women were given a small sausage and a piece of bread for the journey, with their standard bowl of soup for their previous evening meal. Against his [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-superiors' orders, Stirnweis halted the march on 28 April just outside the town of Wolfratshausen and further persuaded a farmer named Walser to shelter the five hundred remaining prisoners in his hayloft. Despite specific orders to the contrary, he did not resume the march, but let the women shelter in place until the American troops drew closer.

On 1 May 1945 Stirnweis surrendered to the [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] of the US Army and asked for protection of the prisoners. After about a week on the farm, being fed by the generous Walser couple the women were relocated nearby, in the abandoned labor camp [[Föhrenwald]].  This was the largest and longest-lived [[Displaced persons camp|resettlement]] camp in post-war Europe. From Föhrenwald, the women were repatriated by the [[International Red Cross|Red Cross]].

===Trial of camp commander===
Initially, and based on cursory evidence, Stirnweis was accused of participating in cruelties and criminal usage of prisoners of war and civilians and sentenced to two years of labor after the war. However, the testimony of many of the women revealed no evidence of atrocities committed at the work detail at Agfa Camera works. According to former prisoners' testimony, sub-camp commander Lieutenant Kurt Konrad Stirnweis was a reasonable man. His sentence was abrogated upon the testimony of his former charges.&lt;ref name=Stirnweistrial/&gt;

His deputy, a 29-year-old [[Latvians|Latvian]] named Alexander Djerin,&lt;ref name=djerintrial&gt;Deputy Judge Advocate's Office, War Crimes Group European Command, United States v. Ludwig Philip Carl, et al. Case No. 000-50-2-46. [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/dachautrial/d48.pdf Dachau trial: Alexander Djerin] (22 July 1947, found on [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ Jewish Virtual Library], Accessed 15 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; was sentenced to six years imprisonment for his cruel treatment of the prisoners, commencing 9 May 1945. Although there was no suggestion in the trial records that Sergeant Djerin had mistreated the women, he was convicted of mistreatment of prisoners during his work at Dachau.

==The US War Press in Dachau==

In April 1945, a group of twenty-two [[war correspondent]]s was quartered in a villa on the [[Isar]] river in [[Grünwald, Bavaria|Grünwald]], another Munich suburb. Just before the women prisoners were transferred from the Walser farm to Föhrenwald, two of the men came looking for women to help in their kitchen. Rennie van Ommen-de Vries and Nel Niemantsverdriet accepted their offer.

Most of the correspondents had come up together from [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] through Italy. War correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]] and cartoonist [[Bill Mauldin]] often were among them. Their job was to document the atrocities of Dachau and to accompany government [[Very Important Person|VIPs]] and several Hollywood executives. One of the latter was film director [[William Wyler]].

The press was under the command of Colonel Max Boyd, his next in command was Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Jay R. Vessels (Minneapolis, Mn.), Air Corps Public Relations Officer. Claude Farmer was the driver and Don Jordan the cook. The journalists included [[Sholem Asch]]'s son, Nathan Asch; [[Associated Press|AP]] reporter working at the [[Seattle Times]] Harry Cowe;&lt;ref&gt;Rennie van Ommen's son Jack, who lives in the US, met Harry Cowe in Seattle in 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Charley Green (from St. Paul, Mn.); Art Everett (from Bay City, Mi.); and Paul Zimmer (from Oakland, Ca.).

'''Antonio Pigafetta''' ({{IPA-it|anˈtɔːnjo piɡaˈfetta|lang}}; c. 1491 – c. 1531) was an Italian scholar and explorer from the [[Republic of Venice]]. He traveled with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and his crew by order of the King [[Charles I of Spain]] on their [[Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation|voyage around the world]]. During the expedition, he served as Magellan's assistant and kept an accurate journal which later assisted him in translating the [[Cebuano language]].  It is the first recorded document concerning the language.

Pigafetta was one of the 18 men who returned to [[Spain]] in 1522, out of the approximately 240 who set out three years earlier. The voyage completed the first [[circumnavigation]] of the world; [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] had served as captain after Magellan's death during the voyage in 1521 in the [[Philippines]]. Pigafetta's surviving journal is the source for much of what is known about Magellan and Elcano's voyage.

At least one warship of the [[Italian Royal Navy|Italian Navy]], a [[destroyer]] of the [[Navigatori class destroyer|''Navigatori'' class]], was named after him in 1931.

==Youth==
Pigafetta belonged to a rich family city of [[Vicenza]] in northeast Italy. In his youth he studied [[astronomy]], [[geography]] and [[cartography]]. He then served on board the ships of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knighters of Rhodes]] at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1519, he accompanied the [[papal nuncio]], Monsignor [[Francesco Chieregati]], to Spain.

==Voyage around the world==

[[File:NaoVictoria.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Museo Nao Victoria|Nao Victoria]], Magellan's boat Replica in Punta Arenas]]

In [[Seville]], Pigafetta heard of Magellan's [[Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|planned expedition]] and decided to join, accepting the title of [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] (''sobresaliente''), and a modest salary of 1,000 [[maravedí]]s.&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;{{cite book | last = Quanchi | first = Max|authorlink=| year = 2005 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands | publisher = [[The Scarecrow Press]]  | location =  | page=207|isbn = 0810853957}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the voyage, which started in August 1519, Pigafetta collected extensive data concerning the [[geography]], [[climate]], [[flora]], [[fauna]] and the native inhabitants of the places that the expedition visited. His meticulous notes proved invaluable to future [[explorer]]s and [[cartographer]]s, mainly due to his inclusion of nautical and linguistic data, and also to latter-day [[historian]]s because of its vivid, detailed style. The only other sailor to maintain a journal during the voyage was Francisco Albo, ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'s'' last [[Maritime pilot|pilot]], who kept a formal [[logbook]].

==Return==
[[File:Vicenza-Palazzo Pigafetta.jpg|thumb|Casa Pigafetta, his palace in [[Vicenza]].]]

Pigafetta was wounded on [[Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], where Magellan was killed in the [[Battle of Mactan]] in April 1521 by the local ruler [[Lapu-Lapu]]. Nevertheless, he recovered and was among the 18 who accompanied [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] on board the ''Victoria'' on the return voyage to Spain.

Upon reaching port in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] in the modern [[Cádiz (province)|Province of Cadiz]] in September 1522, three years after his departure, Pigafetta returned to the Republic of Venice. He related his experiences in the "Report on the First Voyage Around the World" ({{lang-it|Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo}}), which was composed in [[Italian language|Italian]] and was distributed to European monarchs in handwritten form before it was eventually published by Italian historian [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]] in 1550–59. The account centers on the events in the [[Mariana Islands]] and the [[Philippines]], although it included several maps of other areas as well, including the first known use of the word "Pacific Ocean" (''Oceano Pacifico'') on a map.&lt;ref name=Quanchi/&gt; The original document was not preserved.

However, it was not through Pigafetta's writings that Europeans first learned of the circumnavigation of the globe. Rather, it was through an account written by a [[Flanders]]-based writer [[Maximilianus Transylvanus]], which was published in 1523. Transylvanus had been instructed to interview some of the survivors of the voyage when Magellan's surviving ship ''Victoria'' returned to Spain in September 1522 under the command of [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]]. After Magellan and Elcano's voyage, Pigafetta utilized the connections he had made prior to the voyage with the [[Knights of Rhodes]] to achieve membership in the order

The '''Aquanator''' is a small-scale [[Tidal power|tidal-power device]], a device which uses rows of [[hydrofoil]]s to generate [[electricity]] from [[current (water)|water currents]].  It was invented by Australian inventor Michael Perry.

==History==
The Aquanator invention was announced in 2004. A contract to test the device was signed with [[Essential Energy|Country Energy]] on 26 September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energybulletin.net/node/2273&lt;/ref&gt;

Its test site was located at {{Coord|38.5163|S|145.3648|E|display=inline}}. In beginning of 2006 it was connected to grid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rechargenews.com/hardcopy/article193733.ece&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the device test site was decommissioned in May 2008 by its owner Atlantis Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantisresourcescorporation.com/about-atlantis/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027031725/http://atlantisresourcescorporation.com/about-atlantis/history.html |archivedate=27 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Atlantis Resources Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The Aquanator used ocean current to produce electricity.  It was intended to generate power even with a small flow of 1.5 knots.&lt;ref&gt;http://96.0.107.6/?q=node/view/1035&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--is there a tag for 'this link is an IP address and should be replaced'?--&gt; The test device had a capacity of 5&amp;nbsp;kW. The aquanator’s slow moving hydrofoil design was meant to provide a green energy source which would not harm ocean life as faster moving turbines might.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandarchitecture.com.au/1/smart_files/Issue_2_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102258/http://www.brandarchitecture.com.au/1/smart_files/Issue_2_final.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
The aquanator was meant to be cheaper than diesel fuels, with costs about the same amount as wind power and will be one sixth the price of diesel-powered systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/26/1096137100758.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration of mostly carbon-based greenhouse gases has increased dramatically since the onset of the [[Industrialisation|industrial era]].

Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the more potent greenhouse gases and is mainly produced by the digestion or decay of biological organisms. It is considered the second most important greenhouse gas,&lt;ref name=Forster2007/&gt; yet the methane cycle in the atmosphere is currently only poorly understood.&lt;ref name=Prather2001&gt;{{Citation

Large stores of methane can be found in the form of [[Methane clathrate|methane ice]] under permafrost and on continental shelves. Additional methane is produced by the [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic decay]] of organic material and is produced in organisms' digestive tracts, soil, etc. Natural methane production accounts 10-30% of global methane sources.&lt;ref name=Keppler2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keppler | first1 = F. | last2 = Hamilton | first2 = J.

Anthropogenic methane is produced in various ways, e.g. by raising cattle or through the decay of trash in landfills. It is also produced by several industrial sources, including the mining and distribution of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=Prather2001/&gt; More than 70% of atmospheric methane comes from [[biogenic]] sources.

It has an atmospheric lifetime of about eight years.&lt;ref name=Center2011/&gt; This keeps the concentration of methane in the atmosphere relatively low and is the reason that it currently plays a secondary role in the greenhouse effect to carbon dioxide, despite the fact that it produces a much more powerful greenhouse effect per volume.&lt;ref name=Prather2001/&gt;

===Carbon dioxide===
{{main|Atmospheric carbon dioxide}}
Carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) has a large warming effect on global temperatures through the [[greenhouse effect]]. Although individual CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules have a short [[residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] in the atmosphere, it takes an extremely long time for carbon dioxide levels to sink after sudden rises, due to e.g. volcanic eruptions or human activity&lt;ref name=Inman2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Inman | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1038/climate.2008.122 | title = Carbon is forever | journal = Nature Reports Climate Change | issue = 812 | pages = 156 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and among the many long-lasting greenhouse gases, it is the most important because it makes up the largest fraction of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Forster2007/&gt;
Since the [[industrial revolution]], the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere has risen from about 280 ppm to almost 400 ppm.&lt;ref name=NOAA_Observations/&gt; Although the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; introduced makes up only a small portion of the global carbon cycle, carbon dioxide's long residence time makes these emissions relevant for the total carbon balance. The increased carbon dioxide concentration strengthens the greenhouse effect, causing changes to the global [[climate]]. Of the increased amounts of carbon dioxide that are introduced to the atmosphere each year, approximately 80% are from the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production. The other ~20% originate from land use change and deforestation.&lt;ref name=Denman2007&gt;{{Citation

==Interactions with other systems==
{{Main|Carbon cycle}}
[[File:Carbon cycle - Main components.png|thumb|alt=Carbon reservoirs and flows|Major global carbon reservoirs and flows between them.&lt;ref name='Prentice2001'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The carbon cycle and atmospheric carbon dioxide | journal = Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

Atmospheric carbon is exchanged quickly between the oceans and the terrestrial biosphere. This means that at times the atmosphere acts as a sink, and at other times as a source of carbon.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt; The following section introduces exchanges between the atmospheric and other components of the global carbon cycle.

===Terrestrial biosphere===
{{main|Terrestrial biological carbon cycle}}
Carbon is exchanged with varying speed with the terrestrial biosphere. It is absorbed in the form of carbon dioxide by [[autotrophs]] and converted into [[organic compound]]s. Carbon is also released from the biosphere into the atmosphere in the course of biological processes. [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|Aerobic respiration]] converts organic carbon into carbon dioxide and a particular type of [[anaerobic respiration]] converts it into methane. After respiration, both carbon dioxide and methane are typically emitted into the atmosphere. Organic carbon is also released into the atmosphere during burning.&lt;ref name='Prentice2001'/&gt;

The residence time of carbon in the terrestrial biosphere varies and is dependent on a large number of factors. The uptake of carbon into the biosphere occurs on various time scales. Carbon is absorbed primarily during plant growth. A pattern of increased carbon uptake is observable both over the course of the day (less carbon is absorbed at night) and over the course of the year (less carbon is absorbed in winter).&lt;ref name=Forster2007/&gt; While organic matter in animals generally decays quickly, releasing much of its carbon into the atmosphere through respiration, carbon stored as dead plant matter can stay in the biosphere for as much as a decade or more. Different plant types of plant matter decay at different rates - for example, woody substances retain their carbon longer than soft, leafy material.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Active carbon in soils can stay sequestered for up to a thousand years, while [[Black carbon|inert carbon]] in soils can stay sequestered for more than a millennium.&lt;ref name='Prentice2001'/&gt;

===Oceans===
{{main|Oceanic carbon cycle}}
Large amounts of carbon are exchanged each year between the ocean and the atmosphere. A major controlling factor in oceanic-atmospheric carbon exchange is [[thermohaline circulation]]. In regions of ocean upwelling, carbon rich water from the deep ocean comes to the surface and releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Large amounts of carbon dioxide are dissolved in cold water in higher latitudes. This water sinks down and brings the carbon into the deeper ocean levels, where it can stay for anywhere between decades and several centuries.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt; Ocean circulation events cause this process to be variable. For example, during [[El Nino]] events there is less deep ocean upwelling, leading to lower outgasing of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Denman2007/&gt;

Biological processes also lead to ocean-atmosphere carbon exchange. Carbon dioxide equilibriates between the atmosphere and the ocean's surface layers. As [[autotroph]]s add or subtract carbon dioxide from the water through [[photosynthesis]] or [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], they modify this balance, allowing the water to absorb more carbon dioxide or causing it to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;

===Geosphere===
Carbon is generally exchanged very slowly between the atmosphere and geosphere. Two exceptions are [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]] and the combustion of [[fossil fuels]], both of which release high amounts carbon into the atmosphere very quickly.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Fresh [[Silicate minerals|silicate rock]] that is exposed through geological processes absorbs carbon from the atmosphere when it is exposed to air by the processes of [[weathering]] and [[erosion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Anthropogenic sources===
Human activities change the amount of carbon in the atmosphere directly through the burning of fossil fuels and other organic material, thus [[Oxidation|oxidizing]] the organic carbon and producing carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=VanDerWerf2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Der Werf | first1 = G. R. | last2 = Randerson | first2 = J. T. | last3 = Collatz | first3 = G. J. | last4 = Giglio | first4 = L. | last5 = Kasibhatla | first5 = P. S. | last6 = Arellano Jr | first6 = A.

O. | last2 = Merlet | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1029/2000GB001382 | title = Emission of trace gases and aerosols from biomass burning | journal = Global Biogeochemical Cycles | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 955 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2001GBioC..15..955A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another human-caused source of carbon dioxide is [[cement]] production. The burning of fossil fuels and cement production are the main reasons for the increase in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since the beginning of the industrial era.&lt;ref name=Forster2007/&gt;

Other human-caused changes in the atmospheric carbon cycle are due to anthropogenic changes to carbon reservoirs. Deforestation, for example, decreases the biosphere's ability to absorb carbon, thus increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Houghton2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Houghton | first1 = R. A. | title = Revised estimates of the annual net flux of carbon to the atmosphere from changes in land use and land management 1850-2000 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0889.2003.01450.x | journal = Tellus B | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 378 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 2003TellB..55..378H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the industrial use of carbon by humans is a very new dynamic on a geologic scale, it is important to be able to track sources and sinks of carbon in the atmosphere. One way of doing so is by observing the proportion of stable carbon [[isotope]]s present in the atmosphere. The two main carbon isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C. Plants absorb the lighter isotope, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, more readily than &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name=Nakazawa1997&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nakazawa | first1 = T. | last2 = Morimoto | first2 = S. | last3 = Aoki | first3 = S. | last4 = Tanaka | first4 = M. | title = Temporal and spatial variations of the carbon isotopic ratio of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the western Pacific region | doi = 10.1029/96JD02720 | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 102 | pages = 1271 | year = 1997 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1997JGR...102.1271N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because fossil fuels originate mainly from plant matter, the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio in the atmosphere falls when large amounts of fossil fuels are burned, releasing &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C. Conversely, an increase in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C in the atmosphere suggests a higher biospheric carbon uptake.&lt;ref name='Prentice2001'/&gt; The ratio of the annual increase in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compared to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from fossil fuel and cement manufactured is called the "airborne fraction.".&lt;ref name=Keeling_etal1995&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keeling | first1 = C. D. | last2 = Whorf | first2 = T. P. | last3 = Wahlen | first3 = M. | last4 = Van Der Plichtt | first4 = J. | title = Interannual extremes in the rate of rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1980 | doi = 10.1038/375666a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 375 | issue = 6533 | pages = 666 | year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1995Natur.375..666K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The airborne fraction has been around 60% since the 1950s, indicating that about 60% of the new carbon dioxide in the atmosphere each year originated from human sources.&lt;ref name=Forster2007/&gt; For clarity, this is not meant to suggest that 60% of the uptake of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere comes from human activity. It means that the atmosphere exchanges around 210 giga-tonnes of carbon annually, but absorbs between 6 and 10 giga-tonnes more than it loses. Of this net gain, about 60% is attributable to the burning of fossil fuels.

'''Bioavailability''', in environmental and [[soil science]]s, represents the amount of an element or compound that is accessible to an organism for uptake or [[adsorption]] across its [[cellular membrane]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). 1998. Standard guide for conducting laboratory soil toxicity or bioaccumulation test with the lumbricid earthworm ''Eisenia foetida''. E 1676-97. Philadelphia, PA: ASTM.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Casarett, &amp; Doull. 2001. Toxicology. ''The Basic Science of Poisons'', Sixth Edition. C. D. Klaassen (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Semple, K. T., Doick, K. J., Jones, K. C., Burauel, P., Craven, A., &amp; Harms, H. 2004. Peer reviewed: defining bioavailability and bioaccessibility of contaminated soil and sediment is complicated. ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology'', 38(12), 228A-231A. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In environmental and agricultural applications, bioavailability most often refers to availability of [[contaminant]]s, such as [[Organic compound|organic pollutant]]s or [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]]s, in soil systems and is also used frequently in determining potential risk of land application of [[sewage sludge]] or other inorganic/organic waste materials.

Almost exclusively, [[plant root]]s and [[soil organism]]s uptake contaminants that are dissolved in water. Therefore, the bioavailable fraction is often likened to the dissolved (aqueous) fraction in these systems. Depending on its chemical properties, a contaminant may or may not be found in the [[aqueous phase]]. Organic contaminants may become sorbed or sequestered in organic matter through weak [[Van der Waals interactions]] or through [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen]]- or [[Covalent bond|covalent]] bonding.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;National Research Council (US). 2003. Committee on Bioavailability of Contaminants in Soils and Sediments. ''Bioavailability of contaminants in soils and sediments: Processes, tools, and applications''. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Semple, K. T., Morris, A. W. J., &amp; Paton, G. I. 2003. Bioavailability of hydrophobic organic contaminants in soils: fundamental concepts and techniques for analysis. ''European journal of soil science'', 54(4), 809-818.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ionic compounds]], such as heavy metals, can be [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] into the solid phase.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Traina, S. J., &amp; Laperche, V. 1999. Contaminant bioavailability in soils, sediments, and aquatic environments. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 96 (7): 3365-3371.&lt;/ref&gt; Volatile compounds can be lost as [[aerosol]]s to the soil atmosphere. In these forms, contaminants are relatively inaccessible to microbial or plant uptake and must dissociate and re-dissolve into the soil solution to become biological available.

==Factors influencing soil bioavailability==  
Bioavailability is a function of soil properties, time, environmental conditions, and plant and microbial characteristics &lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Naidu, R. (ed). 2011. ''Chemical Bioavailability in Terrestrial Environments'' (Vol. 32). Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Soil properties, such as [[soil pH|pH]], [[ion exchange]] capacity, [[soil organic matter]] content, [[soil texture|texture]] and [[soil porosity|porosity]] influence bioavailability. Because soils with higher ion exchange and organic matter content offer more opportunities for [[adsorption]], typically they exhibit lower bioavailability.&lt;ref name= "five" /&gt;
* As the contact time between the contaminant and soil increases, a decrease in bioavailability is observed, termed “ageing”, due to diffusion and sorption processes with mineral and organic fractions of soil.&lt;ref name= "five" /&gt;  
* Environmental conditions influence bioavailability. Drought conditions result in lower [[Soil water|soil water content]]. This can reduce the access of plants and organisms to dissolved contaminants but also can enhance precipitation of salts from solution.

==Measuring bioavailability in soil ecosystems==
Site-specific characteristics have a major influence on contaminant bioavailability and no standardized tests have been developed.&lt;ref name= "seven" /&gt; However, there are a number of chemical and biological tests used to estimate bioavailability including a direct measurement of contaminant [[bioaccumulation]] in earthworms (''[[Eisenia fetida]]'').&lt;ref name= "one" /&gt; Estimates of bioavailability can also be obtained from chemical [[Solid phase extraction|solid-phase soil extractions]].&lt;ref name= "seven" /&gt;  [[Fugacity]] modelling of bioavailability is based on the [[solubility]] and partitioning of compounds into aqueous and non-aqueous phases.&lt;ref name= "eight"&gt;Mackay, D. and Fraser, A., 2000. Bioaccumulation of persistent organic chemicals: mechanisms and models. ''Environmental pollution'', 110(3), pp.375-391.&lt;/ref&gt; This model describes the tendency for contaminants to be dissolved in the soil solution.

'''Black Moshannon State Park''' is a {{convert|3481|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Rush Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania]], United States. It surrounds Black Moshannon Lake, formed by a [[dam]] on [[Black Moshannon Creek]], which has given its name to the lake and park. The park is just west of the [[Allegheny Front]], {{convert|9|mi}} east of [[Philipsburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania|Philipsburg]] on [[Pennsylvania Route 504]], and is largely surrounded by [[Moshannon State Forest]]. A [[bog]] in the park provides a habitat for diverse wildlife not common in other areas of the state, such as [[carnivorous plant]]s, orchids, and species normally found farther north. As home to the "[l]argest reconstituted bog/wetland complex in Pennsylvania".&lt;ref name="must see"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/index.htm | title = Find a Park: 25 Must-see Parks | accessdate = 2015-05-26 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have long used the Black Moshannon area for recreational, industrial, and subsistence purposes. The [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] tribe used it as hunting and fishing grounds.  European settlers cleared some land for farming, then [[clear-cutting|clear-cut]] the vast stands of [[old growth forest|old-growth]] White Pine and Eastern Hemlock to meet the needs of a growing nation during the late 19th century. Black Moshannon State Park rose from the ashes of a depleted forest that was largely destroyed by [[wildfire]] in the years following the lumber era. The forests were rehabilitated by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. Many of the buildings built by the Civilian Conservation Corps stand in the park today and are protected on the list of [[National Register of Historic Places]] in three [[Historic district (United States)|historic districts]].

Black Moshannon State Park is open year-round for recreation and has an extensive network of trails which allow [[hiking]], [[bicycling|biking]], and viewing the bog habitat at the Black Moshannon State Natural Area. The park is in Pennsylvania [[Important Bird Area]] #33, where [[bird watching|bird watchers]] have recorded 175&amp;nbsp;different species. It is also home to many rare and unusual plants and animals, due to its location atop the [[Allegheny Plateau]]; the lake is at an elevation of about {{convert|1900|ft}}. Much of the park is open for [[hunting]] and the lake and creek are open for [[fishing]], [[boating]], and [[human swimming|swimming]]. In winter it is a popular destination for [[cross-country skiing]], and was home to a small downhill [[skiing]] area from 1965&amp;nbsp;to 1982. [[Picnic]]s and [[camping]] are also popular, and the "Friends of Black Moshannon State Park" group promotes the park and all of the recreational activities associated with it.

===Native Americans===
[[Image:Black Moshannon State Park Map.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Black Moshannon State Park, Lake, and Creek]]
Humans have lived in what is now Pennsylvania since at least 10,000 BC.

After this, the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois.&lt;ref name = "indians"/&gt; The Iroquois lived in long houses, primarily in what is now [[New York (state)|New York]], and had a strong [[confederation|confederacy]] which gave them power beyond their numbers.&lt;ref name = "indians"/&gt; To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the [[Lenape]] (or Delaware).&lt;ref name = "indians"/&gt;

The [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], members of the Iroquois Confederacy, were inhabitants in the area of Black Moshannon Lake, which was a series of [[beaver]] ponds at the time. They and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], including the Lenape, hunted, fished, and traded in the region.&lt;ref name="bmsphistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indians"/&gt; The [[Great Shamokin Path]], the major native east–west path connecting the Susquehanna and [[Allegheny River]] basins, crossed Black Moshannon Creek at a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] a few miles downstream from the park; however, no trails of the indigenous peoples are recorded as having passed through the park itself.&lt;ref name="path"/&gt; The park's {{convert|1|mi|adj=on}} Indian Trail for hiking and cross-country skiing recalls such native paths as it runs through an open forest of [[oak]] and [[pine]] trees, with occasional clearings and a grove of [[Crataegus|hawthorns]].&lt;ref name="sierraclub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmsptrails"/&gt;

===Lumber era===
[[Image:Black Moshannon SP Beach House 3.jpg|thumb|right|The CCC-built beachhouse on the shores of Black Moshannon Lake near the bridge, where Antes Tavern and village were once located.]]
Prior to the arrival of [[William Penn]] and his [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] [[Province of Pennsylvania|colonists]] in 1682, it has been estimated that up to 90&amp;nbsp;percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods: over {{convert|31000|sqmi}} of [[eastern white pine|white pine]], [[Tsuga canadensis|eastern hemlock]], and a mix of [[hardwood]]s.&lt;ref name="timber"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lumbermuseum.org/history.html |title = The Pennsylvania Lumber Museum - History |accessdate = 2008-04-20 |publisher = Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forests near the three original counties, [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]], and [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], were the first to be harvested, as the early settlers used the readily available timber to build homes, barns, and ships, and cleared the land for agriculture. The demand for lumber slowly increased and by the time of the [[American Revolution]] the lumber industry had reached the interior and mountainous regions of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="timber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taber"/&gt;

Lumber became one of the leading industries in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="timber"/&gt; Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, [[tannin]] for the many [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and [[barrel]] making. Large areas of forest were harvested by [[Charcoal maker|colliers]] to fire [[bloomery|iron furnaces]]. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first [[Conestoga wagon]]s.&lt;ref name="timber"/&gt; The Philadelphia&amp;ndash;Erie Pike (present day [[Pennsylvania Route 504]]) opened the Black Moshannon area to [[settler]]s by 1821. The first settlers opened the Antes [[Tavern]] along the Pike, trapped fur-bearing animals, and cleared land for farming.&lt;ref name="bmsphistory"/&gt;

By the mid-19th century, the demand for lumber reached the area, where eastern white pine and eastern hemlock covered the surrounding mountainsides. Lumbermen came and harvested the trees and sent them down [[Black Moshannon Creek|Black Moshannon]] and Moshannon Creeks to the West Branch Susquehanna River, then along that to the [[Susquehanna Boom]] and [[sawmill]]s at [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]].&lt;ref name="bmsphistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taber"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taber III |first= Thomas T. |title= Williamsport Lumber Capital |year= 1995 |edition= 1st |publisher= Paulhamus Litho, Inc. |location= [[Montoursville, Pennsylvania]] |chapter= Chapter Two: The Boom — Making It All Possible |page= 88 | oclc = 35920715 }} &lt;br&gt;''Note: For a general overview of lumber history in the West Branch Susquehanna watershed, see'' {{Cite book

[[Image:Black Moshannon State Park Antes School 2.jpg|thumb|The Moshannon School served Antes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and closed in 1926. It is the only building from the lumber era left in the park.]]
The Beaver Mill Lumber Company became one of the largest single lumber operations in all of Pennsylvania, and four lumber [[boomtown]]s, Beaver Mills, Star Mill, Underwood Mills, and Antes, altered the landscape in the Black Moshannon area.&lt;ref name="ABCs"/&gt; A dam was built at the site of an old beaver dam,&lt;ref name="dayuse"/&gt; and the mill ponds for the lumber mills flooded the old beaver ponds. The communities featured [[general store]]s, [[blacksmith]] shops, [[livery stable|liveries]], taverns, schools, and even a [[ten-pin bowling]] alley. The area helped to meet the nation's need for timber in mining operations, construction, and [[railroad]]s.&lt;ref name="bmsphistory"/&gt;

A number of trails in the park today recall this time. The {{convert|0.8|mi|adj=on}} Seneca Trail for cross-country skiing and hiking passes through a [[Secondary forest|second growth forest]] of oak and cherry trees that shade the stumps of the [[old-growth forest|old growth pines]] harvested during the lumber era.&lt;ref name="sierraclub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmsptrails"/&gt; The Shingle Mill Trail {{convert|4|mi|adj=on}} begins at the main parking area near the dam on Black Moshannon Lake and follows the banks of Black Moshannon Creek to the Allegheny Front Trail for approximately 2 miles.&lt;ref name = "hike pa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmsptrails"/&gt; The remains of Star Mill, a sawmill built in 1879&amp;nbsp;that operated until the end of the lumber era, are on the {{convert|2|mi|adj=on}} Star Mill Trail. This loop trail for hiking and cross-country skiing is nearly flat, with a view of Black Moshannon Lake.&lt;ref name="bmsptrails"/&gt;

This boom era was not to last; before long the lumber was gone, and once the trees were all clear-cut, the loggers left the area. The lumbermen left behind a barren landscape that was devastated by erosion and wildfires. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] bought thousands of acres of deforested and burned land, then began the project of reforestation. By the 1930s, the land that became Black Moshannon State Park was already a place for picnics and camping, on the aptly named "Tent Hill", and people swam and fished in the old mill pond.&lt;ref name="bmsphistory"/&gt; The {{convert|0.5|mi|m|adj=on}} Tent Hill Trail still runs from the campsites to the Black Moshannon Lake.&lt;ref name = "hike pa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmsptrails"/&gt;

===Civilian Conservation Corps===
[[Image:CCC Company 359 Dam crop.PNG|thumb|right|Men of CCC Company 359&amp;nbsp;working on the dam in Black Moshannon State Park, c. 1936]]
The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) was a work relief program for young men from unemployed families, established in 1933. As part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation, it was designed to combat unemployment during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. The CCC operated in every [[U.S. state]].&lt;ref name="npsccc"&gt;{{Cite book|last=  Paige |first= John C.|title= The Civilian Conservation Corps and the National Park Service, 1933–1942: An Administrative History |url= http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/ccc/ccc1.htm |accessdate= April 20, 2008 |year= 1985 |publisher= U.S. National Park Service, Department of the Interior |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter= Chapter One: A Brief History of the Civilian Conservation Corps |oclc=12072830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original facilities at Black Moshannon State Park were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, from 1933&amp;nbsp;to 1937. The CCC created many jobs for unemployed industrial workers from throughout the United States. Black Moshannon State Park is the result of one of many projects undertaken by the CCC throughout central Pennsylvania. However, many people used the area for recreation as far back as the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="bmsphistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmspccc"&gt;{{cite web

They cut roads through the growing forest to aid in fighting the wildfires that sprang up, and planted many acres of [[Red Pine]]s as part of the reforestation effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/ccc/docs/134.pdf |format = PDF| title = History Company 359, S-71-Pa., Philipsburg, Pa. |year = 1936 | publisher = Civilian Conservation Corps | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the CCC-built park facilities are still in use today, including [[log cabins]], picnic pavilions, a food concession stand, and miles of trails. Early on, the CCC constructed a [[dam]] at Black Moshannon Lake, on the site of the former mill pond dam.&lt;ref name="bmsphistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dayuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmspccc"/&gt; CCC Camp S-71&amp;nbsp;closed in January 1937&amp;nbsp;and Black Moshannon State Park officially re-opened that same year.&lt;ref name="forrey"&gt;{{Cite book| title = History of Pennsylvania's State Parks | last = Forrey |first = William C. | year = 1984 |publisher = Bureau of State Parks, Office of Resources Management, Department of Environmental Resources, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |location = Harrisburg, Pennsylvania |oclc = 17824084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historic districts====
{{Main|Black Moshannon State Park Historic Districts}}
[[Image:Black Moshannon SP Historic Districts Map.png|right|thumb|300px|Map of Black Moshannon State Park with the outlines of the three historic districts shown in red]]

In 1987, three separate [[Historic district (United States)|historic districts]] incorporating the existing CCC structures in Black Moshannon State Park were placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/PA/Centre/districts.html | title = National Register of Historic Places - Pennsylvania (PA) - Centre County - Historic Districts | accessdate = 2008-03-29 | authorlink = [[National Register of Historic Places]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The structures in all three districts were built between 1933&amp;nbsp;and 1937&amp;nbsp;and are designated as part of either the Beach and Day Use, Family Cabin, or Maintenance Historic Districts.

Eighteen structures in the Beach and Day Use Historic District are protected as [[contributing property|contributing properties]], including seven "standard" pavilions, a larger picnic shelter, and three water pump shelters. These last were built of native stone and covered with pebbles, and have since been converted to small picnic pavilions. The concession building, beach bathhouse, and museum are also protected.&lt;ref name="dayuse"&gt;{{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H088870_01D.pdf}} | format = PDF| title = Black Moshannon State Park, Beach and Day Use District | accessdate = 2010-09-15 | publisher = Pennsylvania Cultural Resources Geographic Information System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Family Cabin Historic District consists of 16&amp;nbsp;contributing properties: 13&amp;nbsp;log cabins, one lodge, and two latrines. Cabins 1&amp;ndash;12, half with one room and half with two, are in a line along a road, similar to 1930s [[motel|motor courts]]. The cabin layout at Black Moshannon State Park is unique compared to CCC-built cabins at other Pennsylvania state parks.&lt;ref name="cabins"/&gt; The cabins at the other parks reflect the "rustic" style of cabin layout promoted by the [[National Park Service]]. The Lodge, also known as Cabin 13, is a large rectangular [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]]-sided building with a stone fireplace, while Cabin 14&amp;nbsp;is L-shaped with an open porch.

The Maintenance Historic District includes four CCC-built structures.&lt;ref name="maintenance"&gt;{{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H088872_01D.pdf}} |format = PDF| title = Black Moshannon State Park, Maintenance District | accessdate = 2010-09-15 | publisher = Pennsylvania Cultural Resources Geographic Information System}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storage building is a wood-frame structure with a gable roof, similar to military storage buildings built in the 1930s and 1940s. A three-bay garage of standard military design is included in this historic district. The Park Manager's residence is a {{frac|1|1|2}}-story gable-roofed house, with modern [[Siding|vinyl siding]].&lt;ref name="maintenance"/&gt;

==Ecology==
Within Black Moshannon State Park there is a State Park Natural Area protecting the bogs.&lt;ref name="bmspwildlife"/&gt; The park itself is part of a much larger Important Bird Area, which includes most of the surrounding state forest, airport, and private properties.&lt;ref name="IBA33"/&gt;

===Bog Natural Area===
[[File:Black Moshannon State Park stumps.jpg|thumb|Stumps from the lumber era and lily pads in the bog natural area at Black Moshannon State Park]]
The bogs at the park contain large amounts of [[Sphagnum|sphagnum moss]]; this decomposes very slowly, causing layers of dead moss to build up at the bottom of the bog, creating [[peat]].&lt;ref name="bmspwildlife"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/blackmoshannon/index.htm| title = Black Moshannon State Park: Wildlife
| accessdate = 2006-10-28
| publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, {{convert|1592|acre}} of bog at the state park were protected as the "Black Moshannon Bog Natural Area";&lt;ref name="bmspwildlife"/&gt; this was originally conceived as part of the ''State Parks 2000'' strategic plan of the DCNR, and fourteen years later the total area of bog protected as a Natural Area had increased to {{convert|1992|acre}}.&lt;ref name="natural areas"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/natural/naturalareas.aspx| title = Natural Areas | accessdate=2008-03-29| publisher= [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most bogs exist in glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park is on the Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by [[glacier]]s during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. The bogs formed here because of the beds of sandstone that lie flat, a short distance below the surface of the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here.&lt;ref name="bmspwildlife"/&gt; The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include [[greater yellowlegs|greater]] and [[lesser yellowlegs]], [[least sandpiper]], [[solitary sandpiper]], and the [[spotted sandpiper]], which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.&lt;ref name="IBA33"/&gt;

The water in the bog is low in nutrients and high in acidity, which makes it difficult for most plants to live there. Only specialized plants can thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of [[orchid]]. Wild [[cranberry|cranberries]] and [[blueberry|blueberries]] grow in the bog along with [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s, [[Chamaedaphne|leatherleaf]] shrubs, [[Eriophorum callitrix|Arctic cotton grass]], and [[viburnum]]s. The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="bmspwildlife"/&gt;

The lake is home to [[American beaver]]s, as well as [[great blue heron]], [[swan]]s, [[snow goose|snow geese]], [[common loon]]s, and many other types of [[waterfowl]], with [[Canada goose]], [[ring-necked duck]], [[mallard]], and [[wood duck]] the most commonly seen. The bogs, marshes, and swamps contain [[frog]]s and [[salamander]]s, and provide a habitat for [[carnivorous plants]] like the [[pitcher plant]] and [[sundew]]. Black Moshannon State Park is home to many common species of [[songbird]]s, including [[ovenbird]]s.&lt;ref name = "IBA33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmspwildlife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="audubon"/&gt;

The [[Pinophyta|conifer]] and mixed-forests of the park and its surroundings provide habitats for [[northern saw-whet owl]], [[blue-headed vireo]], [[hermit thrush]], [[dark-eyed junco]], and [[magnolia warbler|magnolia]], [[pine warbler|pine]], [[yellow-rumped warbler|yellow-rumped]], [[Blackburnian warbler|Blackburnian]], and [[black-throated green warbler]]s. The [[deciduous]] forests provide habitats for songbirds, such as [[scarlet tanager]] and [[red-eyed vireo]].&lt;ref name="IBA33"/&gt;

An outbreak of the non-native [[gypsy moth]] in the mid-1980s nearly devastated the woods in a small valley. Selective timber cuts harvested the trees that were affected by species of moth. Today the {{convert|1.6|mi|adj=on}} Sleepy Hollow Trail for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing loops through the new growth in the area, which provides an ideal habitat for populations of white-tailed deer and wild turkey.&lt;ref name="sierraclub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmsptrails"/&gt;

====Important Bird Area====
Pennsylvania Important Bird Area #33&amp;nbsp;encompasses {{convert|45667|acre}}. The land includes parts of the state park and surrounding Moshannon State Forest, as well as [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]] No. 33, Mid-State Regional Airport (which borders both the park and forest), and some other nearby parcels of private land. The Pennsylvania [[Audubon Society]] has designated {{convert|3374|acre}} of Black Moshannon State Park as an IBA, which is an area designated as a globally important [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for the conservation of bird populations.&lt;ref name="IBA33"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pa.audubon.org/IBA_Consplans/IBA33.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pennsylvania Important Bird Area #33 |author1=Michelle Cohen |author2=Stephen Goin |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 2004 |accessdate=2008-03-13 |publisher=Pennsylvania Audubon Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225142800/http://pa.audubon.org/IBA_Consplans/IBA33.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Black Moshannon SP Geese.jpg|thumb|right|A family of Canada geese on Black Moshannon Lake, which provides habitat for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds.]]
[[Ornithologist]]s and bird watchers have recorded a total of 175&amp;nbsp;species at the IBA. Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed: there is a large area of forest in the IBA, as well as great habitat diversity. The location of the IBA along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations.&lt;ref name="IBA33"/&gt;

Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are especially important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and [[wader|shorebirds]]. Waterfowl observed at the park include [[pied-billed grebe|pied-billed]] and [[Slavonian grebe]]s, common loon, [[American black duck]], [[ruddy duck]], [[blue-winged teal|blue-winged]] and [[green-winged teal]], [[tundra swan]], [[long-tailed duck]], [[hooded merganser|hooded]] and [[red-breasted merganser]], [[greater scaup|greater]] and [[lesser scaup]], [[northern pintail]], [[bufflehead]], [[American wigeon]], and [[northern shoveler]].&lt;ref name="IBA33"/&gt;

Pennsylvania IBA #33&amp;nbsp;is on the Allegheny Front, which is along a prime migratory path for a variety of [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]]. The [[golden eagle]], [[bald eagle]], [[osprey]], and [[hen harrier|northern harrier]] pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that the bald eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do [[nest]] in the forests of the IBA include the [[northern goshawk]], [[red-shouldered hawk|red-shouldered]], [[broad-winged hawk|broad-winged]], [[red-tailed hawk|red-tailed]], [[sharp-shinned hawk|sharp-shinned]], and [[Cooper's hawk]]s.&lt;ref name="IBA33"/&gt;

The cool, damp habitat provided by the bogs at Black Moshannon State Park provides a home for some birds that are at the southern limit of their habitat in central Pennsylvania. The [[Canada warbler]] and [[northern waterthrush]] nest in the bogs, as do the [[alder flycatcher]], [[common yellowthroat]], [[swamp sparrow]], [[red-winged blackbird]], and [[grey catbird|gray catbird]]. The [[olive-sided flycatcher]], which is designated as [[Local extinction|locally extinct]] in Pennsylvania, has been seen during the breeding season at Black Moshannon State Natural Area. Bird watchers have observed nesting [[barred owl]]s in the IBA, as well as [[Virginia rail]] and [[sora (bird)|sora]].&lt;ref name="IBA33"/&gt;

==Recreation==

===Cabins, camping, swimming, and picnics===
[[Image:Black Moshannon SP Pump House 2.jpg|thumb|right|A former pumphouse, built by the CCC, is now a picnic shelter.]]
Twenty-one cabins can be used by visitors at Black Moshannon State Park. Thirteen are rustic cabins, built by the CCC, with electric lights, a kitchen stove and a wood-burning stove, refrigerator, and bunk beds. Six are modern cabins, including the former ski lodge,&lt;ref name="dcnr map"/&gt; with electric heat, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bath. There are also two deluxe camping cottages with electric heat and similar amenities as the rustic cabins. All cabin renters need to bring their own household items such as linens and cookware.&lt;ref name="bmspccc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmsp"&gt;{{cite web

There are seventy-two campsites at Black Moshannon State Park. Each campsite has access to washhouses with flush toilets, showers, and laundry tubs. The campsites also have fire rings and picnic tables. There is also an organized group tenting area, which can accommodate a group of up to 60&amp;nbsp;persons.&lt;ref name="bmsp"/&gt; Some sites allow pets; there are also twelve full hook-up sites available. These have electric service, water and sewer hook-ups as well. Nine sites are tent-only.

The sandy beach on Black Moshannon Lake is open from [[Memorial Day]] weekend through [[Labor Day]] weekend, and the beach bathhouse was built by the CCC.&lt;ref name="bmsp"/&gt; Beginning in 2008, lifeguards will not be posted at the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/news/ap?articleID=384046 |title=Pa. state parks going without life guards at beaches in 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |work=[[Times Leader]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007235840/http://www.timesleader.com/news/ap?articleID=384046 |archivedate=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eight picnic pavilions built by the CCC in the park, which can be reserved for a fee. In addition to the pavilions, Black Moshannon State Park has 250&amp;nbsp;picnic tables in four large picnic areas. The use of these picnic tables and unreserved pavilions is first come, first served, and they are free of charge.&lt;ref name="bmsp"/&gt;

Some modern activities are prohibited in Black Moshannon State Park. The operation of drones and similar radio controlled devices is prohibited. All-terrain vehicle usage is also prohibited and closely monitored by DCNR. Further, removing any natural items is illegal as is firewood cutting without a permit.

===Boating, fishing, and hunting===
[[Image:Black Moshannon Creek 2.jpg|thumb|Black Moshannon Creek just downstream of the dam and lake]]
Boating is a popular use of the waters of Black Moshannon Lake, which covers {{convert|250|acre}}. [[Canoe]]s, [[sailboat]]s, and electric motor boats are all permitted on Black Moshannon Lake, provided they are properly registered with the state.&lt;ref name="bmsp"/&gt; Edward Gertler, author of a series of canoeing books, calls Black Moshannon Creek "about the best whitewater run in the West Branch Susquehanna Watershed" in ''Keystone Canoeing'',&lt;ref name="canoe"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Gertler |first= Edward |title= Keystone Canoeing: A Guide to Canoeable Waters of Eastern Pennsylvania |year= 1985 |edition= 1st |publisher= Seneca Press |location= [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] |isbn= 0-9605908-2-X |page= {{page needed|date=December 2014}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first {{convert|13.2|mi|adj=on}} stretch of [[International Scale of River Difficulty|Class 2+]] [[whitewater]] for canoeing and [[kayak]]ing begins in the park, just downstream of the dam.

Cold water fishing is available in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find [[rainbow trout|rainbow]] and [[brown trout]] that have been [[fish stocking|stocked]] there for sport fishing by the [[Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission]]. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer than those of the creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including [[largemouth bass]], [[yellow perch]], [[chain pickerel]], [[bullhead catfish]], [[northern pike]], [[bluegill]], and [[crappie]].&lt;ref name="bmsp"/&gt;

Hunting is permitted in most of Black Moshannon State Park. It helps to prevent an overpopulation of animals and the resulting overbrowsing of the [[understory]].&lt;ref name="gamecommission"/&gt; The most common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrel, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. However, the hunting of [[groundhog]]s is prohibited.&lt;ref name="bmsp"/&gt;

===Trails===
There are {{convert|21|mi}} of trails at Black Moshannon State Park that are open to [[hiking]], [[mountain biking]], [[cross-country skiing]], and [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]]. All trails are open to hiking, most are open to skiing during the winter months, and select trails are open to snowmobiles and [[mountain bike]]s.&lt;ref name="bmsptrails"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/blackmoshannon/index.htm#hiking| title = Black Moshannon State Park: Trails | accessdate = 2008-01-08 | publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is especially popular among cross-country skiing enthusiasts due to its high elevation.&lt;ref name="sierraclub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pennsylvania.sierraclub.org/moshannon/OTT%2007-02%20Going%20Where%20the%20Snow%20Is.pdf |format=PDF |title=Going Where the Snow Is |author=Thornbloom, Gary |accessdate=2008-02-27 |publisher=Pennsylvania Sierra Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030203054/http://pennsylvania.sierraclub.org/moshannon/OTT%2007-02%20Going%20Where%20the%20Snow%20Is.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skiers will find trails that are largely free of rocks, with a layer of grass beneath the snow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1872">The '''Burns temperature''', ''T''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, is the temperature where a [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] material, previously in [[Paraelectricity|paraelectric]] state, starts to present randomly polarized nanoregions, that are polar precursor cluster. This behaviour is typical of several, but not all, ferroelectric materials, and was observed in [[lead titanate]] (PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),  [[potassium niobate]] (KNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[lead lanthanum zirconate titanate]] (PLZT), [[lead magnesium niobate]] (PMN), [[lead zinc niobate]] (PZN), K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[strontium barium niobate]] (SBN), Na&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NBT).

The Burns temperature, named from [[Gerald Burns]], who studied this phenomenon with collaboration of [[Frank H. Dacol]], has not been well understood yet.

'''Chemical vapor deposition''' ('''CVD''') is a deposition method used to produce high quality, high-performance, solid materials, typically under [[Vacuum deposition|vacuum]]. The process is often used in the [[semiconductor industry]] to produce [[thin film]]s.

In typical CVD, the [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] (substrate) is exposed to one or more [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[wikt:precursor|precursors]], which [[chemical reaction|react]] and/or [[chemical decomposition|decompose]] on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile [[by-product]]s are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.

[[Microfabrication]] processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: [[Single crystal|monocrystalline]], [[polycrystalline]], [[amorphous]], and [[Epitaxy|epitaxial]]. These materials include: [[silicon]] ([[Silicon dioxide|dioxide]], [[silicon carbide|carbide]], [[silicon nitride|nitride]], [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]]), carbon ([[carbon (fiber)|fiber]], [[carbon nanofibers|nanofibers]], [[carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], [[Synthetic diamond|diamond]] and [[graphene]]), [[fluorocarbon]]s, [[Electrical filament|filaments]], [[tungsten]], [[titanium nitride]] and various [[high-k dielectric]]s.

== Types ==
[[File:ThermalCVD.PNG|thumb|Hot-wall thermal CVD (batch operation type)]]
[[File:PlasmaCVD.PNG|thumb|Plasma assisted CVD]]

CVD is practiced in a variety of formats. These processes generally differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated.
* Classified by operating conditions:
** ''Atmospheric pressure CVD'' (APCVD) – CVD at atmospheric pressure.
** ''Low-pressure CVD'' (LPCVD) – CVD at sub-atmospheric pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crystec.com/klllpcvde.htm|title=Low Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment|publisher=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer.
** ''Ultrahigh vacuum CVD'' (UHVCVD) – CVD at very low pressure, typically below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (~10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]]). Note that in other fields, a lower division between high and [[ultra-high vacuum]] is common, often 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Pa.

Most modern CVD is either LPCVD or UHVCVD.
* Classified by physical characteristics of vapor:
** ''Aerosol assisted CVD'' (AACVD) – CVD in which the precursors are transported to the substrate by means of a liquid/gas aerosol, which can be generated ultrasonically. This technique is suitable for use with non-volatile precursors.
** ''Direct liquid injection CVD'' (DLICVD) – CVD in which the precursors are in liquid form (liquid or solid dissolved in a convenient solvent). Liquid solutions are injected in a vaporization chamber towards injectors (typically car injectors). The precursor vapors are then transported to the substrate as in classical CVD. This technique is suitable for use on liquid or solid precursors. High growth rates can be reached using this technique.
* Classified by type of substrate heating:
** Hot wall CVD – CVD in which the chamber is heated by an external power source and the substrate is heated by radiation from the heated chamber walls.
** Cold wall CVD – CVD in which only the substrate is directly heated either by induction or by passing current through the substrate itself or a heater in contact with the substrate. The chamber walls are at room temperature.
* Plasma methods (see also [[Plasma processing]]):
** ''Microwave plasma-assisted CVD'' (MPCVD)
** ''[[Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|Plasma-Enhanced CVD]]'' (PECVD) – CVD that utilizes [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to enhance chemical reaction rates of the precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.crystec.com/tridepe.htm|title=Crystec Technology Trading GmbH, Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition – Technology and Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; PECVD processing allows deposition at lower temperatures, which is often critical in the manufacture of semiconductors. The lower temperatures also allow for the deposition of organic coatings, such as plasma polymers, that have been used for nanoparticle surface functionalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tavares|first=Jason|author2=Swanson, E.J. |author3=Coulombe, S. |title=Plasma Synthesis of Coated Metal Nanoparticles with Surface Properties Tailored for Dispersion|journal=Plasma Processes and Polymers|year=2008|volume=5|issue=8|page=759|doi=10.1002/ppap.200800074}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Remote plasma-enhanced CVD'' (RPECVD) – Similar to PECVD except that the wafer substrate is not directly in the plasma discharge region. Removing the wafer from the plasma region allows processing temperatures down to room temperature.
* ''Atomic-layer CVD'' ([[ALCVD]]) – Deposits successive layers of different substances to produce layered, [[crystal]]line films. See [[Atomic layer epitaxy]].
* ''[[Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (CCVD) – Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition or flame pyrolysis is an open-atmosphere, flame-based technique for depositing high-quality thin films and nanomaterials.
* ''Hot filament CVD'' (HFCVD) – also known as catalytic CVD (Cat-CVD) or more commonly, initiated CVD (iCVD), this process uses a hot filament to chemically decompose the source gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=R.E.I. | last=Schropp |author2=B. Stannowski |author3=A.M. Brockhoff |author4=P.A.T.T. van Veenendaal |author5=J.K.

* ''[[Hybrid Physical-Chemical Vapor Deposition]]'' (HPCVD) – This process involves both chemical decomposition of precursor gas and [[vaporization]] of a solid source.
* ''[[Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition]]'' (MOCVD) – This CVD process is based on [[metalorganic]] precursors.
* ''Rapid thermal CVD'' (RTCVD) – This CVD process uses heating lamps or other methods to rapidly heat the wafer substrate. Heating only the substrate rather than the gas or chamber walls helps reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions that can lead to [[particle (ecology)|particle]] formation.
* ''Vapor-phase epitaxy'' (VPE)
* ''Photo-initiated CVD'' (PICVD) – This process uses UV light to stimulate chemical reactions. It is similar to plasma processing, given that plasmas are strong emitters of UV radiation. Under certain conditions, PICVD can be operated at or near atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorval Dion|first=C.A.|author2=Tavares, J.R.|title=Photo-Initiated Chemical Vapour Deposition as a Scalable Particle Functionalization Technology (A Practical Review)|journal=Powder Technology|volume=239|pages=484–491|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.powtec.2013.02.024|url=https://zenodo.org/record/968600}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Laser Chemical vapor deposition]] (LCVD)'' - This CVD process uses lasers to heat spots or lines on a substrate in semiconductor applications. In MEMS and in fiber production the lasers are used rapidly to break down the precursor gas-process temperature can exceed 2000oC-to build up a solid structure in much the same way as laser sintering based 3-D printers build up solids from powders.

== Uses ==
CVD is commonly used to deposit conformal films and augment substrate surfaces in ways  that more traditional surface modification techniques are not capable of. CVD is extremely useful in the process of [[atomic layer deposition]] at depositing extremely thin layers of material. A variety of applications for such films exist.  [[Gallium arsenide]] is used in some [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) and  photovoltaic devices. Amorphous polysilicon is used in photovoltaic devices.  Certain [[carbide]]s and [[nitride]]s confer wear-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Wahl, Georg ''et al.''

[[Polycrystalline silicon]] is deposited from [[trichlorosilane]] (SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[silane]] (SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), using the following reactions:&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Simmler, W. | title = Silicon Compounds, Inorganic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a24_001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:SiHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  HCl
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Si + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction is usually performed in LPCVD systems, with either pure silane feedstock, or a solution of silane with 70–80% [[nitrogen]]. Temperatures between 600 and 650&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 [[nanometre|nm]] per minute. An alternative process uses a [[hydrogen]]-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050&amp;nbsp;°C to compensate. Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as [[phosphine]], [[arsine]] or [[diborane]] are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.

=== Silicon dioxide ===
Silicon dioxide (usually called simply "oxide" in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include [[silane]] and [[oxygen]], [[dichlorosilane]] (SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Third World Congress of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo, p. 290 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), or [[tetraethylorthosilicate]] (TEOS; Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The reactions are as follows:&lt;ref name="cao:2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cao|first1=Guozhong|last2=Wang|first2=Ying|title=Nanostructures and Nanomaterials -- Synthesis, Properties and Applications|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-981-4322-50-8|page=248|doi=10.1142/7885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

:Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + byproducts

The choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, [[aluminium]] is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;°C, dichlorosilane at around 900&amp;nbsp;°C, and TEOS between 650 and 750&amp;nbsp;°C, resulting in a layer of ''low- temperature oxide'' (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower [[dielectric strength]], for instance), and it deposits non[[conformal film|conformally]]. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than [[thermal oxidation|thermal oxide]], but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.

Oxide may also be grown with impurities ([[alloy]]ing or "[[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]"). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may [[atomic diffusion|diffuse]] from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5–15% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] ("P-glass") can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:

:4 PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Glass]]es containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850&amp;nbsp;°C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.

Besides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces [[chlorine]].

Lower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500&amp;nbsp;°C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic – that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.

==== Silicon nitride ====
Silicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit silicon nitride from the gas phase:

:3 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:3 SiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 HCl + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Silicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile [[stress (physics)|stress]], which may crack films thicker than 200&amp;nbsp;nm. However, it has higher [[resistivity]] and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; [[ohm|Ω]]·cm and 10 M[[volt|V]]/cm, respectively).

Another two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:

:2 SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → SiNH + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 384| title = Semiconductor devices: physics and technology|author = Sze, S.M. | publisher = Wiley-India| year = 2008|isbn =978-81-265-1681-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metals ===
CVD for [[tungsten]] is achieved from [[tungsten hexafluoride]] (WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), which may be deposited in two ways:

:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:WF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → W + 6 HF

Other metals, notably aluminium and [[copper]], can be deposited by CVD. {{As of|2010}}, commercially cost-effective CVD for copper did not exist, although volatile sources exist, such as Cu([[hexafluoroacetylacetone|hfac]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Copper is typically deposited by [[electroplating]]. Aluminum can be deposited from [[triisobutylaluminium]] (TIBAL) and related [[organoaluminium compound]]s.

CVD for [[molybdenum]], [[tantalum]], [[titanium]], nickel is widely used.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} These metals can form useful [[silicide]]s when deposited onto silicon. Mo, Ta and Ti are deposited by LPCVD, from their pentachlorides. Nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten can be deposited at low temperatures from their carbonyl precursors. In general, for an arbitrary metal ''M'', the chloride deposition reaction is as follows:

:2 MCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 M + 10 HCl

whereas the carbonyl decomposition reaction can happen spontaneously under thermal treatment or acoustic cavitation and is as follows:

:M(CO)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; → M + n CO

the decomposition of metal carbonyls is often violently precipitated by moisture or air, where oxygen reacts with the metal precursor to form metal or metal oxide along with carbon dioxide.

[[Niobium(V) oxide]] layers can be produced by the thermal decomposition of [[niobium(V) ethoxide]] with the loss of [[diethyl ether]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi =  10.1149/1.2059247 | title =  Electrochromic Properties of Niobium Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition | year =  1994 | last1 =  Maruyama | first1 =  Toshiro | journal =  Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume =  141 | issue =  10 | pages =  2868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | title = Atomic Layer Deposition of High Permittivity Oxides: Film Growth and In Situ Studies |  author = Rahtu, Antti | publisher = University of Helsinki | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10138/21065 | year = 2002 | isbn = 952-10-0646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the equation:

:2 Nb(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Graphene ===
Many variations of CVD can be utilized to synthesize graphene. Although many advancements have been made, the processes listed below are not commercially viable yet.
* Carbon source
The most popular carbon source used to produce graphene is methane gas. Less popular choices include petroleum asphalt, notable for being inexpensive but more difficult to work with.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of three-dimensional graphene from petroleum asphalt by chemical vapor deposition|journal = Materials Letters|date = 2014-05-01|pages = 285–288|volume = 122|doi = 10.1016/j.matlet.2014.02.077|first = Zhuchen|last = Liu|first2 = Zhiqiang|last2 = Tu|first3 = Yongfeng|last3 = Li|first4 = Fan|last4 = Yang|first5 = Shuang|last5 = Han|first6 = Wang|last6 = Yang|first7 = Liqiang|last7 = Zhang|first8 = Gang|last8 = Wang|first9 = Chunming|last9 = Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of catalyst
The use of catalyst is viable in changing the physical process of graphene production. Notable examples include iron nanoparticles, nickel foam, and gallium vapor. These catalysts can either be used in situ during graphene buildup,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Novel synthesis route to graphene using iron nanoparticles|journal = Journal of Materials Research|date = 2014|pages = 1522–1527|volume = 29|issue = 14|doi = 10.1557/jmr.2014.165|first = Rajen B.|last = Patel|first2 = Chi|last2 = Yu|first3 = Tsengming|last3 = Chou|first4 = Zafar|last4 = Iqbal|bibcode = 2014JMatR..29.1522P}}&lt;/ref&gt; or situated at some distance away at the deposition area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Direct synthesis of large area graphene on insulating substrate by gallium vapor-assisted chemical vapor deposition|journal = Applied Physics Letters|date = 2015|pages = 093112|volume = 106|issue = 9|doi = 10.1063/1.4914114|first = Katsuhisa|last = Murakami|first2 = Shunsuke|last2 = Tanaka|first3 = Ayaka|last3 = Hirukawa|first4 = Takaki|last4 = Hiyama|first5 = Tomoya|last5 = Kuwajima|first6 = Emi|last6 = Kano|first7 = Masaki|last7 = Takeguchi|first8 = Jun-ichi|last8 = Fujita|bibcode = 2015ApPhL.106i3112M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some catalysts require another step to remove them from the sample material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The direct growth of high-quality, large single-crystalline domains of graphene on a dielectric substrate is of vital importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Combining the advantages of both catalytic CVD and the ultra-flat dielectric substrate, gaseous catalyst-assisted CVD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Silane-catalysed fast growth of large single-crystalline graphene on hexagonal boron nitride |journal=Nature Communications  |volume=6  |year=2015|page=6499|doi=10.1038/ncomms7499 |pmid=25757864  |pmc=4382696  |last1=Tang |first1=Shujie |last2=Wang |first2=Haomin|last3=Wang |first3=Huishan |arxiv=1503.02806|bibcode=2015NatCo...6E6499T}}&lt;/ref&gt; paves the way for synthesizing high-quality graphene for device applications while avoiding the transfer process.
* Physical conditions
Physical conditions such as surrounding pressure, temperature, carrier gas, and chamber material play a big role in production of graphene.

Most systems use LPCVD with pressures ranging from 1 to 1500 Pa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = CVD synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene using urea|journal = Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy|date = 2015-09-05|pages = 1–6|volume = 58|issue = 10|doi = 10.1007/s11433-015-5717-0|first = CanKun|last = Zhang|first2 = WeiYi|last2 = Lin|first3 = ZhiJuan|last3 = Zhao|first4 = PingPing|last4 = Zhuang|first5 = LinJie|last5 = Zhan|first6 = YingHui|last6 = Zhou|first7 = WeiWei|last7 = Cai|bibcode = 2015SCPMA..58.7801Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthesis of CVD-graphene on rapidly heated copper foils|url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c3nr06434d|journal = Nanoscale|volume = 6|issue = 9|pages = 4728–34|doi = 10.1039/c3nr06434d|pmid = 24658264|first = Sang-Min|last = Kim|first2 = Jae-Hyun|last2 = Kim|first3 = Kwang-Seop|last3 = Kim|first4 = Yun|last4 = Hwangbo|first5 = Jong-Hyuk|last5 = Yoon|first6 = Eun-Kyu|last6 = Lee|first7 = Jaechul|last7 = Ryu|first8 = Hak-Joo|last8 = Lee|first9 = Seungmin|last9 = Cho|bibcode = 2014Nanos...6.4728K|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some still use APCVD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low pressures are used more commonly as they help prevent unwanted reactions and produce more uniform thickness of deposition on the substrate.

On the other hand, temperatures used range from 800–1050&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; High temperatures translate to an increase of the rate of reaction. Caution has to be exercised as high temperatures do pose higher danger levels in addition to greater energy costs.
* Carrier gas
Hydrogen gas and inert gases such as argon are flowed into the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These gases act as a carrier, enhancing surface reaction and improving reaction rate, thereby increasing deposition of graphene onto the substrate.
* Chamber material
Standard quartz tubing and chambers are used in CVD of graphene.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Quartz is chosen because it has a very high melting point and is chemically inert. In other words, quartz does not interfere with any physical or chemical reactions regardless of the conditions.
* Methods of analysis of results
Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to examine and characterize the graphene samples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Raman spectroscopy is used to characterize and identify the graphene particles; X-ray spectroscopy is used to characterize chemical states; TEM is used to provide fine details regarding the internal composition of graphene; SEM is used to examine the surface and topography.

Sometimes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure local properties such as friction and magnetism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Cold wall CVD technique can be used to study the underlying surface science involved in graphene nucleation and growth as it allows unprecedented control of process parameters like gas flow rates, temperature and pressure as demonstrated in a recent study. The study was carried out in a home-built vertical cold wall system utilizing resistive heating by passing direct current through the substrate. It provided conclusive insight into a typical surface-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism involved in two-dimensional materials grown using catalytic CVD under conditions sought out in the semiconductor industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Nucleation and growth of single layer graphene on electrodeposited Cu by cold wall chemical vapor deposition|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=28|issue=10|pages=105601|doi=10.1088/1361-6528/aa593b|pmid=28084218|bibcode=2017Nanot..28j5601D|year=2017|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895408/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=Shantanu|last2=Drucker|first2=Jeff|title=Pre-coalescence scaling of graphene island sizes|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=28 May 2018|volume=123|issue=20|pages=205306|doi=10.1063/1.5021341|bibcode=2018JAP...123t5306D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphene nanoribbon===
In spite of graphene's exciting electronic and thermal properties, it is unsuitable as a transistor for future digital devices, due to the absence of a bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. This makes it impossible to switch between on and off states with respect to electron flow. Scaling things down, graphene nanoribbons of less than 10 nm in width do exhibit electronic bandgaps and are therefore potential candidates for digital devices. Precise control over their dimensions, and hence electronic properties, however, represents a challenging goal, and the ribbons typically possess rough edges that are detrimental to their performance.

=== Diamond ===

{{See also|Synthetic diamond#Chemical vapor deposition}}
CVD can be used to produce a [[synthetic diamond]] by creating the circumstances necessary for carbon atoms in a gas to settle on a substrate in crystalline form. CVD of diamonds has received much attention in the materials sciences because it allows many new applications that had previously been considered too expensive. CVD diamond growth typically occurs under low pressure (1–27 [[pascal (unit)|kPa]]; 0.145–3.926 [[pounds per square inch|psi]]; 7.5–203 [[Torr]])  and involves feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber, energizing them and providing conditions for diamond growth on the substrate. The gases always include a carbon source, and typically include hydrogen as well, though the amounts used vary greatly depending on the type of diamond being grown. Energy sources include [[hot filament]], [[microwave]] power, and [[Electric arc|arc discharges]], among others. The energy source is intended to generate a plasma in which the gases are broken down and more complex chemistries occur. The actual chemical process for diamond growth is still under study and is complicated by the very wide variety of diamond growth processes used.

Using CVD, films of diamond can be grown over large areas of substrate with control over the properties of the diamond produced. In the past, when high pressure high temperature (HPHT) techniques were used to produce a diamond, the result was typically very small free standing diamonds of varying sizes. With CVD diamond growth areas of greater than fifteen centimeters (six inches) diameter have been achieved and much larger areas are likely to be successfully coated with diamond in the future. Improving this process is key to enabling several important applications.

The growth of diamond directly on a substrate allows the addition of many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest [[thermal conductivity]] of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond to be used as a heat sink.&lt;ref name="poly1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0925-9635(94)90108-2|title=Diamond protective coatings for optical components|year=1994|last1=Costello|first1=M|last2=Tossell|first2=D|last3=Reece|first3=D|last4=Brierley|first4=C|last5=Savage|first5=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=3|issue=8|pages=1137–1141|bibcode = 1994DRM.....3.1137C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heat2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2005.05.008|title=Comparative study of thermally conductive fillers in underfill for the electronic components|year=2005|last1=Sun Lee|first1=Woong|last2=Yu|first2=Jin|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=14|issue=10|pages=1647–1653|bibcode = 2005DRM....14.1647S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate.  Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] than [[Pyrex]] glass, a [[coefficient of friction]] close to that of Teflon ([[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) and strong [[lipophilicity]] would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.

CVD growth allows one to control the properties of the diamond produced. In the area of diamond growth, the word "diamond" is used as a description of any material primarily made up of [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp3-bonded]] carbon, and there are many different types of diamond included in this. By regulating the processing parameters—especially the gases introduced, but also including the pressure the system is operated under, the temperature of the diamond, and the method of generating plasma—many different materials that can be considered diamond can be made. Single crystal diamond can be made containing various [[dopant]]s.&lt;ref name="single"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.diamond.2003.10.017|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223368741|title=Single crystal diamond for electronic applications|year=2004|last1=Isberg|first1=J|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=320–324|bibcode = 2004DRM....13..320I }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic diamond#Crystallinity|Polycrystalline diamond]] consisting of grain sizes from several [[nanometer]]s to several [[micrometre|micrometers]] can be grown.&lt;ref name="poly1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly2"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0925-9635(01)00385-5|title=Ultrananocrystalline diamond thin films for MEMS and moving mechanical assembly devices|year=2001|last1=Krauss|first1=A|journal=Diamond and Related Materials|volume=10|issue=11|pages=1952–1961|bibcode = 2001DRM....10.1952K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polycrystalline diamond grains are surrounded by thin, non-diamond carbon, while others are not. These different factors affect the diamond's hardness, smoothness, conductivity, optical properties and more.

==Chalcogenides==
Commercially, [[mercury cadmium telluride]] is of continuing interest for detection of infrared radiation.  Consisting of an [[alloy]] of CdTe and HgTe, this material can be prepared from the dimethyl derivatives of the respective elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1541">'''Chladni's law''', named after [[Ernst Chladni]], relates the [[frequency]] of [[modes of vibration]] for flat circular surfaces with fixed center as a function of the numbers ''m'' of diametric (linear) nodes and ''n'' of radial (circular) nodes.  It is stated as the equation
:&lt;math&gt; f = C (m + 2n)^p &lt;/math&gt;
where ''C'' and ''p'' are [[coefficients]] which depend on the properties of the plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Principles of Vibration and Sound|first1=Thomas D.|last1=Rossing|first2=Neville H.|last2=Fletcher|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=9780387405568|pages=73–74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgBF0j2OfKMC&amp;pg=PA73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chladni plate 10.jpg|thumb|Chladni figures, used for studying vibrations]]For flat circular plates, ''p'' is roughly 2, but Chladni's law can also be used to describe the vibrations of [[cymbal]]s, [[handbells]], and [[church bells]] in which case ''p'' can vary from 1.4 to 2.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Physics of Musical Instruments|first1=Neville Horner|last1=Fletcher|first2=Thomas D.|last2=Rossing|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=9780387983745|page=680|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CRSRYQlRLkC&amp;pg=PA680}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''p'' can even vary for a single object, depending on which family of modes is being examined.

The '''Cosmic Background Explorer''' ('''COBE''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|b|i}}), also referred to as '''Explorer 66''', was a [[satellite]] dedicated to [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], which operated from 1989 to 1993.  Its goals were to investigate the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB) of the [[universe]] and provide measurements that would help shape our understanding of the [[cosmos]].

COBE's measurements provided two key pieces of evidence that supported the [[Big Bang]] theory of the universe: that the CMB has a near-perfect [[black-body]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]], and that it has very faint [[Anisotropy|anisotropies]]. Two of COBE's principal investigators,  [[George F. Smoot|George Smoot]] and [[John C. Mather|John Mather]], received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2006 for their work on the project. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the COBE-project can also be regarded as the starting point for [[cosmology]]
as a precision science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2006|publisher=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|date=2006-10-03|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBE was followed by two more advanced spacecraft: [[WMAP]] operated from 2001-2010 and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] from 2009-2013.

== History ==
In 1974, [[NASA]] issued an Announcement of Opportunity for astronomical missions that would use a small- or medium-sized [[Explorer program|Explorer]] spacecraft.  Out of the 121 proposals received, three dealt with studying the cosmological background radiation. Though these proposals lost out to the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite]] (IRAS), their strength made NASA further explore the idea. In 1976, NASA formed a committee of members from each of 1974's three proposal teams to put together their ideas for such a satellite. A year later, this committee suggested a [[Polar orbit|polar-orbiting]] satellite called COBE to be launched by either a [[Delta rocket]] or the [[Space Shuttle]]. It would contain the following instruments:&lt;ref name=leverington&gt;{{cite book | last=Leverington |first=David | title=New Cosmic Horizons: Space Astronomy from the V2 to the Hubble Space Telescope | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2000 | isbn=0-521-65833-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COBELaunch.jpg|thumb|230px|Launch of the COBE spacecraft November 18, 1989.]]

NASA accepted the proposal provided that the costs be kept under $30 million, excluding launcher and data analysis.  Due to cost overruns in the Explorer program due to [[IRAS]], work on constructing the satellite at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) did not begin until 1981.  To save costs, the infrared detectors and liquid [[helium]] [[Dewar flask|dewar]] on COBE would be similar to those used on [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite|IRAS]].

COBE was originally planned to be launched on a [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[Cancelled Space Shuttle missions|STS-82-B]] in 1988 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], but the [[STS-51-L|Challenger explosion]] delayed this plan when the Shuttles were grounded. NASA kept COBE's engineers from going to other space agencies to launch COBE, but eventually, a redesigned COBE was placed into [[sun-synchronous orbit]] on November 18, 1989 aboard a Delta rocket. A team of American scientists announced, on April 23, 1992 that they had found the primordial "seeds" (CMBE anisotropy) in data from COBE. The announcement was reported worldwide as a fundamental scientific discovery and ran on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''.

The [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for 2006 was jointly awarded to John C. Mather, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and George F. Smoot, [[University of California, Berkeley]], "for their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 2006 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/index.html|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBE was an Explorer class satellite, with technology borrowed heavily from [[IRAS]], but with some unique characteristics.

The need to control and measure all the sources of systematic errors required a rigorous and integrated design. COBE would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months, and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground, COBE and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the [[Earth]], [[Sun]] and [[Moon]].&lt;ref name=boggess&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boggess, N.W. |author2=J.C.

The need to control systematic error in the measurement of the CMB [[anisotropy]] and measuring the [[zodiacal cloud]] at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate.&lt;ref name=boggess/&gt; The spin axis is also tilted back from the orbital velocity vector as a precaution against possible deposits of residual atmospheric gas on the optics as well against the infrared glow that would result from fast neutral particles hitting its surfaces at extremely high speed.

[[File:COBEDiagram.jpg|250px|left]]
In order to meet the twin demands of slow rotation and three-axis attitude control, a sophisticated pair of yaw angular [[momentum wheel]]s were employed with their axis oriented along the spin axis .&lt;ref name=boggess/&gt;  These wheels were used to carry an angular momentum opposite that of the entire spacecraft in order to create a zero net angular momentum system.

The orbit would prove to be determined based on the specifics of the spacecraft’s mission.  The overriding considerations were the need for full sky coverage, the need to eliminate stray radiation from the instruments and the need to maintain thermal stability of the dewar and the instruments.&lt;ref name=boggess/&gt;  A circular [[Sun-synchronous orbit]] satisfied all these requirements.  A 900&amp;nbsp;km altitude orbit with a 99° inclination was chosen as it fit within the capabilities of either a [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]] (with an auxiliary propulsion on COBE) or a Delta rocket.  This altitude was a good compromise between Earth's radiation and the charged particle in Earth's [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]] at higher altitudes.  An ascending node at 6 p.m. was chosen to allow COBE to follow the boundary between sunlight and darkness on Earth throughout the year.

The orbit combined with the spin axis made it possible to keep the Earth and the Sun continually below the plane of the shield, allowing a full sky scan every six months.

The last two important parts pertaining to the COBE mission were the dewar and Sun-Earth shield.  The dewar was a 650-liter superfluid helium cryostat designed to keep the FIRAS and DIRBE instruments cooled during the duration of the mission.  It was based on the same design as one used on [[IRAS]] and was able to vent helium along the spin axis near the communication arrays.  The conical Sun-Earth shield protected the instruments from direct solar and Earth based radiation as well as radio interference from Earth and the COBE's transmitting antenna.  Its multilayer insulating blankets provided thermal isolation for the dewar.&lt;ref name=boggess/&gt;

[[File:COBE cmb fluctuations.png|thumb|right|250px|The famous map of the CMB anisotropy formed from data taken by the COBE spacecraft.]]

The science mission was conducted by the three instruments detailed previously: DIRBE, FIRAS and the DMR.  The instruments overlapped in wavelength coverage, providing consistency check on measurements in the regions of spectral overlap and assistance in discriminating signals from our galaxy, Solar System and CMB.&lt;ref name=boggess/&gt;

COBE's instruments would fulfill each of their objectives as well as making observations that would have implications outside COBE’s initial scope.

=== Black-body curve of CMB ===
[[File:Cmbr.svg|thumb|left|250px|Data from COBE showed a perfect fit between the black body curve predicted by big bang theory and that observed in the microwave background.]]
During the long gestation period of COBE, there were two significant astronomical developments.  First, in 1981, two teams of astronomers, one led by David Wilkinson of Princeton and the other by Francesco Melchiorri of the University of Florence, simultaneously announced that they detected a [[quadrupole]] distribution of CMB using balloon-borne instruments.  This finding would have been the detection of the [[black-body]] distribution of CMB that FIRAS on COBE was to measure.
In particular, the Florence group claimed a detection of intermediate angular scale
anisotropies at the level 100 microkelvins &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1981ApJ...250L...1M&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf |first=Francesco|last=Melchiorri|first2=Bianca O. |last2= Melchiorri|last3=Pietranera|first3=Luca| title=Fluctuations in the microwave background at intermediate angular scales |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=November 1981 |bibcode=1981ApJ...250L...1M |accessdate=2011-08-23|doi = 10.1086/183662|last4=Melchiorri|first4=B. O.|volume=250|pages=L1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in agreement with later measurements made by the [[BOOMERanG experiment]].
[[File:PIA16874-CobeWmapPlanckComparison-20130321.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Comparison of [[CMB]] results from COBE, [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] - March 21, 2013.]]
However, a number of other experiments attempted to duplicate their results and were unable to do so.&lt;ref name=leverington/&gt;

Second, in 1987 a Japanese-American team led by [[Andrew E. Lange|Andrew Lange]] and Paul Richards of UC Berkeley and Toshio Matsumoto of Nagoya University made an announcement that CMB was not that of a true black body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmological implication of a new measurement of the submillimeter background radiation |author=Hayakawa, S. |author2=Matsumoto, T. |author3=Matsuo, H. |author4=Murakami, H. |author5=Sato, S. |author6=Lange A. E. |author7=Richards, P. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan  |issn=0004-6264 |volume=39 |issue=6 |date=1987 |pages=941–948 |bibcode=1987PASJ...39..941H |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1987PASJ...39..941H/0000941.000.html |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[sounding rocket]] experiment, they detected an excess brightness at 0.5 and 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm wavelengths.

With these developments serving as a backdrop to COBE’s mission, scientists eagerly awaited results from FIRAS.  The results of FIRAS were startling in that they showed a perfect fit of the CMB and the theoretical curve for a black body at a temperature of 2.7 K, thus proving the Berkeley-Nagoya results erroneous.

FIRAS measurements were made by measuring the spectral difference between a 7° patch of the sky against an internal black body.  The interferometer in FIRAS covered between 2 and 95&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in two bands separated at 20&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  There are two scan lengths (short and long) and two scan speeds (fast and slow) for a total of four different scan modes.  The data were collected over a ten-month period.&lt;ref name=fixsen&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fixsen, D. J. |author2=Cheng, E. S. |author3=Cottingham, D. A. |author4=Eplee, R. E.

=== Intrinsic anisotropy of CMB ===
[[File:COBE DMR Image.PNG|thumb|Data obtained at each of the three DMR frequencies—31.5, 53, and 90 GHz—following dipole subtraction]]
The DMR was able to spend four years mapping the detectable [[anisotropy]] of cosmic background radiation as it was the only instrument not dependent on the dewar’s supply of helium to keep it cooled.  This operation was able to create full sky maps of the CMB by subtracting out galactic emissions and dipole at various frequencies.  The cosmic microwave background fluctuations are extremely faint, only one part in 100,000 compared to the 2.73 [[kelvin]]s average temperature of the radiation field. The cosmic microwave background radiation is a remnant of the [[Big Bang]] and the fluctuations are the imprint of density contrast in the early universe. The density ripples are believed to have produced  [[structure formation]] as observed in the universe today: clusters of galaxies and vast regions devoid of galaxies (NASA).

DIRBE also detected 10 new far-IR emitting galaxies in the region not surveyed by [[IRAS]] as well as nine other candidates in the weak far-IR that may be [[spiral galaxies]].

Galaxies that were detected at the 140 and 240 μm were also able to provide information on very cold dust (VCD).  At these wavelengths, the mass and temperature of VCD can be derived.

When these data were joined with 60 and 100 μm data taken from [[IRAS]], it was found that the far-infrared luminosity arises from cold (≈17–22 K) dust associated with diffuse [[H I region|HI]] cirrus clouds, 15-30% from cold (≈19 K) dust associated with molecular gas, and less than 10% from warm (≈29 K) dust in the extended low-density [[H II region|HII region]]s.&lt;ref name=sodroski&gt;{{cite journal |author= T.

=== DIRBE ===
{{main|Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment}}
[[File:COBE galactic disk.PNG|thumb|Model of the Galactic disk as seen edge-on from our position]]
On top of the findings DIRBE had on galaxies, it also made two other significant contributions to science.&lt;ref name=sodroski/&gt;
The DIRBE instrument was able to conduct studies on [[interplanetary dust]] (IPD) and determine if its origin was from asteroid or cometary particles.  The DIRBE data collected at 12, 25, 50 and 100 μm were able to conclude that grains of [[asteroid]]al origin populate the IPD bands and the smooth IPD cloud.&lt;ref name=spiesman&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Spiesman, W.J. |author2=M.G. Hauser |author3=T. Kelsall |author4=C.M. Lisse |author5=S.H. Moseley Jr. |author6=W.T. Reach |author7=R.F. Silverberg |author8=S.W. Stemwedel |author9=J.L. Weiland |last-author-amp=yes |date=1995 |title=Near and far infrared observations of interplanetary dust bands from the COBE Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment |bibcode=1995ApJ...442..662S |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=442 |issue=2 |page=662 |doi=10.1086/175470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second contribution DIRBE made was a model of the [[Galactic disk]] as seen edge-on from our position.  According to the model, if our Sun is 8.6 [[Parsec|kpc]] from the Galactic center, then the Sun is 15.6 pc above the midplane of the disk, which has a radial and vertical scale lengths of 2.64 and 0.333 kpc, respectively, and is warped in a way consistent with the HI layer.  There is also no indication of a thick disk.&lt;ref name=freudenreich&gt;{{cite journal|author=Freudenreich, H.T. |date=1996 |title=The shape and color of the galactic disk |bibcode=1996ApJ...468..663F |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=468 |pages=663–678 |doi=10.1086/177724}}  See also {{cite journal|author=Freudenreich, H.T. |date=1997 |title=The shape and color of the galactic disk: Erratum |bibcode=1997ApJ...485..920F |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=485|issue=2 |page=920 |doi=10.1086/304478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create this model, the IPD had to be subtracted out of the DIRBE data.  It was found that this cloud, which as seen from Earth is [[Zodiacal light]], was not centered on the Sun, as previously thought, but on a place in space a few million kilometers away.  This is due to the gravitation influence of [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref name=leverington/&gt;

=== Cosmological implications ===
In addition to the science results detailed in the last section, there are numerous cosmological questions left unanswered by COBE’s results.  A direct measurement of the [[extragalactic background light]] (EBL) can also provide important constraints on the integrated cosmological history of star formation, metal and dust production, and the conversion of starlight into infrared emissions by dust.&lt;ref name=dwek&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dwek, E. |author2=R. G. Arendt |author3=M. G. Hauser |author4=D. Fixsen|author5=T. Kelsall |author6=D. Leisawitz|author7=Y. C. Pei |author8=E. L. Wright|author9=J. C. Mather |author10=S. H. Moseley|author11=N. Odegard |author12=R. Shafer|author13=R. F. Silverberg |author14=J. L. Weiland |last-author-amp=yes |date=1998 |title=The COBE Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment search for the cosmic infrared background: IV. Cosmological Implications |bibcode=1998ApJ...508..106D |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=508 |issue=1 |pages=106–122 |doi=10.1086/306382|arxiv = astro-ph/9806129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By looking at the results from DIRBE and FIRAS in the 140 to 5000 μm we can detect that the integrated EBL intensity is ≈16&amp;nbsp;nW/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·sr).  This is consistent with the energy released during nucleosynthesis and constitutes about 20–50% of the total energy released in the formation of helium and metals throughout the history of the universe.  Attributed only to nuclear sources, this intensity implies that more than 5–15% of the baryonic mass density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis analysis has been processed in stars to helium and heavier elements.&lt;ref name=dwek/&gt;

There were also significant implications into [[star formation]].  COBE observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate, and help us calculate the EBL spectrum for various star formation histories.  Observation made by COBE require that star formation rate at redshifts of ''z'' ≈ 1.5 to be larger than that inferred from UV-optical observations by a factor of 2.  This excess stellar energy must be mainly generated by massive stars in yet-undetected dust enshrouded galaxies or extremely dusty star forming regions in observed galaxies.&lt;ref name=dwek/&gt;  The exact star formation history cannot unambiguously be resolved by COBE and further observations must be made in the future.

On June 30, 2001, NASA launched a follow-up mission to COBE led by DMR Deputy Principal Investigator [[Charles L. Bennett]].  The [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] has clarified and expanded upon COBE's accomplishments. Following WMAP, the European Space Agency's probe, [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] has continued to increase the resolution at which the background has been mapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Christopher|title=Planck's Probe Map - A picture of the Universe|url=http://dawn.com/2013/04/03/plank-probes-map-a-picture-of-our-universe/|publisher=Spider Magazine|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planck's HFI Completes Its Survey of the Early Universe|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Planck/Planck_s_HFI_completes_its_survey_of_early_Universe|publisher=ESA|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Spill (audio)}}
In [[electronics]], '''crosstalk''' is any phenomenon by which a [[signal]] transmitted on one [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] or [[Communication channel|channel]] of a [[transmission system]] creates an undesired effect in another circuit or channel. Crosstalk is usually caused by undesired [[capacitive coupling|capacitive]], [[inductive coupling|inductive]], or [[conductive coupling]] from one circuit or channel to another.

Crosstalk is a significant issue in [[structured cabling]], [[audio electronics]], [[integrated circuit design]], [[wireless communication]] and other [[communications system]]s.

==In cabling==
In structured cabling, crosstalk refers to [[electromagnetic interference]] from one unshielded [[twisted pair]] to another twisted pair, normally running in parallel. Signals traveling through adjacent pairs of wire interfere with each other. The pair causing the interference is called the “disturbing pair,” while the pair experiencing the interference is the “disturbed pair”.

;Near end crosstalk (NEXT):  NEXT is a measure of the ability of a cable to reject crosstalk, so the higher the NEXT value, the greater the rejection of crosstalk at the local connection. It is referred to as Near End because the interference between the two signals in the cable is measured at the same end of the cable as the interfering transmitter. The NEXT value for a given cable type is generally expressed in decibels per feet or decibels per 1000 feet and varies with the frequency of transmission. General specifications for cabling (such as CAT 5) usually include the minimum NEXT values.&lt;ref name="lanshack"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanshack.com/cat5e-tutorial.aspx |title=Category 5 / 5E &amp; Cat 6 Cabling Tutorial and FAQ's |publisher=lanshack.com |accessdate=2013-01-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117171629/http://www.lanshack.com/cat5e-tutorial.aspx |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{Anchor|PSNEXT}}Power sum near end crosstalk (PSNEXT)
:PSNEXT is a NEXT measurement which includes the sum of crosstalk contributions from all adjacent pairs as an algebraic sum of the NEXT of the three wire pairs as they affect the fourth pair in a four-pair cable (e.g., Category 6 cable).&lt;ref name="lanshack"/&gt; The Superior Modular Products White paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superiormod.com/smp/pages/support/White%20Paper%20-%20RJ21X.pdf |title=Component Level PowerSum Compliance and RJ21X Connectivity Solutions (Superior Modular Products White paper) |accessdate=2008-09-13 |format=PDF |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716043452/http://www.superiormod.com/smp/pages/support/White%20Paper%20-%20RJ21X.pdf |archivedate=July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the testing process for PSNEXT consists of measuring all pair-to-pair crosstalk combinations and then summing all of the values for each pair. The specification was developed to directly address the effect of transmissions on multiple adjacent pairs on the pair being tested and is relevant to all connecting hardware and associated communications cables.

:Cabling bandwidths in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[Category 5 cable]] bandwidth) make consideration of PSNEXT more important as [[Gigabit Ethernet]] through [[Cat-6]] uses all four wire pairs simultaneously and bidirectionally. The additional wire pair usage and growing bandwidth increases the need to keep NEXT in check.

;Far end crosstalk (FEXT): FEXT measures the interference between two pairs of a cable measured at the far end of the cable with respect to the interfering transmitter.&lt;ref name="lanshack"/&gt;

;Equal level far end crosstalk (ELFEXT): ELFEXT measures the FEXT with attenuation compensation.&lt;ref name="lanshack"/&gt;

;{{visible anchor|Alien crosstalk}} (AXT): AXT is interference caused by other cables routed close to the cable of interest as opposed to signals contained in the same cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.comnews.com/features/2009_february/0209_web3_eliminating.aspx |title=Eliminating alien crosstalk |publisher=Communications News |date=February 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209073156/http://www.comnews.com/features/2009_february/0209_web3_eliminating.aspx |archivedate=2010-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In audio==
[[File:IBA Crosstalk weighting curve.svg|400px|right]]

In [[stereo]] audio reproduction, crosstalk can refer to signal leaking across from one program channel to another, reducing channel separation and [[stereo imaging]]. Crosstalk between channels in mixing consoles, and between studio feeds is a much more noticeable problem, as these are likely to be carrying very different programmes or material.

Crosstalk is an electrical effect and can be quantified with a crosstalk measurement. Crosstalk measurements are made on audio systems to determine the amount of signal leaking across from one channel to another. The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] published a [[weighting curve]] for use in crosstalk measurement that gives due emphasis to the subjective audibility of different frequencies. In the absence of any international standards, this is still in use despite the demise of the IBA.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Good crosstalk performance for a stereo system is not difficult to achieve in today's [[digital audio]] systems, though it was hard to keep below the desired figure of -30&amp;nbsp;dB{{cn|date=December 2017}} or so on [[vinyl record]]ings and [[FM radio]].

==Other examples==
In [[telecommunication]] or [[telephony]], crosstalk is often distinguishable as pieces of speech or [[in-band signaling]] tones leaking from other people's connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-009/_1340.htm |work=Federal Standard 1037C glossary |title=crosstalk (XT) |access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the connection is analog, [[twisted pair]] cabling can often be used to reduce crosstalk. Alternatively, the signals can be converted to digital form, which is typically less susceptible to crosstalk.

In [[wireless communication]], crosstalk is often denoted [[co-channel interference]], and is related to [[adjacent-channel interference]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

In [[integrated circuit design]], crosstalk normally refers to a signal affecting another nearby signal. Usually the coupling is capacitive, and to the nearest neighbor, but other forms of coupling and effects on signal further away are sometimes important, especially in analog designs. See [[signal integrity]] for tools used to measure and prevent this problem, and [[substrate coupling]] for a discussion of crosstalk conveyed through the [[integrated circuit]] substrate. There are a wide variety of repair solutions, with increased spacing, wire re-ordering, and shielding being the most common.

In full-field optical coherence [[tomography]], "crosstalk" refers to the phenomenon that due to highly scattering objects, multiple scattered photons reach the image plane and generate coherent signal after traveling a pathlength that matches that of the sample depth within a coherence length.

In [[3D display|stereoscopic 3D displays]], "crosstalk" refers to the incomplete isolation of the left and right image channels so that one leaks or bleeds into the other - like a double exposure, which produces a [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] effect.

== History ==
''Energy &amp; Environment'' was first published in 1989; David Everest ([[Department of the Environment (UK)|Department of the Environment]], United Kingdom) was its founding editor. Following his death in 1998, Boehmer-Christiansen became the journal's editor. She and several members of the journal's editorial advisory board previously had been associated with "the Energy and Environment Groups" at the [[Science and Technology Policy Research|Science and Technology Policy Unit]] ([[University of Sussex]]), with John Surrey.&lt;ref name=mission /&gt; [[Benny Peiser]] has served as co-editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multi-science.co.uk/ee.htm |title=Energy &amp; Environment |publisher=Multi-Science Publishing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819084743/http://www.multi-science.co.uk/ee.htm |archivedate=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate change denial and criticism ==
The journal is regarded as "a small journal that caters to climate change denialists".&lt;ref&gt;Riley Dunlap, Aaron M. McCright: ''Challenging Climate Change. The Denial Countermovement.'' In: Riley Dunlap, Robert J. Brulle (Hrsg.): ''Climate Change and Society. Sociological Perspectives. Report of the American Sociological Association’s Task Force on Sociology and Global Climate Change.'' Oxford University Press, 2015, 300–332, p 324 and 328.&lt;/ref&gt; It has played an important role in attacking climate science and scientists, for example [[Michael E. Mann]].&lt;ref name=Thacker/&gt;

Several scientists and socials scientists such [[Gavin Schmidt]], [[Roger A. Pielke, Jr.]] [[Stephan Lewandowsky]] and Michael Ashley, have criticised that ''E&amp;E'' has low standards of peer review and little impact.&lt;ref name=guardian-2011&gt;{{cite news|last=Barley|first=Shanta|title=Real Climate faces libel suit|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/25/real-climate-libel-threat|accessdate=11 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephan Lewandowsky]], Michael Ashley: [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/business-spectator/the-weird-and-wacky-world-of-climate-change-denial/news-story/ed530628e726d8476bcab2def209d86d The weird and wacky world of climate change denial]. The Australian. 22. june 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Ralph Keeling]] criticized a paper in the journal which claimed that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels were above 400 ppm in 1825, 1857 and 1942, writing in a letter to the editor, "Is it really the intent of E&amp;E to provide a forum for laundering pseudo-science?"&lt;ref name=guardian-2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Comment on "180 years of atmospheric CO2 gas analysis by chemical methods" by ernst-georg beck | author=Keeling, Ralph | journal=Energy &amp; Environment |date=September 2007  | volume=18 | issue=5 | pages=635–641 | doi=10.1260/0958-305x.18.5.635}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2005 article in ''[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]'' stated that the journal is "obscure" and that "scientific claims made in Energy &amp; Environment have little credibility among scientists."&lt;ref name="Thacker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realclimate.org/docs/thacker/skeptics.pdf | title=Skeptics get a journal | publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] | work=[[Environ.

Technol.]] | date=31 August 2005 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=Thacker, Paul D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehmer-Christiansen acknowledged that the journal's "impact rating has remained too low for many ambitious young researchers to use it", but blamed this on "the negative attitudes of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)/[[Climatic Research Unit]] people."&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/memo/climatedata/uc2602.htm Memorandum submitted by Dr Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen (CRU 26)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hans von Storch]], the journal “tries to give people who do not have a platform a platform,” which "is then attractive for skeptic papers. They know they can come through and that interested people make sure the paper enters the political realm.”&lt;ref name=Thacker/&gt;

When asked about the publication in the Spring of 2003 of a revised version of the paper at the center of the [[Soon and Baliunas controversy]], Boehmer-Christiansen said, "I'm following my political agenda -- a bit, anyway. But isn't that the right of the editor?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monastersky|first=Richard|title=Storm Brews Over Global Warming|journal=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=September 5, 2003|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Storm-Brews-Over-Global/27779/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Part of the journal's official [[mission statement]] reads: "E&amp;E has consistently striven to publish many ‘voices’ and to challenge conventional wisdoms. Perhaps more so than other European energy journal, the editor has made E&amp;E a forum for more sceptical analyses of ‘climate change’ and the advocated solutions".&lt;ref name=mission/&gt;

Environmental Modelling &amp; Software publishes contributions, in the form of research articles, reviews and short communications, on recent advances in environmental modelling and/or software. The aim is to improve our capacity to represent, understand, predict or manage the behaviour of environmental systems at all practical scales, and to communicate those improvements to a wide scientific and professional audience.

It seeks presentation of: 
• Generic frameworks, techniques and issues which either integrate a range of disciplines and sectors or apply across a range 
• Model development, model evaluation, process identification and applications in diverse sectors of the environment (as outlined below) provided they reveal insights and contribute to the store of knowledge. Insights can relate to the generality and limitations of the modelling, methods, the model application and/or the systems modelled. Insights should be ones that are generalizable in some way and are likely to be of interest to those studying other systems and, preferably, other system types.
• Development and application of environmental software, information and decision support systems
• Real-world applications of software technologies - particularly state-of-the-art environmental software able to deal with complex requirements, conflicting user perspectives, and/or evolving data structures. Aspects related to software usability, reliability, verification and validation should be backed up with quantitative results as much as possible. Development and maintenance costs, and adoption and penetration of the software in the target user groups should be addressed. Licensing issues and open source access should be clearly specified.
• Issues and methods related to the integrated modeling, assessment and management of environmental systems - including relevant policy and institutional analysis, public participation principles and methods, decision making methods, model integration, quality assurance and evaluation of models, data and procedure. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-modelling-and-software

'''Geikielite''' is a magnesium titanium [[oxide mineral]] with formula: MgTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a member of the [[ilmenite]] group. It crystallizes in the [[trigonal]] system forming typically opaque, black to reddish black crystals.

It was first described in 1892&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/046620b0 | title = Geikielite and Baddeleyite, Two New Mineral Species | year = 1892 | last1 = Fletcher | first1 = L. | journal = Nature | volume = 46 | issue = 1200 | pages = 620|bibcode = 1892Natur..46..620F }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an occurrence in the Ceylonese gem bearing gravel [[placer deposit|placers]]. It was named for Scottish geologist [[Sir Archibald Geikie]] (1835–1924).&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt; It occurs in [[Metamorphism|metamorphosed]] impure magnesian [[limestone]]s, in [[serpentinite]] derived from [[ultramafic rock]]s, in [[kimberlite]]s and [[carbonatite]]s.  Associated minerals include [[rutile]], [[spinel]], [[clinohumite]], [[perovskite]], [[diopside]], [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], [[forsterite]], [[brucite]], [[hydrotalcite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] and [[calcite]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1853">A '''graded shoreline''' is a stage in the cycle of coastal development characterised by a flat and straight [[coast]]line. It is formed under the influence of [[wind]] and water from the original [[bay]]s, [[island]]s, [[peninsula]]s and promontories. [[Sand]] and [[gravel]] is carried away and dumped at other locations depending on the direction and strength of [[sea current]]s. Typical of graded shorelines are the formation of [[dune]]s, wide sandy beaches and sometimes a [[lagoon]] or a [[spit (landform)|spit]]. Where two graded shorelines meet, a [[headland]] may form with a sandy [[reef]] in the sea beyond it. Parallel to the graded shoreline [[sandbank]]s may form as a result of sediments transported away from the shore. 

== Examples ==
*Long stretches of the southern [[Baltic Sea]] coast in the German state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], in [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]].
*The [[North Sea]] coast from [[Belgium]], along the outer edge of the [[Frisian Islands|Wadden Sea islands]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], to the west coast and northeast coast of [[Jutland]] in [[Denmark]].
*On the headland of Jutland near [[Skagen]] the two graded shorelines for the constantly changing promontory of [[Grenen]].
*On the island of [[Anholt (island)|Anholt]] in the [[Kattegat]], two graded shorelines meet at the eastern bill of Totten. This headland also extends far under the surface of the sea as a reef.
*The peninsula of [[Hel Peninsula|Hel]] in Poland consists of sediments carried eastwards from the [[Pomerania]]n coast, that are deposited in front of the [[Bay of Danzig]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">In [[English folklore]], '''grindylow''' or '''grundylow''' is a creature in the counties of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name=19th&gt;''The Nineteenth Century and After, Volume 68'' (1910). Leonard Scott Pub. Co. p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is thought to be connected to [[Grendel]],&lt;ref name=19th/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, Karl Georg (1906). ''A Grammar of the Dialect of Oldham''. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; a name or term used in ''[[Beowulf]]'' and in many [[Old English language|Old English]] [[charter]]s where it is seen in connection with [[mere (lake)|mere]]s, [[bogs]] and [[lake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heorot.dk/beowulf-rede-notes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Grindylows are said to grab children with their long sinewy arms and drown them if they come too close to the waters edge.&lt;ref name=lanc&gt;[[John Harland|Harland, John]] (1867).

==In popular culture==
* Grindylows appear in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books and films where they live in the lake near [[Hogwarts]]. They first appear in the novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' by [[J. K. Rowling]] and are described as sickly green creatures with sharp little horns, green teeth, and long spindly fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Rowling, J. K. (1999). ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">'''Gulf Gateway Deepwater Port''' was the first offshore [[liquefied natural gas]] LNG import facility&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-102/issue-14/transportation/first-offshore-lng-terminal-moves-ahead.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gulf Gateway was owned by Excelerate Energy Limited Partnership. It was located in Block 603 of the West Cameron Area, South Addition at a distance of approximately {{convert|116|mi|km}} from the [[Louisiana]] Coast, Gulf Gateway had a baseload capacity of {{convert|500|Mcuft|m3}} per day with a peak capacity of {{convert|690|Mcuft|m3}} per day&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshore-mag.com/articles/print/volume-65/issue-6/pipeline-transportation/energy-bridge-delivers-lng-to-gom.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike the four LNG terminals which were built in the US before it, Gulf Gateway utilized a special type of [[LNG Carrier]] which can vaporize LNG onboard the ship offshore rather than on land.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energy-pedia.com/news/usa/worlds-first-offshore-lng-terminal-in-operation&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition the vessel, the terminal consisted of a submerged turret loading (STL) buoy system&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nov.com/Segments/Completion_and_Production_Solutions/Floating_Production_Systems/APL_Mooring_and_Loading_Systems/Submerged_Turret_Loading.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;, a new-build piled platform to support a gas custody transfer metering station, and associated pipelines to connect the subsea offloading buoy system to two pipeline grids.

==History==
Offshore construction of Gulf Gateway commenced in August 2004 and was completed in February 2005 at a cost of approximately US $70 million. First cargo delivery occurred on March 17, 2005 from the world’s first Energy Bridge Regasification Vehicle (EBRV)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/64398-excelerate-buys-rights-to-el-paso-s-energy-bridge-lng-technology-takes-over-project&lt;/ref&gt; ,also known as a floating storage and regasification unit, the ''Excelsior''&lt;ref&gt;http://excelerateenergy.com/fleet/&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The Gulf Gateway was in operation in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] during [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Ike]] and was not affected by either storm&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/86552-first-deepwater-lng-import-facility-to-be-retired&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The terminal was closed in 2011&lt;ref&gt;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/08/14/2013-19687/gulf-gateway-deepwater-port-decommissioning-and-license-termination&lt;/ref&gt;, due to the shift in the supply-demand balance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/5123-marad-oks-retirement-of-first-lng-deepwater-facility&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States from the proliferation of [[shale gas]]. The components of the terminal were removed for use at other similar terminals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abarrelfull.wikidot.com/gulf-gateway-deepwater-port-lng-terminal "A Barrel Full", oil industry website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO), the '''highest registered air temperature on Earth''' was {{convert|56.7|C|F}} in [[Furnace Creek Ranch]], [[California]], located in the [[Death Valley]] desert in the [[United States]], on July 10, 1913.&lt;ref name="WMO-Highest"&gt;[http://wmo.asu.edu/content/world-highest-temperature World: Highest Temperature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714144146/https://wmo.asu.edu/content/world-highest-temperature|date=2017-07-14 }} [[World Meteorological Organization]] Retrieved 2 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020927021958/http://www0.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 September 2002 |title=NCDC Global measured extremes |accessdate=6 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GWR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-recorded-temperature/|title=Highest recorded temperature|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WMO itself admits that "[a]fter examining the temperature record in detail, [it was] noted that this temperature may be the result of a sandstorm that occurred at the time. Such a storm may have caused superheated surface materials to hit upon the temperature in the shelter" - what would mean the recording did not refer to air temperature.&lt;ref name="WMO-Highest" /&gt; Weather historians such as Christopher C. Burt also claim that the 1913 Death Valley reading is "a myth", and is at least {{convert|4|to|5|F-change}} too high.&lt;ref name="KPBS-report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/jul/15/doubts-cloud-death-valleys-100-year-heat-record/ |title=Doubts Cloud Death Valley's 100-year Heat Record|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same conclusion has also been reached by historians Dr. Arnold Court and William Taylor Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=   http://stormbruiser.com/chase/2013/08/29/death-valleys-134f-record-temperature-study-part-one/ |title=Death Valley's 134F Record Temperature Study Part One |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GWR"/&gt; If the 1913 record were to be decertified, the highest recorded air temperature on Earth would be {{convert|54.0|C|F}}, recorded both in Death Valley on June 20, 2013, and in [[Mitribah]], [[Kuwait]] on July 21, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Samenow|first1=Jason|title=New analysis shreds claim that Death Valley recorded Earth’s highest temperature in 1913|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/10/25/new-analysis-shreds-claim-that-death-valley-recorded-earths-hottest-temperature-in-1913/|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurements==
===Air and ground temperature===
The standard measuring conditions for temperature are in the air, 1.5 meters above the ground, and shielded from direct sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mildrexler | first1 = David J. | last2 = Zhao | first2 = Maosheng | last3 = Running | first3 = Steven W. | title = Satellite Finds Highest Land Skin Temperatures on Earth | url = http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2011BAMS3067.1 | journal = Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society | volume = 2011 | pages = 855–860 | doi = 10.1175/2011BAMS3067.1 | bibcode = 2011BAMS...92..855M }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1922 until 2012, the WMO record for the highest official temperature on Earth was {{convert|57.8|C|F}}, registered on September 13, 1922 in [[‘Aziziya]], [[Libya]]. In January 2012, the WMO decertified the 1922 record, citing persuasive evidence that it was a faulty reading recorded in error by an inexperienced observer. &lt;ref name="WMO-Highest" /&gt; Temperatures measured directly on the ground may exceed air temperatures by 30 to 50&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=running2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mildrexler | first1 = David J. | last2 = Zhao | first2 = Maosheng | last3 = Running | first3 = Steven W. | year = | title = Satellite Finds Highest Land Skin Temperatures on Earth | url = http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2011BAMS3067.1 | journal = Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society | volume = 2011 | issue = | pages = 855–860 [855–857] | doi = 10.1175/2011BAMS3067.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical maximum possible ground surface temperature has been estimated to be between 90 and 100&amp;nbsp;°C (between 194 and 212 °F) for dry, darkish soils of low [[thermal conductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0450%281992%29031%3C1096%3AEMLST%3E2.0.CO%3B2 Extreme Maximum Land Surface Temperatures], J. R. Garratt, Journal of Applied Meteorology, '''31''', #9 (September 1992), pp. 1096–1105, {{doi|10.1175/1520-0450(1992)031&lt;1096:EMLST&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no '''highest confirmed ground temperature''', a reading of 93.9&amp;nbsp;°C (201&amp;nbsp;°F) was allegedly recorded in [[Furnace Creek Ranch]] on July 15, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;A possible world record maximum natural ground surface temperature, Paul Kubecka, ''Weather'', '''56''', #7 (July 2001), ''Weather'', pp. 218-221, {{doi|10.1002/j.1477-8696.2001.tb06577.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite measurements===
Temperature measurements via [[satellite]] also tend to capture occurrence of higher records but, due to complications involving satellite's altitude loss (a side effect of atmospheric friction), these measurements are often considered less reliable than ground-positioned thermometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How accurate are satellite measured temperatures of the troposphere?|url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/climatechange/some-of-the-issues-with-satell/54879902|website=AccuWeather|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest recorded temperature taken by a satellite is {{convert|66.8|C|F}}, which was measured in the [[Flaming Mountains]] of [[China]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Satellite Finds Highest Land  Skin Temperatures on Earth|date=July 2011|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2011BAMS3067.1|accessdate=20 October 2014|doi=10.1175/2011BAMS3067.1|volume=92|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|pages=855–860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other satellite measurements of ground temperature taken between 2003 and 2009, taken with the [[MODIS]] [[infrared]] spectroradiometer on the [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellite, found a maximum temperature of 70.7&amp;nbsp;°C (159.3&amp;nbsp;°F), which was recorded in 2005 in the [[Lut Desert]], [[Iran]]. The Lut Desert was also found to have the highest maximum temperature in 5 of the 7 years measured (2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009). These measurements reflect averages over a large region and so are lower than the maximum point surface temperature.&lt;ref name=running2011 /&gt;

The following are unverified claims of extreme heat '''over''' the current world record of {{convert|56.7|C|F}}. &lt;!--The former world record of 57.8 °C (136.0 °F) was disproven, and thus is not included.--&gt;

The [[State of North Carolina]] has a group of ten [[protected area]]s known as '''State Forests''' which are managed by the [[North Carolina Forest Service]], an agency of the [[North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]].  The seven of the [[state forests]] are known as ''State Educational Forests'', and they are primarily used to educate the public about the forest [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[forestry]] and [[forest management]].  One state forest was designated as a ''State Recreational Forest'' in recognition of its high recreational value and use.  All the state forests provide some recreational facilities for [[hiking]] and [[picnicking]].

There are at least 2109 species of dicotyledons found in [[Montana]] according to the Montana Field Guide. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fieldguide.mt.gov/displayOrders.aspx?class=Dicotyledoneae |title=Montana Field Guide-Dicotyledoneae |publisher=Montana Natural Heritage Program |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a list of [[Dicotyledoneae]] [[Order (biology)|order]]s found in Montana. The [[Montana Natural Heritage Program]] has identified a number of dicot species as "Species of Concern".&lt;ref&gt;"Species of Concern are native taxa that are at-risk due to declining population trends, threats to their habitats, restricted distribution, and/or other factors.  Designation as a Montana Species of Concern or Potential Species of Concern is based on the Montana Status Rank, and is not a statutory or regulatory classification.  Rather, these designations provide information that helps resource managers make proactive decisions regarding species conservation and data collection priorities.  See the latest Species of Concern Reports for more detailed explanations and assessment criteria." {{cite web |url=http://fieldguide.mt.gov/statusCodes.aspx#soc |title=Montana Field Guide-Species of Concern |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these species are [[Introduced species|exotics]] (not native to Montana).&lt;ref&gt;Exotic species have been deliberately or accidentally introduced to areas outside of their native geographic range and are able to reproduce and maintain sustainable populations in these areas.  These exotic populations may also be referred to as alien, introduced, invasive, non-native, or non-indigenous. {{cite web |url=http://fieldguide.mt.gov/statusCodes.aspx#exotic |title=Species Status Codes, Exotics |publisher=Montana Natural Heritage Project |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Polynesian mythology]] (specifically [[Samoa]]), '''Mafui'e''' is the god of [[earthquake]]s.

Mafui'e was also the keeper of [[fire]]. [[Ti'iti'i]], a demi-god, won the fire from him in a battle; thus, fire was brought to the people of Samoa.

A '''magnetohydrodynamic converter''' ('''MHD converter''') is an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[machine]] with no [[moving parts]] involving [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the study of the [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] of [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrically conductive]] [[fluid]]s ([[liquid]] or [[Plasma (physics)|ionized gas)]] in the presence of [[electromagnetic field]]s. Such converters act on the fluid using the [[Lorentz force]] to operate in two possible ways: either as an [[electric generator]] called an [[magnetohydrodynamic generator|MHD generator]], extracting energy from a fluid in motion; or as an [[electric motor]] called an MHD accelerator or [[magnetohydrodynamic drive]], putting a fluid in motion by injecting energy. MHD converters are indeed reversible, like many electromagnetic devices.&lt;ref name="The Silence Barrier"&gt;{{cite book

[[Michael Faraday]] first attempted to test an MHD converter in 1832. MHD converters involving plasmas were highly studied in the 1960s and 1970s, with many [[Subsidy|government funding]] and dedicated [[Academic conference|international conferences]]. The research almost stopped after it was considered the [[electrothermal instability]] would severely limit the [[efficiency]] of such converters when intense magnetic fields are used,&lt;ref name="Velikhov 1965"&gt;

== MHD power generation ==
{{main|Magnetohydrodynamic generator}}
A [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]] is an MHD converter that transforms the [[kinetic energy]] of an electrically conductive fluid, in motion with respect to a steady magnetic field, into [[electricity]]. MHD power generation has been tested extensively in the 1960s with [[liquid metal]]s and plasmas as working fluids.&lt;ref name="Haines 1974"&gt;{{cite journal

Basically, a plasma is hurtling down within a channel whose walls are fitted with electrodes. Electromagnets create a uniform transverse magnetic field within the cavity of the channel. The Lorentz force then acts upon the trajectory of the incoming electrons and positive ions, separating the opposite [[charge carrier]]s according to their sign. As negative and positive charges are spatially separated within the chamber, an [[voltage|electric potential difference]] can be retrieved across the electrodes. While work is extracted from the kinetic energy of the incoming high-velocity plasma, the fluid slows down during the process.

== MHD propulsion ==
{{main|Magnetohydrodynamic drive}}
A [[Magnetohydrodynamic drive|magnetohydrodynamic accelerator]] is an MHD converter that imparts motion to an electrically conductive fluid initially at rest, using cross electric current and magnetic field both applied within the fluid. MHD propulsion has been mostly tested with models of ships and submarines in [[seawater]].&lt;ref name="PopMech 1990"&gt;{{cite magazine

In an MHD accelerator, the Lorentz force accelerates all charge carriers in the same direction whatever their sign, as well as neutral atoms and molecules of the fluid through collisions. The fluid is ejected toward the rear and as a reaction, the vehicle accelerates forward.

[[File:World Access to Electricity 2012 cropped.png|thumb|300px|World map showing the percentage of the population in each country with access to mains electricity (as of 2012), a measure of the extent of [[electrification]].]]
'''Mains electricity''' (as it is known in the UK and Canada; US terms include '''grid power''', '''wall power''', and '''domestic power''') is the general-purpose [[Alternating current|alternating-current]] (AC) [[electric power]] supply. It is the form of [[electrical power]] that is delivered to homes and businesses, and it is the form of electrical power that consumers use when they plug domestic appliances, televisions and electric lamps into wall outlets.

The two principal properties of the electric power supply, [[voltage]] and [[utility frequency|frequency]], differ between regions. A voltage of (nominally) 230&amp;nbsp;V and a frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz is used in Europe, most of Africa, most of Asia, much of South America and Australia. In North America, the most common combination is 120&amp;nbsp;V and a frequency of 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.  Other voltages exist, and some countries may have, for example, 230&amp;nbsp;V but 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. This is a concern to travellers, since portable appliances designed for one voltage and frequency combination may not operate with, or may even be destroyed by another. The use of different and incompatible [[AC power plugs and sockets|plugs and sockets]] in different regions and countries provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements.

==Terminology==
[[File:Mains powered electric Lamp.JPG|thumb| A table lamp connected to a wall socket (the mains)]]
In the US, mains electric power is referred to by several names including "household power", "household electricity", "house current", "powerline", "domestic power", "wall power", "line power", "AC power", "city power", "street power".

In the UK, mains electric power is generally referred to as "the mains".

==Power systems==
''For a list of voltages, frequencies, and wall plugs by country, see [[Mains electricity by country]]''

Worldwide, many different [[Mains electricity by country|mains power systems]] are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting. The different systems are primarily characterized by their
* [[Voltage]]
* [[Utility frequency|Frequency]]
* [[Domestic AC power plugs and sockets|Plugs and sockets]] (receptacles or outlets)
* [[Earthing system]] (grounding)
* Protection against [[overcurrent]] damage (e.g., due to short circuit), [[electric shock]], and fire hazards
* Parameter tolerances.

All these parameters vary among regions. The voltages are generally in the range 100–240 [[Volt|V]] (always expressed as [[root-mean-square]] voltage). The two commonly used frequencies are 50&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. [[Single-phase electric power|Single-phase]] or [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] power is most commonly used today, although two-phase systems were used early in the 20th century. Foreign enclaves, such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases, may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas. Some city areas may use standards different from that of the surrounding countryside (e.g. in [[Libya]]). Regions in an effective state of [[anarchy]] may have no central electrical authority, with electric power provided by incompatible private sources.

Many other combinations of voltage and [[utility frequency]] were formerly used, with frequencies between 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and 133&amp;nbsp;Hz and voltages from 100&amp;nbsp;V to 250&amp;nbsp;V. [[Direct current]] (DC) has been almost completely displaced by [[alternating current]] (AC) in public power systems, but DC was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century. The modern combinations of 230&amp;nbsp;V/50&amp;nbsp;Hz and 120&amp;nbsp;V/60&amp;nbsp;Hz, listed in [[IEC 60038]], did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal. Industrial plants with [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase power]] will have different, higher voltages installed for large equipment (and different sockets and plugs), but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment.

==Common uses of electricity==
Electricity is used for lighting, heating, cooling, electric motors and electronic equipment.  The [[US Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) has published:

'''Estimated US residential electricity consumption by end use, for the year 2016'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=96&amp;t=3], How is electricity used in U.S. homes?, [[US Energy Information Administration]], 21 April 2015, (retrieved 26 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic appliances (such as those in the televisions, computer and related equipment categories above, representing 9% of the total), typically use an AC to DC converter or [[AC adapter]] to power the device. This is often capable of operation over the approximate range of 100&amp;nbsp;V to 250&amp;nbsp;V and at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. The other categories are typically AC applications and usually have much more restricted input ranges. A study by the [[Building Research Establishment]] in the UK states that "The existing 230&amp;nbsp;V system is well suited to the future of electricity whether through design or Darwinian processes. Any current perceived weakness is generally a result of cost reduction and market forces rather than any fundamental technical difficulties. Questions as to whether there are alternatives to the existing 230&amp;nbsp;V AC system are often overshadowed by legacy issues, the future smart agenda and cost in all but specific situations. Where opportunities do exist they are often for specific parts of the overall load and often small parts in terms of total demand."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/w/images/b/b7/The_Future_of_Electricity_in_Domestic_Buildings.pdf], The Future of Electricity in Domestic Buildings – a review, Andrew Williams, 28 November 2015, (retrieved 26 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building wiring==
{{see also|Electrical wiring}}
In many countries, household power is [[single-phase electric power]], with two or three wired contacts at each outlet. Neutral and line&lt;!-- a common error is to refer to line as live, but the term "live" technically applies to both conductors collectively as neutral is also live --&gt; wires carry current and are defined as live parts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=83v7hptwljkC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=live+parts+energized+conductive+components&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AdIzUZLYKNK90QGy-YGQCA&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=live%20parts%20energized%20conductive%20components&amp;f=false]''Electrical Inspection Manual, 2011 Edition''], Noel Williams &amp; Jeffrey S Sargent, Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers, 2012, p.249 (retrieved 3 March 2013 from Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4kugySmaTeAC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22live+part%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W_Y3Ua7JFMH90gGJ0oDAAw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22live%20part%22&amp;f=false]''17th Edition IEE Wiring Regulations: Explained and Illustrated''], Brian Scaddan, Routledge, 2011, p.18 (retrieved 6 March 2013 from Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''line wire''' (also known as '''phase''', '''hot''' or '''active''' contact, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as ''live''), carries [[alternating current]] between the [[grid (electricity)|power grid]] and the household.
* The '''[[neutral wire]]''' completes the electrical circuit—remaining at a voltage in proximity to 0&amp;nbsp;V—by also carrying [[alternating current]] between the [[grid (electricity)|power grid]] and the household. The neutral is connected to the ground (Earth), and therefore has nearly the same [[electrical potential]] as the earth. This prevents the power circuits from increasing beyond earth voltage, such as when they are struck by lightning or become otherwise charged.
* The '''[[Ground (electricity)|earth wire]]''' or '''ground''' connects the chassis of equipment to earth ground as a protection against faults ([[electric shock]]), such as if the insulation on a "hot" wire becomes damaged and the bare wire comes into contact with the metal chassis or case of the equipment.
{{details|Ground and neutral}}
* Mixed 230&amp;nbsp;V / 400&amp;nbsp;V [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] (common in northern and central Europe) or 230&amp;nbsp;V [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] based household wiring

In northern and central Europe, residential electrical supply is commonly 400&amp;nbsp;V three-phase electric power, which gives 230&amp;nbsp;V between any single phase and neutral; house wiring may be a mix of three-phase and single-phase circuits, but three-phase residential use is rare in the UK. High-power appliances such as [[kitchen stove]]s, water heaters and maybe household power heavy tools like [[log splitter]]s may be supplied from the 400&amp;nbsp;V three-phase power supply.

Various [[earthing system]]s are used to ensure that the ground and neutral wires have zero voltage with respect to earth, to prevent shocks when touching grounded electrical equipment. In some installations, there may be two line conductors which carry [[alternating current]]s in a [[split-phase electric power|single-phase three-wire]]. Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables (these exist with either two or three insulated conductors) terminated in a [[Domestic AC power plugs and sockets|plug]], which is inserted into a fixed receptacle (socket). Larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building. For example, in North American homes a window-mounted self-contained [[air conditioner]] unit would be connected to a wall plug, whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired. Larger [[Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets|plug and socket combinations]] are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents, higher voltages, or three phase electric power. These are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weather-resistant properties needed in some applications.

[[Circuit breaker]]s and [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s are used to detect [[short circuit]]s between the line and neutral or ground wires or the drawing of more current than the wires are rated to handle (overload protection) to prevent overheating and possible fire. These protective devices are usually mounted in a central panel—most commonly a distribution board or consumer unit—in a building, but some wiring systems also provide a protection device at the socket or within the plug. [[Residual-current device]]s, also known as ground-fault circuit interrupters and appliance leakage current interrupters, are used to detect ''ground faults'' - flow of current in other than the neutral and line wires (like the ground wire or a person). When a ground fault is detected, the device quickly cuts off the circuit.

== Voltage levels ==
Most of [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and most of [[South America]] use a supply that is within 6% of 230&amp;nbsp;V. In the [[UK]] and Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerlogic.com.au/Attachments/Voltage%20and%20Equipment%20Standard%20Misalignment%20PaperV.pdf|title=Voltage and Equipment Standard Misalignment|first1=Chris|last1=Halliday||first2=Dave|last2=Urquhart|website=powerlogic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nominal supply voltage is 230&amp;nbsp;V +10%/−6% to accommodate the fact that most supplies are in fact still 240&amp;nbsp;V. The [[United States]] uses a supply voltage of 120 volts +/- 6%. [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[North America]], [[Central America]] and some parts of northern South America use a voltage between 100&amp;nbsp;V and 127&amp;nbsp;V. The 230&amp;nbsp;V standard has become widespread so that 230&amp;nbsp;V equipment can be used in most parts of the world with the aid of an [[adapter]] or a change to the equipment's connection plug for the specific country.

===Measuring voltage===
A distinction should be made between the voltage at the point of supply (nominal voltage at the point of interconnection between the electrical utility and the user) and the voltage rating of the equipment (utilization voltage). Typically the utilization voltage is 3% to 5% lower than the nominal system voltage; for example, a nominal 208&amp;nbsp;V supply system will be connected to motors with "200&amp;nbsp;V" on their nameplates. This allows for the [[voltage drop]] between equipment and supply. Voltages in this article are the nominal supply voltages and equipment used on these systems will carry slightly lower nameplate voltages. Power distribution system voltage is nearly sinusoidal in nature. Voltages are expressed as [[root mean square]] (RMS) voltage. Voltage tolerances are for steady-state operation. Momentary heavy loads, or switching operations in the power distribution network, may cause short-term deviations out of the tolerance band and storms and other unusual conditions may cause even larger transient variations. In general, power supplies derived from large networks with many sources are more stable than those supplied to an isolated community with perhaps only a single generator.

===Choice of voltage===
{{Main|Mains electricity by country}}
The choice of supply voltage is due more to historical reasons than optimization of the electric power distribution system&amp;mdash;once a voltage is in use and equipment using this voltage is widespread, changing voltage is a drastic and expensive measure. A 230&amp;nbsp;V distribution system will use less conductor material than a 120&amp;nbsp;V system to deliver a given amount of power because the current, and consequently the resistive loss, is lower. While large heating appliances can use smaller conductors at 230&amp;nbsp;V for the same output rating, few household appliances use anything like the full capacity of the outlet to which they are connected. Minimum wire size for hand-held or portable equipment is usually restricted by the mechanical strength of the conductors. Electrical appliances are used extensively in homes in both 230&amp;nbsp;V and 120&amp;nbsp;V system countries. National electrical codes prescribe [[Electrical wiring|wiring methods]] intended to minimize the risk of electric shock and fire.

Many areas, such as the US, which use (nominally) 120&amp;nbsp;V make use of [[Split-phase electric power|three-wire, split-phase]] 240&amp;nbsp;V systems to supply large appliances. In this system a 240&amp;nbsp;V supply has a centre-tapped neutral to give two 120&amp;nbsp;V supplies which can also supply 240&amp;nbsp;V to loads connected between the two line wires. [[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] systems can be connected to give various combinations of voltage, suitable for use by different classes of equipment. Where both single-phase and three-phase loads are served by an electrical system, the system may be labelled with both voltages such as 120/208 or 230/400&amp;nbsp;V, to show the line-to-neutral voltage and the line-to-line voltage. Large loads are connected for the higher voltage. Other three-phase voltages, up to 830 volts, are occasionally used for special-purpose systems such as oil well pumps. Large industrial motors (say, more than 250&amp;nbsp;hp or 150&amp;nbsp;kW) may operate on medium voltage. On 60&amp;nbsp;Hz systems a standard for medium voltage equipment is 2400/4160&amp;nbsp;V (2300/4000&amp;nbsp;V in the US) whereas 3300&amp;nbsp;V is the common standard for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz systems.

===Standardisation===
Following voltage harmonisation, electricity supplies within the [[European Union]] are now nominally 230&amp;nbsp;V ±10% at 50 [[Hertz|Hz]].&lt;ref&gt;CENELEC Harmonisation Document HD 472 S1:1988&lt;/ref&gt;  For a transition period (1995–2008), countries that had previously used 220&amp;nbsp;V changed to a narrower asymmetric tolerance range of 230&amp;nbsp;V +6%/−10% and those (like the UK) that had previously used 240&amp;nbsp;V changed to 230&amp;nbsp;V +10%/−6%.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard BS 7697: Nominal voltages for low voltage public electricity supply systems — (Implementation of HD 472 S1)&lt;/ref&gt;  No change in voltage is required by either system as both 220&amp;thinsp;V and 240&amp;thinsp;V fall within the lower 230&amp;nbsp;V tolerance bands (230&amp;nbsp;V ±6%).  Some areas of the UK still have 250&amp;nbsp;volts for legacy reasons, but these also fall within the 10% tolerance band of 230&amp;nbsp;volts.  In practice, this allows countries to continue to supply the same voltage (220 or 240&amp;thinsp;V), at least until existing supply transformers are replaced.  Equipment (with the exception of [[filament bulb]]s) used in these countries is designed to accept any voltage within the specified range.  In the United States&lt;ref&gt;[[ANSI]] C84.1: [http://www.nema.org/stds/c84-1.cfm American National Standard for Electric Power Systems and Equipment—Voltage Ratings (60 Hertz)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727234316/http://www.nema.org/stds/c84-1.cfm |date=27 July 2007 }}, NEMA (costs $95 for access)&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]] CAN3-C235-83: Preferred Voltage Levels for AC Systems, 0 to 50&amp;thinsp;000&amp;nbsp;V&lt;/ref&gt; national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120&amp;nbsp;V and allow a range of 114&amp;nbsp;V to 126&amp;nbsp;V ([[Root Mean Square|RMS]]) (−5% to +5%).  Historically 110&amp;nbsp;V, 115&amp;nbsp;V and 117&amp;nbsp;V have been used at different times and places in North America.  Mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110&amp;nbsp;V; however, 120&amp;nbsp;V is the nominal voltage.

In 2000, [[Australia]] converted to 230&amp;nbsp;V as the nominal standard with a tolerance of +10%/−6%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Renewable Energy Integration: Challenges and Solutions |author1=Hossain, J.|author2=Mahmud, A.| publisher=Springer |isbn=9789814585279|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tI_EBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=as60038&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgjvnzk9XYAhULBcAKHVHcDPkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=as60038&amp;f=false |page=71|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; this superseding the old 240&amp;nbsp;V standard, AS2926-1987.  As in the UK, 240&amp;nbsp;V is within the allowable limits and "240 volt" is a synonym for mains in [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[British English]].  In [[Japan]], the electrical power supply to households is at 100&amp;nbsp;V. Eastern and northern parts of [[Honshū]] (including [[Tokyo]]) and [[Hokkaidō]] have a frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, whereas western Honshū (including Nagoya, Osaka, and Hiroshima), [[Shikoku]], [[Kyūshū]] and [[Okinawa]] operate at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The boundary between the two regions contains four back-to-back [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) substations which interconnect the power between the two grid systems; these are [[Shin Shinano]], [[Sakuma Dam#HVDC frequency converter|Sakuma Dam]], [[Minami-Fukumitsu]], and the [[Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter]].  To accommodate the difference, frequency-sensitive appliances marketed in Japan can often be switched between the two frequencies.

The world's first public electricity supply was a [[water wheel]] driven system constructed in the small English town of [[Godalming]] in 1881.  It was an [[alternating current]] (AC) system using a Siemens alternator supplying power for both street lights and consumers at two voltages, 250&amp;nbsp;V for arc lamps, and 40&amp;nbsp;V for incandescent lamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/themes/places/surrey/waverley/godalming/godalming_electricity/ |title=Godalming: Electricity |website= Exploring Surrey's Past |publisher=Surrey County Council |accessdate= 6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first large scale central plant—[[Thomas Edison]]’s [[Holborn Viaduct power station|steam powered station at Holborn Viaduct]] in [[London]]—started operation in January 1882, providing [[direct current]] (DC) at 110&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://ntmm.org/~nt/elecpow/history/electricity_supply_in_the_uk__a_chronology_ocrnopic.pdf |publisher=The [[Electricity Council]] |title=Electricity Supply in the United Kingdom |date=1987 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401145847/https://ntmm.org/~nt/elecpow/history/electricity_supply_in_the_uk__a_chronology_ocrnopic.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holborn Viaduct station was used as a [[proof of concept]] for the construction of the much larger [[Pearl Street Station]] in [[Manhattan]], the world's first permanent commercial central power plant. The Pearl Street Station also provided DC at 110&amp;nbsp;V, considered to be a "safe" voltage for consumers, beginning September 4, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ethw.org/Milestones:Pearl_Street_Station,_1882 |title=Milestones:Pearl Street Station, 1882 |website= Engineering and Technology History Wiki |publisher=United Engineering Foundation  |accessdate= 6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AC systems started appearing in the US in the mid&amp;ndash;1880s, using higher distribution voltage stepped down via [[transformer]]s to the same 110&amp;nbsp;V customer utilization voltage that Edison used. In 1883 Edison patented a [[Split-phase electric power|three&amp;ndash;wire]] distribution system to allow DC generation plants to serve a wider radius of customers to save on copper costs. By connecting two groups of 110&amp;nbsp;V lamps in series more load could be served by the same size conductors run with 220&amp;nbsp;V between them; a neutral conductor carried any imbalance of current between the two sub-circuits. AC circuits adopted the same form during the [[War of Currents]], allowing lamps to be run at around 110&amp;nbsp;V and major appliances to be connected to 220&amp;nbsp;V.  Nominal voltages gradually crept upward to 112&amp;nbsp;V and 115&amp;nbsp;V, or even 117&amp;nbsp;V.{{cn|date=December 2017}} After [[World War II]] the standard voltage in the U.S. became 117&amp;nbsp;V, but many areas lagged behind even into the 1960s.{{cn|date=December 2017}} In 1967 the nominal voltage rose to 120&amp;nbsp;V, but conversion of appliances was slow.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Today, virtually all American homes and businesses have access to 120 and 240&amp;nbsp;V at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.  Both voltages are available on the three wires (two "hot" legs of opposite phase and one "neutral" leg).

In 1899, the Berliner Elektrizitäts-Werke (BEW), a [[Berlin]] electrical utility, decided to greatly increase its distribution capacity by switching to 220&amp;nbsp;V nominal distribution, taking advantage of the higher voltage capability of newly developed metal filament lamps. The company was able to offset the cost of converting the customer's equipment by the resulting saving in distribution conductors cost. This became the model for electrical distribution in Germany and the rest of Europe and the 220&amp;nbsp;V system became common. North American practice remained with voltages near 110&amp;nbsp;V for lamps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas P. Hughes]], ''Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society 1880-1930'', The Johns Hopkins University Press,Baltimore 1983 {{ISBN|0-8018-2873-2}} pg. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decade after the introduction of alternating current in the US (from the early 1880s to about 1893) a variety of different frequencies were used, with each electric provider setting their own, so that no single one prevailed.  The most common frequency was 133⅓&amp;nbsp;Hz.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The rotation speed of induction generators and motors, the efficiency of transformers, and flickering of carbon arc lamps all played a role in frequency setting.  Around 1893 the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric Company]] in the United States and [[AEG]] in Germany decided to standardize their generation equipment on 60&amp;nbsp;Hz and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz respectively, eventually leading to most of the world being supplied at one of these two frequencies. Today most 60&amp;nbsp;Hz systems deliver nominal 120/240&amp;nbsp;V, and most 50&amp;nbsp;Hz nominally 230&amp;nbsp;V. The significant exceptions are in Brazil, which has a synchronized 60&amp;nbsp;Hz grid with both 127&amp;nbsp;V and 220&amp;nbsp;V as standard voltages in different regions, and [[Electricity sector in Japan#Transmission|Japan, which has two frequencies]]: 50&amp;nbsp;Hz for East Japan and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz for West Japan.

==Voltage regulation==
To maintain the voltage at the customer's service within the acceptable range, electrical distribution utilities use [[Voltage regulator|regulating equipment]] at [[electrical substation]]s or along the distribution line. At a substation, the step-down [[transformer]] will have an automatic on-load tap changer, allowing the ratio between transmission voltage and distribution voltage to be adjusted in steps. For long (several kilometres) rural distribution circuits, automatic voltage regulators may be mounted on poles of the distribution line. These are [[autotransformer]]s, again, with on-load tapchangers to adjust the ratio depending on the observed voltage changes. At each customer's service, the step-down transformer has up to five taps to allow some range of adjustment, usually ±5% of the nominal voltage. Since these taps are not automatically controlled, they are used only to adjust the long-term average voltage at the service and not to regulate the voltage seen by the utility customer.

==Power quality==
{{Main|Power quality}}
The stability of the voltage and frequency supplied to customers varies among countries and regions. "Power quality" is a term describing the degree of deviation from the nominal supply voltage and frequency. Short-term surges and drop-outs affect sensitive electronic equipment such as computers and [[flat panel display]]s. Longer-term power outages, [[Brownout (electricity)|brown-out]]s and [[Power outage|black out]]s and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers, who may have to invest in [[uninterruptible power supply]] or stand-by [[Engine-generator|generator]] sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable. Erratic power supply may be a severe economic handicap to businesses and public services which rely on electrical machinery, illumination, climate control and computers. Even the best quality power system may have breakdowns or require servicing. As such, companies, governments and other organizations sometimes have backup generators at sensitive facilities, to ensure that power will be available even in the event of a power outage or black out.

Power quality can also be affected by distortions of the current or voltage waveform in the form of [[Total harmonic distortion|harmonics]] of the fundamental (supply) frequency, or non-harmonic [[Intermodulation|(inter)modulation distortion]] such as that caused by [[Electromagnetic interference|RFI or EMI interference]].  In contrast, harmonic distortion is usually caused by conditions of the load or generator. In multi-phase power, phase shift distortions caused by imbalanced loads can occur.

The '''Nelson Coast temperate forests''' are an [[ecoregion]] in [[New Zealand]].

==Location and description==
These forests are located on the flanks of the [[Paparoa Range]] and other mountains at the top of [[South Island]]. The area is thickly forested and has high rainfall, especially on the west-facing slopes but less so on the sheltered eastern side, which has golden sand beaches. Natural features of the region include: the limestone Pancake Rocks near the town of [[Punakaiki]] on the edge of [[Paparoa National Park]]; [[Farewell Spit]] at the north of the island, the longest [[Spit (landform)|sandspit]] in New Zealand; the nearby [[Te Waikoropupu Springs]]; and the [[karst]] areas on the flanks of [[Mount Owen, New Zealand]] in [[Kahurangi National Park]].

==Flora==
[[File:Dracophyllum traversii fragment2.jpg|thumb|''Dracophyllum traversii'' on Mount Arthur, Kahurangi National Park]]
There are small areas of [[Metrosideros robusta|northern rata]] ''(Metrosideros robusta)'', [[Dacrydium cupressinum|rimu]], and [[Prumnopitys ferruginea|miro]] [[rainforest]] hardwoods as well as [[Corynocarpus laevigatus|karaka]] ''(Corynocarpus laevigatus)'' and the [[Nikau]] palm ''(Rhopalostylis sapida)'' near the coast. However most of the area is covered in [[Nothofagus|Southern beech]] forest containing of all four species of Southern beech; [[Nothofagus fusca|red beech]], [[Nothofagus menziesii|silver beech]] and [[Nothofagus truncata|hard beech]] in the lowlands and [[Nothofagus solandri|mountain beech]] higher up. In the less fertile rocks areas there are yellow pine ''([[Halocarpus biformis]])'' and [[Dracophyllum]]s including the endemic D. townsonii and the mountain neinei (D. traversii). The alpine plants found here including [[Celmisia]] dallii occur as these peaks, along with [[Fiordland]] at the southern end of the island, were a high-altitude refuge from the effects of the last [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa0404|name=Nelson Coast temperate forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
The forests are home to a number of [[endemic species]] including two flightless birds that no longer survive in the lowland areas of the island, these are the western [[weka]] and the largest kiwi, the [[great spotted kiwi]]. The varied habitats in the region support a mixture of other birds found here include the [[kea]], the [[New Zealand kaka]] parrot'' (Nestor meridionalis)'', the [[New Zealand pigeon]] or kereru ''(Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae)'' and the [[New Zealand falcon]] or karearea ''(Falco novaeseelandiae)''. Farewell Spit in particular is an important site for wading birds and is on a migration route. 
The area is also rich in invertebrates including almost half of the known species of amber snails ''([[Powelliphanta]])''.

==Threats and preservation==
The forests are threatened by logging and mining, although it is impossible to get permits for large-scale mining in the Kahurangi. The [[karst]] limestone is particularly fragile and even damaged by recreational [[caving]]. The wildlife is threatened by [[introduced species]] but they are largely intact at higher elevations. Much of the ecoregion is protected within three national parks; the large [[Kahurangi National Park]] and [[Paparoa National Park]]s on the west coast, and [[Abel Tasman National Park]] on the north east coast. The coastline is unspoilt too and some of it, including Farewell Spit, is protected as nature reserves of national parks. Efforts are being made to control invasive introduced species, particularly [[common brushtail possum|possums]] although deer, [[chamois]], hares and goats are also targeted for control. Birds eggs and snails are vulnerable to rats, possums, [[Mustela erminea|stoats]] and [[Sus scrofa|wild pigs]]. Forest fires are always a threat.

'''Ocean thermal energy conversion''' ('''OTEC''') uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer shallow or surface [[seawater]]s to run a [[heat engine]] and produce useful work, usually in the form of electricity.  OTEC can operate with a very high [[capacity factor]] and so can operate in [[base load]] mode.

Among ocean energy sources, OTEC is one of the continuously available [[renewable energy resource]]s that could contribute to base-load power supply.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lewis, Anthony, et al. IPCC: Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The resource potential for OTEC is considered to be much larger than for other ocean energy forms [World Energy Council, 2000]. Up to 88,000 [[TWh]]/yr of power could be generated from OTEC without affecting the ocean’s thermal structure [Pelc and Fujita, 2002].

Systems may be either closed-cycle or open-cycle. Closed-cycle OTEC uses working fluids that are typically thought of as [[refrigerant]]s such as [[ammonia]] or [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134a]]. These fluids have low boiling points, and are therefore suitable for powering the system’s generator to generate electricity. The most commonly used heat cycle for OTEC to date is the [[Rankine cycle]], using a low-pressure turbine. Open-cycle engines use vapour from the [[seawater]] itself as the working fluid.

OTEC can also supply quantities of cold water as a by-product. This can be used for air conditioning and refrigeration and the nutrient-rich deep ocean water can feed biological technologies. Another by-product is [[fresh water]] distilled from the sea.&lt;ref name="PopSci95"/&gt;

OTEC theory was first developed in the 1880s and the first bench size demonstration model was constructed in 1926. Currently the world's only operating OTEC plant is in Japan, overseen by [[Saga University]].

== History ==

Attempts to develop and refine OTEC technology started in the 1880s. In 1881, [[Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval]], a French [[Physics|physicist]], proposed tapping the thermal energy of the ocean. D'Arsonval's student, [[Georges Claude]], built the first OTEC plant, in Matanzas, [[Cuba]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Renewable Energy From the Ocean: A Guide to OTEC.	New York: Oxford University Press. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Claude constructed a plant aboard a 10,000-[[ton]] cargo vessel moored off the coast of Brazil. Weather and waves destroyed it before it could generate net power.&lt;ref name=dow-book/&gt; (Net power is the amount of power generated after subtracting power needed to run the system).

In 1956, French scientists designed a 3 [[Megawatt|MW]] plant for [[Abidjan]], [[Ivory Coast]]. The plant was never completed, because new finds of large amounts of cheap petroleum made it uneconomical.&lt;ref name=dow-book/&gt;

In 1962, J. Hilbert Anderson and James H. Anderson, Jr. focused on increasing component efficiency. They patented their new "closed cycle" design in 1967.&lt;ref name=closed-cycle-patent&gt;{{Ref patent | country = US | number = 3312054 | status = patent | title = Sea Water Power Plant | gdate = 1967-04-04 | fdate = 1966-09-27 | invent1 = J.H. Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design improved upon the original closed-cycle Rankine system, and included this in an outline for a plant that would produce power at lower cost than oil or coal. At the time, however, their research garnered little attention since coal and nuclear were considered the future of energy.&lt;ref name="Avery, William H 1994"/&gt;

Japan is a major contributor to the development of OTEC technology.&lt;ref name=osti-assessment&gt;{{Cite journal | title = An Assessment of Research and Development Leadership in Ocean Energy Technologies |date=April 1994| last = Bruch | first = Vicki L. | publisher = Sandia National Laboratories: Energy Policy and Planning Department | volume = SAND93-3946 | url =http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10154003-z9rVWD/native/10154003.PDF|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1970 the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] successfully built and deployed a 100&amp;nbsp;kW closed-cycle OTEC plant on the island of [[Nauru]].&lt;ref name=osti-assessment/&gt;  The plant became operational on 14 October 1981, producing about 120&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity; 90&amp;nbsp;kW was used to power the plant and the remaining electricity was used to power a school and other places.&lt;ref name=dow-book/&gt; This set a world record for power output from an OTEC system where the power was sent to a real (as opposed to an experimental) power grid.&lt;ref name=nauru-outline&gt;{{Cite journal | title =  Outline of the 100 kW OTEC Pilot Plant in the Republic of Nauru | last = Mitsui | first = T. |author2 = Ito, F.; Seya, Y.; Nakamoto, Y. |date=September 1983 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems | volume = PAS-102 | issue = 9 | pages = 3167–3171 |url = http://library.greenocean.org/oteclibrary/otecdesigns/OTEC-nauru.pdf/view | doi =  10.1109/TPAS.1983.318124|bibcode =1983ITPAS.102.3167M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1981 also saw a major development in OTEC technology when Russian engineer, Dr. Alexander Kalina, used a mixture of ammonia and water to produce electricity. This new ammonia-water mixture greatly improved the efficiency of the power cycle. In 1994 Saga University designed and constructed a 4.5&amp;nbsp;kW plant for the purpose of testing a newly invented Uehara cycle, also named after its inventor Haruo Uehara. This cycle included
absorption and extraction processes that allow this system to outperform the Kalina cycle by 1-2%.&lt;ref&gt;Finney, Karen Anne. "Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion". Guelph Engineering Journal. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Institute of Ocean Energy, Saga University, is the leader in OTEC power plant research and also focuses on many of the technology's secondary benefits.

The 1970s saw an uptick in OTEC research and development during the post 1973 Arab-Israeli War, which caused oil prices to triple. The U.S. federal government poured $260 million into OTEC research after President Carter signed a law that committed the US to a production goal of 10,000 MW of electricity from OTEC systems by 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Daly|first=John|title=Hawaii About to Crack Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Roadblocks?|url=http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Renewable-Energy/Hawaii-About-To-Crack-Ocean-Thermal-Energy-Conversion-Roadblocks.html|accessdate=28 March 2013|newspaper=OilPrice.com|date=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OTEC in Hawaii.jpg|thumb|260px|left|View of a land based OTEC facility at [[Keahole Point]] on the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]] coast of [[Hawaii]]]]

In 1974, The U.S. established the [[Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority]] (NELHA) at [[Keahole Point]] on the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona coast]] of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]. Hawaii is the best US OTEC location, due to its warm surface water, access to very deep, very cold water, and high electricity costs. The laboratory has become a leading test facility for OTEC technology.&lt;ref name=elec-costs&gt;{{cite web | title =  Average Retail Price of Electricity to Ultimate Customers by End-Use Sector, by State | publisher = [[Energy Information Administration]] |date = September 2007| url = http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table5_6_a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Lockheed received a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation to study OTEC. This eventually led to an effort by Lockheed, the US Navy, Makai Ocean Engineering, Dillingham Construction, and other firms to build the world's first and only net-power producing OTEC plant, dubbed "Mini-OTEC"&lt;ref name="lockheed1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=L.

Research related to making open-cycle OTEC a reality began earnestly in 1979 at the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) with funding from the US Department of Energy. Evaporators and suitably configured direct-contact condensers were developed and patented by SERI (see &lt;ref&gt;Bharathan, D.; Penney, T. R. (1984). Flash Evaporation from Turbulent Water Jets. Journal of Heat Transfer. Vol. 106(2), May 1984; pp. 407-416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bharathan, D. (1984). Method and Apparatus for Flash Evaporation of Liquids.

Direct-Contact Condensers for Open-Cycle OTEC Applications: Model Validation with Fresh Water Experiments for Structured Packings. 272 pp.; NREL Report No. TR-253-3108.&lt;/ref&gt;). An original design for a power-producing experiment, then called the 165-kW experiment was described by [[Frank Kreith|Kreith]] and Bharathan (,&lt;ref&gt;Bharathan, D.; [[Frank Kreith|Kreith, F.]]; Schlepp, D. R.; Owens, W. L. (1984). Heat and Mass Transfer in Open-Cycle OTEC Systems. Heat Transfer Engineering. Vol. 5(1-2); pp. 17-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;Kreith, F.; Bharathan, D. (1988). Heat Transfer Research for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion. Journal of Heat Transfer. Vol. 110, February 1988; pp. 5-22.&lt;/ref&gt; ) as the [[Max Jakob Memorial Award]] Lecture. The initial design used two parallel axial turbines, using last stage rotors taken from large steam turbines. Later, a team led by Dr. Bharathan at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed the initial conceptual design for up-dated 210&amp;nbsp;kW open-cycle OTEC experiment (&lt;ref&gt;Bharathan, D.; Green, H. J.; Link, H. F.; Parsons, B. K.; Parsons, J. M.; Zangrando, F. (1990). Conceptual Design of an Open-Cycle Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Net Power-Producing Experiment (OC-OTEC NPPE). 160 pp.; NREL Report No. TR-253-3616.&lt;/ref&gt;). This design integrated all components of the cycle, namely, the evaporator, condenser and the turbine into one single vacuum vessel, with the turbine mounted on top to prevent any potential for water to reach it. The vessel was made of concrete as the first process vacuum vessel of its kind. Attempts to make all components using low-cost plastic material could not be fully achieved, as some conservatism was required for the turbine and the vacuum pumps developed as the first of their kind. Later Dr. Bharathan worked with a team of engineers at the Pacific Institute for High Technology Research (PICHTR) to further pursue this design through preliminary and final stages. It was renamed the Net Power Producing Experiment (NPPE) and was constructed at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii (NELH) by PICHTR by a team led by Chief Engineer Don Evans and the project was managed by Dr. Luis Vega.

In 2002, India tested a 1 MW floating OTEC pilot plant near Tamil Nadu. The plant was ultimately unsuccessful due to a failure of the deep sea cold water pipe.&lt;ref&gt;Avery, William H. and Chih Wu. Renewable Energy From the Ocean: A Guide to OTEC.

In 2006, Makai Ocean Engineering was awarded a contract from the U.S. [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR) to investigate the potential for OTEC to produce nationally significant quantities of hydrogen in at-sea floating plants located in warm, tropical waters. Realizing the need for larger partners to actually commercialize OTEC, Makai approached Lockheed Martin to renew their previous relationship and determine if the time was ready for OTEC. And so in 2007, Lockheed Martin resumed work in OTEC and became a subcontractor to Makai to support their SBIR, which was followed by other subsequent collaborations&lt;ref name="lockheed1" /&gt;

In March 2011, Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation signed an Energy Services Agreement (ESA) with the Baha Mar resort, Nassau, Bahamas, for the world's first and largest seawater air conditioning (SWAC) system.&lt;ref&gt;http://otecorporation.com/2011/12/19/baha-mar-resort-signs-energy-services-agreement-with-ote-corporation/&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the project was put on pause while the resort resolved financial and ownership issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2015/06/29/baha-mar-resorts-to-chapter-11-bankruptcy-blames-china-construction-for-delays/#141b6aab7560&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, it was announced that the issues had been resolved and that the resort would open in March 2017.&lt;ref name="otecorporation.com"&gt;http://otecorporation.com/2016/08/30/ocean-thermal-energy-corporation-reports-announcement-bahamian-government-remobilization-completion-opening-baha-mar-beach-resort/&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that the SWAC system's construction will resume at that time.

In July 2011, Makai Ocean Engineering completed the design and construction of an OTEC Heat Exchanger Test Facility at the [[Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii]]. The purpose of the facility is to arrive at an optimal design for OTEC heat exchangers, increasing performance and useful life while reducing cost (heat exchangers being the #1 cost driver for an OTEC plant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=otecfoundation|title=Makai Ocean Engineering's Heat Exchanger Test Facility opened|url=http://www.otecnews.org/2011/11/makai-ocean-engineerings-heat-exchanger-test-facility-opened/|website=www.otecnews.org|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in March 2013, Makai announced an award to install and operate a 100 kilowatt turbine on the OTEC Heat Exchanger Test Facility, and once again connect OTEC power to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Makai Ocean Engineering working with Navy on Big Island OTEC project|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2013/03/19/makai-ocean-engineering-working-with.html|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IDEA|title=Makai Ocean Engineering to add 100kW turbine generator to Kona, Hawaii OTEC test facility|url=http://www.districtenergy.org/blog/2013/03/19/makai-ocean-engineering-to-add-100kw-turbine-generator-to-kona-hawaii-otec-test-facility/|website=International District Energy Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the Virgin Islands Public Services Commission approved Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation's application to become a Qualified Facility. The Company is thus permitted to begin negotiations with the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (WAPA) for a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) pertaining to an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant on the island of St. Croix. This would be the world's first commercial OTEC plant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://otecorporation.com/2016/07/18/ote-receives-approval-otec-system-usvi/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lancasteronline.com"&gt;http://lancasteronline.com/business/local_business/ocean-thermal-to-begin-talks-for-renewable-energy-plants-in/article_e68b41f4-4da4-11e6-8d72-1352558baa6f.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currently operating OTEC plants ==

In March 2013, Saga University with various Japanese industries completed the installation of a new OTEC plant. Okinawa Prefecture announced the start of the OTEC operation testing at Kume Island on April 15, 2013. The main aim is to prove the validity of computer models and demonstrate OTEC to the public. The testing and research will be conducted with the support of Saga University until the end of FY 2016. IHI Plant Construction Co. Ltd, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, and Xenesys Inc were entrusted with constructing the 100 kilowatt class plant within the grounds of the Okinawa Prefecture Deep Sea Water Research Center. The location was specifically chosen in order to utilize existing deep seawater and surface seawater intake pipes installed for the research center in 2000. The pipe is used for the intake of deep sea water for research, fishery, and agricultural use.[19]
The plant consists of two 50&amp;nbsp;kW units in double Rankine configuration.&lt;ref&gt;http://otecokinawa.com/en/Project/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The OTEC facility and deep seawater research center are open to free public tours by appointment in English and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;http://otecokinawa.com/en/Contact/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this is one of only two fully operational OTEC plants in the world. This plant operates continuously when specific tests are not underway.

In 2011, Makai Ocean Engineering completed a heat exchanger test facility at NELHA. Used to test a variety of heat exchange technologies for use in OTEC, Makai has received funding to install a 105&amp;nbsp;kW turbine.&lt;ref&gt;http://nelha.hawaii.gov/energy-portfolio/&lt;/ref&gt; Installation will make this facility the largest operational OTEC facility, though the record for largest power will remain with the Open Cycle plant also developed in Hawaii.

In July 2014, DCNS group partnered with Akuo Energy announced NER 300 funding for their NEMO project. If successful, the 16MW gross 10MW net offshore plant will be the largest OTEC facility to date. DCNS plans to have NEMO operational by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.dcnsgroup.com/2014/07/09/akuo-energy-and-dcns-awarded-european-ner-300-funding-a-crucial-step-for-the-marine-renewable-energy-sector/&lt;/ref&gt;

An ocean thermal energy conversion power plant built by Makai Ocean Engineering went operational in Hawaii in August 2015 . The governor of Hawaii, [[David Ige]], "flipped the switch" to activate the plant.  This is the first true closed-cycle ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant to be connected to a U.S. electrical grid .   It is a demo plant  capable of generating  105 kilowatts, enough to power about 120 homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techxplore.com/news/2015-08-celebrating-hawaii-ocean-thermal-energy.html Celebrating Hawaii ocean thermal energy conversion power plant] Physorg 25 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermodynamic efficiency ==

A [[heat engine]] gives greater efficiency when run with a large [[temperature]] difference. In the oceans the temperature difference between surface and deep water is greatest in the [[tropics]], although still a modest 20 to 25&amp;nbsp;°C. It is therefore in the tropics that OTEC offers the greatest possibilities.&lt;ref name="PopSci95"/&gt; OTEC has the potential to offer global amounts of energy that are 10 to 100 times greater than other ocean energy options such as [[wave power]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} OTEC plants can operate continuously providing a [[base load]] supply for an electrical power generation system.&lt;ref name="PopSci95"&gt;{{cite journal| last = DiChristina| first = Mariette| date = May 1995| title = Sea Power| journal = Popular Science |pages = 70–73| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4jETasQk7aoC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=otec#v=onepage&amp;q=otec&amp;f=false| access-date = 2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main technical challenge of OTEC is to generate significant amounts of power efficiently from small temperature differences.  It is still considered an [[emerging technology]]. Early OTEC systems were 1 to 3 percent [[thermal efficiency|thermally efficient]], well below the theoretical maximum 6 and 7 percent for this temperature difference.&lt;ref name=microbial-countermeasures/&gt;  Modern designs allow performance approaching the theoretical maximum [[Carnot efficiency]].

==  Power Cycle types ==

Cold seawater is an integral part of each of the three types of OTEC systems: closed-cycle, open-cycle, and hybrid.  To operate, the cold seawater must be brought to the surface. The primary approaches are active pumping and desalination. Desalinating seawater near the sea floor lowers its density, which causes it to rise to the surface.&lt;ref name=desalination-pump-patent&gt;{{Ref patent | country = US | number = 4311012 | status = patent | title = Method and apparatus for transferring cold seawater upward from the lower depths of the ocean to improve the efficiency of ocean thermal energy conversion systems | gdate = 1982-01-19 | fdate = 1980-02-19 | invent1 = Warren T. Finley | class = F03G 704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative to costly pipes to bring condensing cold water to the surface is to pump vaporized low boiling point fluid into the depths to be condensed, thus reducing pumping volumes and reducing technical and environmental problems and lowering costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QdArDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1470&amp;lpg=PT1470&amp;dq=The+alternative+to+costly+pipes+to+bring+condensing+cold+water+to+the+surface+is+to+pump+vaporized+low+boiling+point+fluid+into+the+depths+to+be+condensed,+thus+reducing+pumping+volumes+and+reducing+technical+and+environmental+problems+and+lowering+costs#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20alternative%20to%20costly%20pipes%20to%20bring%20condensing%20cold%20water%20to%20the%20surface%20is%20to%20pump%20vaporized%20low%20boiling%20point%20fluid%20into%20the%20depths%20to%20be%20condensed,%20thus%20reducing%20pumping%20volumes%20and%20reducing%20technical%20and%20environmental%20problems%20and%20lowering%20costs&amp;f=false|title=Thermal Energy: Sources, Recovery, and Applications|last=Shah|first=Yatish T.|date=2018-01-12|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781315305936|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Closed ===

[[File:Otec Closed Diagram in English.JPG|thumb|350px|Diagram of a closed cycle OTEC plant]]

Closed-cycle systems use fluid with a low boiling point, such as [[ammonia]] (having a boiling point around -33&amp;nbsp;°C at atmospheric pressure), to power a [[turbine]] to generate electricity. Warm surface [[seawater]] is pumped through a [[heat exchanger]] to vaporize the fluid. The expanding vapor turns the turbo-generator. Cold water, pumped through a second heat exchanger, condenses the vapor into a liquid, which is then recycled through the system.

In 1979, the Natural Energy Laboratory and several private-sector partners developed the "mini OTEC" experiment, which achieved the first successful at-sea production of net electrical power from closed-cycle OTEC.&lt;ref name=mini-otec&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Review of mini-OTEC performance | first = L.C. | last = Trimble |author2=Owens, W.L. | year = 1980 | journal = Energy to the 21st Century; Proceedings of the Fifteenth Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference | volume = 2 | pages = 1331–1338 | bibcode = 1980iece....2.1331T}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mini OTEC vessel was moored {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} off the Hawaiian coast and produced enough net electricity to illuminate the ship's light bulbs and run its computers and television.

=== Open ===

[[File:Otec Open Diagram in English.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Diagram of an open cycle OTEC plant]]

Open-cycle OTEC uses warm surface water directly to make electricity. The warm seawater is first pumped into a low-pressure container, which causes it to boil. In some schemes, the expanding [[vapour]] drives a low-pressure turbine attached to an [[electrical generator]]. The vapour, which has left its [[salt]] and other contaminants in the low-pressure container, is pure fresh water. It is condensed into a liquid by exposure to cold temperatures from deep-ocean water.  This method produces [[desalinization|desalinized]] fresh water, suitable for [[drinking water]], [[irrigation]] or [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref name="vega05"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otecnews.org/articles/vega/05_open_cycle.html|title=Open Cycle OTEC|last=Vega|first=L.A.|year=1999|website=OTEC News|publisher=The GreenOcean Project|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other schemes, the rising vapour is used in a [[gas lift]] technique of lifting water to significant heights.  Depending on the embodiment, such [[mist lift|vapour lift]] pump techniques generate power from a [[water turbine|hydroelectric turbine]] either before or after the pump is used.&lt;ref name=jsee&gt;{{citation|journal=Journal of Solar Energy Engineering |last1=Lee |first1= C. K. B. |last2= Ridgway |first2= Stuart |title=Vapor/Droplet Coupling and the Mist Flow (OTEC) Cycle |volume=105 |pages=181 |date= May 1983 |url=http://library.greenocean.org/oteclibrary/otecdesigns/mistliftotec/vapor_mistlift_otec.pdf|bibcode=1983ATJSE.105..181L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the ''Solar Energy Research Institute'' (now known as the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]) developed a vertical-spout evaporator to convert warm seawater into low-pressure steam for open-cycle plants. Conversion efficiencies were as high as 97% for seawater-to-steam conversion (overall steam production would only be a few percent of the incoming water). In May 1993, an open-cycle OTEC plant at Keahole Point, Hawaii, produced close to 80 [[kW]] of electricity during a net power-producing experiment.&lt;ref name=nrel-otec-achievements&gt;{{cite web | title = Achievements in OTEC Technology | publisher = [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] | url = http://www.nrel.gov/otec/achievements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broke the record of 40&amp;nbsp;kW set by a Japanese system in 1982.&lt;ref name=nrel-otec-achievements/&gt;

=== Hybrid ===

A hybrid cycle combines the features of the closed- and open-cycle systems. In a hybrid, warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber and is flash-evaporated, similar to the open-cycle evaporation process. The steam vaporizes the [[ammonia]] working fluid of a closed-cycle loop on the other side of an ammonia vaporizer.  The vaporized fluid then drives a turbine to produce electricity. The steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides [[Desalination|desalinated water]] (see [[heat pipe]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Working fluids ===
A popular choice of working fluid is ammonia, which has superior transport properties, easy availability, and low cost. Ammonia, however, is toxic and flammable. Fluorinated carbons such as [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]s and [[HCFC]]s are not toxic or flammable, but they contribute to ozone layer depletion. [[Hydrocarbon]]s too are good candidates, but they are highly flammable; in addition, this would create competition for use of them directly as fuels. The power plant size is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the working fluid. With increasing vapor pressure, the size of the turbine and heat exchangers decreases while the wall thickness of the pipe and heat exchangers increase to endure high pressure especially on the evaporator side.

== Land, shelf and floating sites ==
OTEC has the potential to produce gigawatts of electrical power, and in conjunction with [[electrolysis]], could produce enough hydrogen to completely replace all projected global fossil fuel consumption.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Reducing costs remains an unsolved challenge, however. OTEC plants require a long, large diameter intake pipe, which is submerged a kilometer or more into the ocean's depths, to bring cold water to the surface.

=== Land-based ===

Land-based and near-shore facilities offer three main advantages over those located in deep water. Plants constructed on or near land do not require sophisticated mooring, lengthy power cables, or the more extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments. They can be installed in sheltered areas so that they are relatively safe from storms and heavy seas. Electricity, desalinated water, and cold, nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from near-shore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways. In addition, land-based or near-shore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as [[mariculture]] or those that require desalinated water.

Favored locations include those with narrow shelves (volcanic islands), steep (15-20 degrees) offshore slopes, and relatively smooth sea floors. These sites minimize the length of the intake pipe. A land-based plant could be built well inland from the shore, offering more protection from storms, or on the beach, where the pipes would be shorter. In either case, easy access for construction and operation helps lower costs.

Land-based or near-shore sites can also support mariculture or chilled water agriculture. Tanks or lagoons built on shore allow workers to monitor and control miniature marine environments. Mariculture products can be delivered to market via standard transport.

One disadvantage of land-based facilities arises from the turbulent wave action in the [[surf zone]]. OTEC discharge pipes should be placed in protective trenches to prevent subjecting them to extreme stress during storms and prolonged periods of heavy seas. Also, the mixed discharge of cold and warm seawater may need to be carried several hundred meters offshore to reach the proper depth before it is released, requiring additional expense in construction and maintenance.

One way that OTEC systems can avoid some of the problems and expenses of operating in a surf zone is by building them just offshore in waters ranging from 10 to 30 meters deep (Ocean Thermal Corporation 1984). This type of plant would use shorter (and therefore less costly) intake and discharge pipes, which would avoid the dangers of turbulent surf. The plant itself, however, would require protection from the marine environment, such as breakwaters and erosion-resistant foundations, and the plant output would need to be transmitted to shore.&lt;ref name="Land Based Design and Location"&gt;{{cite web|title=Design and Location|url=http://www.nrel.gov/otec/design_location.html|website=What is Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion?|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shelf based ===

To avoid the turbulent surf zone as well as to move closer to the cold-water resource, OTEC plants can be mounted to the continental shelf at depths up to {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}. A shelf-mounted plant could be towed to the site and affixed to the sea bottom. This type of construction is already used for offshore oil rigs. The complexities of operating an OTEC plant in deeper water may make them more expensive than land-based approaches. Problems include the stress of open-ocean conditions and more difficult product delivery. Addressing strong ocean currents and large waves adds engineering and construction expense. Platforms require extensive pilings to maintain a stable base. Power delivery can require long underwater cables to reach land. For these reasons, shelf-mounted plants are less attractive.&lt;ref name="Land Based Design and Location" /&gt; {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Floating ===

Floating OTEC facilities operate off-shore. Although potentially optimal for large systems, floating facilities present several difficulties. The difficulty of mooring plants in very deep water complicates power delivery. Cables attached to floating platforms are more susceptible to damage, especially during storms. Cables at depths greater than 1000 meters are difficult to maintain and repair. Riser cables, which connect the sea bed and the plant, need to be constructed to resist entanglement.&lt;ref name="Land Based Design and Location" /&gt; {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

As with shelf-mounted plants, floating plants need a stable base for continuous operation. Major storms and heavy seas can break the vertically suspended cold-water pipe and interrupt warm water intake as well. To help prevent these problems, pipes can be made of flexible polyethylene attached to the bottom of the platform and gimballed with joints or collars. Pipes may need to be uncoupled from the plant to prevent storm damage. As an alternative to a warm-water pipe, surface water can be drawn directly into the platform; however, it is necessary to prevent the intake flow from being damaged or interrupted during violent motions caused by heavy seas.&lt;ref name="Land Based Design and Location" /&gt; {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Connecting a floating plant to power delivery cables requires the plant to remain relatively stationary. Mooring is an acceptable method, but current mooring technology is limited to depths of about {{convert|2000|m|ft|sp=us}}. Even at shallower depths, the cost of mooring may be prohibitive.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

== Some proposed projects ==

OTEC projects under consideration include a small plant for the [[U.S. Navy]] base on the [[United Kingdom|British]] overseas territory island of [[Diego Garcia]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (formerly OCEES International, Inc.) is working with the U.S. Navy on a design for a proposed 13-MW OTEC plant, to replace the current diesel generators. The OTEC plant would also provide 1.25 million gallons{{clarify|date=March 2012}}&lt;!--USgal or Imp gal?--&gt; per day of potable water.&lt;!-- are our figures messed up, or is the current plant not fully utilized?[[User:Pakaran|Pak]][[User talk:Pakaran|aran]] 21:04, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)--&gt; This project is currently waiting for changes in US military contract policies.

=== Japan ===

Currently the only continuously operating OTEC system is located in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The Governmental support, local community support, and advanced research carried out by Saga University were key for the contractors, IHI Plant Construction Co. Ltd, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, and Xenesys Inc, to succeed with this project. Work is being conducted to develop a 1MW facility on Kume Island requiring new pipelines. In July 2014, more than 50 members formed the Global Ocean reSource and Energy Association ([http://gosea.info/en/ GOSEA]) an international organization formed to promote the development of the Kumejima Model and work towards the installation of larger deep seawater pipelines and a 1MW OTEC Facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://otecokinawa.com/AloHaisai/the-foundation-of-go-sea/&lt;/ref&gt; The companies involved in the current OTEC projects, along with other interested parties have developed plans for offshore OTEC systems as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://xenesys.com/english/products/otec.html&lt;/ref&gt; - For more details, see "Currently Operating OTEC Plants" above.

On March 5, 2014, Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (OTEC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.otecorporation.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the 30th Legislature of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to move forward with a study to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits to the USVI of installing on-shore Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) renewable energy power plants and Seawater Air Conditioning (SWAC) facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://stthomassource.com/content/news/local-news/2014/03/06/senate-signs-mou-ocean-energy-feasibility-study&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits to be assessed in the USVI study include both the baseload (24/7) clean electricity generated by OTEC, as well as the various related products associated with OTEC and SWAC, including abundant fresh drinking water, energy-saving air conditioning, sustainable aquaculture and mariculture, and agricultural enhancement projects for the Islands of St Thomas and St Croix.  The Honorable Shawn-Michael Malone, President of the USVI Senate, commented on his signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) authorizing OTE's feasibility study. ''“The most fundamental duty of government is to protect the health and welfare of its citizens,"'' said Senator Malone. ''"These clean energy technologies have the potential to improve the air quality and environment for our residents, and to provide the foundation for meaningful economic development. Therefore, it is our duty as elected representatives to explore the feasibility and possible benefits of OTEC and SWAC for the people of USVI.”''&lt;ref&gt;http://en.dcnsgroup.com/news/feasibility-study-for-worlds-first-us-based-commercial-otec-plant-and-sea-water-air-conditioning-swac-systems-in-usvi/&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2016, OTE's application to be a Qualifying Facility was approved by the Virgin Islands Public Services Commission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; OTE also received permission to begin negotiating contracts associated with this project.&lt;ref name="lancasteronline.com"/&gt;

=== Kiribati ===
South Korea's Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering (KRISO) received Approval in Principal from Bureau Veritas for their 1MW offshore OTEC design. No timeline was given for the project which will be located 6&amp;nbsp;km offshore of the Republic of Kiribati.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marinetechnologynews.com/news/energy-ocean-ocean-thermal-527332&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maldives ===
On February 16, 2018, Global OTEC Resources announced plans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/business-proposals/otecresorts-ocean-energy-15-789143|title=OTECresorts: Ocean Energy at East Anglia, United Kingdom - Angel Investment Network|last=Network|first=Angel Investment|website=www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build a 150 kW plant in the Maldives, designed bespoke for hotels and resorts. “''All these resorts draw their power from diesel generators.

== Related activities ==

OTEC has uses other than power production.

=== Desalination ===

Desalinated water can be produced in open- or hybrid-cycle plants using [[surface condenser]]s to turn evaporated seawater into potable water. System analysis indicates that a 2-megawatt plant could produce about {{convert|4300|m3}} of desalinated water each day.&lt;ref&gt;Block and Lalenzuela 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Another system patented by Richard Bailey creates condensate water by regulating deep ocean water flow through surface condensers correlating with fluctuating dew-point temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|7726138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condensation system uses no incremental energy and has no moving parts.

On March 22, 2015, Saga University opened a Flash-type desalination demonstration facility on Kumejima.&lt;ref name="Saga University Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioes.saga-u.ac.jp/jp/openlab/openlab-kume-2015-report|title=海洋エネルギー研究センター 2015久米島サテライトオープンラボ (施設見学会)[報告]|accessdate=2015-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This satellite of their Institute of Ocean Energy uses post-OTEC deep seawater from the Okinawa OTEC Demonstration Facility and raw surface seawater to produce desalinated water. Air is extracted from the closed system with a vacuum pump. When raw sea water is pumped into the flash chamber it boils, allowing pure steam to rise and the salt and remaining seawater to be removed. The steam is returned to liquid in a heat exchanger with cold post-OTEC deep seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Benjamin|title=IOES Kumejima Satellite|url=http://otecokinawa.com/en/Tours/IOES.html|website=otecokinawa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desalinated water can be used in hydrogen production or drinking water (if minerals are added).

=== Air conditioning ===

The {{convert|41|F}} cold seawater made available by an OTEC system creates an opportunity to provide large amounts of cooling to industries and homes near the plant. The water can be used in chilled-water coils to provide air-conditioning for buildings. It is estimated that a pipe {{convert|1|ft|m}} in diameter can deliver 4,700 gallons of water per minute. Water at {{convert|43|F}} could provide more than enough air-conditioning for a large building. Operating 8,000 hours per year in lieu of electrical conditioning selling for 5-10¢ per kilowatt-hour, it would save $200,000-$400,000 in energy bills annually.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]], 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[InterContinental]] Resort and Thalasso-Spa on the island of [[Bora Bora]] uses an SWAC system to air-condition its buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTGvPrrkVAA|title=YouTube video on the OTEC air-conditioning system used at the InterContinental Resort and Thalasso-Spa on the island of Bora Bora|accessdate=2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system passes seawater through a heat exchanger where it cools freshwater in a closed loop system. This freshwater is then pumped to buildings and directly cools the air.

In 2010, Copenhagen Energy opened a district cooling plant in Copenhagen, Denmark. The plant delivers cold seawater to commercial and industrial buildings, and has reduced electricity consumption by 80 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Green Tech. "Copenhagen’s SeawaterCooling Delivers Energy And Carbon Savings". 24 October 2012. Forbes.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (OTE) has designed a 9800-ton SDC system for a vacation resort in The Bahamas.

=== Chilled-soil agriculture ===

OTEC technology supports chilled-soil agriculture. When cold seawater flows through underground pipes, it chills the surrounding soil. The temperature difference between roots in the cool soil and leaves in the warm air allows plants that evolved in [[temperate climate]]s to be grown in the [[subtropics]]. Dr. John P. Craven, Dr. Jack Davidson and Richard Bailey patented this process and demonstrated it at a research facility at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|us|7069689}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research facility demonstrated that more than 100 different crops can be grown using this system. Many normally could not survive in Hawaii or at Keahole Point.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Japan has also been researching agricultural uses of Deep Sea Water since 2000 at the Okinawa Deep Sea Water Research Institute on Kume Island. The Kume Island facilities use regular water cooled by Deep Sea Water in a heat exchanger run through pipes in the ground to cool soil. Their techniques have developed an important resource for the island community as they now produce spinach, a winter vegetable, commercially year round. An expansion of the deep seawater agriculture facility was completed by Kumejima Town next to the OTEC Demonstration Facility in 2014. The new facility is for researching the economic practicality of chilled-soil agriculture on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;http://kumeguide.com/Industry/DeepSeaWater/ResearchInstitute/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aquaculture ===

[[Aquaculture]] is the best-known byproduct, because it reduces the financial and energy costs of pumping large volumes of water from the deep ocean.  Deep ocean water contains high concentrations of essential nutrients that are depleted in surface waters due to biological consumption. This "artificial upwelling" mimics the natural upwellings that are responsible for fertilizing and supporting the world's largest marine ecosystems, and the largest densities of life on the planet.

Cold-water delicacies, such as [[salmon]] and [[lobster]], thrive in this nutrient-rich, deep, seawater. [[Microalgae]] such as ''[[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]]'', a health food supplement, also can be cultivated. Deep-ocean water can be combined with surface water to deliver water at an optimal temperature.

Non-native species such as salmon, lobster, [[abalone]], [[trout]], [[oyster]]s, and [[clam]]s can be raised in pools supplied by OTEC-pumped water. This extends the variety of fresh seafood products available for nearby markets. Such low-cost refrigeration can be used to maintain the quality of harvested fish, which deteriorate quickly in warm tropical regions. In Kona, Hawaii, aquaculture companies working with NELHA generate about $40 million annually, a significant portion of Hawaii’s GDP.&lt;ref&gt;Ponia, Ben. "Aquaculture Updates in the Northern Pacific: Hawaii, Federated States of Mirconesia, Palau and Saipan". SPCFisheries Newsletter. July 2006. Web. 25 June 2013. available at: http://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/InfoBull/FishNews/118/FishNews11 8_58_Ponia.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NELHA plant established in 1993 produced an average of 7,000 gallons of freshwater per day. KOYO USA was established in 2002 to capitalize on this new economic opportunity. KOYO bottles the water produced by the NELHA plant in Hawaii. With the capacity to produce one million bottles of water every day, KOYO is now Hawaii’s biggest exporter with $140 million in sales.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Daniel. "A Brief History of OTEC Research at NELHA".  NELHA. August 1999. Web. 25 June 2013. available at: http://library.greenocean.org/oteclibrary/otecpapers/OTEC%20History.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrogen production ===

[[Hydrogen]] can be produced via [[electrolysis]] using OTEC electricity. Generated steam with electrolyte compounds added to improve efficiency is a relatively pure medium for hydrogen production. OTEC can be scaled to generate large quantities of hydrogen. The main challenge is cost relative to other energy sources and fuels.

=== Mineral extraction ===

The ocean contains 57 [[trace element]]s in salts and other forms and dissolved in solution. In the past, most economic analyses concluded that mining the ocean for trace elements would be unprofitable, in part because of the energy required to pump the water. Mining generally targets minerals that occur in high concentrations, and can be extracted easily, such as [[magnesium]]. With OTEC plants supplying water, the only cost is for extraction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}
The Japanese investigated the possibility of extracting [[uranium]] and found developments in other technologies (especially materials sciences) were improving the prospects.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

== Political concerns ==

Because OTEC facilities are more-or-less stationary surface platforms, their exact location and legal status may be affected by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] treaty (UNCLOS). This treaty grants coastal nations 12- and {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} zones of varying legal authority from land, creating potential conflicts and regulatory barriers. OTEC plants and similar structures would be considered [[artificial islands]] under the treaty, giving them no independent legal status. OTEC plants could be perceived as either a threat or potential partner to [[fisheries management|fisheries]] or to seabed mining operations controlled by the [[International Seabed Authority]].

== Cost and economics ==

For OTEC to be viable as a power source, the technology must have tax and subsidy treatment similar to competing energy sources. Because OTEC systems have not yet been widely deployed, cost estimates are uncertain. One study estimates power generation costs as low as US $0.07 per kilowatt-hour, compared with $0.05 - $0.07 for subsidized wind systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pichtr.org/Luis_Vega_OTEC_Summary.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626183941/http://www.pichtr.org/luis_vega_otec_summary.pdf|date=June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beneficial factors that should be taken into account include OTEC's lack of waste products and fuel consumption, the area in which it is available,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} (often within 20° of the equator)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/otec/markets.html |title=NREL: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion - Markets for OTEC |publisher=Nrel.gov |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126110351/http://www.nrel.gov/otec/markets.html |archivedate=2005-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the geopolitical effects of [[petroleum]] dependence, compatibility with alternate forms of ocean power such as wave energy, tidal energy and [[methane hydrate]]s, and supplemental uses for the seawater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/otec/ |title=NREL: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Home Page |publisher=Nrel.gov |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thermodynamics ==

A rigorous treatment of OTEC reveals that a 20&amp;nbsp;°C temperature difference will provide as much energy as a hydroelectric plant with 34&amp;nbsp;m head for the same volume of water flow.
The low temperature difference means that water volumes must be very large to extract useful amounts of heat.  A 100MW power plant would be expected to pump on the order of 12 million gallons (44,400 tonnes) per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Challenge And Promise Of OTEC  |first1=Duke |last1 =Hartman | journal = Ocean News |date = October 2011| accessdate= 11 June 2012| url= http://virtual.ocean-news.com/display_article.php?id=864488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, pumps must move a mass of water greater than the weight of the ''[[German battleship Bismarck|battleship Bismarck]]'', which weighed 41,700 tonnes, every minute.  This makes pumping a substantial [[parasitic loss|parasitic drain]] on energy production in OTEC systems, with one Lockheed design consuming 19.55 MW in pumping costs for every 49.8 MW net electricity generated.&lt;!--Da Rosa, P.147 --&gt;  For OTEC schemes using heat exchangers, to handle this volume of water the exchangers need to be enormous compared to those used in conventional thermal power generation plants,&lt;ref name=" Da Rosa"&gt;{{cite book|last= Da Rosa|first= Aldo Vieira|title=Fundamentals of renewable energy processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDuec62ube8C&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=otec#v=onepage&amp;q=otec&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-374639-9|pages=139 to 152 |chapter=Chapter 4:Ocean Thermal Energy Converters}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them one of the most critical components due to their impact on overall efficiency. A 100 MW OTEC power plant would require 200 exchangers each larger than a 20-foot shipping container making them the single most expensive component.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Comparison Of Aluminum Alloys And Manufacturing Processes Based On Corrosion Performance For Use In OTEC Heat Exchangers|last1=Eldred|first1=M. |last2=Landherr|first2= A. |last3=Chen |first3=I.C. |doi=10.4043/20702-MS | url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=OTC-20702-MS | title= Offshore Technology Conference 2010 (OTC 2010) |publisher= Curran Associates, Inc.  | isbn=9781617384264 | date= July 2010 |accessdate= May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variation of ocean temperature with depth ===

The total [[insolation]] received by the oceans (covering 70% of the earth's surface, with clearness index of 0.5 and average energy retention of 15%) is: {{math|5.45&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; MJ/yr &amp;times; 0.7 &amp;times; 0.5 &amp;times; 0.15 {{=}} 2.87&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; MJ/yr}}

We can use [[Beer–Lambert law|Beer–Lambert–Bouguer's law]] to quantify the solar energy absorption by water,

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{dI(y)}{dy}=\mu I&lt;/math&gt;

where, ''y'' is the depth of water, ''I'' is intensity and ''μ'' is the absorption coefficient.
Solving the above [[differential equation]],

:&lt;math&gt; I(y)=I_{0}\exp(-\mu y) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The absorption coefficient ''μ''  may range from 0.05 m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; for very clear fresh water to 0.5 m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for very salty water.

Since the intensity [[exponential decay|falls exponentially]] with depth ''y'', heat absorption is concentrated at the top layers. Typically in the tropics, surface temperature values are in excess of {{convert|25|C}}, while at {{convert|1|km|mi|sp=us}}, the temperature is about {{convert|5|-|10|C|F}}. The warmer (and hence lighter) waters at the surface means there are no [[convection current|thermal convection currents]]. Due to the small temperature gradients, heat transfer by [[heat conduction|conduction]] is too low to equalize the temperatures. The ocean is thus both a practically infinite heat source and a practically infinite heat sink.{{Clarify|date=January 2013}}

This temperature difference varies with latitude and season, with the maximum in [[tropical]], [[subtropical]] and [[Equatorial climate|equatorial]] waters. Hence the tropics are generally the best OTEC locations.

=== Open/Claude cycle ===

In this scheme, warm surface water at around {{convert|27|C}} enters an evaporator at pressure slightly below the [[saturation pressure]]s causing it to vaporize.

:&lt;math&gt; H_{1}=H_{f} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''H{{sub|f}}'' is [[enthalpy]] of liquid water at the inlet temperature, ''T''{{sub|1}}.

[[File:otec oc t-s dia.jpg]]

This temporarily [[superheating|superheated]] water undergoes volume boiling as opposed to pool boiling in conventional boilers where the heating surface is in contact. Thus the water partially flashes to steam with two-phase equilibrium prevailing. Suppose that the pressure inside the evaporator is maintained at the saturation pressure, ''T''{{sub|2}}.

:&lt;math&gt;H_{2}=H_{1}=H_{f}+x_{2}H_{fg} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''x''{{sub|2}} is the fraction of water by mass that vaporizes. The warm water mass flow rate per unit [[turbine]] mass flow rate is 1/''x''{{sub|2}}.

The low pressure in the evaporator is maintained by a [[vacuum pump]] that also removes the dissolved non-condensable gases from the evaporator. The evaporator now contains a mixture of water and steam of very low [[vapor quality]] (steam content). The steam is separated from the water as saturated vapor. The remaining water is saturated and is discharged to the ocean in the open cycle. The steam is a low pressure/high [[specific volume]] working fluid. It expands in a special low pressure turbine.

:&lt;math&gt;H_{3}=H_{g} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''H{{sub|g}}'' corresponds to ''T''{{sub|2}}. For an ideal [[isentropic process|isentropic]] ([[reversible adiabatic]]) turbine,

:&lt;math&gt;s_{5,s}=s_{3}=s_{f}+x_{5,s}s_{fg} \, &lt;/math&gt;

The above equation corresponds to the temperature at the exhaust of the turbine, ''T''{{sub|5}}. ''x''{{sub|5,''s''}} is the mass fraction of vapor at state 5.

The enthalpy at ''T''{{sub|5}} is,

:&lt;math&gt; H_{5,s}=H_{f}+x_{5,s}H_{fg} \,&lt;/math&gt;

This enthalpy is lower. The adiabatic reversible turbine work = ''H''{{sub|3}}-''H''{{sub|5,''s'' }}.

Actual turbine work {{Math|1=''W''{{sub|T}} = (''H''{{sub|3}}-''H''{{sub|5,''s''}}) x ''polytropic efficiency''}}

:&lt;math&gt;H_{5}=H_{3}-\ \mathrm{actual}\ \mathrm{work} &lt;/math&gt;

The condenser temperature and pressure are lower. Since the turbine exhaust is to be discharged back into the ocean, a direct contact condenser is used to mix the exhaust with cold water, which results in a near-saturated water. That water is now discharged back to the ocean.

''H''{{sub|6}}=''H{{sub|f}}'', at ''T''{{sub|5}}. ''T''{{sub|7}} is the temperature of the exhaust mixed with cold sea water, as the vapour content now is negligible,

:&lt;math&gt;H_{7}\approx H_{f}\,\ at\ T_{7} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The temperature differences between stages include that between warm surface water and working steam, that between exhaust steam and cooling water, and that between cooling water reaching the condenser and deep water. These represent external [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversibilities]] that reduce the overall temperature difference.

The cold water flow rate per unit turbine mass flow rate,

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{m_{c}=\frac{H_{5}-\ H_{6}}{H_{6}-\ H_{7}}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Turbine mass flow rate, &lt;math&gt;\dot{M_{T}}=\frac{\mathrm{turbine}\ \mathrm{work}\ \mathrm{required}}{W_{T}} &lt;/math&gt;

Warm water mass flow rate, &lt;math&gt; \dot{M_{w}}=\dot{M_{T}\dot{m_{w}}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Cold water mass flow rate &lt;math&gt;\dot{\dot{M_{c}}=\dot{M_{T}m_{C}}} \,&lt;/math&gt;
'''

=== Closed Anderson cycle ===

a Developed starting in the 1960s by [[J. Hilbert Anderson]] of Sea Solar Power, Inc. In this cycle, ''Q{{sub|H}}'' is the heat transferred in the evaporator from the warm sea water to the working fluid. The working fluid exits the evaporator as a gas near its [[dew point]].

The high-pressure, high-temperature gas then is expanded in the turbine to yield turbine work, ''W{{sub|T}}''. The working fluid is slightly superheated at the turbine exit and the turbine typically has an efficiency of 90% based on reversible, adiabatic expansion.

From the turbine exit, the working fluid enters the condenser where it rejects heat, ''-Q{{sub|C}}'', to the cold sea water. The condensate is then compressed to the highest pressure in the cycle, requiring condensate pump work, ''W{{sub|C}}''. Thus, the Anderson closed cycle is a Rankine-type cycle similar to the conventional power plant steam cycle except that in the Anderson cycle the working fluid is never superheated more than a few [[degrees Fahrenheit]]. Owing to viscous effects, working fluid pressure drops in both the evaporator and the condenser. This pressure drop, which depends on the types of heat exchangers used, must be considered in final design calculations but is ignored here to simplify the analysis. Thus, the parasitic condensate pump work, ''W{{sub|C}}'', computed here will be lower than if the heat exchanger pressure drop was included. The major additional parasitic energy requirements in the OTEC plant are the cold water pump work, ''W{{sub|CT}}'', and the warm water pump work, ''W{{sub|HT}}''. Denoting all other parasitic energy requirements by ''W{{sub|A}}'', the net work from the OTEC plant, ''W{{sub|NP}}'' is

:&lt;math&gt; W_{NP}=W_{T}-W_{C}-W_{CT}-W_{HT}-W_{A} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The thermodynamic cycle undergone by the working fluid can be analyzed without detailed consideration of the parasitic energy requirements. From the first law of thermodynamics, the energy balance for the working fluid as the system is

:&lt;math&gt; W_{N}=Q_{H}-Q_{C} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1=''W{{sub|N}}'' = ''W{{sub|T}}'' + ''W{{sub|C}}''}} is the net work for the thermodynamic cycle. For the idealized case in which there is no working fluid pressure drop in the heat exchangers,

:&lt;math&gt; Q_{H}=\int_{H}T_{H}ds \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; Q_{C}=\int_{C}T_{C}ds \,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the net thermodynamic cycle work becomes

:&lt;math&gt; W_{N}=\int_{H}T_{H}ds-\int_{C}T_{C}ds \,&lt;/math&gt;

Subcooled liquid enters the evaporator. Due to the heat exchange with warm sea water, evaporation takes place and usually superheated vapor leaves the evaporator. This vapor drives the turbine and the 2-phase mixture enters the condenser. Usually, the subcooled liquid leaves the condenser and finally, this liquid is pumped to the evaporator completing a cycle.

== Environmental impact ==

Carbon dioxide dissolved in deep cold and high pressure layers is brought up to the surface and released as the water warms. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Mixing of deep ocean water with shallower water brings up nutrients and makes them available to shallow water life. This may be an advantage for aquaculture of commercially important species, but may also unbalance the ecological system around the power plant. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

OTEC plants use very large flows of warm surface seawater and cold deep seawater to generate constant renewable power. The deep seawater is oxygen deficient and generally 20-40 times more nutrient rich (in nitrate and nitrite) than shallow seawater. When these plumes are mixed, they are slightly denser than the ambient seawater.&lt;ref name="bioplume"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grandelli|first=Pat|title=Modeling the Physical and Biochemical Influence of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Plant Discharges into their Adjacent Waters|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/1055480/1055480.pdf|website=US Department of Energy - Office of Scientific and Technical Information|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though no large scale physical environmental testing of OTEC has been done, computer models have been developed to simulate the effect of OTEC plants.

=== Hydrodynamic modeling ===

In 2010, a computer model was developed to simulate the physical oceanographic effects of one or several 100 megawatt OTEC plant(s). The model suggests that OTEC plants can be configured such that the plant can conduct continuous operations, with resulting temperature and nutrient variations that are within naturally occurring levels. Studies to date suggest that by discharging the OTEC flows downwards at a depth below 70 meters, the dilution is adequate and nutrient enrichment is small enough so that 100-megawatt OTEC plants could be operated in a sustainable manner on a continuous basis.&lt;ref name="hydroplume"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rocheleau|first=Greg|author2=Pat Grandelli|title=Physical and biological modeling of a 100 megawatt Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion discharge plume|journal=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|date=22 September 2011|page=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6107077&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6107077|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological modeling ===

The nutrients from an OTEC discharge could potentially cause increased biological activity if they accumulate in large quantities in the [[photic zone]].&lt;ref name="hydroplume" /&gt; In 2011 a biological component was added to the hydrodynamic computer model to simulate the biological response to plumes from 100 megawatt OTEC plants. In all cases modeled (discharge at 70 meters depth or more), no unnatural variations occurs in the upper 40 meters of the ocean's surface.&lt;ref name="bioplume" /&gt; The picoplankton response in the 110 - 70 meter depth layer is approximately a 10-25% increase, which is well within naturally occurring variability. The nanoplankton response is negligible. The enhanced productivity of diatoms (microplankton) is small. The subtle phytoplankton increase of the baseline OTEC plant suggests that higher-order biochemical effects will be very small.&lt;ref name="bioplume" /&gt;

=== Studies ===

A previous Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the United States' NOAA from 1981 is available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Environmental Impact Statement for Commercial Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Licensing|url=http://hinmrec.hnei.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/OTEC-Programmatic-EIS-NOAA-1981.pdf|website=U.S. Dept of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but needs to be brought up to current oceanographic and engineering standards. Studies have been done to propose the best environmental baseline monitoring practices, focusing on a set of ten chemical oceanographic parameters relevant to OTEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=L.Vega, C.Comfort|title=Environmental Assessment of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion in Hawaii|url=http://hinmrec.hnei.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Environmental-Assessment-of-OTEC-in-Hawaii1.pdf|website=Hawaii National Marine Renewable Energy Center|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, NOAA held an OTEC Workshop in 2010 and 2012 seeking to assess the physical, chemical, and biological impacts and risks, and identify information gaps or needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion: Assessing Potential Physical, Chemical, and Biological Impacts and Risks|url=http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/otec/docs/otecjun10wkshp.pdf|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion: Information Needs Assessment|url=http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/otec/docs/otecassessment.pdf|website=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Response and Restoration (ORR) and the Environmental Research Group at the University of New Hampshire (UNH)|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical difficulties ==

=== Dissolved gases ===

The performance of direct contact heat exchangers operating at typical OTEC boundary conditions is important to the Claude cycle. Many early Claude cycle designs used a surface condenser since their performance was well understood. However, direct contact condensers offer significant disadvantages. As cold water rises in the intake pipe, the pressure decreases to the point where gas begins to evolve. If a significant amount of gas comes out of solution, placing a gas trap before the direct contact heat exchangers may be justified. Experiments simulating conditions in the warm water intake pipe indicated about 30% of the dissolved gas evolves in the top {{convert|8.5|m|ft|sp=us}} of the tube. The trade-off between [[wikt:dearation|pre-dearation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=deaerate deaeration]&lt;/ref&gt; of the seawater and expulsion of non-condensable gases from the condenser is dependent on the gas evolution dynamics, deaerator efficiency, head loss, vent compressor efficiency and parasitic power. Experimental results indicate vertical spout condensers perform some 30% better than falling jet types.

=== Microbial fouling ===

Because raw seawater must pass through the heat exchanger, care must be taken to maintain good [[thermal conductivity]].  [[Biofouling]] layers as thin as {{convert|25|to|50|μm}} can degrade heat exchanger performance by as much as 50%.&lt;ref name=microbial-countermeasures/&gt; A\1977 study in which mock heat exchangers were exposed to seawater for ten weeks concluded that although the level of microbial fouling was low, the thermal conductivity of the system was significantly impaired.&lt;ref name=microbial-fouling&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aftring RP, Taylor BF |title=Assessment of Microbial Fouling in an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Experiment |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=734–739 |date=October 1979 |pmid=16345450 |pmc=243568 |doi= |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16345450|last2=Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent discrepancy between the level of fouling and the heat transfer impairment is the result of a thin layer of water trapped by the microbial growth on the surface of the heat exchanger.&lt;ref name=microbial-fouling/&gt;

Another study concluded that fouling degrades performance over time, and determined that although regular brushing was able to remove most of the microbial layer, over time a tougher layer formed that could not be removed through simple brushing.&lt;ref name=microbial-countermeasures&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berger LR, Berger JA |title=Countermeasures to Microbiofouling in Simulated Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Heat Exchangers with Surface and Deep Ocean Waters in Hawaii |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=1186–1198 |date=June 1986 |pmid=16347076 |pmc=239043 |doi= |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16347076|last2=Berger }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study passed sponge rubber balls through the system. It concluded that although the ball treatment decreased the fouling rate it was not enough to completely halt growth and brushing was occasionally necessary to restore capacity. The microbes regrew more quickly later in the experiment (i.e. brushing became necessary more often) replicating the results of a previous study.&lt;ref name=microbial-brush-cleaning&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickels JS, Bobbie RJ, Lott DF, Martz RF, Benson PH, White DC |title=Effect of Manual Brush Cleaning on Biomass and Community Structure of Microfouling Film Formed on Aluminum and Titanium Surfaces Exposed to Rapidly Flowing Seawater |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1442–1453 |date=June 1981 |pmid=16345798 |pmc=243937 |doi= |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16345798|last2=Bobbie |last3=Lott |last4=Martz |last5=Benson |last6=White }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased growth rate after subsequent cleanings appears to result from selection pressure on the microbial colony.&lt;ref name=microbial-brush-cleaning/&gt;

Continuous use of 1 hour per day and intermittent periods of free fouling and then [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] periods (again 1 hour per day) were studied. Chlorination slowed but did not stop microbial growth; however chlorination levels of .1&amp;nbsp;mg per liter for 1 hour per day may prove effective for long term operation of a plant.&lt;ref name=microbial-countermeasures/&gt;  The study concluded that although microbial fouling was an issue for the warm surface water heat exchanger, the cold water heat exchanger suffered little or no biofouling and only minimal inorganic fouling.&lt;ref name=microbial-countermeasures/&gt;

Besides water temperature, microbial fouling also depends on nutrient levels, with growth occurring faster in nutrient rich water.&lt;ref name=biofilm-dynamics&gt;{{Cite journal | title =  Dynamics of Biofilm Processes | last = Trulear | first = MG |author2=Characklis, WG |date=September 1982 | journal =  Journal of the Water Pollution Control Federation | volume = 54 | issue = 9 | pages = 1288–1301 | url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?collection=ENV&amp;recid=8301080&amp;uid=792056511&amp;q=&amp;uid=792056511&amp;q=&amp;uid=792056511&amp;setcookie=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fouling rate also depends on the material used to construct the heat exchanger. [[Aluminium]] tubing slows the growth of microbial life, although the [[aluminium oxide|oxide]] layer which forms on the inside of the pipes complicates cleaning and leads to larger efficiency losses.&lt;ref name=microbial-brush-cleaning/&gt;  In contrast, [[titanium]] tubing allows biofouling to occur faster but cleaning is more effective than with aluminium.&lt;ref name=microbial-brush-cleaning/&gt;

=== Sealing ===

The evaporator, turbine, and condenser operate in partial vacuum ranging from 3% to 1% of atmospheric pressure. The system must be carefully sealed to prevent in-leakage of atmospheric air that can degrade or shut down operation. In closed-cycle OTEC, the specific volume of low-pressure steam is very large compared to that of the pressurized working fluid. Components must have large flow areas to ensure steam velocities do not attain excessively high values.

=== Parasitic power consumption by exhaust compressor ===

An approach for reducing the exhaust compressor [[Parasitic loss|parasitic power loss]] is as follows. After most of the steam has been condensed by spout condensers, the non-condensible gas steam mixture is passed through a counter current region which increases the gas-steam reaction by a factor of five. The result is an 80% reduction in the exhaust pumping power requirements.

== Cold air/warm water conversion ==

In winter in coastal [[Arctic]] locations, the delta T between the seawater and ambient air can be as high as 40&amp;nbsp;°C (72&amp;nbsp;°F). Closed-cycle systems could exploit the air-water temperature difference. Eliminating seawater extraction pipes might make a system based on this concept less expensive than OTEC. This technology is due to H. Barjot, who suggested butane as cryogen, because of its boiling point of {{convert|-0.5|C|F}} and its non-solubility in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,751867,00.html | work=Time | title=Science: Cold Power | date=1929-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming a level of efficiency of realistic 4%, calculations show that the amount of energy generated with one cubic meter water at a temperature of {{convert|2|C|F}} in a place with an air temperature of {{convert|-22|C|F}} equals the amount of energy generated by letting this cubic meter water run through a hydroelectric plant of 4000 feet (1,200 m) height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buch-der-synergie.de/c_neu_html/c_06_10_wasser_temperaturgradient.htm |title=Achmed Khammas - Das Buch der Synergie - Teil C - Temperaturgradient |publisher=Buch-der-synergie.de |date=2007-10-25 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barjot Polar Power Plants could be located on islands in the polar region or designed as swimming barges or platforms attached to the [[ice cap]]. The weather station Myggbuka at Greenlands east coast for example, which is only 2,100&amp;nbsp;km away from Glasgow, detects monthly mean temperatures below {{convert|-15|C|F}} during 6 winter months in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/station/de-myggb.htm |title=Denmark - Myggbuka |publisher=Globalbioclimatics.org |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of the thermoelectric effect ==

In 1979 SERI proposed using the [[Seebeck effect]] to produce power with a total conversion efficiency of 2%&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/254.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Liping Liu, Associate Professor at Rutgers University, envisioned an OTEC system that utilises the solid state [[thermoelectric effect]] rather than the fluid cycles traditionally used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2014-12-thermoelectric-power-economically-competitive-renewable.html Thermoelectric power plants could offer economically competitive renewable energy] PhysOrg.com, Dec 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liping Liu.

'''Piston effect''' refers to the [[forced-air]] flow inside a [[tunnel]] or shaft caused by moving vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200622/000020062206A0880005.php |title=JR-East (East Japan Railway Company) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217004746/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200622/000020062206A0880005.php |archivedate=February 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of numerous phenomena that engineers and designers must consider when developing a range of structures.

==Cause==
[[File:Piston Effect of a Van.svg|thumb|left|A diagram showing the piston effect as a vehicle moves through a tunnel.]]
[[File:E5 S11 Sendai 20090725.JPG|thumb|The elongated nose of this [[E5 Series Shinkansen|modern high speed train]] in Japan is designed to counter the piston effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitachi Brasil Ltd. |title=Innovation and Advanced Technology - High Speed Train – Hitachi Brasil Ltda |website=www.slideshare.net |url=http://www.slideshare.net/SistemaFIEB/innovation-and-advanced-technology-high-speed-train-hitachi-brasil-ltda |at=Slide 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In open air, when a vehicle travels along, air pushed aside can move in any direction except into the ground. Inside a tunnel, air is confined by the tunnel walls to move along the tunnel. Behind the moving vehicle, as air has been pushed away, suction is created, and air is pulled to flow into the tunnel. In addition, because of [[Viscosity|fluid viscosity]], the surface of the vehicle drags the air to flow with vehicle, a force experienced as [[skin drag]] by the vehicle. This movement of air by the vehicle is analogous to the operation of a mechanical [[piston]] as inside a [[reciprocating compressor]] gas pump, hence the name 'piston effect.' The effect is also similar to the pressure fluctuations inside drainage pipes as waste water pushes air in front of it.

[[File:Why London Underground is nicknamed The Tube.jpg|thumb|right|The clearance between train and tunnel is often small. London Underground train at [[Hendon Central tube station|Hendon Central]].]]
The piston effect is very pronounced in railway tunnels, because the cross sectional area of trains is large and in many cases almost completely fills the tunnel [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]. The wind felt by the passengers on underground railway platforms (that do not have [[platform screen doors]] installed) when a train is approaching is air flow from the piston effect. The effect is less pronounced in road vehicle tunnels, as the cross-sectional area of vehicle is small compared to the total cross-sectional area of the tunnel.  Single track tunnels experience the maximum effect but clearance between rolling stock and the tunnel as well as the shape of the front of the train affect its strength.&lt;ref name="pre"/&gt;

Air flow caused by the piston effect can exert large forces on the installations inside the tunnel and so these installations have to be carefully designed and installed properly. Non-return [[Damper (flow)|dampers]] are sometimes needed to prevent stalling of ventilation fans caused by this air flow.&lt;ref name="pre"&gt;{{cite book |title=Practical Railway Engineering |last=Bonnett |first=Clifford F. |year=2005 |publisher=[[Imperial College Press]] |isbn=1860945155 |pages=174–175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcMgBJ1exfIC |accessdate=20 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The piston effect has to be considered by building designers in relation to smoke movement within an [[elevator]] shaft.&lt;ref name="epeatsp"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Klote |first=John H. |author2=George Tamura |date=13 June 1986 |title=Elevator Piston Effect and the Smoke Problem |journal=Fire Safety Journal |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=227–233 |url=https://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/upload/3Klote_R8700428_Elevator_Piston.pdf |accessdate=20 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A moving elevator car forces the air in front of it out of the shaft and pulls air into the shaft behind it with the effect most apparent in elevator systems with a fast moving car in a single shaft. This means that in a fire a moving elevator may push smoke into lower floors.&lt;ref name="epeatsp" /&gt;

The piston effect is used in tunnel ventilation. In railway tunnels, the train pushes out the air in front of it toward the closest ventilation shaft in front, and sucks air into the tunnel from the closest ventilation shaft behind it. The piston effect can also assist ventilation in road vehicle tunnels.

In underground rapid transit systems, the piston effect contributes to ventilation and in some cases provides enough air movement to make mechanical ventilation unnecessary. At wider stations with multiple tracks, air quality remains the same and can even improve when mechanical ventilation is disabled. At narrow platforms with a single tunnel, however, air quality worsens when relying on the piston effect alone for ventilation. This still allows for potential energy savings by taking advantage of the piston effect rather than mechanical ventilation where possible.&lt;ref name="subway-air-quality"&gt;{{cite journal

==Tunnel boom==
[[File:tgv_tunnel_with_hood.jpg|thumb|right|A tunnel in the French high-speed [[TGV]] network with an entrance hood to mitigate tunnel boom.]]

'''Tunnel boom''' is a loud boom sometimes generated by high-speed trains when they exit tunnels. These [[shock wave]]s can disturb nearby residents and damage trains and tunnel structures. The perception of this sound by humans is similar to that of a [[sonic boom]] from supersonic aircraft, but unlike a sonic boom, tunnel boom is not caused by trains exceeding the speed of sound. Instead, tunnel boom results from the structure of the tunnel preventing the air around the train from escaping in all directions. As a train passes through a tunnel, it generates compression waves in front of it. These waves coalesce into a shock wave that generates a loud boom when it reaches the tunnel exit.&lt;ref name="takayama1995"&gt;{{cite journal

Tunnel boom can disturb residents near the mouth of the tunnel, and it is exacerbated in mountain valleys where the sound can echo. Reducing these disturbances is a significant challenge for high-speed lines such as Japan's [[Shinkansen]] and the French TGV. Tunnel boom has become a principal limitation to increased train speeds in Japan where the mountainous terrain requires frequent tunnels. Japan has created a law limiting noise to 70&amp;nbsp;dB in residential areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=新幹線鉄道騒音に係る環境基準について（昭和50年環境庁告示） The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollutions (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which applies to many tunnel exit zones.

Methods of reducing the phenomenon include making the train's profile highly [[aerodynamic]], adding hoods to tunnel entrances,&lt;ref name="ishikawa2010"&gt;

[[File:Positronium.svg|thumb|200px|right|An [[electron]] and [[positron]] orbiting around their common [[centre of mass]]. (An s state has zero angular momentum; so orbiting around each other would mean going straight at each other until scattered or until annihilation, whichever comes first). This is a bound quantum state known as '''positronium'''.]]
'''Positronium''' ('''Ps''') is a system consisting of an [[electron]] and its [[antimatter|anti-particle]], a [[positron]], bound together into an [[exotic atom]], specifically an [[onium]].  The system is unstable: the two particles annihilate each other to predominantly produce two or three [[gamma-ray]]s, depending on the relative spin states.  The orbit and [[energy level]]s of the two particles are similar to that of the [[hydrogen atom]] (which is a bound state of a [[proton]] and an electron). However, because of the [[reduced mass]], the [[frequency|frequencies]] of the [[spectral line]]s are less than half of the corresponding hydrogen lines.

==States==

The mass of positronium is 1.022&amp;nbsp;MeV, which is twice the electron mass minus the binding energy of a few eV. The [[ground state]] of positronium, like that of hydrogen, has two possible configurations depending on the relative orientations of the spins of the electron and the positron.

The [[Singlet state|''singlet'' state]], {{SubatomicParticle|para-positronium}},  with [[Antiparallel (mathematics)|antiparallel]] [[spin (physics)|spin]]s ([[spin quantum number|''S'']]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) is known as ''para''-positronium (''p''-Ps). It has a mean lifetime of 0.125&amp;nbsp;[[nanosecond|ns]] and decays preferentially into two gamma rays with energy of {{val|511|ul=keV}} each (in the [[center-of-mass frame]]). By detecting these photons the position at which the decay occurred can be determined.  This process is used in [[positron-emission tomography]]. ''Para''-positronium can decay into any even number of photons (2, 4, 6, ...), but the probability quickly decreases with the number: the [[branching ratio]] for decay into 4 photons is {{val|1.439|(2)|e=-6}}.&lt;ref name="hep-ph0310099"&gt;

The annihilation into a [[neutrino]]–antineutrino pair is also possible, but the probability is predicted to be negligible. The branching ratio for ''o''-Ps decay for this channel is {{val|6.2|e=-18}} (electron neutrino–antineutrino pair) and {{val|9.5|e=-21}} (for other flavour)&lt;ref name="hep-ph9911410" /&gt; in predictions based on the Standard Model, but it can be increased by non-standard neutrino properties, like relatively high [[magnetic moment]]. The experimental upper limits on branching ratio for this decay (as well as for a decay into any "invisible" particles) are &lt;{{val|4.3|e=-7}} for ''p''-Ps and &lt;{{val|4.2|e=-7}} for ''o''-Ps.&lt;ref name="Badertscher" /&gt;

==Energy levels==
{{main|Bohr model#Electron energy levels}}

While precise calculation of positronium energy levels uses the [[Bethe–Salpeter equation]] or the [[Breit equation]], the similarity between positronium and hydrogen allows a rough estimate.  In this approximation, the energy levels are different because of a different effective mass, ''m''*, in the energy equation (see [[Bohr model#Electron energy levels|electron energy levels]] for a derivation):

::&lt;math&gt;E_n = -\frac{\mu q_\mathrm{e}^4}{8 h^2 \varepsilon_0^2} \frac{1}{n^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Elementary charge|charge magnitude]] of the electron (same as the positron),
:{{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]],
:{{math|''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[electric constant]] (otherwise known as the permittivity of free space),
:{{mvar|&amp;mu;}} is the [[reduced mass]]:
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{m_\mathrm{e} m_\mathrm{p}}{m_\mathrm{e} + m_\mathrm{p}} = \frac{m_\mathrm{e}^2}{2m_\mathrm{e}} = \frac{m_\mathrm{e}}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} are, respectively, the mass of the electron and the positron (which are ''the same'' by definition as antiparticles).

Thus, for positronium, its reduced mass only differs from the electron by a factor of 2. This causes the energy levels to also roughly be half of what they are for the hydrogen atom.

So finally, the energy levels of positronium are given by

::&lt;math&gt; E_n = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{m_\mathrm{e} q_\mathrm{e}^4}{8 h^2 \varepsilon_0^2} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{-6.8~\mathrm{eV}}{n^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The lowest energy level of positronium ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}) is &amp;minus;6.8&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt]]s&amp;nbsp;(eV). The next level is {{val|-1.7|u=eV}}. The negative sign implies a [[bound state]].  Positronium can also be considered by a particular form of the [[Two-body Dirac equations|two-body Dirac equation]]; Two point particles with a [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb interaction]] can be exactly separated in the (relativistic) [[center-of-momentum frame]] and the resulting ground-state energy has been obtained very accurately using [[finite element method]]s of J. Shertzer.&lt;ref name="Shertzer"/&gt;  The Dirac equation whose Hamiltonian comprises two Dirac particles and a static Coulomb potential is not relativistically invariant.  But if one adds the {{math|{{sfrac|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} (or {{math|''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} is the [[fine-structure constant]]) terms, where {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1,2…}}, then the result is relativistically invariant.  Only the leading term is included.  The {{math|''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} contribution is the Breit term; workers rarely go to {{math|''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} because at {{math|''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} one has the Lamb shift, which requires quantum electrodynamics.&lt;ref name="Shertzer"&gt;

Jerolmack. "Real and apparent changes in sediment deposition rates through time." Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface (2003–2012) 114.F3 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect equivalently states that more ancient packages of sediment in the stratigraphic record will record slower sedimentation rates stretched over longer periods of time. For instance, it explains the fact that in general, the more ancient geological [[Period (geology)|periods]] of the [[Phanerozoic]] are longer than the more recent ones; i.e., the periods of the [[Palaeozoic]] are much longer than those in the [[Cenozoic]]. Conversely, it also explains that the maximum sediment accumulation rates seen in the [[Cambrian]] at the start of the Phanerozoic are almost two orders of magnitude lower than those observed in the [[Quaternary]], at its end.&lt;ref name=Sadler /&gt;

The Sadler effect provides a powerful framework for understanding how information extracted from any given stratigraphic section differs from what should be expected under constant conditions – that is, it provides a [[null hypothesis]] for analysing stratigraphy. It also provides techniques to estimate the completeness of a given stratigraphic section on a given timescale. Sections are less complete at shorter timescales, which means that at sufficiently short timescales and for some purposes, some sedimentary successions may contain essentially no useful information.&lt;ref name=Sadler /&gt;

For example, the Sadler effect has since been used to investigate whether [[Tectonic–climatic interaction#Climate-driven tectonism|apparent increases in global sedimentation rates]] across the last 5 Ma are real;&lt;ref name=Schumer2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peizhen, Zhang, Peter Molnar, and William R.

==Introduction==
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg. When this is done, the cytoplasmic factors affect the nucleus to become a zygote. The blastocyst stage is developed by the egg which helps to create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic cell nuclear transfer {{!}} biology and technology|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/somatic-cell-nuclear-transfer|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=27 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first animal that was developed by this technique was Dolly, the sheep, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer - Embryology|url=https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Somatic_Cell_Nuclear_Transfer|website=embryology.med.unsw.edu.au|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, known as the ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to the cells of the human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an denucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum.&lt;ref name="Pattinson"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|last2=Kind|first2=Vanessa|date=2017-09-12|title=Using a moot to develop students’ understanding of human cloning and statutory interpretation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0968533217726350|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|doi=10.1177/0968533217726350}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is [[Reprogramming|reprogrammed]] by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a [[blastocyst]] (an early stage [[embryo]] with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Applications==

=== Stem cell research ===
Somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in [[stem cell research]]. The aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo. These cells [[Genetics|genetically]] matched the donor organism from which they came. This gives them the ability to create patient specific pluripotent cells, which could then be used in therapies or disease research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo. These cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism. This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type, which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable human embryos. Leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells, SCNT is one such method.

A potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient's particular disease. By doing so, an ''in vitro'' model could be created, would be useful for studying that particular disease, potentially discovering its pathophysiology, and discovering therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals, questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum. Despite many attempts, success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited. There lies a problem in the human cell's ability to form a blastocyst; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development. This is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development. These earlier experiments used procedures developed in non-primate animals with little success.

A research group from the [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] demonstrated SCNT procedures developed for primates successfully   using skin cells. The key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase II (MII) of the cell cycle. Egg cells in MII contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states. When the ovum's nucleus is removed, the cell loses its genetic information. This has been blamed for why enucleated eggs are hampered in their reprogramming ability. It is theorized the critical embryonic genes are physically linked to oocyte chromosomes, enucleation negatively affects these factors. Another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast, affecting reprogramming ability.

Taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human SCNT stem cells. In May 2013, the Oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through SCNT, using fetal and infant donor cells. Using MII oocytes from volunteers and their improved SCNT procedure, human clone embryos were successfully produced. These embryos were of poor quality, lacking a substantial inner cell mass and poorly constructed [[trophectoderm]]. The imperfect embryos prevented the acquisition of human ESC. The addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum's nucleus and injection of the somatic nucleus improved blastocyst formation and ESC isolation. The ESC obtain were found to be capable of producing teratomas, expressed pluripotent transcription factors, and expressed a normal 46XX karyotype, indicating these SCNT were in fact ESC-like.&lt;ref name="Tachibana"/&gt; This was the first instance of successfully using SCNT to reprogram human somatic cells. This study used fetal and infantile somatic cells to produce their ESC.

In April 2014, an international research team expanded on this break through. There remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells. Epigenetic and age related changes were thought to possibly hinder an adult somatic cells ability to be reprogrammed. Implementing the procedure pioneered by the Oregon research group they indeed were able to grow stem cells generated by SCNT using adult cells from two donors, aged 35 and 75.Indicating age does not impede a cells ability to be reprogrammed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909%2814%2900137-4 Human Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Using Adult Cells] ''[[Cell Stem Cell]]''.

Late April 2014, the [[New York Stem Cell Foundation]] was successful in creating SCNT stem cells derived from adult somatic cells. One of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic. The group was then able to successfully culture these stem cells and induce differentiation. When injected into mice, cells of all three of the germ layers successfully formed. The most significant of these cells, were those who expressed insulin and were capable of secreting the hormone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These insulin producing cells could be used for replacement therapy in diabetics, demonstrating real SCNT stem cell therapeutic potential.

The impetus for SCNT-based stem cell research has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cells]] were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based stem cell research: the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases.&lt;ref name="2008 breakthrough"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gretchen Vogel|title=Breakthrough of the year: Reprogramming Cells|journal=Science |volume=322|issue=5909|pages=1766–1767|date=December 2008|doi=10.1126/science.322.5909.1766|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/322/5909/1766 |pmid=19095902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells. Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into. For instance, an iPS cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells, while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the question of how well iPS cells can mimic the gold standard ESC in experiments, as stem cells are defined as having the ability to differentiate into any cell type. SCNT stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies.

=== Reproductive cloning ===
{{main|Cloning}}
[[File:ECM 2001 Hybridoma System.jpg|62 KBpx|thumbnail|BTX ECM 2001 Electrofusion generator used for SCNT and Cloning applications]]
This technique is currently the basis for [[cloning]] animals (such as the famous [[Dolly the sheep]]),&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been theoretically proposed as a possible way to clone humans. Using SCNT in reproductive cloning has proven difficult with limited success. High fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient. Resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species. For these reasons, along with moral and ethical objections, reproductive cloning in humans is proscribed in more than 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most researchers believe that in the foreseeable future it will not be possible to use the current cloning technique to produce a human clone that will develop to term. It remains a possibility, though critical adjustments will be required to overcome current limitations during early embryonic development in human SCNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Revel M |title=Research on animal cloning technologies and their implications in medical ethics: an update |journal=Med Law |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=527–43 |year=2000 |pmid=11143888 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rhind SM, Taylor JE, De Sousa PA, King TJ, McGarry M, Wilmut I |title=Human cloning: can it be made safe? |journal=Nat.

There is also the potential for treating diseases associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Recent studies show SCNT of the nucleus of a body cell afflicted with one of these diseases into a healthy oocyte prevents the inheritance of the mitochondrial disease. This treatment does not involve cloning but would produce a child with three genetic parents. A father providing a sperm cell, one mother providing the egg nucleus and another mother providing the enucleated egg cell.&lt;ref name="Pera" /&gt;

=== Interspecies nuclear transfer ===
Interspecies nuclear transfer (iSCNT) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species, or even to restore species after their extinction. The technique is similar to SCNT [[cloning]] which typically is between domestic animals and rodents, or where there is a ready supply of oocytes and surrogate animals. However, the cloning of highly endangered or extinct species requires the use of an alternative method of cloning. Interspecies nuclear transfer utilizes a host and a donor of two different organisms that are closely related species and within the same genus. In 2000, [[Robert Lanza]] was able to produce a cloned fetus of a [[gaur]], ''Bos gaurus'', combining it successfully with a domestic cow, ''Bos taurus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lanza|first=Robert P.|author2=Jose B. Cibelli |author3=Francisca A. Diaz |author4=Carlos T. Moraes |author5=Peter W. Farin |author6=Charlotte E. Farin |author7=Carolyn J. Hammer |author8=Michael D. West |author9=Philip Damiani  |title=Cloning of an endangered species (Bos gaurus) using interspecies nuclear transfer|journal=Cloning|year=2000|volume=2|issue=2|pages=79–90|url=http://media.longnow.org/files/2/REVIVE/Cloning%20of%20an%20Endangered%20Species.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2013|doi=10.1089/152045500436104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interspecies nuclear transfer provides evidence of the universality of the triggering mechanism of the cell nucleus reprogramming. For example, Gupta et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Das | first2 = Z. C. | last3 = Heo | first3 = Y. T. | last4 = Uhm | first4 = S.

Moreover, NCSU23 medium, which was designed for in vitro culture of pig embryos, was able to support the in vitro development of cattle, mice, and chicken iSCNT embryos up to the [[blastocyst]] stage. Furthermore, ovine oocyte cytoplast may be used for remodeling and reprogramming of human somatic cells back to the embryonic stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hosseini | first1 = S.

==Limitations==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
SCNT can be inefficient. Stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus in early research were enormous, resulting in a low percentage of successfully reprogrammed cells. For example, in 1996 Dolly the sheep was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; As the procedure was not automated, but had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive. The [[biochemistry]] involved in reprogramming the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from understood. However, by 2014, researchers were reporting success rates of 70-80% with cloning pigs&lt;ref&gt;Shukman, David (14 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25576718 China cloning on an 'industrial scale'] BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 a Korean company, Sooam Biotech, was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos a day.&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=New Scientist|date=8 February  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's [[mitochondria]] that contain their own [[mitochondrial DNA]] are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. This fact may also hamper the potential benefits of SCNT derived tissues/organs for therapy, as there may be an immunoresponse to the non-self mtDNA after transplant.

== Controversy ==
{{Further|stem cell controversy}}

[[Image:Human blastocyst.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Human [[Blastocyst]], showing the [[inner cell mass]] (top, right).]]
Proposals to use nucleus transfer techniques in human stem cell research raise a set of concerns beyond the moral status of any created embryo. These have led to some individuals and organizations who are ''not'' opposed to human embryonic stem cell research to be concerned about, or opposed to, SCNT research.&lt;ref name="rifkin"&gt;[[Jeremy Rifkin]]. (February 18, 2002). [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020218/rifkin "Fusion Biopolitics".] ''The Nation''. Retrieved on August 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolberg"&gt;Sheryl Gay Stolberg, "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE7DA1E3BF937A15752C0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Some for Abortion Rights Lean Right in Cloning Fight]", ''New York Times'' (January 24, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lori B. Andrews, et al., [http://geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=1958 Open Letter to US Senate on Human Cloning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122105524/http://geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=1958 |date=2010-11-22 }}, (March 19, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

One concern is that blastula creation in SCNT-based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction,&lt;ref name="Regulation"&gt;Lori B. Andrews et al. (March 19, 2002).[http://genetics-and-society.org/resources/cgs/2002_open_letter.html "Open Letter to US Senators on Human Cloning and Eugenic Engineering".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930074200/http://www.genetics-and-society.org/resources/cgs/2002_open_letter.html |date=2006-09-30 }} Retrieved on August 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or its prohibition.&lt;ref name="rifkin" /&gt;

A second important concern is the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed. SCNT requires human [[ovum|eggs]], which can only be obtained from women. The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment. This is a minimally invasive procedure, but it does carry some health risks, such as [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].

One vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients. Each custom stem cell line would consist of a collection of identical stem cells each carrying the patient's own DNA, thus reducing or eliminating any problems with rejection when the stem cells were transplanted for treatment. For example, to treat a man with Parkinson's disease, a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by SCNT into an egg cell from an egg donor, creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient's own cells. (There would be differences. For example, the mitochondrial DNA would be the same as that of the egg donor. In comparison, his own cells would carry the mitochondrial DNA of his mother.)

Potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy, and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line.  Such large numbers of donated eggs would exceed the number of eggs currently left over and available from couples trying to have children through [[assisted reproductive technology]]. Therefore, healthy young women would need to be induced to sell eggs to be used in the creation of custom stem cell lines that could then be purchased by the medical industry and sold to patients. It is so far unclear where all these eggs would come from.

Stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long-term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyperovulation (ovulating several eggs at once). Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now, the long-term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use on a large scale on otherwise healthy women. Longer-term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later. Whether hormone treatments to induce hyperovulation could have similar effects is unknown. There are also ethical questions surrounding paying for eggs. In general, marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries. Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time.

To address the problem of creating a human egg market, some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs. If successful, human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines.  However, this technology may be a long way off.

== Policies regarding human SCNT ==
SCNT involving human cells is currently legal for research purposes in the [[United Kingdom]], having been incorporated into the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]].&lt;ref name="coghlan"&gt;Andy Coghlan, "[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1602 Cloning opponents fear loopholes in new UK law]", ''New Scientist'' (November 23, 2001, retrieved October 6, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pattinson"/&gt; Permission must be obtained from the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] in order to perform or attempt SCNT.

In the United States, the practice remains legal, as it has not been addressed by federal law.&lt;ref name="NBAC"&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/research/nrcbl/nbac/pubs/cloning1/chapter5.pdf "Chapter 5: Legal and Policy Considerations.

Accessed 21 Oct 06&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 2002, a moratorium on United States federal funding for SCNT prohibits funding the practice for the purposes of research.  Thus, though legal, SCNT cannot be federally funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robertson | first1 = John A | year = 2010 | title = Embryo Stem Cell Research: Ten Years of Controversy | url = | journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine, &amp; Ethics | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 191–203 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2010.00479.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; American scholars have recently argued that because the product of SCNT is a clone embryo, rather than a human embryo, these policies are morally wrong and should be revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cunningham | first1 = Thomas V | year = 2013 | title = What justifies the United States ban on federal funding for nonreproductive cloning? | url = | journal = Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 825–841 | doi=10.1007/s11019-013-9465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[United Nations]] adopted a proposal submitted by [[Costa Rica]], calling on member states to "prohibit all forms of human cloning in as much as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life."&lt;ref name="un"&gt;United Nations, "[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/ga10333.doc.htm General Assembly Adopts United Nations Declaration on Human Cloning By Vote of 84-34-37]", press release (August 3, 2005, retrieved October 6, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase may include SCNT, depending on interpretation.

The [[Council of Europe|Council of Europe's]] ''Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine'' and its ''Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being'' appear to ban SCNT of human beings.

The term '''South Seas''' commonly refers to the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. Geographically, all areas to the south of [[Panama]]'s degree of latitude belong to the South Sea.

Central archipelagos are the [[Society Islands]] ([[French Polynesia]]/[[Tahiti]]), the [[Samoan islands|Samoa]]-archipelago and the [[Fiji]] islands. The term South Sea is often used [[synonymy|synonymously]] for [[Oceania]] and in a narrow sense for [[Polynesia]] ([[Polynesian Triangle]]). The [[Hawaii]] islands, [[New Zealand]] ([[Aotearoa]]) and the [[Easter Island]] (''Rapa Nui'') build the vertices.

== History ==

[[File:Nuñez de Balboa.jpg|upright|thumbnail|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]]]
The Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] coined the term "South Sea" when he traveled through the isthmus of Panama and named the ocean lying ahead ([[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]) ''Mar del sur'' („'''South Ocean'''“).

Núñez de Balboas and his soldiers tried to travel to the peak of the mountain to see the huge sea, but when they arrived at the foot of the mountain there where only 69 out of 190 soldiers left. He didn't want to share the experience of being the first to see the unknown ocean so he commanded his crew to stand still and wait. On 25 September 1513, he was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean. After looking at the ocean for some time, he told his crew to come up to share his happiness and his pride with them.

He declared the ''South Ocean'' to be property of his king, when he realized the salty water of the ocean, after he set foot into the water at the opening of the Saban river.

=== South Sea Paradise ===

In a figurative sense, the South Sea is an often idealised and distant region.

In 1773, when [[James Cook]] came to Tahiti for the second time, he was accompanied by two scientifically educated Germans [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] and [[Georg Forster]].
:''"What a morning - impossible to be described more beautifully by any poet - when we saw the isle O-Taheiti two miles ahead of us.“''

The report of the discoverers determined the Europeans' picture of the South Sea for a long time. On these grounds, [[Joseph Banks]] wrote: 
:"An Arcadia of which we will be king."

[[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Louis Antoine de Bougainville']]s romantic travel report ''Voyage autour du monde'' as well as Georg Forster's travel description ''A Voyage Round The World'' (1777) confirmed [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau']]s image of the "[[noble savage| noble savages]]". He describes the country as ''„jardin d’Eden“'' ([[Garden of Eden]]), which provided his residents with everything required to live. He saw the islanders as pure humans not yet poisoned by civilization. The report ''Voyage autour du monde'' inspired [[Denis Diderot]] to write his essay ''Supplément au voyage de Bougainville,'' a plea for sexual freedom.

[[Paul Gauguin]], a French artist, contributed to this picture as well. His pictures do not resemble reality, but the exotic paradise he envisioned.

Even the German writer [[Erich Scheurmann]] benefited from these desires, which can be seen in his fictional travel reports of a South Sea chief. The travel reports were published between 1915 and 1920 under the title [[The Papalagi]]. Fifty years after the book was published it became a cult book and more than 1.7 million copies were sold in the German language only.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10858">The '''spark spread''' is the theoretical gross margin of a gas-fired [[power plant]] from selling a unit of [[electricity]], having bought the [[fuel]] required to produce this unit of electricity. All other costs ([[Business operations|operation]] and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and other financial costs) must be covered from the spark spread. The term was first coined by Tony West's trading team on the trading floor of [[National Power]] Ltd in Swindon, UK during the late 1990s and quickly came into common usage as other traders realised the trading and hedging opportunities.

The term '''dark spread''', '''quark spread''' and '''bark spread''' {{cn|date=June 2017}} refers to the similarly defined difference between cash streams (spread) for coal-fired power plants, nuclear power plants and bio-mass power plants respectively. These indicators of power plant economics are useful for tracing [[energy market]]s. For operating or investment decisions published "spread" data are not applicable. Local market conditions, actual plant efficiencies and other plant costs have to be considered. The higher the dark spread the better, for the generator; an [[Independent Power Producer|IPP]] with a dark spread of €15/[[MWh]] will be more profitable than a competitor with a dark spread of only €10/MWh.

Further definition of '''[[spark spread#Clean spread|clean spread]]''' indicators include the price of [[carbon dioxide]] emission allowances (see: [[Emission trading]]).

==Definition of spark spread==

The spark spread ''SS'' is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;  SS = p_E - \frac{p_G}{\eta_{el}} = p_E - HR \cdot p_G &lt;/math&gt;

: with 
: p&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; as price of [[electricity]] in [[monetary unit|MU]]/MWh 
: p&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; as price of [[natural gas]] in MU/MWh or MU/[[Btu]] 
: η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; as electrical [[efficiency]] resp.
: HR as [[heat rate (efficiency)|heat rate]] in Btu/MWh

A precise definition of a spark spread has to be given by the source publishing such indicators. Definitions should specify energy (electricity and fuel) prices considered (delivery point &amp; conditions) and the plant efficiency used for the calculation. Also, any plant operating costs that may be included should be stated. Typically, an efficiency of 50 [[%]] is considered for gas-fired plants, and 36[[%]] for coal-fired plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}, "The  Clean spark spread, expressed in €/MWh, represents the difference between the price of electricity and the price of natural gas used to generate that electricity"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[UK]], a non-rounded efficiency of 49.13% is used for calculating the gas conversion. In reality, each gas-fired plant has a different fuel efficiency, but 49.13% is used as a standard in the UK market because it provides an easy conversion between gas and power volumes. The spark spread value is therefore the power price minus the gas cost divided by 0.4913, i.e. Spark Spread = Power Price – (Gas cost/0.4913). As of August 2006, UK dark spreads were in the range of 10–30 £/MWh, while UK spark spreads were in the range of 4–9 £/MWh.

==Clean spread==

In countries that are covered by the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, generators have to consider also the cost of [[carbon dioxide]] emission allowances that will be under a [[cap and trade]] regime. [[Emission trading]] has started in the [[European Union|EU]] in January 2005.

The Clean Spark Spread is calculated using a gas emissions intensity factor of 0.411 tCO2/MWh. Therefore, the clean spark spread is
calculated by subtracting the carbon price per tonne (multiplied by 0.411) from the ‘dirty’ spark spread, i.e. Clean Spark Spread = Spark Spread
– (Carbon Price*0.411).

'''Clean spark spread''' or "[[spark green spread]]" represents the net revenue a generator makes from selling power, having bought gas and the required number of carbon allowances.  This spread is calculated by adjusting the cost of natural gas in MMBtu for the efficiency of the generation and subsequently applying the market cost of procuring or opportunity cost of setting aside an emissions allowance such as a European Union Allowance (EUA) in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).

Let S: spark spread, E: electricity price, G: gas cost, Ng: number of [[carbon credits]] necessary to cover gas operation, Pcc: price of a carbon credit.

Then, Clean spark spread = E - G - Ng*Pcc = S - Ng*Pcc

'''Clean dark spread''' or "[[dark green spread]]" refers to an analogous indicator for coal-fired generation of electricity.  The spark green spread and the dark green spread are especially important in areas where coal-fired electricity generation is prevalent as the convergence of the spreads will lead to an important decision point.

Let D: dark spread, E: electricity price, C: coal cost, Nc: number of carbon credits necessary to cover coal operation (2–2.5x that of gas), Pcc: price of a carbon credit.

Then, Clean dark spread = E - C - Nc*Pcc = D - Nc*Pcc

'''Climate spread''': The difference between the dark green spread and the spark green spread is known as the "[[Climate Spread]]".

Climate spread = Clean dark spread - Clean spark spread = (D - Nc*Pcc) - (S - Ng*Pcc) = (D - S)  - (Nc - Ng)*Pcc.

Note: (D - S) and (Nc - Ng) are positive numbers.

In a carbon constrained economy a power producer in a geographic area where coal is currently the preferred method by which electricity is generated may eventually encounter a negative [[climate spread]] if carbon credit prices rise.  This would mean that when taking into consideration the cost to produce plus the cost of compliance with a cap and trade (coal is on average 2.5 times as polluting as natural gas for the same MWh of electricity), natural gas would be a better decision.  This would begin to cause more internal abatement via power generation fuel switching and less reliance on flexible mechanisms.  This is important due to concerns regarding [[supplementarity]].

Climate spread is also interesting in that it is the fundamental driver for the price of carbon credits. Since the ETS cap-and-trade system covers the major polluting industries, power generation by coal- and gas-fired power plants, by far the largest power sources, create the most carbon credit demand within the ETS. To cover emissions on an ever-tightening ration of free EUA allowances, a coal-fired powered power plant will either have to abate internally or buy credits. If the price of marginal internal abatement is lower than the price of carbon credits, the firm will choose internal abatement. However marginal abatement becomes more and more expensive, at some point forcing the plant to buy credits – thus the carbon credit price is equal to the marginal cost of abatement to the extent that European power plants have chosen to abate.

Clean Dark Spreads are a reflection of the cost of generating power from coal after taking into account fuel (coal) and carbon allowance costs. A positive spread effectively means that it is profitable to generate electricity on a Baseload basis for the period in question, while a negative spread means that generation would be a loss-making activity. The Clean Spark Spreads do not take into account additional generating charges (beyond fuel and carbon), such as operational costs.

Both the UK and German Dark Spread tables use a fuel efficiency factor of 35% for the coal conversion, and an energy conversion factor of 7.1 for converting tonnes/coal into MWh/electricity. In reality, each type of coal has a different energy value and each coal-fired plant has a different fuel efficiency, but 35% is accepted as a broad standard. At the time of writing (March 2007) there is no liquid Dark Spread traded market in either the UK or Germany. The Dark Spread value is the power price minus the coal price divided by 0.35, i.e. Dark Spread = Power price – (Coal price/0.35).

The Clean Dark Spread is calculated using a coal emissions intensity factor of 0.971 tCO2/MWh. Therefore, the Clean Dark Spread is calculated by subtracting the carbon price (multiplied by 0.971) from the ‘dirty’ spark spread, i.e. Clean Dark Spread = Dark Spread – (Carbon Price*0.971).

===Spark spread as cost of replacement power for intermittent renewables===
Spark spread can be used to assess the loss of revenue if a power station is switched from a  normal running scenario to one where it is held in reserve to provide power when a large population of wind, or other renewable generators, is unable to generate.

In theory, the power station operator would be indifferent to such non-running as long as he was paid the spread it would have earned during the normally expected number of hour run. In fact, if paid the expected spark spread for the hours it had expected to run in normal operating mode, the operator would be better off, because it would not incur the variable operating and maintenance costs (O&amp;M costs), which are proportional to the electrical energy produced.

An assessment of the lost revenues is needed if some power plants, such as wind turbines, have absolute priority (must-run plants). A dispatching authority will in this case order the other plants to decrease power. In some countries plant operators are entitled to receive compensation for such interventions. In a competitive [[electricity market]] the situation can be handled by a balancing mechanism, in which any imbalance from the schedule (typically a day-ahead schedule) is penalized, either using the price from a balancing market or a calculated price.
   
Thus, since UK spark spreads were in the range of 4–9 £/MWh – on average £6.5/MWh, or 0.65 p/kWh, we can assess the likely cost of relegating existing power stations to a standby role for a large penetration of renewables as being around 0.65 p/kWh.

The original ionisation event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision to sustain the avalanche.]]
The '''Townsend discharge''' or '''Townsend avalanche''' is a gas [[ionisation]] process where free [[electron]]s are accelerated by an [[electric field]], collide with gas molecules, and consequently free additional electrons.  Those electrons are in turn accelerated and free additional electrons.  The result is an [[avalanche breakdown|avalanche multiplication]] that permits electrical conduction through the gas. The discharge requires a source of free electrons and a significant [[electric field]]; without both, the phenomenon does not occur.

The Townsend discharge is named after [[John Sealy Townsend]], who discovered the fundamental ionisation mechanism by his work between 1897 and 1901.

==General description of the phenomenon==
The avalanche occurs in a gaseous medium that can be [[ionization|ionised]] (such as [[air]]).  The [[electric field]] and the [[mean free path]] of the electron must allow free electrons to acquire an energy level (velocity) that can cause impact ionisation.  If the electric field is too small, then the electrons do not acquire enough energy.  If the mean free path is too short, the electron gives up its acquired energy in a series of non-ionising collisions.  If the mean free path is too long, then the electron reaches the anode before colliding with another molecule.

The avalanche mechanism is shown in the accompanying diagram.  The electric field is applied across a gaseous medium; initial ions are created with ionising radiation (for example, cosmic rays). An original ionisation event produces an ion pair; the positive [[ion]] accelerates towards the [[cathode]] while the free electron accelerates towards the [[anode]]. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron can gain sufficient velocity (energy) to liberate another electron when it next collides with a molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause further impact ionisations, and so on. This process is effectively a [[Chain reaction#Electron avalanche in gases|chain reaction]] that generates free electrons.&lt;ref name="knoll"/&gt; The total number of electrons reaching the [[anode]] is equal to the number of collisions, plus the single initiating free electron. Initially, the number of collisions grows exponentially.  The limit to the multiplication in an electron avalanche is known as the [[Raether limit]].

The Townsend avalanche can have a large range of current densities. In common [[gas-filled tube]]s, such as those used as [[gaseous ionization detector|gaseous ionisation detectors]], magnitudes of currents flowing during this process can range from about 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;18&lt;/sup&gt; amperes to about 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt; amperes.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Quantitative description of the phenomenon==
Townsend's early experimental apparatus consisted of planar parallel plates forming two sides of a chamber filled with a [[gas]]. A [[direct current]] high-[[voltage source]] was connected between the plates; the lower voltage plate being the [[cathode]] while the other was the [[anode]]. He forced the cathode to emit electrons using the [[photoelectric effect]] by irradiating it with [[X-ray]]s, and he found that the current {{mvar|I}} flowing through the chamber depended on the [[electric field]] between the plates. However, this current showed an exponential increase as the plate gaps became small{{Disputed inline|Gap size contradiction|date=June 2017}}, leading to the conclusion that the gas [[ions]] were multiplying as they moved between the plates due to the high electric field.

Townsend observed currents varying exponentially over ten or more orders of magnitude with a constant applied voltage when the distance between the plates was varied. He also discovered that gas pressure influenced conduction: he was able to generate ions in gases at low pressure with a much lower voltage than that required to generate a spark. This observation overturned conventional thinking about the amount of current that an irradiated gas could conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''John Sealy Edward Townsend. 1868-1957'' by A. von Engel. Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society. 1957 3, 256-272&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental data obtained from his experiments are described by the following formula

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{I}{I_0}=e^{\alpha_n d}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where
*{{mvar|I}} is the current flowing in the device,
*{{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[photoelectric]] current generated at the [[cathode]] surface,
*{{math|e}} is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]]
*{{math|&amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the ''first Townsend ionisation coefficient'', expressing the number of [[ion]] pairs generated per unit length (e.g. meter) by a negative ion ([[anion]]) moving from [[cathode]] to [[anode]],
*{{mvar|d}} is the [[distance]] between the plates of the device.
The almost constant voltage{{which|date=March 2016}} between the plates is equal to the [[breakdown voltage]] needed to create a self-sustaining avalanche: it ''decreases'' when the current reaches the [[glow discharge]] regime.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} Subsequent experiments revealed that the current {{mvar|I}} rises faster than predicted by the above formula as the distance {{mvar|d}} increases: two different effects were considered in order to better model the discharge: positive ions and cathode emission.

===Gas ionisation caused by motion of positive ions===
Townsend put forward the hypothesis that positive ions also produce ion pairs, introducing a coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_p&lt;/math&gt; expressing the number of [[ion]] pairs generated per unit length by a positive ion ([[cation]]) moving from [[anode]] to [[cathode]]. The following formula was found

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{I}{I_0}=\frac{(\alpha_n-\alpha_p)e^{(\alpha_n-\alpha_p)d}}{\alpha_n-\alpha_p e^{(\alpha_n-\alpha_p)d}}
\qquad\Longrightarrow\qquad \frac{I}{I_0}\cong\frac{e^{\alpha_n d}}{1 - ({\alpha_p/\alpha_n}) e^{\alpha_n d}}&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;\alpha_p \ll \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt;, in very good agreement with experiments.

The ''first Townsend coefficient'' ( α ), also known as ''first Townsend avalanche coefficient'' is a term used where secondary ionisation occurs because the primary ionisation electrons gain sufficient energy from the accelerating electric field, or from the original ionising particle. The coefficient gives the number of secondary electrons produced by primary electron per unit path length.

===Cathode emission caused by impact of ions===
Townsend, Holst and Oosterhuis also put forward an alternative hypothesis, considering the [[secondary emission|augmented emission]] of electrons by the [[cathode]] caused by impact of positive [[ions]]. This introduced ''Townsend's second ionisation coefficient'' &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt;; the average number of electrons released from a surface by an incident positive ion, according to the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{I}{I_0}=\frac{e^{\alpha_n d}}{1 - {\epsilon_i}\left(e^{\alpha_n d}-1\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

These two formulas may be thought as describing limiting cases of the effective behavior of the process: either can be used to describe the same experimental results. Other formulas describing various intermediate behaviors are found in the literature, particularly in reference 1 and citations therein.

A Townsend discharge can be sustained only over a limited range of gas pressure and electric field intensity. The accompanying plot shows the variation of voltage drop and the different operating regions for a gas-filled tube with a constant pressure, but a varying current between its electrodes. The Townsend avalanche phenomena occurs on the sloping plateau B-D. Beyond D the ionisation is sustained.

At higher pressures, discharges occur more rapidly than the calculated time for ions to traverse the gap between electrodes, and the streamer theory of spark discharge of Raether, Meek and Loeb is applicable. In highly non-uniform electric fields, the [[corona discharge]] process is applicable. See [[Electron avalanche]] for further description of these mechanisms.

Discharges in vacuum require vaporization and ionisation of electrode atoms. An arc can be initiated without a preliminary Townsend discharge; for example when electrodes touch and are then separated.

==Applications==

===Gas-discharge tubes===
The starting of Townsend discharge sets the upper limit to the [[voltage|blocking voltage]] a [[glow discharge]] [[gas-filled tube]] can withstand. This limit is the Townsend discharge [[breakdown voltage]], also called '''ignition voltage''' of the tube.

[[Image:Tube relaxation oscillator.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Neon lamp/cold-cathode gas diode [[relaxation oscillator]]]]

The occurrence of Townsend discharge, leading to [[glow discharge]] breakdown shapes the [[current-voltage characteristic]] of a [[gas discharge tube]] such as a [[neon lamp]] in a way such that it has a [[negative differential resistance]] region of the S-type. The negative resistance can be used to generate electrical [[oscillation]]s and [[waveform]]s, as in the [[relaxation oscillator]] whose schematic is shown in the picture on the right. The sawtooth shaped oscillation generated has frequency

:&lt;math&gt;f\cong\frac{1}{R_1C_1\ln\frac{V_1-V_\text{GLOW}}{V_1-V_\text{TWN}}},&lt;/math&gt;

:where
:*&lt;math&gt;V_\text{GLOW}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[glow discharge]] [[breakdown voltage]],
:*&lt;math&gt;V_\text{TWN}&lt;/math&gt; is the Townsend discharge [[breakdown voltage]],
:*&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the [[capacitance]], the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] and the supply [[voltage]] of the circuit.
:Since [[temperature]] and [[time]] stability of the characteristics of gas diodes and [[neon lamp]]s is low, and also the [[statistical dispersion]] of breakdown voltages is high, the above formula can only give a qualitative indication of what the real frequency of oscillation is.

===Gas phototubes===
[[Avalanche breakdown|Avalanche multiplication]] during Townsend discharge is naturally used in [[phototube|gas phototubes]], to amplify the [[photoelectric]] charge generated by incident radiation (visible light or not) on the [[cathode]]: achievable current is typically 10~20 times greater respect to that generated by [[phototube|vacuum phototube]]s.

===Ionising radiation detectors===
[[File:Detector regions.gif|thumb|300px|Plot of variation of ionisation current against applied voltage for a co-axial wire cylinder gaseous radiation detector.]]
Townsend avalanche discharges are fundamental to the operation of [[gaseous ionization detector|gaseous ionisation detectors]] such as the [[Geiger–Müller tube]] and the [[proportional counter]] in either detecting [[ionising radiation]] or measuring its energy. The incident radiation will ionise [[atom]]s or [[molecules]] in the gaseous medium to produce ion pairs, but different use is made by each detector type of the resultant avalanche effects.

In the case of a GM tube the high electric field strength is sufficient to cause complete ionisation of the fill gas surrounding the anode from the initial creation of just one ion pair. The GM tube output carries information that the event has occurred, but no information about the energy of the incident radiation.&lt;ref name="knoll"/&gt;

In the case of proportional counters, multiple creation of ion pairs occurs in the "ion drift" region near the cathode. The electric field and chamber geometries are selected so that an "avalanche region" is created in the immediate proximity of the anode. A negative ion drifting towards the anode enters this region and creates a localised avalanche that is independent of those from other ion pairs, but which can still provide a multiplication effect. In this way spectroscopic information on the energy of the incident radiation is available by the magnitude of the output pulse from each initiating event.&lt;ref name="knoll"&gt;Glenn F Knoll. ''Radiation Detection and Measurement'', third edition 2000. John Wiley and sons, {{ISBN|0-471-07338-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accompanying plot shows the variation of ionisation current for a co-axial cylinder system. In the ion chamber region, there are no avalanches and the applied voltage only serves to move the ions towards the electrodes to prevent re-combination.
In the proportional region, localised avalanches occur in the gas space immediately round the anode which are numerically proportional to the number of original ionising events. Increasing the voltage further increases the number of avalanches until the Geiger region is reached where the full volume of the fill gas around the anodes ionised, and all proportional energy information is lost.&lt;ref name="knoll"/&gt; Beyond the Geiger region the gas is in continuous discharge owing to the high electric field strength.

'''Volcanic ash''' consists of fragments of pulverized rock, [[mineral]]s and [[volcanic glass]], created during [[volcano|volcanic]] [[eruptions]] and measuring less than 2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.079&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter.&lt;ref name="Rose &amp; Durant"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=W.I.|author2=Durant, A.J. |title=Fine ash content of explosive eruptions|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|year=2009|volume=186|issue=1–2|pages=32–39|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2009.01.010|bibcode = 2009JVGR..186...32R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term volcanic ash is also often loosely used to refer to all [[explosive eruption]] products (correctly referred to as [[tephra]]), including particles larger than 2 mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in [[magma]] expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during [[phreatomagmatic eruption]]s, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.

Due to its wide dispersal, ash can have a number of impacts on society, including human and animal health, disruption to aviation, disruption to critical infrastructure (e.g., electric power supply systems, telecommunications, water and waste-water networks, transportation), primary industries (e.g., agriculture), buildings and structures.

==Formation==
[[Image:Vulkaanilise tuha kiht.JPG|thumb|454 million-year-old volcanic ash between layers of [[limestone]] in the catacombs of [[Peter the Great's Naval Fortress]] in [[Estonia]] near [[Laagri]]. This is a remnant of one of the oldest [[list of largest volcanic eruptions|large eruptions]] preserved. The diameter of the black camera lens cover is {{convert|58|mm|in|abbr=on}}.]]
Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions, phreatomagmatic eruptions and during transport in pyroclastic density currents.

Explosive eruptions occur when magma [[decompression (physics)|decompresses]] as it rises, allowing dissolved [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatiles]] (dominantly [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]]) to exsolve into gas bubbles.&lt;ref name="Wilson book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=T.M.|author2=Stewart, C. |editor-first=Bobrowsky|editor-last=P|title=Encyclopaedia of Natural Hazards|publisher=Springer|year=2012|pages=1000|chapter=Volcanic Ash}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more bubbles nucleate a foam is produced, which decreases the [[density]] of the magma, accelerating it up the conduit. Fragmentation occurs when bubbles occupy ~70-80 vol% of the erupting mixture.&lt;ref name="Cashman encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cashman, K.V.|authorlink=Katharine Cashman|author2=Sturtevant, B. |author3=Papale, P. |author4=Navon, O.  |editor1-last=Sigurdsson |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=Houghton |editor2-first=B.F. |editor3-last=McNutt |editor3-first=S.R. |editor4-last=Rymer |editor4-first=H. |editor5-last=Stix |editor5-first=J. |title=Encyclopedia of Volcanoes |publisher=Elsevier Inc.|year=2000|location=San Diego, USA|pages=1417|chapter=Magmatic fragmentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; When fragmentation occurs, violently expanding bubbles tear the magma apart into fragments which are ejected into the [[atmosphere]] where they solidify into ash particles. Fragmentation is a very efficient process of ash formation and is capable of generating very fine ash even without the addition of water.&lt;ref name="Kueppers et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kueppers|first=U.|author2=Putz, C. |author3=Spieler, O. |author4=Dingwell, D.B. |title=Abrasion in pyroclastic density currents: insights from tumbling experiments|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.pce.2011.09.002|bibcode = 2012PCE....45...33K |volume=45–46 |journal=Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C |pages=33–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcanic ash is also produced during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes into contact with bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms ([[Leidenfrost effect]]).&lt;ref name="Zimanowski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimanowski|first=B.|title=Physics of phreatomagmatism. Part 1: explosion physics|journal=Terra Nostra|year=2000|volume=6|pages=515–523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer which leads to the rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent. Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism,&lt;ref name="Zimanowski"/&gt; leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.

[[pyroclastic flow|Pyroclastic density currents]] can also produce ash particles. These are typically produced by [[lava dome]] collapse or collapse of the [[eruption column]].&lt;ref name="Parfitt &amp; Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=E.A.|author2=Wilson, L. |title=Fundamentals of Physical Volcanology|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Massachusetts, USA|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within pyroclastic density currents particle [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] occurs as particles interact with each other resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=G.P.L.|title=Generation and dispersal of fine ash by volcanic eruptions|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|year=1981|volume=11|pages=81–92|bibcode = 1981JVGR...11...81W |doi = 10.1016/0377-0273(81)90077-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which is removed from pyroclastic density currents in co-ignimbrite ash plumes.

Physical and chemical characteristics of volcanic ash are primarily controlled by the style of volcanic eruption.&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web|last=USGS|title=Volcanic Ash, What it can do and how to minimise damage|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/ash/|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanoes display a range of eruption styles which are controlled by magma chemistry, crystal content, temperature and dissolved gases of the erupting magma and can be classified using the [[Volcanic explosivity index|volcanic explosivity index (VEI)]]. Effusive eruptions (VEI 1) of [[basalt]]ic composition produce &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of ejecta, whereas extremely explosive eruptions (VEI 5+) of [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] and [[dacite|dacitic]] composition can inject large quantities (&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of ejecta into the atmosphere. Another parameter controlling the amount of ash produced is the duration of the eruption: the longer the eruption is sustained, the more ash will be produced. For example, the second phase of the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull]] was classified as VEI 4 despite a modest 8&amp;nbsp;km high eruption column, but the eruption continued for a month, which allowed a large volume of ash to be ejected into the atmosphere.

==Properties==

===Chemical===
The types of minerals present in volcanic ash are dependent on the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in [[silicate]] magma are [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]], the various types of magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained in terms of their silica content. Low energy eruptions of [[basalt]] produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in [[iron]] (Fe) and [[magnesium]] (Mg). The most explosive [[rhyolite]] eruptions produce a [[felsic]] ash that is high in silica (&gt;69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., [[andesite]] or [[dacite]]) have a silica content between 55-69%.

The principal [[gas]]es released during volcanic activity are [[water]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]].&lt;ref name="Witham et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witham|first=C.S.|author2=Oppenheimer, C. |author3=Horwell, C.J. |title=Volcanic ash-leachates: a review and recommendations for sampling methods|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|year=2005|volume=141|pages=299–326|doi=10.1007/s00445-010-0396-1|bibcode = 2011BVol...73..223W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[sulfur]] and [[halogen]] gases and metals are removed from the atmosphere by processes of chemical reaction, dry and wet deposition, and by [[adsorption]] onto the surface of volcanic ash.

===Physical===

====Components====
[[Image:Ashsem small.jpg|alt=Close up of tiny particle of volcanic ash, showing its many tiny tubular holes.|thumb|Particle of volcanic ash from [[Mount St. Helens]].]]
Volcanic ash particles erupted during magmatic eruptions are made up of various fractions of [[volcanic glass|vitric]] (glassy, non-crystalline), crystalline or [[lithic fragment (geology)|lithic]] (non-magmatic) particles. Ash produced during low [[viscosity]] magmatic eruptions (e.g., [[hawaiian eruption|Hawaiian]] and [[Strombolian]] basaltic eruptions) produce a range of different pyroclasts dependent on the eruptive process. For example, ash collected from Hawaiian lava fountains consists of [[sideromelane]] (light brown basaltic glass) pyroclasts which contain rare [[microlite]]s (small quench crystals) and [[phenocryst]]s. Slightly more viscous eruptions of basalt (e.g., Strombolian) form a variety of pyroclasts from irregular sideromelane droplets to blocky [[tachylite]] (black to dark brown microcrystalline pyroclasts). In contrast, most high-silica ash (e.g. rhyolite) consists of pulverised products of [[pumice]] (vitric shards), individual phenocrysts (crystal fraction) and some lithic fragments ([[xenolith]]s).&lt;ref name="Heiken &amp; Wohletz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heiken|first=G.|author2=Wohletz, K.H. |title=Volcanic ash|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ash generated during phreatic eruptions primarily consists of hydrothermally altered lithic and mineral fragments, commonly in a clay matrix. Particle surfaces are often coated with [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregate]]s of [[zeolite]] crystals or clay and only relict textures remain to identify pyroclast types.&lt;ref name="Heiken &amp; Wohletz"/&gt;

====Morphology====
[[Image:MtStHelensAsh1980eruption.jpg|thumb|Light microscope image of ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington.]]
The morphology (shape) of volcanic ash is controlled by a plethora of different eruption and kinematic processes.&lt;ref name="Heiken &amp; Wohletz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heiken"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heiken|first=G.|title=Morphology and petrography of volcanic ashes|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|year=1972|volume=83|pages=1961–1988|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1972)83[1961:mapova]2.0.co;2|bibcode = 1972GSAB...83.1961H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eruptions of low-viscosity magmas (e.g., basalt) typically form droplet shaped particles. This droplet shape is, in part, controlled by [[surface tension]], acceleration of the droplets after they leave the vent, and air friction. Shapes range from perfect spheres to a variety of twisted, elongate droplets with smooth, fluidal surfaces.&lt;ref name="Heiken"/&gt;

The morphology of ash from eruptions of high-viscosity magmas (e.g., rhyolite, dacite, and some andesites) is mostly dependent on the shape of [[vesicular texture|vesicles]] in the rising magma before disintegration. Vesicles are formed by the expansion of magmatic gas before the magma has solidified. Ash particles can have varying degrees of vesicularity and vesicular particles can have extremely high surface area to volume ratios.&lt;ref name="Heiken &amp; Wohletz"/&gt; Concavities, troughs, and tubes observed on grain surfaces are the result of broken vesicle walls.&lt;ref name="Heiken"/&gt; Vitric ash particles from high-viscosity magma eruptions are typically angular, vesicular pumiceous fragments or thin vesicle-wall fragments while lithic fragments in volcanic ash are typically equant, or angular to subrounded. Lithic morphology in ash is generally controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall rock broken up by [[spall]]ing or explosive expansion of gases in the magma as it reaches the surface.

The morphology of ash particles from phreatomagmatic eruptions is controlled by stresses within the chilled magma which result in fragmentation of the glass to form small blocky or pyramidal glass ash particles.&lt;ref name="Heiken &amp; Wohletz"/&gt; Vesicle shape and density play only a minor role in the determination of grain shape in phreatomagmatic eruptions. In this sort of eruption, the rising magma is quickly cooled on contact with ground or surface water. Stresses within the "quenched" magma cause fragmentation into five dominant pyroclast shape-types: (1) blocky and equant; (2) vesicular and irregular with smooth surfaces; (3) moss-like and convoluted; (4) spherical or drop-like; and (5) plate-like.

====Density====
The density of individual particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for pumice, 2350–2450&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for glass shards, 2700–3300&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for crystals, and 2600–3200&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for lithic particles.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al 11"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=T.M.|author2=Stewart, C. |author3=Sword-Daniels, V. |author4=Leonard, G. |author5=Johnston, D.M. |author6=Cole, J.W. |author7=Wardman, J. |author8=Wilson, G. |author9=Barnard, S.  |title=Volcanic ash impacts on critical infrastructure|journal=Physics and Chemistry of the Earth|year=2011|doi=10.1016/l.pce.2011.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shipley|first=S.|author2=Sarna-Wojcicki, A.M. |title=Distribution, thickness, and mass of late pleistocene and holocene tephra from major volcanoes in the northwestern United States: a preliminary assessment of hazards from volcanic ejecta to nuclear reactors in the Pacific Northwest|journal=US Geological Survey Miscellaneous Field Studies Map MF-1435|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high density and hardness (~5 on the [[mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs Hardness Scale]]) together with a high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.

====Grain size====
[[Image:Volcanic ash grain size distributions.jpg|thumb|Volcanic ash grain size distributions.]]
Volcanic ash consists of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters &lt;2&amp;nbsp;mm (particles &gt;2&amp;nbsp;mm are classified as lapilli),&lt;ref name="Rose &amp; Durant"/&gt; and can be as fine as 1 μm.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few attempts have been made to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas.&lt;ref name="Rose &amp; Durant"/&gt; There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.&lt;ref name="Rose &amp; Durant"/&gt;

==Dispersal==
[[Image:MountRedoubtEruption.jpg|thumb|Ash plume rising from Mount Redoubt after an eruption on April 21, 1990.]]
[[Image:MtCleveland ISS013-E-24184.jpg|alt=A thick plume of dark ash arises from the volcano's cone.|thumb|Ash plume from [[Mount Cleveland (Alaska)|Mt Cleveland]], a [[stratovolcano]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]].]]
Ash particles are incorporated into eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Parfitt &amp; Wilson"/&gt; At a point where the bulk density of the column is the same as the surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carey|first=S.|author2=Sparks, R.S.J. |title=Quantitative models of the fallout and dispersal of tephra from volcanic eruption columns|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|year=1986|volume=48|pages=109–125|bibcode = 1986BVol...48..109C |doi = 10.1007/BF01046546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ash fallout occurs immediately after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of [[lapilli#Accretionary Lapilli|accretionary lapilli]], which is the result of particle agglomeration within the column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=R.J.|author2=Bonadonna, C. |author3=Durant, A.J. |title=A review of volcanic ash aggregation|journal=Chemistry and Physics of the Earth|year=2011|doi=10.1016/j.pce.2011.11.001|pages=65–78|volume=45–46|bibcode=2012PCE....45...65B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyle|first=D.|title=The thickness, volume and grainsize of tephra fall deposits|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|year=1989|volume=51|pages=1–15|doi=10.1007/BF01086757|bibcode = 1989BVol...51....1P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.

Volcanic ash plumes can form above pyroclastic density currents, these are called co-ignimbrite plumes. As pyroclastic density currents travel away from the volcano, smaller particles are removed from the flow by [[elutriation]] and form a less dense zone overlying the main flow. This zone then entrains the surrounding air and a buoyant co-ignimbrite plume is formed. These plumes tend to have higher concentrations of fine ash particles compared to magmatic eruption plumes due to the abrasion within the pyroclastic density current.&lt;ref name="Rose &amp; Durant"/&gt;

==Impacts==

===Introduction===
Population growth has caused the progressive encroachment of urban development into higher risk areas, closer to volcanic centres, increasing the human exposure to volcanic ash fall events.

[[Infrastructure]] is critical to supporting modern societies, particularly in urban areas, where high population densities create high demand for services. These infrastructure networks and systems support urban living, and provide lifeline services upon which we depend for our [[health]], [[education]], [[transport]] and social networking. Infrastructure networks and services support a variety of facilities across a broad range of sectors.&lt;ref name="Platt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Platt|first=R.H.|title=Lifelines; An emergency Management Priority for the United States in the 1990s|journal=Disasters|year=1991|volume=15|pages=172–176|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7717.1991.tb00446.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costs have been incurred from business disruption, replacement of damaged parts and insured losses. Ash fall impacts on critical infrastructure can also cause multiple knock-on effects, which may disrupt many different sectors and services.

Volcanic ash fall is physically, socially, and economically disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas many hundreds of kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses in a wide variety of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any [[emergency management#Preparedness|preparedness]], [[emergency management|management]] and [[emergency management#Mitigation|prevention]] (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are [[vulnerability|vulnerable]] to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.

===Infrastructure sectors===

====Electricity====
[[Image:Electrical insulator flashover from volcanic ash.jpg|thumb|Electrical insulator flashover caused by volcanic ash contamination.]]
Volcanic ash can cause disruption to electric power supply systems at all levels of power generation, transformation, transmission and distribution. There are four main impacts arising from ash-contamination of apparatus used in the power delivery process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=T.M.|author2=Daly, M. |author3=Johnston, D.M. |title=Review of Impacts of Volcanic Ash on Electricity Distribution Systems, Broadcasting and Communication Networks|journal=Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group Project AELG-19. Auckland Regional Council Technical Publication 051|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Wet deposits of ash on high voltage [[insulator (electricity)|insulators]] can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current flow across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current is achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around or over the surface of an insulating material).

If the resulting [[short circuit|short-circuit]] current is high enough to trip the [[circuit breaker]] then disruption of service will occur. Ash-induced flashover across transformer insulation (bushings) can burn, etch or crack the insulation irreparably and will likely result in the disruption of power supply.

* Volcanic ash can erode, pit and scour metallic apparatus, particularly moving parts such as water and wind turbines and cooling fans on transformers or thermal power plants.
* The high bulk density of some ash deposits can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or the lines and structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) and there has been ≥10&amp;nbsp;mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., &lt;0.5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) adheres to lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.
* Controlled outages of vulnerable connection points (e.g., [[electrical substation|substations]]) or circuits until ash fall has subsided or for de-energised cleaning of equipment.

====Drinking water supplies====
Following an eruption, it is very common for the public to hold fears about chemical contamination of water supplies. However, in general, the physical impacts of an ashfall will tend to overwhelm problems caused by the release of chemical contaminants from fresh volcanic ash. Impacts vary according to the type of treatment system.

=====Large water treatment plants=====
[[Image:Water turbine eroded by volcanic ash.jpg|thumb|Water turbine from the [[Agoyan]] Hydroelectric plant eroded by volcanic ash laden water.]]
Groundwater-fed systems are resilient to impacts from ashfall, although airborne ash can interfere with the operation of well-head pumps. Electricity outages caused by ashfall can also disrupt electrically powered pumps if there is no backup generation.

For surface water sources such as lakes and reservoirs, the volume available for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large. The most abundant components of ash leachates (Ca, Na, Mg, K, Cl, F and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most surface waters and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall, and are also of low concern in drinking water, with the possible exception of [[fluorine]]. The elements [[iron]], [[manganese]] and [[aluminium]] are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall. These elements may impart a metallic taste to water, and may produce red, brown or black staining of whiteware, but are not considered a health risk. Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and [[lead]] (Pb) which occur at very low levels in ash leachates.

A further point to note is that drinking-water treatment commonly involves the addition of treatment chemicals such as [[aluminium sulfate]] or [[ferric chloride]] as [[Flocculation|flocculants]], lime for pH adjustment, chlorine for disinfection and fluoride compounds for dental health.

The physical impacts of ashfall can affect the operation of water treatment plants. Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to [[turbidity]] (the level of suspended solids, measured in [[turbidity#Measurement|nephelometric turbidity units]]) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls will be more likely to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall, but there will not be service interruptions.

The final step of drinking water treatment is disinfection to ensure that final drinking water is free from infectious microorganisms. As suspended particles (turbidity) can provide a growth substrate for microorganisms and can protect them from disinfection treatment, it is extremely important that the water treatment process achieves a good level of removal of suspended particles.

=====Small treatment systems=====
Many small communities obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It should be noted that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as [[Giardia]] and [[Cryptosporidium]], which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.

Volcanic ashfall is likely to have major effects on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause abrasion damage to pumps and block pipes, settling ponds and open filters. High levels of turbidity are very likely to interfere with disinfection treatment and doses may have to be adjusted to compensate. It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.

=====Rainwater-fed supplies=====
Many households, and some small communities, rely on rainwater for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, as they have a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further problem is that the surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with [[plumbosolvency]], whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.

=====Water demand=====
During ashfall events large demands are commonly placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key services such as firefighting and can lead to a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).

====Wastewater treatment====
Wastewater networks may sustain damage similar to water supply networks. It is very difficult to exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow/infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections (e.g., from roof downpipes), cross connections, around manhole covers or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes.

Ash-laden sewage entering a treatment plant is likely to cause failure of mechanical prescreening equipment such as step screens or rotating screens. Ash that penetrates further into the system will settle and reduce the capacity of biological reactors as well as increasing the volume of sludge and changing its composition.

====Aircraft====
{{Main|Volcanic ash and aviation safety}}
The principal damage sustained by aircraft flying into a volcanic ash cloud is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., [[pitot tube]]s) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.

The composition of most ash is such that its melting temperature is within the [[operating temperature]] (&gt;1000&amp;nbsp;°C) of modern large [[jet engine]]s.&lt;ref name="Sammonds et al"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sammonds|first=P.|author2=McGuire, B. |author3=Edwards, S. |year=2010|title=Volcanic hazard from Iceland: analysis and implications of the Eyjafjallajökull eruption. UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction Report|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/rdr/publications/icelandreport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, the length of time the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in [[compressor stall]] and complete loss of engine thrust.&lt;ref name="Miller encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller|first=T.P.|author2=Casadevall, T.J. |editor1-first=Sigurdsson|editor1-last=H. |editor2-first=Houghton|editor2-last=B.F.|editor3-first=McNutt|editor3-last=S.R.|editor4-first=Rymer|editor4-last=H.|editor5-first=Stix|editor5-last=J.|title=Encyclopedia of Volcanoes |publisher=Elsevier Inc.|year=2000|location=San Diego, USA|pages=1417|chapter=Volcanic ash hazards to aviation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn.&lt;ref name="Miller encyclopedia"/&gt; Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields, although this damage may not surface for many years.

=====Occurrence=====
There are many instances of damage to jet aircraft as a result of an ash encounter. On 24 June 1982 a [[British Airways]] [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-236B]] ([[British Airways Flight 9|Flight 9]]) flew through the ash cloud from the eruption of [[Galunggung|Mount Galunggung]], [[Indonesia]] resulting in the failure of all four engines. The plane descended 24,000 feet (7,300 m) in 16 minutes before the engines restarted, allowing the aircraft to make an emergency landing. On 15 December 1989 a [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines|KLM]] [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-400]] ([[KLM Flight 867|Flight 867]]) also lost power to all four engines after flying into an ash cloud from [[Mount Redoubt (Alaska)|Mount Redoubt]], [[Alaska]]. After dropping 14,700 feet (4,500 m) in four minutes, the engines were started just 1–2 minutes before impact. Total damage was US$80 million and it took 3 months' work to repair the plane.&lt;ref name="Sammonds et al"/&gt; In the 1990s a further US$100 million of damage was sustained by commercial aircraft (some in the air, others on the ground) as a consequence of the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Sammonds et al"/&gt;

In April 2010 [[airspace]] all over [[Europe]] [[Air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption|was affected, with many flights cancelled]]-which was unprecedented-due to the presence of volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere from the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8621407.stm |title=Icelandic volcanic ash alert grounds UK flights |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=15 April 2010 | date=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April 2010 the [[Finnish Air Force]] halted training flights when damage was found from volcanic dust ingestion by the engines of one of its Boeing [[F-18 Hornet]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/pictures-finnish-f-18-engine-check-reveals-effects-of-volcanic-340727|title = Finnish F-18 engine check reveals effects of volcanic dust|publisher = flightglobal.com|accessdate = 2010-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 2010 UK [[RAF]] [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]] training flights were also temporarily suspended after deposits of volcanic ash were found in a jet's engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/15612624|title = Volcano Ash is Found in RAF Jet's Engines|publisher = news.sky.com|accessdate = 2010-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 there were similar closures of airspace in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, following the eruption of [[Puyehue-Cordón Caulle]], [[Chile]].

=====Detection=====
[[Image:VAAC Coverage.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Coverage of the nine VAAC around the world]]
Volcanic ash clouds are very difficult to detect from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the [[Norwegian Institute for Air Research]], which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi) ahead and fly safely around them.&lt;ref name="NIAR"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nilu.no/Nyhetsarkiv/tabid/74/language/en-GB/NewsId/177/No-more-volcanic-ash-plane-chaos.aspx|title=No more volcanic ash plane chaos?|publisher=Norwegian Institute for Air Research|date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are tuned to detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to &gt; 50&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning.&lt;ref name="NIAR"/&gt; The camera is currently being tested by [[easyJet]] airline company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10234553.stm|title=Easyjet to trial volcanic ash detection system|publisher=BBC|date=4 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ground and satellite based imagery, [[radar]], and [[lidar]] can be used to detect ash clouds. This information is passed between meteorological agencies, volcanic observatories and airline companies through [[VAAC|Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC)]]. There is one VAAC for each of the nine regions of the world. VAACs can issue advisories describing the current and future extent of the ash cloud.

=====Airport systems=====
Volcanic ash not only affects in-flight operations but can affect ground-based airport operations as well. Small accumulations of ash can reduce visibility, create slippery runways and taxiways, infiltrate communication and electrical systems, interrupt ground services, damage buildings and parked aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guffanti|first=M.|author2=Mayberry, G.C. |author3=Casadevall, T.J. |author4=Wunderman, R. |title=Volcanic hazards to airports|journal=Natural Hazards|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s11069-008-9254-2 |volume=51 |pages=287–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ash accumulation of more than a few millimeters requires removal before airports can resume full operations. Ash does not disappear (unlike snowfalls) and must be disposed of in a manner that prevents it from being remobilised by wind and aircraft.

====Land transport====
Ash may disrupt transportation systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash will reduce the visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al 11"/&gt; In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al 11"/&gt; Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al 11"/&gt;

Marine transport can also be impacted by volcanic ash. Ash fall will block air and oil filters and abrade any moving parts if ingested into engines. Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall. Vesiculated ash ([[pumice]] and [[scoria]]) will float on the water surface in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al 11"/&gt;

====Communications====
[[Telecommunications network|Telecommunication]] and [[Broadcast network|broadcast]] networks can be affected by volcanic ash in the following ways: [[path loss|attenuation]] and reduction of signal strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through user demand. Signal attenuation due to volcanic ash is not well documented; however, there have been reports of disrupted communications following the 1969 [[Surtsey]] eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Research by the [[New Zealand]]-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to [[low frequency]] services such as [[communications satellite|satellite communication]].&lt;ref name="Wilson thesis"/&gt; Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNutt|first=S.R.|author2=Williams, E.R. |title=Volcanic lightning: global observations and constraints on source mechanisms|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|year=2010|doi=10.1007/s00445-010-0393-4|bibcode = 2010BVol...72.1153M|volume=72|pages=1153–1167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telecommunication equipment may become damaged due to direct ash fall. Most modern equipment requires constant cooling from [[Air conditioner|air conditioning units]]. These are susceptible to blockage by ash which reduces their cooling efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=S.|year=2009|title=The vulnerability of New Zealand lifelines infrastructure to ashfall|url=http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/3688}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy ash falls may cause telecommunication lines, masts, cables, aerials, antennae dishes and towers to collapse due to ash loading.  Moist ash may also cause accelerated corrosion of metal components.&lt;ref name="Wilson thesis"/&gt;

Reports from recent eruptions suggest that the largest disruption to communication networks is overloading due to high user demand.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al 11"/&gt; This is common of many natural disasters.

====Computers====
[[Computer]]s may be impacted by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, but it is unlikely they will completely fail.&lt;ref name="Wilson G thesis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=G.|author2=Wilson, T.M. |author3=Cole, J.W. |author4=Oze, C. |title=Vulnerability of laptop computers to volcanic ash and gas|journal=Natural Hazards|year=2012|doi=10.1007/s11069-012-0176-7 |volume=63 |pages=711–736}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as [[computer fan|cooling fans]], [[optical disc drive|cd drives]], [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[Mouse (computing)|mice]] and [[touch pad]]s. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.&lt;ref name="Wilson G thesis"/&gt;

====Buildings and structures====
Damage to buildings and structures can range from complete or partial roof collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials. Impacts depend on the thickness of ash, whether it is wet or dry, the roof and building design and how much ash gets inside a building. The specific weight of ash can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50-100%.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; Problems associated with ash loading are similar to that of snow; however, ash is more severe as 1) the load from ash is generally much greater, 2) ash does not melt and 3) ash can clog and damage gutters, especially after rain fall. Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction, including roof slope, construction materials, roof span and support system, and age and maintenance of the building.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; Generally flat roofs are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs. Roofs made of smooth materials (sheet metal or glass) are more likely to shed ash than roofs made with rough materials (thatch, asphalt or wood shingles). Roof collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage. For example, the collapse of roofs from ash during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spence|first=R.J.S.|author2=Kelman, I. |author3=Baxter, P.J. |author4=Zuccaro, G. |author5=Petrazzuoli, S. |title=Residential building and occupant vulnerability to tephra fall|journal=Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences|year=2005|doi=10.5194/nhess-5-477-2005 |volume=5 |pages=477–494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human and animal health===
Ash particles of less than 10&amp;nbsp;µm diameter suspended in the air are known to be inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms.&lt;ref name="ivhhn"/&gt; Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing [[respiratory disease|respiratory conditions]].&lt;ref name="Horwell &amp; Baxter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horwell|first=C.J.|author2=Baxter, P.J. |title=The respiratory health hazards of volcanic ash: a review for volcanic risk mitigation|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|year=2006|volume=69|pages=1–24|bibcode = 2006BVol...69....1H |doi = 10.1007/s00445-006-0052-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings on the surface of the ash particles.&lt;ref name="Horwell &amp; Baxter"/&gt; Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10&amp;nbsp;µm diameter, known as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The social context may also be important.

Chronic health effects from volcanic ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica is known to cause [[silicosis]]. Minerals associated with this include [[quartz]], [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]], which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not attached to another element to create a new mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.&lt;ref name="Horwell &amp; Baxter"/&gt;

The exposure levels to free crystalline silica in the ash are commonly used to characterise the risk of silicosis in occupational studies (for people who work in mining, construction and other industries,) because it is classified as a human [[carcinogen]] by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]. Guideline values have been created for exposure, but with unclear rationale; UK guidelines for particulates in air (PM10) are 50&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and USA guidelines for exposure to crystalline silica are 50&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Horwell &amp; Baxter"/&gt; It is thought that the guidelines on exposure levels could be exceeded for short periods of time without significant health effects on the general population.&lt;ref name="ivhhn"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[International Volcanic Health Hazard Network]]|title=International Volcanic Health Hazard Network|url=http://www.ivhhn.org|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been no documented cases of silicosis developed from exposure to volcanic ash. However, long-term studies necessary to evaluate these effects are lacking.&lt;ref name="Horwell &amp; Baxter"/&gt;

Ingesting ash may be harmful to [[livestock]], causing abrasion of the teeth, and in cases of high [[fluorine]] content, fluorine poisoning (toxic at levels of &gt;100&amp;nbsp;µg/g) for grazing animals.&lt;ref name="Cronin et al 03"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cronin|first=S.J.|author2=Neall, V.E. |author3=Lecointre, J.A. |author4=Hedley, M.J. |author5=Loganathan, P. |title=Environmental hazards of fluoride in volcanic ash: a case study from Ruapehu Volcano, New Zealand|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|year=2003|volume=121|pages=271–291|bibcode = 2003JVGR..121..271C |doi = 10.1016/S0377-0273(02)00465-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known from the [[Laki#1783 eruption|1783 eruption of Laki]] in Iceland that fluorine poisoning occurred in humans and livestock as a result of the chemistry of the ash and gas, which contained high levels of Hydrogen Fluoride.  Following the [[Mt Ruapehu#1995-96 eruptions|1995/96 Mount Ruapehu eruptions]] in New Zealand, two thousand ewes and lambs died after being affected by fluorosis while grazing on land with only 1–3&amp;nbsp;mm of ash fall.&lt;ref name="Cronin et al 03"/&gt; Ash ingestion may also cause gastrointestinal blockages.&lt;ref name="Wilson thesis"/&gt; Sheep that ingested ash from the 1991 Mount Hudson volcanic eruption in Chile, suffered from diarrhoea and weakness. The added weight of ash in the [[wool]] led to fatigue and sheep could not stand up.

===Environment and agriculture===
Volcanic ash can have a detrimental impact on the environment which can be difficult to predict due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone. Natural waterways can be impacted in the same way as urban water supply networks. Ash will increase water turbidity which can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged [[aquatic plant]]s and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as [[fish]] and [[shellfish]]. High turbidity can also affect the ability of [[gill|fish gills]] to absorb [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]]. Acidification will also occur, which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment. Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride.

Ash accumulation will also affect pasture, plants and trees which are part of the [[horticulture]] and [[agriculture]] industries. Thin ash falls (&lt;20&amp;nbsp;mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit [[transpiration]] and [[photosynthesis]] and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=R.J.|author2=Barron, J.C. |author3=Papendick, R.I. |author4=Williams, G.J. |title=Impact of Agriculture of the Mount St. Helens Eruptions|journal=Science|year=1981|volume=211|pages=16–22|bibcode = 1981Sci...211...16C |doi = 10.1126/science.211.4477.16 |issue=4477 |pmid=17731222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cronin|first=S.J.|author2=Hedley, M.J. |author3=Neall, V.E. |author4=Smith, R.G. |title=Agronomic impact of tephra fallout from the 1995 and 1996 Ruapehu Volcano eruptions, New Zealand|journal=Environmental Geology|year=1998|volume=34|pages=21–30|doi=10.1007/s002540050253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon [[agronomy|arable]] crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.

Young forests (trees &lt;2 years old) are most at risk from ash falls and are likely to be destroyed by ash deposits &gt;100&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neild|first=J.|author2=O'Flaherty, P. |author3=Hedley, P. |author4=Underwood, R. |author5=Johnston, D.M. |author6=Christenson, B. |author7=Brown, P. |title=Agriculture recovery from a volcanic eruption: MAF Technical paper 99/2|journal=MAF Technical paper 99/2|year=1998|url=http://vatlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Impacts-of-a-volcanic-eruption-on-agriculture-and-forestry-in-New-Zealand.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ash fall is unlikely to kill mature trees, but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls (&gt;500&amp;nbsp;mm). Defoliation of trees may also occur, especially if there is a coarse ash component within the ash fall.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;

Land rehabilitation after ash fall may be possible depending on the ash deposit thickness. Rehabilitation treatment may include: direct seeding of deposit; mixing of deposit with buried soil; scraping of ash deposit from land surface; and application of new topsoil over the ash deposit.&lt;ref name="Wilson thesis"/&gt;

===Interdependence===
[[Image:Interdependency of volcanic ashfall impacts.jpg|thumb|Interdependency of volcanic ashfall impacts from the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruptions.]]
Critical infrastructure and infrastructure services are vital to the functionality of modern society, to provide: medical care, policing, [[emergency service]]s, and lifelines such as water, wastewater, and power and transportation links. Often critical facilities themselves are dependent on such lifelines for operability, which makes them vulnerable to both direct impacts from a hazard event and indirect effects from lifeline disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rinaldi|first=S.M.|author2=Peerenboom, J. P. |author3=Kelly, T.

The impacts on lifelines may also be [[interdependence|inter-dependent]]. The vulnerability of each lifeline may depend on: the type of hazard, the spatial density of its critical linkages, the dependency on critical linkages, susceptibility to damage and speed of service restoration, state of repair or age, and institutional characteristics or ownership.&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt;

The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted the impacts of volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7638750/Volcanic-ash-crisis-cost-airlines-2.2-billion.html|title=Volcanic ash crisis cost airlines £2.2 billion|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.&lt;ref name="Sword-Daniels thesis"/&gt;

Preparedness for ashfalls should involve sealing buildings, protecting infrastructure and homes, and storing sufficient supplies of food and water to last until the ash fall is over and clean-up can begin. [[Dust mask]]s can be worn to reduce inhalation of ash and mitigate against any respiratory health affects.&lt;ref name="ivhhn"/&gt; Goggles can be worn to protect against eye irritation.

The [[International Volcanic Ashfall Impacts Working Group]] of [[International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior|IAVCEI]] maintains a regularly updated database of impacts and mitigations strategies.

At home, staying informed about volcanic activity, and having [[contingency plan]]s in place for alternative shelter locations, constitutes good preparedness for an ash fall event. This can prevent some impacts associated with ash fall, reduce the effects, and increase the human capacity to cope with such events. A few items such as a flashlight, plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from ash ingress, and battery operated radios, are extremely useful during ash fall events.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;

The protection of infrastructure must also be considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It is also important to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.

Communication plans should be made beforehand to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up.&lt;ref name="FEMA"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]|year=1984|title=The mitigation of ashfall damage to public facilities: lessons learned from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[personal protective equipment|Protective equipment]] such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.

Some effective techniques for the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Josh L.|last2=Wilson|first2=Thomas M.|last3=Magill|first3=Christina|date=2015-10-01|title=Tephra fall clean-up in urban environments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027315002930|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|volume=304|pages=359–377|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2015.09.014|bibcode=2015JVGR..304..359H}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system.&lt;ref name="FEMA"/&gt; Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.&lt;ref name="FEMA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Josh|last2=Wilson|first2=Thomas M.|last3=Deligne|first3=Natalia I.|last4=Cole|first4=Jim|last5=Hughes|first5=Matthew|date=2017-01-06|title=A model to assess tephra clean-up requirements in urban environments|url=http://appliedvolc.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13617-016-0052-3|journal=Journal of Applied Volcanology|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s13617-016-0052-3|issn=2191-5040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volcanic ash soils==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Volcanic ash's primary use is that of a soil enricher. Once the minerals in ash are washed into the soil by rain or other natural processes, it mixes with the soil to create an [[andisol]] layer. This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is often as a result of trees growing and flourishing in the [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]]-rich andisol.
