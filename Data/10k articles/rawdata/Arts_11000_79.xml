'''Aleksandër Vasilev Lilov''' ({{lang-bg|Александър Василев Лилов}}; 31 August 1933 – 20 July 2013) was a [[Bulgaria]]n politician and philosopher.

At his career's height during the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], he was described as the second most powerful man of the regime. However, he fell out of favor in 1983 and lost his power. He made a strong political comeback during the democratic transition and was elected chairman of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]. He led the party to transform and adapt to the post-communist era.  A party referendum supported his proposal to change the name to the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. After winning the first [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|democratic elections]] he did not become prime minister himself, instead he eventually supported a multi-party government led by [[Dimitar Iliev Popov|Dimitar Popov]]. After losing the [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|1991 parliamentary elections]] he stepped down as party leader. In 2001 he retired as MP after having served for 39 years.

==Biography==
Aleksandar Lilov was born on 31 August 1933 in the village of [[Granichak (village)|Granichak]], northwestern [[Vidin Province]]. He graduated Bulgarian Studies (philosophy) at [[Sofia University]] in 1962 and graduated doctoral studies in communist Social Science at the Academy of Public Sciences in Moscow. In 1975 he became an associate at the institution of art at the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]. Six years later, he defended a doctoral thesis in 1981.&lt;ref name=Death /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; He died on 20 July 2013 at the age of 79.

==Political career==
Lilov joined the Dimitrov Young Communist League in Vidin and rose to the ranks of its central committee in 1963. Six years later he joined the central Party organ and in 1971 he became a prominent member of the Communist Party. Lilov was a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] from July 1974 to September 1983 and was also a secretary of the Central Committee of the Party from July 1972 to September 28, 1983. He was also a member of the [[State Council of Bulgaria]] from 1976 to 1983.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; By the end of the 70s he was viewed as the second most powerful member of the party. After the death of [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] (General Secretary [[Todor Zhivkov]]'s daughter) in 1981, Lilov's power began to wane. In 1983 he was removed from the Politburo after criticizing the General Secretary for his economic mismanagement and apparent lack of interest in current issues.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

After fading from the public view for six year, Lilov returned from Great-Britain - where he was when Zhivkov was forced to resign on November 10, 1989 - and was welcomed back among the leaders of the BCP. There he denounced the [[Revival Process]] (started by Zhivkov and internationally condemned) and allowed Bulgarian Muslims to reinstate their former names.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt;

During the 14th emergency congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party (held in January - February 1990), the post of general secretary was abolished, and Lilov was elected to the new post of chairman. Under his leadership the party was dissolved and reorganized into the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] on April 3 following an party referendum.&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; This transition brought about revolutionary change to the party's ideology, from Communism to Socialism (from [[far-left politics|far-left]] to [[left-wing politics|left-wing]]). Change was also brought to the way the party was run in order to dismantle the totalitarian apparatus in the country. In September he was reelected as party chairman by a margin of 2 to 1 against the hopes of the liberals in the party who sought to remove the remains of the former Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD : Bulgaria Socialists Reelect Lilov|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-25/news/mn-1340_1_socialist-party|work=World News|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=25 September 1990|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the party's leader until the end of 1991.

He led the Socialists through the first democratic elections in [[Bulgarian Constitutional Assembly election, 1990|1990]], elected to adopt a new constitution, where his party won a majority of the seats (211 out of 400) and 47.15% of the votes. He did not become Prime Minister himself, instead continuing his support for the socialist government in place led by [[Andrey Lukanov]]. This came to an end when mass demonstrations and a general strike led to the formation of a government under the non-partisan judge [[Dimitar Iliev Popov|Dimitar Popov]] in which the BSP participated alongside the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|UDF]], [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union|BANU]] and independent experts.

His second election campaign in [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|1991]] ended with defeat after his electoral alliance won only 33.1% of the votes and 106 seats (out of 240); finishing behind the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] who won 34.4% of the votes and 110 seats. Later that year he stepped down and as chairman of the party and was succeeded by [[Zhan Videnov]]. Lilov remained a Member of Parliament until 2001, a seat he held for 39 years (1962–2001).&lt;ref name=Bio /&gt; In 2001 he was the longest serving member of parliament.&lt;ref name=Death /&gt;

The '''Alphabet Synthesis Machine''' (2002) is a work of [[interactive art]] which makes use of [[genetic algorithm]]s to "evolve" a set of glyphs similar in appearance to a real-world alphabet. Users create initial glyphs and the program takes over. As the creators of the project put it, their goal was "to bring about the specific feeling of semi-sense one experiences when one recognizes—- but cannot read—- the unfamiliar writing of another culture."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alphabetsynthesis.com/#background&lt;/ref&gt; The project was developed by [[Golan Levin]], a new-media artist, in collaboration with [[Cassidy Curtis]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/12/61720?currentPage=2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jonathan Feinberg]].

'''Architectural propaganda''' is the use of [[architecture]], intentionally or unintentionally, to communicate an attitude or idea in a persuasive manner, often for an explicitly [[propaganda|propagandic]] purpose. The use of architecture for propaganda purposes in order to influence attitudes, opinions, and feelings of the target audience can be found in many cultures across history. Since architecture itself is an expression of culture, the propaganda element of architecture can organically flow from the structure by nature of its being.

The fact that something may be used for propaganda is not a values statement about the thing itself. It is a simple truism that people are influenced by things around them and therefore, when those things around include architecture, people will be influenced by it as a part of an environment. This inherent quality of architecture then can be used by those with the desire to do so. This use is what transforms the architecture from a simple influence into a piece of propaganda.

The psychological dimension of architecture and propaganda means that even when a group or government has no direct intent to use architecture for propaganda purposes, the nature of architecture proceeding as it does from the human mind will express something about the designer and his or her culture. The architecture itself becomes an expression of the larger opinions of a cultural or social group which may then be impressed upon others. By virtue of observation of an architectural work, an individual may come to understand something about the original builder and his or her culture. Thus, even with no prior intent, architecture by its very nature has a built-in propaganda value.

==A Holistic Approach to Architecture==

[[Richard Swett]], the former [[Congressman]] from [[New Hampshire]] and US ambassador to [[Denmark]], an architect by training proposed that architecture need not be limited simply to buildings and grand constructions, but rather that architectural design and design considerations should permeate every aspect of life. He proposed that since everything utilized and created is designed at some level, it is possible and indeed necessary to include a great deal of thought and effort in the design of everything from buildings to desk lamps, to silverware.&lt;ref name="Swett"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.di.net/articles/design-diplomacy-architectures-relationship-with-public-policy|title=Design Diplomacy: Architecture's Relationship with Public Policy|last=Swett|first=Richard|date=September 30, 2000|work=[[Design Intelligence]]|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swett proposed that “examples of integrated artistic, social and environmental harmony created by architects who have served both their calling and the needs of society” are the ideal to be striven for in architectural design. He says that in Denmark, “all aspects of the design of a civilized life’s accouterments, from the shelter we need to the implements for feeding ourselves, are treated with the same high standards of design integrity and respect,”&lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt; and proposes that American architecture and architects ought to follow a similar course. "In one of its articles in 1953, the [[Architectural Forum]] recognised US’s export architecture as a diplomatic tool, appreciating it and presenting US as a state exercising political world leadership and cultural leadership with the latter being driven especially by the US‘s architecture." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://publicandculturaldiplomacy3.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/architecture-diplomacy-undervalued-dimension-of-branding/|title=Design Diplomacy: Architecture's Relationship with Public Policy|last=kag0276|date=March 18, 2012|work=[[Architecture Diplomacy]]|accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture is a profession that is inherently engaged in public diplomacy by the nature of what it creates and who interacts with it, and that therefore, architects need to consciously participate in public diplomacy through their work rather than unwittingly be a part of it with no awareness of their significance. “The fact is too many architects are seriously marginalized, and I would go so far as to say, intentionally isolated, from the political process that determines the zoning, funding and the complex social and legal regulations that control the building of our shared environment. This subject needs to be confronted, debated and discussed in detail." &lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt; Swett concludes that the architectural profession would do well to develop “by assisting in the design of a blueprint that will frame the future influence of our profession beyond the limitations of bricks and mortar. Such a plan suggests that our fellow architects take up leadership roles in order to balance the tectonic, economic and political aspects of city/state planning more consciously. [[Thomas Jefferson]] also wrote in 1785: “I am proud to be an architect and don’t propose we go out and tear down any buildings. I do propose, however, we tear down some of the myths and misperceptions that architects have about public policy and vice versa.”” &lt;ref name="Swett"/&gt;

Architectural propaganda is not limited simply to a given propaganda value or sum; rather, it has the ability to act in the wider realm of public diplomacy because of its importance and overreaching themes that touch all aspects of life. As such, when talking about [[Canada|Canadian]] public diplomacy, Evan Potter, a [[Professor]] of [[Communications]] at the [[University of Ottawa]] made the following points. He states that the entirety of public diplomacy must be thought of: "(1) temporally, in three time frames; (2) as an essentially contested concept that has many labels, such as cultural diplomacy, political communication, international public relations, democracy building, propaganda, branding, and military information operations; (3) as an endeavor whose effectiveness is linked to the level of societal support and understanding at home; and (4) as a form of statecraft that is not exclusive to foreign ministries but that, according to Bruce Gregory, “cuts across all political, economic, and military instruments and is essential to their implementation and success.” &lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Bruce. "Not Your Grandaparents’ Public Diplomacy," Presentation at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, November 30, 2005, Retrieved 2013-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Public diplomacy is not a single instrument or the exclusive preserve of a country’s foreign ministry; rather, it is a process, and as Gregory writes, it has “multiple components, each with their own organizations, budgets, tribal cultures, and rules for applying principles to behavior.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://publicdiplomacymagazine.com/a-new-architecture-for-canadian-public-diplomacy/|title=A New Architecture for Canadian Public Diplomacy |last=Potter|first=Evan|date=June 1, 2010|work=[[Public Diplomacy Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; These themes are not limited simply to their obvious and stated public diplomacy dimensions, but also to the inherent propaganda and public diplomacy value of architecture itself. It is this connectivity that brings together Swett's and Potter's theories into a practicable and useful set of operational principles for architecture in both its propaganda and public diplomacy aspects. Different countries and groups have utilized the propaganda and public diplomacy aspects of architecture with varying degrees of success and continue to do so today. Below, expanded are some of these countries and groups with examples of their architectural propaganda and public diplomacy.

==People's Republic of China==

The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) is currently engaged in a prolonged public relations campaign with many other nations, the developing world particularly. This campaign has been termed a "charm offensive" by [[Joshua Kurlantzick]] in his book of the same name. Among the many elements of soft power used by the PRC is that of architecture. China has a rich architectural tradition to draw from and to publicize with. This allows the PRC government to promote tourism to famous architectural sites like the [[Great Wall]] or the [[Forbidden City]]. Furthermore, a rich architectural history combined with a desire to spread pro-PRC sentiment means that PRC funding of building projects abroad is increasingly common. ". . . Many scholars associated China's aid with giant white-elephant projects, like large buildings and ministries and similar structures."&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, Joshua. Charm Offensive. New Haven and London: Yale University, 2007, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Wall of China may 2007.JPG|thumb|left|alt=The Great Wall of China in May 2007 with many tourists and the PRC Flag.|The Great Wall of China in May 2007 with many tourists and the PRC Flag.]]

In [[Mozambique]], a former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony possessed of largely Portuguese-style architecture, in the capital city, Maputo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building In [[East Timor]], also a former Portuguese colony, the PRC funded and promoted the construction of that country's foreign ministry and funded the creation of a new East Timor [[embassy]] in [[Beijing]] despite the long-standing antagonism between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, Joshua.

The use of architecture to fuel tourism in the PRC has been highly successful. China is the third most visited country in the world. The number of overseas tourists was 55.98 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hFli5xB9YgVoSunOYYFREW6BozmQ?docId=CNG.f55f656a9f597ee071fe1ead97d63e4a.3b1]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign exchange income was 45.8 billion [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]s, the world's fourth largest in 2010. The number of domestic tourist visits totaled 1.61 billion, with a total income of 777.1 billion yuan.&lt;ref name="factbox"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/06/content_8994009.htm  Factbox: Basic facts about China's economy]&lt;/ref&gt; While certainly all of this tourism cannot be attributed to architecture alone, a significant number of the tourist sites visited possess inherent architectural value.

As part of a corporation's overall marketing and branding campaign, when it comes to constructing a central office or corporate headquarters, architectural marketing or propaganda can be employed. A company's headquarters can be the ultimate expression or symbol of that company.&lt;ref name="Castillo"&gt;Castillo, Greg. Cold War on the Home Front: The Soft Power of Midcentury Design. Minneapolis: Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A building can make a statement to potential customers, clients, employees, or rivals. The architecture utilized in a corporate building can indicate general philosophies held by the corporation or principles it wishes to espouse. In some cases, corporate architecture can be used to show the success of a given corporation versus its rivals.&lt;ref name="Castillo"/&gt;

Famous examples of corporate architecture can be found in cities around the world. In some cities, skyscrapers serve as unforgettable propaganda for the corporations for which they are named. In other places, corporate sponsorship of sports arenas, performing arts venues, and the sprawling headquarters of the corporations themselves serve as propaganda for their owners. A fine example of corporate architecture and propaganda can be found in the Chrysler Building in New York City. Built from 1928-1930, the Chrysler building gave the Chrysler Corporation a giant piece of advertising and propaganda. Not only could Chrysler lay claim to the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion, but the stainless steel spire of the building was styled after the grilles of then current Chrysler road cars. This huge building served as a massive statement of the success and power of the Chrysler Corporation while at the same time advertising its products to the world through the very architecture of the building.&lt;ref name="Castillo"/&gt;

==Drug Cartel==

Mexican drug cartels have utilized architecture as part of their overall propaganda campaign. Large houses called "''narco mansions'' or ''narco castillos'' (drug mansions or castles)" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/worldview/101026/mexico-drug-war-cartels-newspapers|title=Analysis: A PR department for Mexico's narcos|last=O'Connor|first=Mike|date=November 5, 2010|work=[[GlobalPost]]|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; are becoming an increasingly common feature of the recent drug conflicts in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/the-narco-generation/|title=The Narco Generation|last=Beckhart|first=Sarah|date=February 21, 2011|work=AL DÍA|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]'s Mexico Institute|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to overwhelm and sway over local populaces and potential rivals, these demonstrations of wealth and power are built at least partly for their psychological value.

==Nazi==

[[Nazi architecture]] adopted many elements of [[neoclassicism]] and of [[art deco]] in keeping with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s personal fascination with [[Ancient Roman|Ancient Rome]]. Part of the Nazi cult involved the overaweing and subsuming of the individual into the greater German ''volk''. This giving over of oneself to the whole was also expressed through Nazi architecture. The three primary expressed roles found in Nazi architecture are the (i)[[Theatrical]], (ii)[[Symbol]]ic, and (iii)[[Didactic]], but each of these roles has its own place within the larger sphere of propaganda value.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-1130-502, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Lichtdom.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Cathedral of Lights at the 1936 Nuremberg Party Rally. |The Cathedral of Lights at the 1936 Nuremberg Party Rally.]]

Nazi architecture was designed to make the individual feel small and insignificant through its use of high ceilings. For example, at [[Nuremberg rallies]], the feeling produced by the use of massed groups coupled with the architecture of the Zepplintribune architecture was to create wonder and a powerful feeling of community. Indeed, Hitler stated in one of his Nuremberg rally speeches, "Not every one of you sees me and I do not see every one of you. But I feel you and you feel me!".&lt;ref&gt;Baynes, Norman H. The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922-August 1939, V1 &amp; V2. London: Oxford University Press, 1942. V1 - {{ISBN|0-598-75893-3}} V2 - {{ISBN|0-598-75894-1}} ,197.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Nuremberg rallies, the overall effect of architecture was further enhanced through the use of many searchlights pointed directly upward in order to create a "Cathedral of Light" that even further served to invite the individual to buy into the Nazi worldview.

Another prominent conceptual feature of Nazi architecture was the "[[Ruin value|Theory of Ruin Value]]", first put forward by [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's personal architect. This theory postulated that in order for a civilization's influence to pass beyond the existence of the civilization itself, it was important that aesthetically pleasing and impressive ruins be left by the dilapidated buildings of that civilization. This theory, too, took inspiration from the ancient Romans and Greeks in attempting to emulate the even architectural remains of their civilizations with Nazi ones in thousands of years. Since the original inspiration for Nazi architecture was itself, the ancient Romans and Greeks, it was important to Hitler that at the end of the Thousand Year Reich, the remains would inspire others as Roman ruins had done for him.

An interesting remaining piece of Nazi architecture can be found in the former [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] which closed all airport operations in 2008. The main terminal was designed and built during the late 1930s and early 1940s according to a design by [[Ernst Sagebiel]] following the ideas of Speer and Hitler including that of ruin value. It was designed to be the main hub for Hitler's redesigned Berlin, to be called Germania. When completed, it was the world's largest building and today, should the building fall into disrepair, Speer and Hitler's ruin value theory may be demonstrated.

==United States (Federal)==

[[File:US Capitol Building Front New.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The United States' Capitol Building in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.|The United States' Capitol Building in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.]]

The [[Classical Liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[United States]]' [[Founding fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] heavily influenced American Federal architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learner.org/amerpass/unit04/context_activ-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas and creations of the [[Ancient Greeks]] and Romans held great sway not only in the formation of the United States and her founding documents, but also in the ways American ideals came to be expressed physically when it came to designing the Federal City, [[Washington, DC.]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unrv.com/government.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln-Memorial WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.|The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC exhibits classical Greek architectural features.]]

The Embassy of the Hellenic Republic in Washington, DC has hosted lectures on the topic of Greek architectural influence on the Western World and in the United States in particular. Their website says, "Thomas Jefferson once wrote that “design activity and political thought are indivisible.”  He believed that architecture was an important vehicle for expressing political ideals, and he worked to ensure that Washington, as the seat of the American democracy, would become a city of stately and sophisticated buildings based on classical precedents."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office%3D1%26folder%3D14%26article%3D20822 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007144345/http://greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=1&amp;folder=14&amp;article=20822 |archivedate=2010-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can clearly be seen that while the modern state of Greece did not even exist at the time of the construction of many American government buildings, the Hellenic Republic is still able to derive some propaganda value and great national prestige from the influence of the ancient Greeks upon world history and architecture.

The style of construction found in the [[Lincoln Memorial]] closely parallels the design of a classical Greek temple. It utilizes a colonnade of thirty-six [[Doric order|Doric]] columns surrounding a central interior made up of three chambers. It serves as a memorial for American President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and for his service to the United States during the United States' [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The neoclassical design serves to reinforce the validity of the values Americans believed this president embodied at the time of the Memorial's construction.&lt;ref&gt;NRHP Nomination: {{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination Form: Lincoln Memorial |last=Pfanz |first=Donald C. |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |url=http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NRHP&amp;item=/Text/NRHP-6340b4580b4649f499fbab210684e03f.djvu&amp;style=nps/FOCUS-DJview.xsl&amp;wid=640&amp;hei=480&amp;oif=jpeg&amp;props=item(SUMMARY,COPYRIGHT) |date=1981-03-24 |accessdate=2012-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224002508/http://image1.nps.gov:9001/StyleServer/calcrgn?cat=NRHP&amp;item=%2FText%2FNRHP-6340b4580b4649f499fbab210684e03f.djvu&amp;style=nps%2FFOCUS-DJview.xsl&amp;wid=640&amp;hei=480&amp;oif=jpeg&amp;props=item%28SUMMARY%2CCOPYRIGHT%29 |archivedate=2012-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This itself is to some degree a self reinforcement, and thereby propaganda promoting the American values expounded therein.

The intent to showcase President Lincoln's connection to the founding values of the United States and to the values of the ancients Greeks and Romans is shown in the architecture of the monument itself. It is the implementation and exhibition of these values combined with the text inscribed on the memorial that transforms it from a simple honoring of a man into the honoring of all that he has been perceived to stand for. Even though the memorial is in President Lincoln's honor, it transcends this purpose and becomes a site for connection with American values themselves. The use of ancient Greek architecture allows for the transfer of the collective American values as passed down from the Lincoln, the Founding Fathers, and the ancient Greeks before them. This is consummate propaganda, it takes values, personifies them and holds them up as something to be aspired to, all through the use of architecture.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aerial View Rendering New US Embassy Londoin.jpg|thumb|left| alt= The design for the new US Embassy in London. Copyright KieranTimberlake.|The new US Embassy in London exhibits public diplomacy in its design.]] --&gt;

An interesting case study into the public diplomacy effects of architecture within a fixed culture and location is provided by the case of the United States embassy in London. “Public buildings project the identity of a country’s peoples, culture and aspirations. American public buildings convey the collective identity of our rich, culturally diverse, and increasingly complex society. An American embassy’s design expresses to the world the ideals of American democracy—the optimism, hope and promise of our time. By communicating the transcendent values that define the United States as a nation, the new Embassy of the United States of America in London has the potential to embody a new age of American openness, transparency, and renewed commitment to international collaboration.  Architecture itself becomes an act of public diplomacy; as the United States Department of State envisions, the design of the new Embassy “far transcends architecture and engineering… it is fully and firmly within the realm of international diplomacy.”” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://morphopedia.com/projects/new-u-s-embassy-in-london|title= New U.S. Embassy in London|last=Morphosis Team|date=August 31, 2011|work=[[Morphopedia]]|accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old US Embassy in Grosvenor Square became the subject of intense dislike by the local inhabitants of London when, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, “the area surrounding the embassy was transformed into a fortress, complete with heavily armed guards, ugly security corridors and unsightly bollards – all of which defaced the elegant square.”&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel"&gt;{{cite news|title=The US Embassy's move to Vauxhall|url= http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/Property-Experts/Expert-Opinions/The-US-Embassys-move-to-Vauxhall.html|last= Bar-Hillel |first= Mira |date=October 1, 2012|work=[[The London Magazine]]|accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The new US Embassy integrates aspects of British landscaping and site design, rather than high fences, to create security”; “The main building itself will be “clad in glass to emphasise a transparent, open atmosphere.”&lt;ref name="Bar-Hillel"/&gt; The use of architecture itself in the design of the new US Embassy in London to present American ideals and values through the building itself is ingenious and exhibits well thought out and executed public diplomacy and propaganda value in its design.

Used extensively in [[bookbinding]], a '''board shear''' is a large, hand-operated machine for cutting board or paper.  Like [[scissors]], a board shear uses two blades to apply [[shear stress]] exceeding the paper's [[shear strength]] in order to cut.  The stationary blade forms the edge of the cutting table, with the moving blade mounted on a cutting arm.  Originally known as a table gauge shear because its gauge allowed the cutting of consistently-sized materials, the board shear resembles a larger version of the paper cutters commonly found in offices.

The earliest known reference to a board shear comes from an 1842 supplement to ''[[Penny Magazine]]'', titled ''A Day at a Bookbinder's'', which included a drawing of a board shear with many of the major developments already present.  An 1854 article on the history of bookbinding from ''The Bookbinder's Trade Circular'' describes early board shears, and places their development in "about 1836"; credit for the invention is ascribed to Warren De La Rue in the ''Reports of the Juries'' from the [[Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition of 1851]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Bernard |title=A History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique |publisher=Oak Knoll Press &amp; [[British Library|The British Library]] |year=1996 |pages=232–234 |isbn=1-884718-28-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modifications of the basic design were made in the 19th century, with changes such as rack-and-pinion adjustment for the outer gauge&lt;ref&gt;Brombacher, C. U.S. Patent 43634, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; and improved clamp bars.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J.T. U.S. Patent 225871, 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 19th century, board shears were substantively the same as modern machines, and many 19th-century board shears are still in use today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

As of January 2018, Brand Union has been integrated into Superunion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dawood |first1=Sarah |title=Brand Union, Lambie-Nairn and The Partners become Superunion in huge WPP merger |url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/22-28-january-2018/brand-union-lambie-nairn-partners-become-superunion-huge-wpp-merger/ |website=Design Week |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the newly formed WPP brand consultancy. 

==History==
In May 1976, graphic designers Terry Tyrrell and Sam Sampson formed Sampson Tyrrell. The catalyst for this was an opportunity given to them by an advertising agency to help with the corporate identity of British Gas. They worked for clients including Kodak, Lowrey, London Docklands and Legal and General.

The business grew slowly and by 1984 had grown to 10 employees working across a broad range of assignments, focusing mainly on graphic design projects. In 1984 Dave Allen joined from Kodak and helped accelerate growth winning work from Citizen, Mazda and Castrol.

In 1986, Sampson Tyrrell was acquired by the WPP Group plc. This resulted in a period of rapid growth and by 1991 the company was over 100 people in London. In 1992 Sampson and Allen led the formation of Enterprise identity Group with Jim Johnson of Anspach Grossman Portugal, Flavio Gomez of Sidjakov Berman Gomez and Miles Young of Ogilvy and Mather in Asia who owned a design network based in Hong Kong and Taiwan called Artistree. This was in response to the needs of international brand owners who were rapidly globalising the brands and their businesses around the world. Most particularly in Asia. All the founding businesses were formally transitioned into a new brand - Enterprise IG. Enterprise IG was formally launched in 1996. At this time and Allen and Johnson became Joint CEOs.

The business grew organically and by acquisition. Enterprise IG acquired Horniak and Canny in Australia, Springham Anderson in Singapore, Brindfors Design in Stockholm, Winderlich design in Hamburg and in 2001 Brown KSDP (part of the Tempus acquisition made by WPP) decided to join Enterprise IG - adding offices in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Amsterdam and Paris. This took Enterprise IG up to over $100m revenue, 19 offices and over 700 employees. That year Enterprise IG topped the Design Week 100 league table.

In July, 2001 Enterprise IG acquired The Identity Business, Ireland’s leading brand and identity consultancy

The Enterprise IG global network expanded with 21 regional offices in 18 markets, and formally became known as Brand Union in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logolounge.com/identitynews/ LogoLounge - ENTERPRISE IG IS NOW THE BRAND UNION] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629212858/http://www.logolounge.com/identitynews/ |date=June 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

'''Revelation'''

Liz lives with her husband Eli and two children in the old west, one of which is a boy from her husband's prior marriage, and the other is a young girl. Liz is a midwife who can hear but communicates through sign language. A new minister comes to their church, and the moment that Liz hears his voice, she seems to recognize him and is terrified. The same day Liz is forced to choose between a delivering a baby safely or saving its mother, and the father Nathan blames and threatens Liz.
After Eli's sheep are killed, he seeks out Nathan, who has disappeared. Liz then sneaks off at night to kill the minister, and finds her daughter's doll in the minister's bed. The minister disembowels Eli, and leaves him to die. Eli tells his son Matthew to take the family up into the mountains to Eli's father, before the boy shoots him. Liz and the children flee the farm.

'''Exodus'''

A young girl named Joanna walking through the desert is picked up by a Chinese family. In the mining town of Bismuth, she's sold to a brothel owned by Frank. Joanna is first protected by Sally until she is hanged for shooting a violent customer, and then Elizabeth. After Elizabeth bites the tongue of an abusive customer, her tongue is cut off in punishment. Joanna teaches Elizabeth sign language from a book the doctor gave her. Elizabeth plans to sneak out of Bismuth to find a new life, and arranges through a marriage broker to marry Eli. 
The minister comes to the brothel and becomes violent with Joanna. Elizabeth saves Joanna and is killed by the minister. Joanna slashes his throat and runs away, cutting off her own tongue and taking Elizabeth's place with Eli.

'''Genesis'''

In the desert, two badly wounded men, Samuel and Wolf, are the last men standing in a dispute over gold that has left several other men dead. They depart on a single horse. Young Joanna lives with her mother, Anna, and father, who is the minister. Samuel and Wolf collapse at the farm and Joanna secretly cares for them. Anna confronts the minister when she realizes he lusts after their daughter, and he beats and humiliates her by placing a [[scold's bridle]] on her head, so that she commits suicide in full view of the church congregation. The next day her father takes Joanna to church and starts to perform a wedding ceremony between himself and his daughter. Samuel tries to rescue her and the minister kills him. Her father whips Joanna and rapes her. In the morning she runs off.

'''Retribution'''

Matthew is shot by the minister as he follows Liz to her father-in-law's place in the mountains. He kills her father-in-law and tells Liz he will beat and rape her daughter before Liz finally kills him instead. Some time later, after Liz has turned Eli's place into a [[sawmill]], Nathan arrives to arrest her. The minister had sent him to Bismuth where he became a deputy and then sheriff. Finding a 'Wanted Poster' of Elizabeth Brundy, the woman without a tongue who killed Frank before she saved Liz/Joanna, Nathan has come to arrest her. As Nathan is escorting her onto a ferry, with a last look at her daughter playing on the shore, Liz throws herself in the lake and drowns.
Her daughter Sam, now a grown woman with a child of her own, remembers her well.

===Critical reception===
The film received positive reviews in The Netherlands from critics and opened strongly.&lt;ref name="StrongOpening"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ad.nl/show/brimstone-is-kaskraker-beste-opening-voor-koolhoven-ooit~a5fc40bd/ |title=Brimstone opens strongly |accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InterviewFanning"/&gt;

Koolhoven won the Gouden Pen (Golden Pen) for the screenplay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netwerkscenario.nl/newsItems/martin-koolhoven-ontvangt-gouden-pen-voor-scenario-brimstone/ |title=Koolhoven wins Golden Pen for Brimstone |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |dead-url=yes}} {{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gouden Film]] (Golden Film) for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/nieuws/nieuws-januari-2017/gouden-film-voor-brimstone/ |title=Koolhoven wins Golden Film for Brimstone |accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

29 September 2017 ''Brimstone'' won six [[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calves]] (often called ''"The Dutch Oscars"'') at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]], breaking the old record of four.&lt;ref name="BreakingRecord"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ad.nl/film/brimstone-breekt-record-met-zes-gouden-kalveren~va943b799// |title=Brimstone breaks record |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the positive reception in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nu.nl/film/4383513/recensieoverzicht-nederlandse-recensenten-indruk-van-brimstone.html/ |title=Dutch reviewers impressed by Brimstone |accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nu.nl/film/4316381/recensieoverzicht-brimstone-traag-maar-overtuigend.html/ |title=Reception after Venice Film Festival |accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; American reviews for the film were mixed. On [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], though no Critics Consensus has yet been reached, the film has a rating of 39% based on 46 reviews and the average rating is 4.9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brimstone_2016/ | title=Brimstone | accessdate=March 15, 2017 | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average score]] out of 100 from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 44 based on 16 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/brimstone/ | title=Brimstone | accessdate=March 7, 2017 | website=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; wrote "''Brimstone'' is raw and very powerful filmmaking, a movie that can't help but get under your skin," ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote it was "highfalutin exploitation," blaming it on the Netherlands, writing "It is, after all, a country that ever since the 1960s, especially in Amsterdam, has profferred a more liberal view than almost any other place of what might euphemistically be termed 'youthful sexuality."&lt;ref name="Film Review: Brimstone"/&gt;

The [[Political Film Society]] has nominated ''Brimstone'' as best film on human rights of 2017.

The movie was released in the [[United Kingdom]] 29 September 2017 and, like in other European countries, was very well received &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/boulevard/entertainment/brimstone-goed-ontvangen-door-britse-pers/ |title=Brimstone goed ontvangen door Britse pers |trans-title=Brimstone well-received by British press |accessdate=September 27, 2017 |publisher=RTL Nieuws |language=nl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007170435/https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/boulevard/entertainment/brimstone-goed-ontvangen-door-britse-pers/# |archive-date=7 October 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire Magazine]]'' gave it four stars and called it "white-knuckle tense",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/brimstone/review/ |title=Brimstone Review |publisher=Empire Magazine |accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Hollywood News'' called it "one of the most visceral and intense western thrillers of all time" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2017/09/25/brimstone-review |title=‘''Brimstone''’ Review: Dir. Martin Koolhoven (2017) |publisher=Hollywood New Review |accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Bradshaw]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "This epically long, lurid, violent western from Dutch film-maker Martin Koolhoven has a kind of Tarantino-ish prolixity and narrative ingenuity. Despite its very indulgent length, it never bores." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/27/brimstone-review-guy-pearce-dakota-fanning-martin-koolhoven?CMP=share_btn_tw/ |title=Brimstone review – Guy Pearce outrageously operatic in grisly and gripping western |author=Peter Bradshaw |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12493">The '''Brittle Books Program''' is an initiative carried out by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] at the request of the United States Congress. The initiative began officially between 1988 and 1989 with the intention to involve the eventual [[microform|microfilming]] of over 3 million endangered volumes.

== Purpose ==
In the beginning half of the 20th century it became apparent that the use of acidic [[wood-pulp paper]], common since the 1850s, was causing paper materials to slowly burn. This has been referred to as the [[slow fire]]. A statement submitted to the House of Representatives estimated that there were 80 million brittle books in North American libraries, 12 million of which were unique titles. As [[mass deacidification]] efforts proved costly and inconsistent, librarians and archivists began looking for more practical ways to preserve the intellectual content of the decaying material. Microfilm, one of the most stable and durable mediums around at the time, was decided to be the most reasonable alternative.

== Timeline ==
*1987 - A subcommittee of the House of Representatives during the 100th Congress (1st session) addressed the problem of "brittle books in our nation's libraries."
*March 17, 1988 - [[Patricia Battin]], president of the Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA), testified before the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies (Committee on Appropriations).  She proposed a collaborative approach to the preservation of the nation's brittle books and asked the House to increase federal funding for preservation microfilming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhalliance.org/testimony/1988/88testimony-pbattin.html# |title=NHA Testimony: Patricia M.

*October, 1988 - An appropriations bill for fiscal year 1989 gave the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] $12.5 million. Eight million dollars of that sum went to instituting a twenty-year program for the microfilming of endangered volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/timeline.html Timeline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*1995 - The program was assessed to be on schedule and 25% complete.{{Citation needed|reason=who assessed the program?|date=August 2009}}
*Roughly 50,000 brittle and endangered volumes are microfilmed each year.

==Important figures==
[[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] was a pioneer conservator in the [[library science]] field. He connected the paper strength or lack thereof (brittle paper)to the acidity of the groundwood used to make [[wood pulp]] after the 1850s.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;.{{cite web |author1=Timoth Barrett |author2=Cynthia Mosier |year=1994 |url=http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v13/bp13-02.html|title=The Role of Gelatin in Paper Permanency II|publisher=American Institute for Conservation.}}The Book and Paper Annual vol.13&lt;/ref&gt; 
With his own observations of his collection and tests conducted, he announced to the library community that acid deterioration begins to show signs after 20,40 and 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrow|first1=William J.|title=Permanence/Durability of the book-VI: Spot testing for unstable modern book and record papers.|date=1969|publisher=W. J.Barrow Research Laboratory, Inc|page=11|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED031265|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
As with other [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] programs, the Brittle Books Program is a partnership program, meaning that qualifying institutions must apply for grants in order to participate. Should the institution be accepted, they are required to share at least 33% of the program's costs. Unlike other [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] preservation funding initiatives, the Brittle Books program does require that an institution in each state must be awarded a grant. The projects are largely run at the state level with the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] providing methodologies, assuring a standard level of quality, and connecting the efforts of the various institutions. To be awarded a grant as part of the Brittle Books Program, institutions were required to abide by five basic conditions:
*1. That they abide by the national standard
*2. That they create three copies of all material: a master negative, a print negative, and a service copy
*3. That a record adhering to national standards be entered into a national bibliographic database
*4. That interlibrary loan copies be readily available
*5. That storage conditions meet that of the national standard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhalliance.org/testimony/1995/95testimony-pbattin.html# |title=NHA Testimony: Patricia M.

== Preservation issues ==

===Deacidification===
While there is a deacidification&lt;ref&gt;[[Mass deacidification]]&lt;/ref&gt; method that can successfully lower the acidity in brittle books, many public libraries do not have the funding to implement standard programs to halt the deterioration taking place in these institutions.  Some repositories have the resources to send books for a deacidification wash in stages.

Deacidification washes are usually a viable option for most repositories as books can be sent in bulk; however, only books of excellent physical quality may be sent.  The wash process is rather aggressive and any deformities in a book may cause damage to already brittle specimens.  Therefore, libraries would have to first repair those books in less than desirable condition - specifically elements of the binding, leaf attachments, and text attachments - before deacidification.  These extra conservation efforts would increase the costs of deacidification.

===Paper splitting===
Another option to preserve brittle books is to perform [[paper splitting]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/papertreng.html MDEP Paper Strengthening Pilot Program 2003-2005 (Preservation, Library of Congress)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526155014/http://www.loc.gov/preserv/papertreng.html |date=May 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process dissects a book by its leaf and text attachment and treats each sheet of paper individually.  Supervised by a book conservator, a paper conservator, and a conservation specialist, pages are literally pulled apart - fronts from backs - and a piece of alkaline paper is placed in between.  The acid pages are then sandwiched back together with a non-acid buffer between them to slow the deterioration process.  However, only ZFB (the Zentrum für Bucherhaltung)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zfb.com/en_version.php Mass Deacidification and Conservation for Libraries, Archives and Museums from one source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; offers this procedure (also called mechanical paper splitting).  They claim the process is so refined, they have successfully split cigarette paper. Washes will de-acidify the paper though they will remain brittle; but paper splitting increases the strength and flexibility of the paper via the extra new sheet of buffered paper and the ZFB process includes de-acidification washes.&lt;ref&gt;Brückle, I. and Dambrogio, J.[http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic39-03-001_indx.html "Paper splitting: History and modern technology"] "[[Journal of the American Institute for Conservation]]", 2000.  Retrieved on 2008-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bansa, H. and Ishii, R. [https://www.uni-muenster.de/Forum-Bestandserhaltung/downloads/pfest-bansa.pdf "The Effect of Different Strengthening Methods on Different Kinds of Paper"]. "[[Restaurator]]", 1997. Retrieved on 2008-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liers, L., Wächter, W., and Müller, G. "Results of the paper splitting process." "[[Restaurator]]",1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microform===
Microform is a reasonable option for Brittle Book preservation mainly because microfilm can be usable for 500 years, so long as it is stored in proper conditions and a microfilm reader is accessible.  Even [[microform|microfiche]] is easier to store than microfilm, provided organizational practices prevent the divestment of sheets from their filing system. Despite its proven record of durability, microform is no longer a preferred method of digitization because it lacks the accessibility that modern electronic digitization provides.

===Digitization===
Digital conversion of physical items is the preferred method, despite an estimated five-year longevity for most computer files.  As proper archival-quality digitization requires use of large, uncompressed [[TIFF]] files, storage can be a significant cost, especially for public libraries. Moreover, copyright law restrains the ability to digitize all brittle books. While the library is authorized to make a copy of a book it cannot obtain through reasonable means, having a digital copy offers the possibility of unauthorized distribution if circulated in this format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byauth/oakley/brittle.html Copyright and Preservation-Brittle Books Preservation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photocopies===
Many repositories, such as the University of Kansas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/BrittleBooks.shtml KU Libraries: Brittle Books Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723190614/http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/BrittleBooks.shtml |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opt for preservation-quality photocopies.  A list-serv&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/Brittle.shtml KU Libraries: Brittle Books Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903072543/http://www.lib.ku.edu/preservation/Brittle.shtml |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is utilized for the posting of titles so a consortium of libraries can benefit from a reduced cost in replication so they may maintain their circulating collections.  Maintained by OCLC, the submissions are processed at the OCLC Preservation Service Center and OCLC retains the digital copies produced as to defer any copyright issues away from the repositories subscribing to the service.

== Future ==
As libraries move into the digital era, preservation practices attempt to move with them. Current and future projects in preserving brittle volumes are more likely to involve scanning and digitization than microfilming. A recent example of such a program is the ''Digitizing America's Imprints'' project at the [[Library of Congress]] which received a $2 million grant in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-02-01-digitizing-brittle-books_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=A $2M grant will digitize brittle books | date=2007-02-01 | accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Un signari celtibèric oriental.jpg|thumb|250px|An eastern Celtiberian signary]]

The '''Celtiberian script''' is a [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic script]] that was the main [[writing system]] of the [[Celtiberian language]], an extinct [[Continental Celtic]] language, which was also occasionally written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. This script is a direct adaptation of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the most frequently used of the [[Iberian scripts]].

==Origins==
All the [[Paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic values for the [[stop consonant]]s, and monophonemic values for the rest of [[consonants]] and [[vowels]]. They are thus to be classed as neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]]; rather, they are mixed scripts normally identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. There is no agreement about how the [[paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries]] originated; some researchers conclude that they derive only from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] was also involved.

==Tipology and variants==
The basic Celtiberian signary contains 26 [[sign (linguistics)|signs]] rather than the 28 signs of the original model, the [[northeastern Iberian script]], since the [[Celtiberians]] omitted one of the two [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] and one of the three [[Nasal consonant|nasals]]. The remaining 26 signs comprised 5 [[vowel]]s, 15 syllabic signs and 6 consonants (one [[Lateral consonant|lateral]], two [[sibilants]], one rhotic and two nasals). The sign equivalent to Iberian ''s'' is transcribed as ''z'' in Celtiberian, because it is assumed that it sometimes expresses the fricative result of an ancient dental stop (''d''), while the Iberian sign ''ś'' is transcribed as ''s''. As for the use of the nasal signs, there are two variants of the Celtiberian script: In the eastern variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''ḿ'', while in the western variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign ''m''. This is interpreted as evidence of a double origin of the Celtiberian script. Like one variant of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the western variant of Celtiberian shows evidence{{which|date=March 2014}} of having allowed the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[Stop consonant|stops]] ''g'' and ''d'' to be differentiated from their respective [[voicelessness|voiceless]] counterparts, ''k'' and ''t'', by adding a stroke to the voiceless signs. This is known as the ‘dual system’ in Paleohispanic scripts, which otherwise do not distinguish between pairs of voiceless and voiced stops (''p:b, t:d'' and ''k:g'').

==Location of findings==
The Celtiberian inscriptions have been found mainly in the [[Ebro]] valley and near the sources of the [[Tagus]] and [[Douro]] rivers, where [[ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sources place the Celtiberian people. The Celtiberian inscriptions were made on different types of objects ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], [[ceramic]] receptacles, [[bronze]] plaques and [[tessera]]s, [[amphora|amphores]], stones, [[spindle (textiles)|spindle-whorls]], etc.). There are just under two hundred surviving inscriptions, one of which is exceptionally long: the third [[Botorrita]] bronze plaque ([[Zaragoza]]) with more than three thousand signs containing a census of nearly 250 people. Almost always the direction of the writing is left to right. The fact that nearly all the Celtiberian inscriptions were found out of archaeological context does not allow a precise chronology to be established, but it seems that the earliest inscriptions in the Celtiberian script date from the 2nd century BCE while the latest ones date from the 1st century BCE.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">A '''chief creative officer''' ('''CCO''') is the highest ranking position of the creative team within a company. Depending on the type of company, this position may be responsible for the overall look and feel of [[marketing]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[brand]]ing associated with the organization. The CCO may also be charged with managing, developing, and leading the team of [[creative director]]s, [[art director]]s, [[designer]]s, and [[copywriter]]s.

==Overall description==
The CCO directs a company's creative output, developing the artistic design strategy that defines the company's brand.&lt;ref name="do"&gt;Written By: Terry Masters, Edited By: Allegra J. Lingo [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-chief-creative-officer-do.htm "What Does a Chief Creative Officer Do"], 14 October 2014, Retrieved on 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The CCO creates the unique image of the firm and deliver this distinctive design to consumers and to create a clear [[brand image]] which is a fundamental and essential work throughout the company. Advertisements present a certain memorable artistic design while also structured to accomplish functional goals. The CCO ensures that the design and functionality combine harmoniously so the firm can present a product that successfully represents its creative brand.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

CCOs, in some cases are called [[creative directors]], are demanded in firms which involve creative thinking and artistic design. The position of generic head of marketing is usually replaced by chief creative officer in advertising firms.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt; The power of chief creative officer can even be compared to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and at the early stages of a small company, usually at the start of [[partnerships]], the CCO and the CEO manage jointly.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

'''Cong Abbey''' also known as the Royal Abbey of Cong, is a historic site located at [[Cong (Mayo)|Cong]], on the borders of counties [[County Galway|Galway]] and [[County Mayo|Mayo]], in [[Ireland]]'s province of [[Connacht]]. The ruins of the former [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] abbey mostly date to the 13th century and have been described as featuring some of finest examples of medieval ecclesiastical architecture in Ireland.

==History==
In the early 7th century, a church was built at this site, reportedly by [[Saint Feichin]]. A later building was destroyed by fire in 1114. Within the next twenty years or so, [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair|Turlough Mor O’Connor]], the [[High King of Ireland]], refounded the abbey.&lt;ref name="Cong"/&gt; Raiders from [[Munster]] destroyed the buildings in 1137 but they were rebuilt by King Turlough.&lt;ref name="Survey1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mayolibrary.ie/en/LocalStudies/IrishTouristAssociationSurvey/CongandTheNeale/CongAbbey/PDFDocument,16111,en.pdf|title=Irish Tourist Association Survey of 1945: Cong Abbey|publisher=Mayo County Library| date= |first= |last= |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbey was refounded as an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] settlement in 1138. It was one of the earliest Augustinian settlements south of [[Armagh]] which was founded in 1126.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Around and About Cong|last=Robert|first=Scott|publisher=Kinlough Press|year=2017|location=Cong|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1198, his son, [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]] (Rory O'Connor), Ireland's last High King, constructed new buildings and also lived the last 15 years of his life at the abbey.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Wilde|Sir W. Wilde]] ''Lough Corrib'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He died here and was reportedly briefly buried in the abbey before being exhumed and re-interred at [[Clonmacnoise]].&lt;ref name="Cong"/&gt;

Cong Abbey was also closely associated with the [[Duffy (surname)|O'Duffy family]] at least from 1097 to 1501.&lt;ref name="Survey1"/&gt; The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] record that in 1150, [[Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh]], [[Archbishop]] of [[Connacht]], died at Cong aged 75.
&lt;ref name="CELT"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://celt.ucc.ie/publishd.html|title=Annals of the Four Masters at Corpus of Electronic Texts (CELT)|publisher=UCC| date= |first= |last= |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name is inscribed upon the processional [[Cross of Cong]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Stokes|Stokes, Margaret]]. Early Christian Art in Ireland. Part 1. London: Chapman and Hall Limited, 1887–1894&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Normans|Norman]] knight, [[William de Burgh]], attacked Cong in 1203, and again the abbey was rebuilt.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In the 1307 the abbey was reconstructed and dedicated to [[St Mary]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cong Abbey was suppressed sometime after 1542 and later fell into ruins.&lt;ref name="Survey1"/&gt;

The last (nominal) abbot was Father [[Patrick Prendergast (abbot)|Patrick Prendergast]], parish priest of Cong from 1795 until his death in 1829. He was the preserver of the [[Cross of Cong]]. After his death, the cross was bought by [[James MacCullagh]] for the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref name="Survey1"/&gt;

The first restoration of the abbey was started by [[Benjamin Guinness]] in 1855, soon after he had bought nearby [[Ashford Castle]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Cong"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.congtourism.com/cngabbey.htm |title=Cong Abbey|publisher=Cong Tourism| date= |first= |last= |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The remains of Cong Abbey have been praised as featuring some of the finest examples of early gothic architecture and masonry in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Cong"/&gt; The present church, and possibly the fragmentary cloister where the monks worked and prayed, belong to the rebuilding of the early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Survey1"/&gt; The north doorway of the church, and the elaborate doorways that open onto the cloister from the east range of the monastery, may pre-date the attack by William de Burgo. The doorway with two fine windows on either side belongs to the chapter house, where the monastery’s daily business was conducted as well as a chapter of the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|rule]] being read each day. This was also where the community gathered to confess their sins publicly. The sculpture in the abbey, which is some of the finest in Ireland, suggests links to French styles of the period.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The grounds of the abbey also contain a monks’ fishing house, probably built in the 15th or 16th century,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} on an island in the River Cong leading towards nearby [[Lough Corrib]]. The house is built on a platform of stones over a small arch which allows the river to flow underneath the floor. There is a trapdoor in the floor in which the fish may have been kept fresh. According to local tradition, a line was connected from the fishing house to the monastery kitchen to alert the cook to fresh fish.&lt;ref name="Survey1"/&gt;

==Today==
Cong Abbey is a national monument in the care of the [[Office of Public Works|Commissioners for Public Works]].

A '''flea circus''' is a [[circus (performing art)|circus]] [[sideshow]] attraction in which [[flea]]s are attached (or appear to be attached) to miniature carts and other items, and encouraged to perform circus acts within a small housing.

== History ==
[[File:The Go-As-You-Please Race, as seen through a Magnifying Glass.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|"The Go-As-You-Please Race, as seen through a Magnifying Glass", engraved by J. G. Francis, from an article by [[Charles Frederick Holder|C. F. Holder]] in ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'', 1886]]

The first records of flea performances were from [[watchmaker]]s who were demonstrating their metalworking skills. In 1578, Mark Scaliot produced a lock and chain that were attached to a flea. The first recorded flea circus dates back to the early 1820s, when an Italian impresario called Louis Bertolotto advertised an “extraordinary exhibition of industrious fleas” on [[Regent Street]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawton |first=Graham |last2= |first2= |date=22 December 2012|title=Fleadom or death: Reviving the glorious flea circus |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |volume= |issue=2896 |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some flea circuses persisted in very small venues in the United States as late as the 1960s. The flea circus at [[Belle Vue Zoological Gardens]], Manchester, England, was still operating in 1970. At least one genuine flea circus still performs (at the annual [[Oktoberfest]] in Munich, Germany&lt;ref name="Birk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flohcirkus.de/geschichte |title=Geschichte |publisher=Flohcirkus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Svensons in the UK occasionally use real fleas, but most flea circuses are a sideline of magicians and clowns, and use electrical or mechanical effects instead of real fleas.

== Techniques with real fleas ==

Fleas typically live only for a few months and are not trained.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  Fleas are observed to see if they have a predisposition for jumping or walking. Once sorted, they are harnessed by carefully wrapping a thin gold wire around their neck.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', May 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the harness, the fleas usually stay in it for life. The harnesses are attached to the props and the strong legs of the flea allow them to move objects significantly larger than themselves. Jumping fleas are used for kicking small lightweight balls. They are carefully given a ball; when they try to jump away (which is not possible because of the harness), they shoot the ball instead. Running fleas can pull small carts and vehicles or rotate a [[Ferris wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Hund, Katze, Maus. 10 February 2010 VOX&lt;/ref&gt;

There are historical reports of fleas glued to the base of the flea circus enclosure. Miniature musical instruments were then glued to the flea performers and the enclosure was heated. The fleas fought to escape, giving the impression of playing instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noonco.com/flea/faq.htm |title=Flea-Circus.com |publisher=Noonco.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques without real fleas ==

Some flea circuses may appear to use real fleas, but in fact do not. A variety of electrical, magnetic, and mechanical devices have been used to augment exhibits. In some cases, these mechanisms are responsible for all of the "acts", with loose fleas in the exhibit maintaining the illusion. These circuses are known as "Humbug" flea circuses. [[Michael Bentine]] gave a mechanical flea circus a regular slot on his television show, ''[[It's a Square World]]'' in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2LF04Y9n5hJTHK1l6ffLhPc/the-rise-and-demise-of-the-flea-circus |title=The rise and demise of the flea circus |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=BBC Radio4 |publisher=BBC |access-date=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much the same way that viewers know that a woman will not actually be [[Sawing a woman in half|cut in half]], the magician's showmanship allows viewers to [[Suspension of disbelief|suspend disbelief]] in order to enjoy the show.

[[File:Gcina Mhlope 5.jpg|thumb|Gcina Mhlophe at the ''Festival Internacional de Poesía de Medellín'' in 2016]]
'''Nokugcina Elsie Mhlophe''' (born 24 October 1958 &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sahistory.org.za/this_day/24/10  This Day in History | South African History Online ] &lt;/ref&gt; ) is a well-known [[South Africa]]n [[anti-apartheid activist]], actress, [[storytelling|storyteller]], poet, playwright, director and author. Storytelling is a deeply traditional activity in Africa and Mhlophe is one of the few woman storytellers in a country dominated by males. She does her work through charismatic performances, working to preserve storytelling as a means of keeping history alive and encouraging South African children to read. She tells her stories in four of South Africa's languages: English, [[Afrikaans]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]].

==Life and career==
Gcina was born in 1958 in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] to a [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] mother and a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] father. She started her working life as a domestic servant, later working as a newsreader at the [[Press Trust]] and [[BBC Radio]], then as a writer for ''[[Learn and Teach]]'', a magazine for newly-literate people.

She began to get a sense of the demand for stories while in Chicago in 1988. She performed at a library in a mostly-black neighbourhood, where an ever-growing audience kept inviting her back. Still, Mhlophe only began to think of storytelling as a career after meeting an [[Imbongi]], one of the legendary poets of African folklore, and after encouragement by [[Mannie Manim]], the then-director of the [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]], [[Johannesburg]].

Since then Mhlophe has appeared in theatres from [[Soweto]] to London and much of her work has been translated into [[German language|German]], French, Italian, [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and Japanese. Mhlophe has travelled extensively in Africa and other parts of the world giving storytelling workshops.

Mhlophe's stories meld folklore, information, current affairs, song and [[idiom]]. The realisation of her dreams is a visceral motivator for her and she is passing on her infectious enthusiasm by developing young talent to carry forward the work of storytelling through the [[Zanendaba]] (''Bring me a story'') Initiative. This initiative, established in 2002, is a collaboration with the Market Theatre and [[READ Educational Trust|READ]], a national literacy organization.

Mhlophe currently serves as the patron of the ASSITEJ South Africa, the International Association for Theatre for Children and Young People.

==History==

===1898-1925 (Formation through retirement of Adolf GUND)===
[[File:GUND_Logo_compilation.jpg|thumb|right|Progression of GUND logos from inception through 2016.]]
GUND was founded in 1898 by Adolf Gund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Frank|last2=Augustyn|first2=Frederick J.|last3=J.|first3=Martin|title=Dictionary of Toys and Games in American Popular Culture|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135418465|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdJEAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT117&amp;dq=%22Jacob+Swedlin%22+%2B+GUND&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilg_uygJzNAhUEWxoKHRnwBmkQ6AEINTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jacob%20Swedlin%22%20%2B%20GUND&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Germany]] and resided in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]] before settling in New York City.&lt;ref name="AllAboutExaminer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meehan|first1=Meagan|title=All about GUND|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=The Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started GUND as a small toy and novelty company which was incorporated under the name Gund Manufacturing Company in 1910. In the early years, GUND used GEE as the company slogan in advertising on product labels. GUND produced its first products in [[Factory|loft factories]] around New York City. It moved from location to location as it expanded, starting off on [[Third Avenue]] and eventually moving to [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan|Ninth Street]] by 1922. The moves were all prompted by the need for larger manufacturing quarters.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raiffe|first1=Bruce S.|last2=Raiffe|first2=Alex Baron|title=GUND|date=2005|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9780738537108}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the early 1900s, GUND received numerous patents that introduced various [[Mechanical toy|mechanisms]] into plush toys.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt; Once such patent was for what was described as a "springing dog." The design called for a mechanism to be placed inside the stuffed animal which would cause it to jump, "bringing it to life." Another patent was for a walking mechanism which allowed the plush to walk. One of the company's most notable patents was for a "ride-on duck" which was a duck for children to ride on.&lt;ref name="AGBRands"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gotta Getta GUND|url=http://www.americasgreatestbrands.com/volume5/pdf/gund.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=America's Greatest Brands}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had wheels that operated a working duck bill which moved up and down as the wheels turned. The ride-on duck was produced by GUND for approximately 10 years commencing in 1912.&lt;ref name="AGBRands"/&gt; GUND also secured many other patents for toys such as the wind-up walking plush, dancing toys, and walking toys.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt;

GUND created many of the industry standards in its early years, including safety standards and the manufacturing processes for toys.&lt;ref name="AmericanToy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Sharon M.|title=Toys and American Culture: An Encyclopedia|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313351112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbTUorcuXkoC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Jacob+Swedlin%22+%2B+GUND&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilg_uygJzNAhUEWxoKHRnwBmkQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jacob%20Swedlin%22%20%2B%20GUND&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to market its products under the moniker GEE up until the late 1920s, as evidenced in various advertisements in Playthings and other toy magazines. The company was eventually sold when Adolf Gund retired in 1925.&lt;ref name="OrlandSent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kovel|first1=Ralph|last2=Kovel|first2=Terry|title=Changing times|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-04-02/business/KOVEL02_1_daylight-early-clocks-patent-numbers|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=2 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1925-1968 (New ownership and expansion)===

During the early years of the company, Adolf Gund was the mentor to Jacob Swedlin, a Russian immigrant who came to the United States in 1907.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt; Gund taught Swedlin to become a cutter and pattern maker, teaching him the ins and outs of the company. When Gund retired in 1925, he sold the company to Swedlin for $1,500.&lt;ref name="ICompanyDirect"/&gt; Swedlin brought his brothers Abe and John on board with the company, which began rapid expansion.&lt;ref name="AmericanToy"/&gt; Jacob oversaw design and production, Abe acted as the chief financial officer, and John ran sales and promotions.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt;
 
Some of the most notable GUND products in the 1930s included its line of [[Easter Bunny|Easter Bunnies]] which continue to be one of its most popular products. It also introduced "puppy purses," a stuffed animal dog that doubled as a purse. GUND also became the first licensor of cartoon characters, producing plush toy versions of [[Popeye]], [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Felix the Cat]], and [[Tigger]].&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt; Its relationship with The Walt Disney Company began in 1947 and contributed to expansion of GUND.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gund stuffed animals go into a museum display|url=http://stuffedparty.com/gund-stuffed-animals-go-into-a-museum-display/|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=Stuffed Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal with Disney allowed GUND to supply every major toy retailer in the United States with licensed Disney merchandise.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt;

In the 1940s, GUND received [[Registered trademark symbol|trade mark registrations]] for two versions of its logos, both of which can be seen on its products during that time. One of the logos was a lower-case "g" with bunny ears which became synonymous with the company and its products. The popularity of the logo sparked the creation of a new plush character known as "GUNDy." GUNDy became the company mascot and grew into merchandising that included the "GUND Club."&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt;
 
During World War II in the early 1940s, GUND did not manufacture its products according to prior demand.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt; To support the war effort, GUND only offered its products on a quota allotment. It also produced a doll in an army uniform as its way to encourage the purchase of war bonds. After the war, GUND began rapid expansion, releasing new products, including many new Disney characters in conjunction with the opening of Disneyland in California in 1955.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt; It moved into a new manufacturing center in Brooklyn in 1957, a location that would produce its toys until 1974.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt;

===1969-1990 (Further expansion &amp; the Raiffe family)===

By 1969, GUND had become dependent on its licensing agreement with Disney for the majority of its business.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt; Herbert Raiffe, the son-in-law of John Swedlin, became the company president in 1969 after Swedlin's passing.&lt;ref name="AmericanToy"/&gt; Raiffe began moving GUND away from its licensing agreements and shifted the focus to internal design. The company launched new products that included the "Bag Full of Laughs," a sound mechanism placed in a fabric sack and sewn into a plush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selling Happiness - An Editorial Diary|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19701208&amp;id=rt09AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LkgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2756,1516144&amp;hl=en|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=The Glasgow Herald|date=8 December 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the 1970s, GUND expanded its product line by releasing toys and plush popular in other countries.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt; This included beanies and Gonk toys. In 1972, GUND was able to expand again thanks to [[Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing]], two panda bears gifted to the United States from [[China]] as part of that country's [[panda diplomacy]] efforts. The plush industry had a huge demand for panda stuffed animals, with GUND leading the way with manufacturing and distribution. Raiffe was credited by publications such as [[Forbes]] for GUND marketing efforts of the bears.&lt;ref name="GUNDBook"/&gt;

The 1980s brought about one of GUND's most prominent branding campaigns, known as "Gotta Getta GUND."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gund Creatures to Take First TV Bow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPIdAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Gotta+Getta+GUND%22&amp;dq=%22Gotta+Getta+GUND%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi43oTYg5zNAhUOLlIKHf3ZCyEQ6AEIQTAE|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=Ad Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is credited as making GUND one of the most recognized toy companies in the United States.&lt;ref name="AmericanToy"/&gt; During this decade, GUND also expanded its offering of stuffed bears, releasing its collectible series of bears called the Signature Collection. Each bear was signed by the Rita Raiffe, GUND’s Director of Design and sold in limited quantities. In 1986 it released 60 new items, the most ever since the company was formed.&lt;ref name="Higbeamplushspeaks"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leccese|first1=Donna|title=Plush speaks a new language; electronic technology, new characters, add spark to $585 million category.|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4264283.html|accessdate=8 May 2016|publisher=Playthings|date=1 June 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990-2014 (100th Anniversary and postage stamp)===
 
In 1993, Bruce Raiffe became President of GUND.&lt;ref name="GAAccessHB"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weissenberger|first1=Mark|title=Meet Bruce Raiffe, president of Gund Inc., Edison, N.J.(Interview)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20399491.html|accessdate=8 May 2016|publisher=Gifts &amp; Decorative Accessories|date=1 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that time he served as the company's Marketing Director and later Vice President.&lt;ref name="WNDHiheam"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edelman|first1=Renee|title=Plush toys mean plush bucks|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-3871714.html|accessdate=8 May 2016|publisher=World Net Daily|date=29 July 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Del Vescovo|first1=Rosemarie|title=Plush makers seek niche in crowded marketplace.

GUND celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1998.&lt;ref name="HMTribnue100"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pagan|first1=Marcos|title=Special bear gest charities $100,000|publisher=Home News Tribune|date=21 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the celebration, GUND auctioned off a 100th anniversary bear which raised $100,000 for four children's charities.&lt;ref name="HMTribnue100"/&gt; The bear was one-of-a-kind and purchased by Yoshihiro Sekiguchi who placed it in one of three [[Teddy bear museum]]s he owned in Japan.&lt;ref name="HMTribnue100"/&gt; It was the 100th anniversary of the [[Theodore Roosevelt]] "teddy bear" that brought about GUND's next milestone.&lt;ref name="Gundstamp"&gt;{{cite news|title=GUND bear to grace new U.S. Postal Service 37-Cent stamp|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87781362.html|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=Gifts &amp; Decorative Accessories|date=1 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[United States Postal Service]] used a 1948 teddy bear of GUND  to grace a 37 cent stamp in honor of the event.&lt;ref name="Gundstamp"/&gt;
 
GUND entered into a licensing agreement with [[Sesame Street]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="HATsesame"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sesame Beginnings line to debut at JPMA|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-117115656.html|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=Home Accents Today|date=1 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008-present (Purchase by Enesco and beyond)===
 
GUND was purchased by [[Enesco]], the giftware manufacturer best known for its line of [[Precious Moments, Inc.|Precious Moments]] figurines.&lt;ref name="EnecsoCawuicw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Evelyn|title=Enesco Acquires Gund Business|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1527765161.html|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=NJBIZ|date=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; GUND joined Enesco's other recently purchased brands which included [[Boyds Bears]], Our Name is Mud, philoSphie's and Jubilee Art.&lt;ref name="EnecsoCawuicw"/&gt; Bruce Raiffe remained with the company on a consultant type basis, but returned in 2011 when he was again appointed president of GUND.&lt;ref name="ECupRaifePres"&gt;{{cite news|title=Enesco Appoints Bruce Raiffe President of Gund|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-249192920.html|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=Entertainment Close-up|date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
GUND continued to take on new licensing agreements after being purchased by Enesco. One of the most notable was that of the [[Uglydolls]] line of plush toys which it signed in 2012.&lt;ref name="KtodaUggly"&gt;{{cite news|title=GUND signs licensing deal to make Uglydoll plush|url=http://www.kidstodayonline.com/article/405025-gund-signs-licensing-deal-to-make-uglydoll-plush|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=Kids Today|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year it signed an agreement for ''[[Boo (dog)|Boo, the World's Cutest Dog]]''.&lt;ref name="BloomCatCraze"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mosendz|first1=Polly|title=How an Internet Cat Craze Became a Toy Empire|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-14/how-an-internet-cat-craze-became-a-toy-empire|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=Bloomberg|date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also added ''[[Grumpy Cat]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Pusheen]]'' in 2014.&lt;ref name="GDecorGrump"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gund Signs on for Grumpy Cat Plush|url=http://www.giftsanddec.com/article/380797-gund-signs-on-for-grumpy-cat-plush|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=Gifts and Dec|date=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbian1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mosendz|first1=Polly|title=Internet cat craze becomes toy empire|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/mar/20/internet-cat-craze-becomes-toy-empire/|accessdate=26 May 2016|publisher=The Columbian|date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
GUND went through rebranding in late 2015. It included a redesigned logo that reflects its signature plush toys. This new identity system was designed by a NYC-based digital branding agency Cynda	Media Lab, and it received several national and international design awards, including 2016 Communication Arts Design Annual Award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeh and Shin’s Cynda Media Lab Wins Communication Arts Design Award|url=http://news.fitnyc.edu/2016/09/22/yeh-and-shins-cynda-media-lab-wins-communication-arts-design-award/|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=FIT Newsroom|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 2017 HOW Logo Design Award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Logo Design Awards: 8th Annual Winner Galleries|url=http://www.howdesign.com/design-creativity/8th-annual-logo-design-awards-winner-galleries/|accessdate=31 July 2017|publisher=HOW Design|date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 2017 iF Design Award, and 2017 A'Design Award. It also released more than 200 new items as part of its 2016 campaign. It was in late 2015 that Enesco was purchased by private equity fund Balmoral Funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balmoral Acquires Enesco|url=http://www.giftsanddec.com/article/525620-balmoral-acquires-enesco|accessdate=9 June 2016|publisher=Gifts &amp; Dec|date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GUND's most recent campaign is for a charitable cause that involves "giving huggable joy to children in need," and incorporating social media with the hashtag #howdoyouhug &lt;ref&gt;http://gund.com/pages/history&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

GUND is the manufacturer of plush stuffed animals. It sells over 1500 products including Gund, Baby Gund, Gund Bears, [[Gund Snuffles]] teddy bears, and Gund Holiday.

'''Just Buffalo Literary Center''' (JBLC) is a not-for-profit literary organization centered in [[Buffalo, NY]] which serves the greater [[Western New York]] region as a prominent literary curator. Just Buffalo Literary Center’s mission is to create and strengthen communities through the literary arts. And for more than 40 years, Just Buffalo Literary Center has brought the world’s greatest writers to Buffalo, hosted poetry events, and readings, and supported the development of young writers.

Just Buffalo Literary Center's business office is currently located above the Western New York Book Arts Center on Washington Street.

==History==
===Inception===
Just Buffalo began in 1975 when founder Debora Ott hosted a reading featuring Diane di Prima at the Allentown Community Center. In the following years, notable authors and poets such as [[Robert Creeley]], [[Ed Dorn]], [[Alice Notley]], [[Maureen Owen]], and [[Ted Berrigan]] came to Buffalo to participate in readings offered by what had by then become "Just Buffalo".
The organization proceeded to host writing workshops for writers of all-ages and published a literary magazine. It also had a radio show.

===Continued growth===
In 1982, Just Buffalo Literary Center established its renowned Writers in Education program, providing in-school creative writing programs for young people. At their peak, this program served approximately 4,000 students per year. After more than two decades of stewarding community-based literary programs and establishing Just Buffalo Literary Center as a national presence on the literary scene, Debora left the organization in 1998. She hired Michael Kelleher as Artistic Director in the months before she left. Ed Taylor served as Executive Director from 1998-2001.

===2002-present===
Laurie Dean Torrell took over as Executive Director in 2002, ushering in a new era. During her tenure, Just Buffalo Literary Center has experienced an extraordinary expansion. It moved from the Tri-Main Center to the Market Arcade Building in 2005, a change which marked the beginning of a groundbreaking administrative collaboration with CEPA and Big Orbit Galleries. All three organizations benefited from this long-term effort that involves shared resources and staff as well as a joint education effort, Writing With Light. In 2016, Just Buffalo Literary Center moved from the Market Arcade Building to its current home on the second floor at the corner of Washington and Mohawk in downtown Buffalo.

Just Buffalo Literary Center's program office staff currently consists of Laurie Dean Torrell, Executive Director; Barbara Cole, Artistic Director; Noah Falck, Education Director; Kristen Pope, Development Director.

==Programs==
===BABEL===

BABEL is an international literary lecture series that brings notable authors to Buffalo to speak four times per year. It is cosponsored by [[Hallwalls]]. It was conceived of in 2006 by Michael Kelleher, who was at the time Just Buffalo's Artistic Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin Dabkowski |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/entertainment/gusto/books/article808973.ece |title=The man who built Babel - Books &amp; Poetry |publisher=The Buffalo News |date=2012-04-15 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was launched in 2007. Past authors have included Nobel Prize winners [[Orhan Pamuk]], [[Derek Walcott]] and [[V.S. Naipaul]], as well as global literary icons [[Isabel Allende]], [[Amos Oz]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[A.S. Byatt]], [[Chinua Achebe]] and many others.

BABEL was initially hosted in folk-musician [[Ani Difranco]]'s recording space, "Babeville", in the old [[Asbury Delaware United Methodist Church]], until it outgrew the space late in its second season and moved to [[Kleinhans Music Hall]].

In 2009, BABEL was awarded "Most Innovative Arts Programming (any artform)" by Buffalo Spree Magazine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalospree.com/buffalospreemagazine/archives/2009_0708/070809bestofarts.html |title=Buffalo Spree Magazine |publisher=Buffalospree.com |date=1979-06-26 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BABEL series has been hailed by the [[Buffalo News]] as:

:''...one of the most exciting literary series Buffalo has ever seen.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Simon |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/entertainment/article392438.ece |title=Babel books top global writers for 2011-12 season - Entertainment |publisher=The Buffalo News |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing BABEL in its first year, Kelleher states:

:''The idea of the series is really to bring global perspective to the literary discussion in Buffalo.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koch |first=Peter |url=http://artvoice.com/issues/v6n36/babel |title=Babel |publisher=Artvoice.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107094054/http://artvoice.com/issues/v6n36/babel |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Just Buffalo Literary Center's official website:

'''Ludlow Street''' runs between [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston]] and [[Division Street (Manhattan)|Division]] Streets on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] of the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. Vehicular traffic runs south on this [[one-way street]].

==Name==
Ludlow Street was named after Lieutenant [[Augustus Ludlow]], the naval officer who was second-in-command to Captain [[James Lawrence]] on the [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|USS ''Chesapeake'']] during the ship’s engagement with [[HMS Shannon (1806)|HMS ''Shannon'']] on June 1, 1813.  It was to Ludlow that Lawrence said "Don't give up the ship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite streetbook}}, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
The land that is now Ludlow Street was once part of the huge De Lancey Estate,&lt;ref name=gotham476&gt;{{cite gotham}}, p.476&lt;/ref&gt; which had been confiscated from James De Lancey after the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], due to his status as a Loyalist, and auctioned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gotham}}, pp.267-68&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 19th century, speculative builders had constructed decent housing for workers on Ludlow Street, as well as other streets nearby, such as Eldridge, [[Forsyth Street|Forsyth]] and [[Chrystie Street|Chrystie]] Streets.&lt;ref name=gotham476 /&gt; At mid-century, Ludlow was in the middle of ''[[Kleindeutschland]]'', where large numbers of German-speaking immigrants had settled, and was one of the informal boundaries of the Jewish section of the neighborhood, along with [[Grand Street (Manhattan)|Grand]], [[Stanton Street|Stanton]], and Pitt Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gotham}}, p.745&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and music scene===
As far back as 1962 ''[[Theatre of Eternal Music]]'' members [[Tony Conrad]] and [[Angus MacLise]] lived and worked at 56 Ludlow&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watson, ''Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties'', Pantheon, New York, 2003, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1965 [[Lou Reed]], [[John Cale]] and [[Sterling Morrison]] of [[The Velvet Underground]] lived and recorded there. The earliest known recorded version of ''[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]'' was recorded there.&lt;ref&gt;Fricke, David, liner notes for the ''Peel Slowly and See'' box set (Polydor, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other filmmakers, performers, poets, artists and musicians that lived in the building at the time included [[Warhol superstars]] [[Mario Montez]] and [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323596204578241620759540276 "Incubator for the Velvet Underground"], ''Wall Street Journal'' (January 20, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Conrad has produced two CDs from the [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] tape archives subtitled  ''56 Ludlow Street'' that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack Smith - Les Evening Gowns Damnees - 56 Ludlow Street 1962-1964, Volume I''  and  ''Jack Smith - Silent Shadows On Cinemaroc Island - 56 Ludlow Street 1962-1964 Volume II''. Label: Table of the Elements. CDs released in 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-1970s Gary Weis made some short films of [[Taylor Mead]] talking to his cat in the kitchen of his Ludlow Street apartment called ''Taylor Mead's Cat''.  From 1980 to the mid-80s actor/videomaker Craig Calman lived in the building adjoining Taylor Mead's.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Dan [http://www.thelmagazine.com/3/11/NYCProfiles/nycprofiles.cfm "Taylor Mead, Superstar:The Life and Times of a Downtown Legend"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120914024636/http://www.thelmagazine.com/3/11/NYCProfiles/nycprofiles.cfm |date=2012-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An excerpt from Tyler Hubby's film ''Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present'' documents Tony Conrad making a [[field recording]] on Ludlow Street.

In the early 1980s, Ludlow Street was well known as a street where [[no wave]] [[Colab]] artists connected with [[ABC No Rio]] lived; such as [[Kiki Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], "The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984", [[Princeton University]] Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fab Five Freddy]], [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]], [[Tom Otterness]], Beatrice (Bebe) Smith, Izhar Patkin, Tron Von Hollywood, [[Wolfgang Staehle]], Raina Jane Sherry, Christof Kohlhofer, [[Carlo McCormick]], Cara Perlman, [[Steven Parrino]], Edwige Belmore, [[Joseph Nechvatal]], Uli Rimkus, [[Peter Fend]], [[Walter Robinson (art critic and artist)|Walter Robinson]], [[Aline Mare]], Emily XYZ, and [[George Condo]]. In 1980, [[Coleen Fitzgibbon]] made a video called ''Ludlow'' about Ludlow Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orensanznyc.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/les-on-the-screen-film-series-up-coming-screening-october-3-coleen-fitzgibbon-stephanie-gray/ "'LES on the Screen' Film Series: Screening October 3, 2011: Coleen Fitzgibbon &amp; Stephanie Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1983 to 1989, the bimonthly cassette publication [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] was based out of 143 Ludlow Street. Leonard Abrams started the [[East Village Eye]] cultural magazine at 167 Ludlow Street. In 1989 the [[Beastie Boys]] used a photo of the southwest corner of Ludlow and [[Rivington Street]] as the cover for their album ''[[Paul's Boutique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php NYC Album Art: Paul's Boutique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415205746/http://www.gothamist.com/2006/04/19/nyc_album_art_p.php |date=2007-04-15 }}, accessed April 26, 2007. "According to the album, Paul's Boutique is in [[Brooklyn]]...but we all know this photo was taken in the [[Lower East Side]]. With a Paul's Boutique sign hanging up on the Lee's Sportswear storefront, the shot was taken at 99 Rivington Street, where Rivington and Ludlow intersect."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the two level loft at 58 Ludlow was the home to artists such as Alex Hahn, Douglas Eisenstark,&lt;ref&gt;[http://Douglaseisenstark.com Douglas Eisenstark]&lt;/ref&gt; David Blair and Leslie Mentel, among others. Wolfgang Staehle presented an extended digital photographic record of Ludlow Street in his exhibition at [[Postmasters Gallery]] in 2016/2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2017/02/film/Wolfgang-Staehle-Ludlow-Street Keith Sanborn art review of Wolfgang Staehle at The Brooklyn Rail]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gentrification===
In the mid- to late 1990s, the increasing popularity of the area among [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]], driven out of the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] by an invasion of [[yuppie]]s, led to an upturn in activity along Ludlow Street, with several old establishments, such as corner delis (a.k.a. [[convenience store|bodegas)]] closing shop to make way for [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s, [[music venue]]s such as the Ludlow Street Bar &amp; Grill (a basement restaurant and music venue), and [[Theatre|alternative theatres]] such as [[Collective: Unconscious|Collective:Unconscious Theater]] (before it became an empty lot), [[Piano's|Piano's Theater]] (before it became a music venue and bar), and Todo Con Nada (before it became The Dark Room).

In the 2000s, Ludlow Street was a destination street for musicians and music-lovers, and was heavily populated with fashion shops, art galleries, bars, restaurants, and performance venues such as [[Cake Shop NYC|Cake Shop]], [[The Living Room]], and [[Piano's]] making Ludlow into a small nightlife strip with a distinct subcultural flavor. Local institutions included the bistro/cafe Pink Pony, the adjacent artist bar Max Fish, [[Katz's Deli]] (one of the city's most famous [[delicatessen]]s) Motor City bar, Ludlow Street Guitars, Earthmatters Cafe (hangout of musicians/actors/writers/techies), Ludlow Studio (which was home to some of the top recording artists in the mid-1990s) and the Sombrero Mexican restaurant, better known to a generation of musicians as "The Hat." The art and cultural gallery Ludlow 38 is the downtown satellite for contemporary art of the [[Goethe-Institut]] New York. The space was designed by artists Ethan Breckenridge and [[Liam Gillick]]. In 2005 artist [[Wolfgang Staehle]] created ''One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)''. The work consists of 6716 images displayed in approximately 8 second intervals over 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evolutiondelart.net/edla/artists/w_staehle.html ''One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ludlow Street between Delancey and Houston Streets lost to rising rent many small interesting shops, bars and cafes that once gave the street its distinctive flavor. Closed were: Pink Pony Cafe Littéraire &amp; Ciné Club, the print shop at 139 Ludlow, Press Tea, Earth Matters natural food store and Motor City bar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thevillager.com/2013/02/21/pink-pony-had-a-great-ride-but-couldnt-buck-changes/ The Villager: Pink Pony had a great ride, but couldn’t buck changes]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Banksy]] installed a major [[street art]] installation on Ludlow Street in the fall of 2013 as part of his ''[[Better Out Than In]]'' residency: a strange vision of horses with camera-lens googles rearing up by a car covered with cowering humans. The work is Banksy’s largest New York work to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperallergic.com/87431/banksy-watch-new-work-in-les-red-hook-work-protected/ "Banksy Watch: New Work in LES"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mihai Dumitru Ralea''' (also known as '''Mihail Ralea''', '''Michel Raléa''', or '''Mihai Rale''';&lt;ref name="mstr586"&gt;Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; May 1, 1896 – August 17, 1964) was a [[Romania]]n social scientist, cultural journalist, and political figure. He debuted as an affiliate of [[Poporanism]], the left-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] movement, which he infused with influences from [[corporatism]] and [[Marxism]]. A distinguished product of French academia, Ralea rejected traditionalism and welcomed cultural modernization, outlining the program for a secular and democratic "peasant state". His ideology blended into his scholarly work, with noted contributions to [[political sociology]], the [[sociology of culture]], and [[Social psychology|social]] and [[national psychology]]. He was a professor at the [[University of Iași]] and, from 1938, the [[University of Bucharest]].

By 1935, Ralea had become a doctrinaire of the [[National Peasants' Party]], managing ''[[Viața Românească]]'' review and ''[[Dreptatea]]'' daily. He had publicized polemics with the far-right circles and [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], which he denounced as alien to the Romanian ethos. He later drifted apart from the party's centrist leadership and his own democratic ideology, setting up a [[Socialist Peasants' Party]], then embracing authoritarian politics. He was a founding member and [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Labor Minister]] of the dictatorial [[National Renaissance Front]], representing its corporatist left-wing. He fell from power in 1940, finding himself harassed by successive fascist regimes, and became a "[[fellow traveler]]" of the underground [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]].

Ralea willingly cooperated with the communists and the [[Ploughmen's Front]] before and after their arrival to power, serving as [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]], [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]], and vice president of the [[Great National Assembly]]. He was sidelined, then recovered, by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and, as a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]], was one of its leading cultural ambassadors by 1960. Heavily controlled by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], his work gave scientific credentials to the regime's [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] propaganda, though Ralea also used his position to protect some of those persecuted by the authorities.

Ralea's final contributions assisted in the re-professionalization of Romanian psychology and education, with the retention of a more liberal communist doctrine. Always an avid traveler and raconteur, he died abroad, while on mission to the [[UNESCO]]. He endures in cultural memory as a controversial figure. He is celebrated for his sociological and critical insights, but reprehended for his nepotism, his political choices, and his literary compromises. His only, and last, direct descendant was a daughter, Catinca Ralea, who achieved literary fame as a translator of Western literature.

==Biography==

===Early life and Poporanist beginnings===
A native of [[Huși]], [[Fălciu County]] (currently in [[Vaslui County]]), Ralea was the son of a Dumitru Ralea, a local magistrate, and Ecaterina Botezatu-Ralea.&lt;ref name="gc912"&gt;Călinescu, p. 912&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Camelia Zavarache, Ralea's ethnic background was non-Romanian: on his father's side, he was a [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarian]], while his mother was [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 196–197. See also Moldovan, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The family was relatively wealthy, and Dumitru had served as Fălciu representative in the [[Senate of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; His son was always spiritually attached to his native region and, later in life, bought himself a vineyard on Dobrina Hill, just outside Huși, building himself a vacation home.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 125; (2010), p. 385; Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Huși was where he completed his primary education, before he moved on to the urban center of [[Iași]], where he enlisted at [[boarding school]] (''Liceul Internat'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 912; Vianu, p. 143; Zavarache, pp. 197–198, 199&lt;/ref&gt; He was colleagues with another future sociologist, [[D. I. Suchianu]]. The two remained personal and political friends for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="ln(10)129"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Another enduring friendship was formed on school grounds between Ralea and historian [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]], who became Ralea's main connection to the revolutionary left.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 197–198, 199, 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea went on to attend the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, under [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] (who shortlisted and prepared Ralea for academic tenure).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 191–192, 293, 344&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in publishing during 1916, with an essay in Rădulescu-Motru's ''Revista de Filozofie'',&lt;ref name="tv144"&gt;Vianu, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and with ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' articles that he usually signed with the initials ''M. R.'' (an alternative signature he would use for the rest of his career).&lt;ref&gt;Straje, pp. 406, 586&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was university colleagues with philosophers [[Tudor Vianu]] and [[Nicolae Bagdasar]], with whom he remained close friends for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 283. See also Vianu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies were interrupted by the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Campaign of World War I]], during which time Ralea relocated to Iași. He took his final examination in Law and Letters at the [[University of Iași]], in 1918.&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; His professors included the culture critic [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], who became Ralea's mentor.&lt;ref name="zavr187–188"&gt;Zavarache, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea recalled that his first encounter with Ibrăileanu was "my life's greatest intellectual event".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by Vianu as a "young luminary" with "new and original ideas", "always surrounded by a sizable pack of students",&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea returned to cultural journalism in postwar [[Greater Romania]]. From February 1919, he was a contributor to the Iași-based review ''Însemnări Literare'', which stood in for the temporarily disestablished ''[[Viața Românească]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 114; Nicolescu, p. 131. See also Desa ''et al.'' (1987), pp. 508–509&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was managed by the novelist [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] and heavily influenced by Ibrăileanu. Their friendship sealed Ralea's affiliation to prewar [[Poporanism]], a leftist current which promoted [[agrarianism]], "national specificity", and art with a social mission. The ''Însemnări Literare'' group also recognized that Poporanism was made inadequate by the social promises of [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and [[universal male suffrage]]. These policies, Ibrăileanu acknowledged, "settled a debt" with the peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Poporanism was generally pro-[[Westernization]], with a noted reserve; taken separately, Ralea was the most pro-Western, socialist, and least culturally conservative thinker of this category.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 353–354; Verdery, pp. 50–51, 53, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1919, Ralea and his new friend, [[Andrei Oțetea]], earned state scholarships to complete his doctorate in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 190–192, 250, 284&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] as a disciple of [[Lucien Herr]],&lt;ref name="tv144"/&gt; simultaneously registering for doctoral programs in letters and politics, with interests in sociology and psychology. He studied under the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] [[Célestin Bouglé]], then under [[Paul Fauconnet]] and [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], and later, at the [[Collège de France]], under [[Pierre Janet]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 191–192, 293&lt;/ref&gt; As he himself recounted, he became a passionate follower of the [[French Left]], a reader of [[Jean Jaurès]], and a guest of [[Léon Blum]]'s.&lt;ref name="istnm28"&gt;Stanomir, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He defined himself as a [[Rationalism|rationalist]], heir to the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref name="istnm28"/&gt; and was ostensibly an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's secular agenda was underscored when he joined the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]], which, historian Lucian Nastasă writes, implied a commitment to [[freethought]] and religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, Ralea managed a Romanian restaurant owned by the banker [[Aristide Blank]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of a tight cell of Romanian students in letters or history, which also included Oțetea, [[Gheorghe Brătianu]], and [[Alexandru Rosetti]], who remained close friends over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 250, 284, 293, 345–347&lt;/ref&gt; Suchianu and his sister Ioana, who were also studying in Paris, lived in the same boarding house as Ralea.&lt;ref name="ln(10)129"/&gt;

===Debut as theoretician===
With funds raised by a Support Committee that included Ralea,&lt;ref&gt;Ilie Th. Riga, Gheorghe Călin, ''Dr. Fr. I. Rainer'', [[Editura Științifică]], Bucharest, 1966, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Viața Românească'' was eventually revived by Ibrăileanu. Ralea became its foreign correspondent, sending in articles about the intellectual life and philosophical doctrines of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]],&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the first Romanian notices about the work of [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref name="ccproust"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/COROIUoct12.htm "Proust și romanul românesc modern"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled extensively, studying first-hand the cultural life of France, Belgium, Italy, and [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt;

In 1922, Ralea took his ''[[Habilitation|Docteur d'État]]'' degree (the sixth Romanian to ever qualify for it)&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt; with ''L'idée de la révolution dans les doctrines socialistes'' ("The Idea of Revolution in Socialist Doctrines"). Under the [[Francization|Francized]] name ''Michel Raléa'', he published it at Rivière company in 1923. ''L'idée de la révolution...'' theorized that, in order to be classified as a revolution, a social movement needed at once a "social body", an "ideal", and a "transfer of power"—depending on which trait was prevailing, revolutions were, respectively, "organic", "programmatic", or "means-based".&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of his attention was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], whom he rediscovered (and criticized) as a proponent of "class solidarity" and [[nonviolent revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; The work earned Ralea the [[Institut de France]]'s [[Prix Osiris]]&lt;ref name="tv144"/&gt; and a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree in 1923.&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; He spent another several months frequenting [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] lectures.&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt; It was there that he first met a future enemy, the poet-mathematician [[Ion Barbu]]. The latter left a corrosive record of their first encounter, dismissing Ralea as a "clown" with "aristocratic manias".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Romania, Ralea began publishing his political and sociological essays in reviews such as ''Fapta'', ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'', and ''[[Gândirea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 76; Desa ''et al.'' (1987), p. 469; Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with [[Dimitrie Gusti]] and [[Virgil Madgearu]]'s Romanian Social Institute, publishing his texts in its ''Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială''. In 1923, it hosted his essay on "The Issue of Societal Classification" and his critical review of German sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Gusti, pp. 16, 17&lt;/ref&gt; While still in Paris, Ralea was confident that he would find employment: the University of Iași Chair of Sociology had been set aside for him by Rădulescu-Motru, with Ibrăileanu's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 293, 344&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was complicated when another Paris graduate, [[Garabet Aslan]], ran for the same position. Supported by Ibrăileanu and Gusti, Ralea was eventually moved to the Logic and Modern Philosophy Department, as an assistant professor to [[Ion Petrovici]], while also employed as lecturer in [[social pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 344–345, 347, 483&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea's own words, this was a "ridiculous" situation: most of his students were girls, some of whom were infatuated with him.&lt;ref name="ln(09)483"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; He had married Ioana Suchianu in November 1923, while still in Bucharest, and lived with her in a small apartment above the ''Viața Românească'' offices.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 150, 200–201, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years, Ralea diversified his qualifications with the goal of obtaining employment in his main field. He published the tract ''Formația ideii de personalitate'' ("How the Notion of Personality Is Formed"), noted as a pioneering introduction to [[behavioural genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1926, following good referrals from Petrovici (and despite the preference of psychology students, who favored C. Fedeleș), Ralea was appointed Professor of Psychology and Aesthetics at Iași University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 345–346, 347, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea soon became one of ''Viața Românească''{{'}}s ideologues and polemicists, as well as architect of its satire column, ''Miscellanea'' (alongside Suchianu and, initially, [[George Topîrceanu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925, he was also regularly featured in the left-wing daily ''[[Adevărul]]'', and its cultural supplement, ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 17, 18&lt;/ref&gt; His essays were taken up by other cultural magazines throughout Romania, including ''[[Kalende]]'' of [[Pitești]] and ''Minerva'' of Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 557, 619–620&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, when Ralea published his ''Contribuțiuni la știința societății'' ("Contributions to Social Science") and ''Introducere în sociologie'' ("Companion to Sociology"),&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Herseni, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; Gusti's Social Institute had Ralea as a guest speaker, with a lecture on "Social Education".&lt;ref&gt;Gusti, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, with Gusti as president of the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Broadcasting Company]], Ralea became a frequent presence on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

In his columns and essays, Ralea defended Ibrăileanu's "national specificity" against criticism from the new-wave [[Literary modernism|modernists]] at ''[[Sburătorul]]''. [[Eugen Lovinescu]], the modernist ideologue, had reconnected with 19th-century [[classical liberalism]], rejecting Poporanism as a nationalist, culturally isolationist, and [[Socialization (economics)|socializing]] phenomenon. Lovinescu and Ralea denounced each other's politics as [[reactionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 39, 128, 133; E. Lovinescu, pp. 116–119&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea opined that Poporanist ideas were still culturally relevant, and not in fact isolationist, since they provided a recipe for "originality"; as he put it, "national specificity" had become inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was not just political: Ralea also objected to modernist aesthetics, from the pure poetry cultivated by ''Sburătorul'' to the more radical [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] of ''[[Contimporanul]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 123–124, 128, 133–135, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea was not an anti-modernist, but rather a particular modernist. According to his friend and colleague [[Octav Botez]], he was an "integrally modern man" in tastes and behavior, "one of the few philosophers who conceived of, and lived, their lives as regular people, with a naturalness and facility that were charming and stimulating."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 483–484&lt;/ref&gt; The same was also noted by ''Contimporanul'' writer [[Sergiu Dan]], who proposed that Ralea denied himself "all sort of transaction with the confuse world of sentiment".&lt;ref name="sdan184"&gt;Dan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's literary columns very often promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, such as when he used Janet's psychology to explain the genesis of works by [[Thomas Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 911; Vianu, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; More famous was his reading of Proust through [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[Matter and Memory|classification of memory]].&lt;ref name="ccproust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc911"&gt;Călinescu, p. 911&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as [[Alexandru A. Philippide]], and hailed [[Tudor Arghezi]], the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 227; Crohmălniceanu, p. 140. See also M. Lovinescu, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for [[social realism]] in prose. His natural favorite was Sadoveanu, but he was also enthusiastic about modernist novels with a flavor of social radicalism, including those by ''Sburătorul''{{'}}s [[Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 180, 253, 397, 406, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ralea vs. ''Gândirea''===
With the Lovinescu–Ralea debate occupying the center stage at ''Viața Românească'' and ''Sburătorul'', a new intellectual movement, critical of both modernism and Poporanism, was emerging in the cultural life of Greater Romania. Led by poet-theologian [[Nichifor Crainic]], this group took over at ''Gândirea'', turning the magazine against its former ''Viața Românească'' allies.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 76–77, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; As pointed out by Lovinescu, Ralea was initially welcoming of Crainic's "remarkable" program.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; He did not object to Crainic's [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] devotion (seeing it as compatible with secularism and "national specificity"), but mainly to his [[national conservatism]], which worshiped the historical past.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 123–128&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Poporanists, Ralea adopted [[left-wing nationalism]], arguing that the very concept of nation was a product of French radicalism: "[It] emerged from the great French Revolution, the modest ideology of the bourgeoisie. [...] What's more, we may claim that only a democracy can truly be nationalistic."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bochmann, "Conceptul de patriotism în cultura română", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 124; Ornea (1995), pp. 65, 351&lt;/ref&gt; He credited the core ideas of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]], according to which [[National awakening of Romania|Romanian national awareness]] was an afterthought of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]]: "We have had to visit France to find out we're Romanians."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by scholar Balázs Trencsényi: "Ralea sought to separate the study of national specificity, which he considered to be legitimate, from the exhortation of national particulars, which he rejected."&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, ''Gândirea'' hosted the inflammatory "White Lily" Manifesto. It signaled the Poporanists' confrontation with a "new generation" of anti-rationalists, and Ralea's personal rivalry with one of the White Lily intellectuals, [[Petre Pandrea]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's Manifesto was at once a plea for [[aestheticism]] and [[mysticism]], a critique of "that famed social justice" idea, and an explicit denunciation of Ralea, Ibrăileanu, Suchianu and the ''Sburătorul'' group as "dry", "barren", all too critical.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea answered with half-satirical comments: the country, he noted, could do without "prophets" with "fun and interesting biases", but not without "liberty, paved roads, justice and cleanliness in the streets".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the Manifesto authors were modern-day [[Rasputin]]s, prone to fanatical vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

From that moment on, Crainic's Orthodox spirituality and traditionalism made a slow transition into far-right politics. Their rejection of democracy became another issue of dispute, with Ralea noting, in 1930, that "all civilized countries are democratic; all semi-civilized or primitive countries are dictatorial."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, ''Gândirists'' produced more and more systematic attacks on Ralea's ideology, condemning its atheism, "[[historical materialism]]", and [[Francophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 97, 102&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Ralea noted that, beyond their facade, national and religious conservatism meant a reinstatement of primitive customs, [[obscurantism]], [[Neoplatonism]], and [[Byzantinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 124, 127, 130–132&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed the envelope by demanding a program of forced Westernization and secularization, to mirror [[Kemalism]].&lt;ref name="gc973"&gt;Călinescu, p. 973&lt;/ref&gt;

His comments also challenged the grounding of ''Gândirist'' theory: Romanian Orthodoxy, he noted, was part of an international Orthodox phenomenon that mainly included [[Slavs]], whereas many Romanians were [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]]. He concluded, therefore, that Orthodoxy could never claim synonymy with the Romanian ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 127–128; Ornea (1995), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also insisted that, despite its nativist [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] claims, Orthodox religiousness was a modern "trifle", that owed inspiration to [[Hermann Graf Keyserling|Keyserling]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]]'s Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 132; Ornea (1995), pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that Romanian peasants, whose religiousness was exhorted by Crainic, were "superstitious, but atheistic", not respectful "of any spiritual value when it should compete with their logical instincts." No other people, he contented, was as blasphemous as Romanians when it came to [[Romanian profanity|profanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea collected his critical essays as a set of volumes: ''Comentarii și sugestii'' ("Comments and Suggestions"), ''Interpretări'' ("Interpretations"), ''Perspective'' ("Perspectives").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 187–188, 586, 598, 616&lt;/ref&gt; He was still involved in psychological research, with tracts such as ''Problema inconștientului'' ("The Problem of the Unconscious Mind") and ''Ipoteze și precizări privind știința sufletului'' ("Hypotheses and Précis Regarding Spiritual Science").&lt;ref name="gc1025"&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also resumed his European travels, touring the [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]], and was unenthusiastic about its conservatism. Ralea's travelogue, ''Memorial din Spania'', depicts the country as a reactionary bulwark of "somber priests" and "festooned soldiers".&lt;ref name="sdan184"/&gt; Another ''Memorial'', serialized by ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', detailed his trips through [[Germanic-speaking Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 912, 1025&lt;/ref&gt;

===PNȚ deputy and ''Viața Românească'' editor===
Shortly before the [[Romanian general election, 1928|election of December 1928]], Ralea was attracted into the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ), speaking out against the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] political class as "an abnormal regime of corruption and brutality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Octavian Tăslăuanu]], "Ce scriu tinerii despre România", in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 28/1928, pp. 898–899&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully contested a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]], and was [[Romanian general election, 1931|reelected in 1933]]; during that interval, he also presided upon Fălciu's party chapter.&lt;ref name="zavr189"&gt;Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was one of a compact group of National Peasantist academics in Poporanist Iași, together with Botez, Oțetea, [[Constantin Balmuș]], [[Iorgu Iordan]], [[Petre Andrei]], [[Traian Bratu]], and [[Traian Ionașcu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 100, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the party, Ralea was a follower of the Poporanist founding figure, [[Constantin Stere]], but did not follow Stere's "[[Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere|Democratic Peasantist]]" dissidence of 1930.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/glose_la_petre_pandrea_ii "Glose la Petre Pandrea (II)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 25/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1929, Ralea was a noted contributor to the party press organ ''Acțiunea Țărănistă'' and to [[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște|Teodorescu-Braniște]]'s ''Revista Politică''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 16, 822&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1933, Ibrăileanu retired, leaving Ralea and literary critic [[George Călinescu]] as editors of ''Viața Românească''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 146; Piru, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea eventually affiliated with the centrist current of the PNȚ, distancing himself from those party factions who were tempted by socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126. See also Ornea (1995), pp. 119, 295&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and Ibrăileanu still promoted the vision of a "peasant state", accepting socialist [[reformism]], but still cautious of socialist industrialization, and rejected outright the idea of [[Dictatorship of the proletarian|proletarian primacy]]. Criticized by the communist left as "outstanding shortsightedness",&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; this ideological position came to define the PNȚ in the mid 1930s. Ralea defended classical parliamentarianism at several [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] meetings, including the 1933 conference in the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic of Spain]], but insisted on the benefits of [[statism]] and a [[planned economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5448104j/ ''Compte rendu de la XXIXe conférence tenue à Madrid du 4 au 10 octobre 1933''], Éditions Payot, Lausanne, 1934, pp. 582–588&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Ralea was leaving behind his sociological research. As noted by his friend Botez, he showed himself to be "absent-minded and preoccupied most of all with politics."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Botez noted that Ralea was showing signs of [[hyperactivity]], seemingly incapable of concentrating during formal functions.&lt;ref name="ln(09)483"/&gt; He became infamous as one of the "traveling professors",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in Bucharest and only taught the minimum of classes allowed in Iași—one of his return trips to Iași, in 1936, was for the funeral ceremony of his mentor Ibrăileanu.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 475–476; Piru, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; He now owned an Iași townhouse and a villa in Bucharest's Filipescu Park.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 201, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Although lovingly married to Ioana, he had begun an affair with another woman, Marcela Simionescu.&lt;ref name="ln(10)266-267"&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 266–267&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's energies were also drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent seat at the University of Iași, at the expense of PNȚ colleague [[Ioan Hudiță]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 250, 403, 406&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to do the same for Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist [[Giorge Pascu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 302–303&lt;/ref&gt; Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their [[Romanian Baccalaureate|baccalaureate examination]].&lt;ref name="ln(10)266-267"/&gt; Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

He contributed its political editorials, answering to criticism from the right. In February 1935, he co-authored and published the new PNȚ Party Program, which rendered explicit the goal of transforming Romania into a "peasant state".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dreptatea'', addressing ''[[Universul]]'' editor [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], Ralea dismissed suspicions that the "peasant state" signified a "simplistic domination" or a dictatorship of the peasantry. He maintained that the notion simply implied "a juster distribution of the national income", and the "collective" but peaceful "redemption of an entire class."&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', pp. 204–206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against the Iron Guard===
Ralea's time at ''Dreptatea'' overlapped with the emergence of [[fascism]], whose leading Romanian representatives were members of the [[Iron Guard]]. This violent movement had been temporarily banned in 1931, by order of a PNȚ [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]], [[Ion Mihalache]]. Mihalache's ban followed repeated requests by the party's left-wingers, Ralea included.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea had his own brush with the Guard in late 1932, when he was presiding upon symposiums on French literature at ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion Society]]''. One of the sessions, focusing on [[André Gide]], was interrupted, on Crainic's instigation, by Guardsmen under [[Mihai Stelescu]], who assaulted ''Criterion'' activists and created a bustle.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Irina Manea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/criterion-o-istorie "Criterion – o istorie"], in ''Historia'', May 2014; Ornea (1995), pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, Ralea had quarreled with the ''Criterion'' cell, which had since adopted "new generation" idealism and sympathy for the Iron Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; In private, he also dismissed the Guard's new convert and ideologue, [[Nae Ionescu]], as a "trickster" and a "barber".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of Romanian fascism became stringent after the Guard assassinated [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Premier]] [[Ion G. Duca]]. In his articles, Ralea described the National Liberal administration as "insane and degenerate" for continuing to tolerate the Guard's existence, instead of jailing its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Dreptatea'', protesting against the Guard's assault of the leftist intellectual [[Alexandru Graur]], Ralea decried fascism in Romania as an "[[The Island of Doctor Moreau|island of Doctor Moreau]]", an experiment in the growth of "blind and absurd mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, 161 of Ralea's essays were collected and published at [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]] as ''Valori'' ("Values"). They predicted the emergence of a stable civilization, conformist and [[Collectivism|collectivist]], whose great merit was the elimination of careerism.&lt;ref&gt;Dan, pp. 184–186&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea synthesized his critique of fascism in the 1935 essays on "The Right's Doctrine", taken up by ''Dreptatea'' and ''Viața Românească''. These texts described the far-right and fascism as parasitical phenomena, feeding on democracy's errors, with an ignorant mindset, incapable of subtlety.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 119; Ornea (1995), pp. 64–65, 350–352&lt;/ref&gt; His assessments were countercriticized by Guardist intellectual [[Toma Vlădescu]], in the newspaper ''[[Porunca Vremii]]''. According to Vlădescu, the "right-wing ideology" existed as an expression of the "human equilibrium", and, at its very core, was antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Nazi Germany]] and the invigoration of European fascism, Ralea was again moving to the left, cooperating with the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR). In 1936, at ''Dreptatea'', he condemned the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|German march into Rhineland]] as a bad omen and an attack on world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Prisăcaru, "Rhineland Crisis: The First 'Milestone' to the Second World War. Romanian Authorities and Media Reactions", in ''Romanian Military Thinking'', Nr. 4/2013, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the PNȚ men affiliated with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Cecil]]'s International Peace Campaign, which, in Romania, was dominated by PSDR militants.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, with an obituary piece to the "martyr" Stere, he defended Poporanism from accusations of "[[Bolshevik]]" subservience. Bolshevism, he argued, was impossible in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 74, 396&lt;/ref&gt; However, he himself had established a working relationship with the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR), who was also interested in other PNȚ antifascists (one of them was the White Lily's Pandrea, who had since joined the National Peasantist left current).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 126, 133, 137, 143–144; Tismăneanu, pp. 99, 299, 312&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also allowed PCdR intellectuals such as [[Ștefan Voicu]] and [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]] to publish essays in ''Viața Românească'', and hosted news about social life and culture in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 118–119. See also Zavarache, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the PCdR acknowledged him as one of the intellectuals who could be trusted with "fulfilling the bourgeois revolution in Romania."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1937, at the PNȚ Youth Conference in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], Ralea spoke of the "peasant state" as a "[[neo-nationalist]]" application of [[democratic socialism]], opposed to fascism, and in natural solidarity with the trade unions. He felt confident that this alliance would be powerful enough to outweigh fashionable [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conferințele tineretului național-țărănist la Cluj", in ''Țara de Mâine'', Nr. 1–2/1937, pp. 58, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; During April of that year, Ralea and his Iași colleagues expressed public solidarity with his old Poporanist friend Sadoveanu, whose books were being burned by far-right militants.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 78–80; Ornea (1995), p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's own sociological work was falling under Guardist scrutiny: in December, ''[[Buna Vestire]]'' hosted a piece by [[Horia Stamatu]], which referred to Ralea's contribution as "unhinged", and to Ralea personally as "kike-turned", "at odds with the new man".&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Săndulescu, "Convertiri și reconvertiri: elite academice și culturale și schimbare politică în România anilor 1930–1960", in Cristian Vasile (ed.), ''"Ne trebuie oameni!".

===Becoming Carol's minister===
[[File:Călinescu, Gafencu, Ralea, Constantinescu. Prima ședință a fondatorilor F.R.N..jpg|thumb|370px|Founding session of the [[National Renaissance Front]]. Wearing the Front's gala uniforms, from left: [[Armand Călinescu]], [[Grigore Gafencu]], Ralea, [[Mitiță Constantinescu]]]]
The [[Romanian general election, 1937|December 1937 election]] toned down Ralea's anti-Guard militancy: the PNȚ had a non-aggression pact with the Guardsmen. Consequently, Ralea campaigned in his native [[Fălciu County]] alongside the movement's candidates, in terms he would later describe as "cordial".&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; His apparent compromise with the Guard is one of the most serious charges in Pandrea's later criticism of Ralea.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt; The tied elections, and the successes of the Guard, prompted the authoritarian [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] to increase his participation in politics, beyond his [[royal prerogative]]. Identified as one of the PNȚ "turncoats",&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea sealed a surprising deal with Carol II and Premier [[Miron Cristea]] (the [[Patriarch of All Romania|Patriarch of Romania]]), becoming the country's [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Minister of Labor]]. He was promptly stripped of his PNȚ membership, and inaugurated his own party, the exceedingly minor [[Socialist Peasants' Party]] (PSȚ).&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marin Pop, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162339/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=1954 "Întâlniri secrete între Iuliu Maniu, Nicolae D. Cocea și Mihail Ralea (1942–1944)"], in ''Caiete Silvane'', Nr. 2/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians tend to describe Ralea's attitude toward Carol as "servile",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; and Ralea himself as Carol's "pocket Socialist"&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; or "intellectual trophy".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea himself claimed that the king cultivated his friendship as a likable "communist", though, as Camelia Zavarache argues, there is no secondary proof to attest that Ralea was ever part of Carol's ''[[camarilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iuliu Maniu]], the PNȚ chief and leader of the semi-clandestine democratic opposition, suggested that Ralea had "not a trace of character" to compliment his intellectual gifts.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; At the time, PNȚ activists began collecting evidence that Ralea was not an ethnic Romanian, which meant that he could no longer hold public office under the [[Romanianization]] laws.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 197"&gt;Zavarache, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea himself was involved in the Romanianization campaign: in late 1938, he accepted [[Wilhelm Filderman]]'s proposal for [[Fifth Aliyah|the mass emigration of Romanian Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Aurel Vainer]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160416040538/https://www.jewishfed.ro/downloads/realitatea/RE442-443.pdf "Contribuția evreimii române la Așezământul Muncii în Ereț Israel"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 442–443, January 2015, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, Ralea became a founding member of Carol's [[One-party state|single party]], the [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment offered him several honors, including a reprint of his works by the ministry press.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his ministerial appointment, Ralea became Royal Resident, or governor, of [[Ținutul Prut]], a new administrative region incorporating parts of Western Moldavia and [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He was created a Knight 2nd Class of the ''[[Meritul Cultural]]'' Order,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; publishing, at Editura Fundațiilor Regale, the volume ''Psihologie și vieață'' ("Psychology and Life").&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Toward the end of 1938, Ralea moved from his old chair at the University of Iași and took up a similar position at his Bucharest alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 293, 343, 447; Zavarache, pp. 190, 197&lt;/ref&gt; Vianu was the assistant professor, lecturing in specialized aesthetics and literary criticism, and in practice taking over all of Ralea's classes.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 283–284, 447&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Lucian Boia]] argues: "Of all the king's dictatorship dignitaries, one may count Mihai Ralea as the most left-wing."&lt;ref name="lb141"&gt;Boia, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In Ralea's own view, the FRN regime was, overall, progressive: "I had inaugurated a corpus of social reforms that were approved by the working class."&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1945 by political scientist [[Hugh Seton-Watson]], there was a cynical side to Ralea's reform-mindedness: "however much [the average Romanian intellectual] cursed the regime, he was grateful to it for one thing. It stood between him and the great, dirty, primitive, disinherited masses, whose 'Bolshevik' desire for Social Justice threatened his comforts."&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; His time in office brought the creation of a workers' leisure service, ''[[Muncă și Voe Bună]]'', together with a Workers' University,&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"&gt;"Necesitatea universităților muncitorești", in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 4/1939, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; a workers' theater, and a hostel for vacationing writers (''Casa Scriitorilor'').&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 140–143, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Nepotistic in his selection of a ministerial staff,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 182, 225&lt;/ref&gt; by November 1939 his ministry was able to co-opt PSDR politicians such as [[George Grigorovici]]&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 141; Petrescu, p. 458, 459&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stavri Cunescu]].&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilarion Țiu, Lavinia Betea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cum-l-furat-ceausescu-regele-playboy "Cum l-a furat Ceaușescu pe Regele playboy"], in ''Historia'', online edition; retrieved July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He appropriated socialist propaganda, and attracted more or less sizable contributions from various centrists and left-wingers: Sadoveanu, Vianu, Suchianu, Philippide, as well as [[Demostene Botez]], [[Octav Livezeanu]], [[Victor Ion Popa]], [[Gala Galaction]], [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]], and [[Ion Pas]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 141–143, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's mandate was also a crossover of left-wing corporatism and fascism. In June 1938, he even visited Nazi Germany and had a formal meeting with his counterpart, [[Robert Ley]].&lt;ref name="lb141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmhoria"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Manolescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/85_via-a-romaneasca-5-6-2013/80_istorie-i-literatura/1492_scriitori-romani-in-exil-vintila-horia-fata-cu-premiul-goncourt.html "Scriitori români în exil. Vintilă Horia față cu Premiul Goncourt"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 5-6/2013&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Muncă și Voe Bună'' was directly inspired by [[Strength Through Joy]] and the ''[[Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro]]''.&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 141; Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Ralea celebrated [[May Day]] with a large parade of support for Carol II. This was meant to undermine the leftist [[International Workers' Day|Workers' Day]] while showing the success of the FRN's worker [[guild]]s, and was partly inspired by Nazi festivities.&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt; Nevertheless, the parade was voluntarily joined by militants of the underground PCdR, who found that it gave them am opportunity for chanting "democratic slogans".&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt; In underground PSDR circles, as well as in inside the ministerial structures, rumors spread that Ralea was using secret funds at his discretion to sponsor various PCdR militants, including his schoolmate [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]]; these stories were partly confirmed by Ralea himself.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 197–200, 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 1939, the premiership had passed to [[Armand Călinescu]], a former PNȚ politician. Ralea was his friend and confidant, and, as he later claimed, tried to keep Călinescu grounded in the face of "mythomaniacal" rumors.&lt;ref name="zoambasador"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nsemnrile_unui_ambasador "Însemnările unui ambasador"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 6/2001&lt;/ref&gt; The FRN regime soon organized a massive clampdown of the Iron Guard. Ralea claimed to have protected Guardsmen employed by the Labor Ministry, and to have negotiated pardons for militants interned at [[Miercurea Ciuc]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 313, 314&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained one such reprieve for Guardist historian [[P. P. Panaitescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a Guard sympathizer, [[Ion Barbu]] later claimed that Ralea was behind his marginalization in academia.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 189; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 332, 342&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also accused by Pandrea of having done nothing to prevent the arrest of his former ''Dreptatea'' colleague, the anti-Carol PNȚ-ist Madgearu.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt;

On September 21, 1939, following a spree of extrajudicial killings ordered by government, an [[Iron Guard death squads|Iron Guard death squad]] took its revenge, assassinating Premier Călinescu. Ralea, Andrei, and other former PNȚ-ists preserved their governmental posts as the premiership passed to [[Constantin Argetoianu]], then to [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Guvern nou", in ''Unirea. Foaie Bisericească'', December 2, 1939, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also given new responsibilities within the FRN structure, becoming president of its regional chapter in [[Ținutul Mării]].&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, pp. 359, 369–372&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall and harassment===
[[File:Sala de Consiliu -- Primim &amp; mobilizare.jpg|thumb|250px|Ralea's vote on the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet ultimatum]] and mobilization, registered on Romanian government stationary, alongside those of his cabinet colleagues]] 
Meanwhile, the outbreak of World War II caught Romania isolated from either the [[Axis Powers]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. During the [[Battle of France]], the FRN regime itself was divided between partisans of a détente with Germany and Francophiles such as Ralea. As witnessed by the Swiss diplomat [[René de Weck]], Ralea was restating his ''Valori'' ethos at cabinet meetings, in front of Axis representatives, declaring that the Allies stood for "humanistic civilization".&lt;ref name="zoambasador"/&gt; Former PCdR activists still enjoyed access to Ralea, through Constantinescu-Iași. In May 1940, the latter tried to create a bridge of communications between the Labor Minister and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 118; Zavarache, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; Various reports on both sides confirm that Ralea was in permanent contact with Soviet diplomats, arranged for him by Constantinescu-Iași and [[Belu Zilber]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a month later, the Soviets issued an ultimatum, demanding that Romania cede Bessarabia. During the deliberations, Ralea voted in favor of Argetoianu's proposal: withdrawing from the region and mobilizing the army on the [[Prut River|Prut]], in preparation of a future defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Constantin Argetoianu]], [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/constantin-argetoianu-ultimatum-mi-s-au-taiat-picioarele "Ultimatum... Mi s-au tăiat picioarele..."], in ''Historia'', June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] sent Romania into a deep political crisis. The events, and revelations about the existence of a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi–Soviet agreement]], led Carol to order a final clampdown of the PCdR's remaining Romanian cells. In July, Ralea intervened to rescue a communist friend, the journalist [[George Ivașcu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Țugui]], [http://www.romlit.ro/george_ivacu_cronicar_de_rzboi_la_ziarul_vremea_1941-1944 "George Ivașcu, cronicar de război, la ziarul ''Vremea'' (1941–1944). I"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian crisis was aggravated in August, when the Nazi-inspired [[Second Vienna Award|Vienna arbitration]] stripped her of [[Northern Transylvania]]. The political standstill propelled the Iron Guard, which was Nazi-aligned, into government, and forced Carol into permanent exile. The emerging "[[National Legionary State]]" banned reviews such as ''Viața Românească'',&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to prosecute all former FRN dignitaries. With Panaitescu as the new Rector, the University instituted a Commission for Review, which included Iron Guard sociologist [[Traian Herseni]] and eugenicist [[Iordache Făcăoaru]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 172; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 314, 315&lt;/ref&gt; Of those professors brought before the commission, Ralea was the only one to have his contract terminated without the possibility of transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 540–541. See also Boia, pp. 176, 199; Popescu-Cadem, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Panaitescu, Herseni and Făcăoaru found that his appointment to Bucharest had been illegal, and dismissed his scientific contributions as having "zero value".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 176; Popescu-Cadem, p. 315. See also Zavarache, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and his colleagues were able to defend Vianu, who was openly Jewish, and who was threatened with demotion under the [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial purity laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 447. See also Boia, pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing to Huși, Ralea became the target of surveillance by agents of the [[Siguranța]], who monitored his subversive conversations, including his wager that Guard rule would be short-lived.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 197"/&gt;

In November 1940, the Guard's [[Romanian Police|Police]] chief, [[Ștefan Zăvoianu]], ordered the arrests of several FRN dignitaries, Ralea included. This angered the military ''[[Conducător]]'', [[Ion Antonescu]], who freed Ralea and the others, ordering Zăvoianu to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe I. Florescu, "N. Iorga și America", in ''Zargidava. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XII, 2013, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|clashes of January 1941]], the Iron Guard was ousted, and Antonescu remained unchallenged. Although fascist, the new regime reinstated Ralea to his professorship. Antonescu castigated the Commission for Review as a "shame", and declared Ralea to be "indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 198–200&lt;/ref&gt; In a companion to [[Romanian philosophy]], published that year, Herseni revised his stance, calling Ralea "a thinker of unquestionable talent", whose sociological work had been "a true revelation."&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea returned to teach at the University where, in addition to Vianu, he had received as his assistant a refugee from Soviet-occupied territory, [[Traian Chelariu]].&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Traian Chelariu]], [[Mircea A. Diaconu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/zilele_i_umbra_mea "Zilele și umbra mea"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Panaitescu was stripped of his position and briefly imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Still present in public life after the Romania's entry into the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|anti-Soviet war]], Ralea returned to publishing with articles in ''Revista Românǎ''&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 243; Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1942 book ''Înțelesuri'' ("Meanings").&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Despite being partly recovered by the new regime, and allegedly proposing to Antonescu that they revive together the [[National Socialist Party (Romania)|National Socialist Party]],&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt; Ralea was still under ''Siguranța'' watch, and also spied on by the Police and the German Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 200, 237; Zavarache, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt; His file contains a denunciation of his entire career and loyalties: he stood accused of having been a "socialist-communist" camouflaged within the PNȚ, of having revived the guilds so as to give the PCdR room for maneuver, and of having sponsored Soviet agents to protect himself in the event of a Soviet invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/154/art16-arhiva.php "''Arhivele Sfera Politicii'' – Mihail Ralea"], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 154, December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''Siguranța'' record suggests that, in secret, Ralea was hoping to consolidate a left-wing opposition movement against Antonescu during the early months of 1941. More alarmingly for the regime, Ralea had also begun cultivating a revolutionary and pro-Allied youth, through a new magazine called ''Graiul Nostru'' and with British funds.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Ralea was subjected to formal interrogations over his contacts with the PCdR under Carol. He defended these, arguing that he had aimed at securing a protective deal between Romania and the Soviets, and that Carol had approved of his effort. The explanation was viewed as plausible by police, and Ralea was allowed to go free.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the file was reopened by August, after revelations that Ralea had cultivated communists since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, Antonescu ordered Ralea's interment at the concentration camp in [[Târgu Jiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He was held there for about three months, to March 1943, and apparently enjoyed a mild detention regime, with visitations.&lt;ref name="zavr203–204"&gt;Zavarache, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gh.Gheorghiu Dej rostindu-și cuvântarea la Congresul Frontului Plugarilor ținut pe Stadionul A.N.E.F. (Mihai Ralea, Petru Groza).jpg|thumb|340px|Ralea (left) and [[Petru Groza]], flanking [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] as he addresses the [[Ploughmen's Front]] Congress, June 1945]]
Ralea's return from camp coincided roughly with the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the turn of fortunes on the eastern front. He soon established contacts with the antifascist opposition, repeatedly seeking to set up a Peasantist left and rejoin the PNȚ. Maniu received him and listened to his pleas, but denied him readmission and invited him to create his own coalition from shards of the Renaissance Front, promising him some measure of leniency "for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection."&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; Their separation remained "unbridgeable";&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 196, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; eventually, Ralea reestablished the PSȚ, and attracted into its ranks a Social Democratic dissident faction, led by former PSDR theoretician [[Lothar Rădăceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, pp. 116–117, 120; Tismăneanu, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The two reestablished contacts with the PCdR and other fringe parties: moving between Bucharest and [[Sinaia]], Ralea was involved in trilateral talks between the communists, the [[Ploughmen's Front]] of [[Petru Groza]], and the National Liberal inner faction of [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], helping to coordinate actions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, pp. 550, 555&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brașov]], he met with the economist [[Victor Jinga]], whose antifascist and socialist program was reused in later PSȚ propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Together with party colleague [[Stanciu Stoian]], he signed the PSȚ's adherence to the PCdR's clandestine "Patriotic Antihitlerite Front".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 132; Frunză, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to such underground work, Ralea was notably involved in combating the nationalism and racism of the Antonescu years. He was one of several literary critics who publicly chided a colleague, George Călinescu, for publishing a 1941 treatise which included racialist profiles of Romanian writers,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 243, 244; {{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/g.clinescu_i_detractorii_si "G. Călinescu și detractorii săi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2013&lt;/ref&gt; alongside criticism of Ralea's own anti-nationalism.&lt;ref name="gc973"/&gt; With the 1943 collection of essays, ''Între două lumi'' ("Between Two Worlds", published at [[Cartea Românească]]),&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Ralea revised his earlier prophecies about the triumph of collectivism.&lt;ref name="pcom193-194"&gt;Comarnescu, pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Ralea's participation in subversion was disregarded by government: in June 1943, when the [[German Foreign Ministry]] nominated Ralea as a high-risk target, Antonescu personally replied that this was not the case.&lt;ref name="zavr203–204"/&gt; In November, Ralea applied for a new Chair of Psychology at Bucharest, reserving his old department for Vianu. The review committee, overseen by leftist allies such as Gusti and [[Mircea Florian]], gave him immediate approval for transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 346. See also Zavarache, pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; In February of the next year, Ralea and N. Bagdasar rejected the application of [[Constantin Noica]], the traditionalist philosopher, to join the university teaching staff. In his report, Ralea noted that Noica had "an absolute and metaphysical mindset", with no "practical reason", and that he was therefore unsuited for research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as a defense witness for [[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]], an activist of the underground [[National Popular Party (Romania)|Union of Patriots]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Hudiță and other rival PNȚ-ists, and his friends in Iași academia, Ralea signed to [[Grigore T. Popa]]'s manifesto of the intellectuals, demanding that Antonescu negotiate a separate peace with the Soviets. Reputedly, the document had been stripped of references to the prosecution of FRN and Antonescian officials, leading Maniu to conclude that the signers were "cowardly".&lt;ref name="smhalucin44"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Solomon Marcus]], [http://www.romlit.ro/halucinantul_an_1944 "Halucinantul an 1944"], ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 45/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hudiță, Ralea objected to the Soviets' offer of an armistice as "too soft" on Romania.&lt;ref name="smhalucin44"/&gt; Blocked out of the National Democratic Bloc coalition,&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p. 120; Zavarache, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; which included the PNȚ, the PSDR, and ultimately the PCdR, Ralea watched from the side as the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]] deposed Antonescu and pushed Romania into the anti-Nazi camp. His friend and PSȚ colleague, Grigore Geamănu, was more directly involved, helping PCdR leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] to escape from Târgu Jiu camp and join the other conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In the PSȚ newspaper, ''Dezrobirea'', Ralea saluted "the full triumph of the ideas and principles for which our foremost activists have been militating uninterruptedly these past six years" (a pedigree which seemingly included Ralea's own activities under King Carol).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; He reissued ''Viața Românească'' with a similar statement about "the present triumph of our credo".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, keeping up with his earlier threats, Maniu repeatedly asked for Ralea to be [[Romanian People's Tribunals|indicted for war crimes]].&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt;

Ralea played an instrumental part in the gradual installation of communism, and is described by various authors as the prototype "[[fellow traveler]]".&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 154, 290; Stanomir, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1944, he was announced as the Literary Section Vice President of the [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union]] (ARLUS).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126, 143&lt;/ref&gt; His PSȚ was drawn into the National Democratic Front (FND) coalition, which comprised the PCdR, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. According to the PCdR, this transformation of the Antihitlerite Front was "a progressive step, befitting the tasks of the people's revolution";&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; according to historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]], it was more of opportunistic move on Ralea's part.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt; In private, Ralea claimed that his alignment with the communists helped him provide for his large family, including former landowners, but his account is viewed as doubtful by Zavarache.&lt;ref name="zavr256"&gt;Zavarache, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's Socialist Peasantists were eventually absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front. As noted by Zavarache, Ralea now understood that his influence on political life was "exceedingly minor", aware that Groza himself was merely a communist "puppet"; "consequently, he sought to preserve those offices which could ensure him a comfortable lifestyle".&lt;ref name="zavr225"&gt;Zavarache, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Like the rest of the FND, Ralea participated in the movement to depose the monarchist premier, General [[Nicolae Rădescu]]. Faced with the PCdR's obstructionism, Rădescu approached Ralea with an alternative offer: the Ploughmen's Front was to form a new government with no communist ministers. Ralea divulged this offer to the Soviet envoy, [[Andrey Vyshinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1945, together with 10 other academics (among them Balmuș, Parhon, Rosetti and Oțetea), he signed a letter of protest, accusing Rădescu of stalling land reform and of undermining the work of the [[Allied Commission]].&lt;ref name="citeroarea"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cicerone Ionițoiu, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/aldine/history/asa-a-inceput-teroarea-92991 "Așa a început teroarea"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts Minister and ambassador===

Front row, from the right: General [[Grigore Vasiliu Rășcanu]], [[Teohari Georgescu]], [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], Groza, Gheorghiu-Dej, [[Chivu Stoica]], [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]]. Ralea is visible second row, between Georgescu and Tătărescu]]
Bloody clashes ensued in Bucharest, most of them between anticommunists and communist agents.&lt;ref name="citeroarea"/&gt; They signaled a new political crisis, and forced the FND into power. Ralea was made [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]] on March 6, 1945, when Groza took the premiership from the deposed General Rădescu.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 127, 154; Vasile (2010), pp. 71–72; Zavarache, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1945 Ralea was one of the rapporteurs at the Ploughmen's Front largest-ever General Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 1946, he also took over the Ministry of Religious Affairs, replacing the disgraced [[Constantin Burducea]] until August (when Groza himself replaced him in this function).&lt;ref&gt;George Enache, "Strategii de infiltrare și atragere la colaborare a cultelor religioase elaborate de autoritățile procomuniste din România în perioada 1945-1947, cu o privire specială asupra cazului Bisericii Ortodoxe Române", in ''Caietele CNSAS'', Nr. 1/2008, pp. 74, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea became one of several intellectuals who were mobilized to run on the Ploughmen's Front (and FND) list in the [[Romanian general election, 1946|1946 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 273; Cioroianu, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as minister, Ralea set in motion the purge of PNȚ-ist functionaries and of artists perceived by the PCdR as pro-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, pp. 187–188, 190; Vasile (2010), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; He extended his personal protection to [[Șerban Cioculescu]], who became Iași University professor in 1946 upon Ralea's intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also pursued his projects for workers' education, authorizing the establishment of a workers' theatrical troupe, ''[[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Teatrul Muncitoresc CFR Giulești]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; He also republished his 1930s travel accounts, completed with notes from his trip to [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], as ''Nord-Sud'' ("North-South").&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 285–291; Vianu, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, Ralea stepped down from the Ministry of Arts, only to be appointed [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]]. Reputedly, he was a last minute replacement for the Union of Patriots' [[Dumitru Bagdasar]]. The latter had fallen severely ill,&lt;ref name="abasclepios"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandra Bellow]], [http://www.revista22.ro/articol-1115.html "Asclepios versus Hades în România (II)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 755, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; but was also seen as a political liability by the American side—Ralea, as a former monarchist, was preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's own arrival in Washington was delayed by his inclusion on the Romanian delegation to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]], and he finally landed on American soil in October.&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28; Zavarache, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; He supported a détente in [[Romania–United States relations|Romanian–American relations]], after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] had refused to recognize the Groza cabinet. In front of American criticism, he played down the electoral fraud of 1946, claiming that it was within the "normal" boundaries, at some 5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127. See also Zavarache, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea was also tasked with undermining the reputation of the anticommunist opposition and with popularizing communism among [[Romanian American]] exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28; Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The anticommunist press responded by calling Ralea "a liaison man" of the [[Politburo]], tasked with planting [[Stalinism]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dushnyck, "Stalin's Pan-Slavism in the United States", in ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', Nr. 30/1948, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among expatriate Romanians, Ralea and his legation staff had difficulties convincing [[Maruca Cantacuzino|Maruca]] and [[George Enescu]], but persuaded [[Dimitrie Gusti]] to return to Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also approached the former backers of Carol's regime. He build a connection with the industrialist [[Nicolae Malaxa]], but found vocal adversaries in [[Max Auschnitt]] and [[Richard Franasovici]].&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Going against Soviet policies and his own government, Ralea also sought to obtain American foreign aid, and even political interventions. His persistence in this regard contributed to the relief effort organized by [[Cortlandt V.R. Schuyler|General Schuyler]] in famine-stricken [[Western Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt; However, the assistance fell below Ralea's expectations, owing to various factors, one of which was American suspicion that Groza was diverting food to relieve the [[Soviet famine of 1946–47|Soviet famine]]; meanwhile, diaspora voices repeatedly argued that Ralea was playing down the scale of famine, and also insinuated that he was embezzling funds.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; In his reports to Bucharest, Ralea complained that: "America's attitude toward us was oscillating between hostility and ignorance. All doors were closed. [...] We were seen as a Soviet branch office, and people were discouraged from giving us any sort of assistance."&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he was shocked by Truman's ignorance of Romanian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_raport_american_despre_romnia_din_1949 "Un raport american despre România din 1949"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 48/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's diplomatic mission was also tainted by his difficult lifestyle, including his noticeable [[hypochondriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 207, 267&lt;/ref&gt; but also his philandering. Ralea had appointed his mistress as [[cultural attaché]], but she deserted her post and left to Mexico while Ioana Ralea took up residence in the Romanian embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, p. 27; Nastasă (2010), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

With the looming threat of Soviet-style [[Collectivization in Romania|collectivization]], Ralea informed the Americans that Romanian peasants valued individual property.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, during his January 1947 interview with [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]], he pleaded emotionally for Romanians not to be left "behind the [[Iron Curtain]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127; Deaconescu, p. 29; Zavarache, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; He was still the country's ambassador when King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] was forced to abdicate by the PCdR officials and a [[Communist Romania|communized people's republic]] was proclaimed. Nevertheless, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ana Pauker]] greatly reduced his influence in Washington, transferring many of his attributes to a communist diplomat, [[Grigore Preoteasa]].&lt;ref name="zavr225"/&gt; In June, Ralea also became chairman of a Romanian Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, which was dedicated to the spread of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Florin C. Stan, "Relațiile bilaterale România—Israel (1948–1959). O cronologie", in ''Caiete Diplomatice'', Vol. 2, Issue 2, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist marginalization and recovery===
A scandal erupted in July 1948, when the Raleas were denied access to the diplomats' beach in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], having been blacklisted as "communists". Ioana Ralea endangered her husband's position by protesting against this qualifier; at home, rumor spread that the couple was planning to defect.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was able to persuade Pauker not to recall him, and even organized a reception in her honor during October 1948;&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; he also organized a communist counter-manifestation upon Michael's arrival to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marius Ghilezan, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/De-ce-toti-presedintii-Romaniei-s-au-temut-de-Regele-Mihai-I*articleID_26028-articles_details.html "De ce toți președinții României s-au temut de Regele Mihai I?"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 597, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While still abroad, Ralea had run in the formal [[Romanian legislative election, 1948|election of March 1948]], taking a Fălciu seat in the [[Great National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 310–311; Zavarache, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed him to return to a secure position after [[Mihai Magheru]] took over as Ambassador, in late 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 226, 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Resuming his scholarly work, Ralea had to refrain from calling himself a "sociologist", as that field of research had been declared "reactionary".&lt;ref&gt;Zamfir ''et al.'', pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt; He was again given the position of psychology chair at the University of Bucharest, and was also made a member of the new [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History|Institute of History and Philosophy]], whose president was Constantinescu-Iași. Ralea was seconded there by [[Constantin Ionescu Gulian]], with whom he did research into the history of Romanian materialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 237–246&lt;/ref&gt; He also prepared an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] tract, ''Explicarea omului'' ("Explaining Man"). Translated into the French by [[Eugène Ionesco]],&lt;ref name="apmorală3"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Antonio Patraș]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/PATRASfeb7.html "Pentru o morală a grației (III)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; it was published at [[Presses Universitaires de France]].&lt;ref name="feexpl418"&gt;François Evain, "Revue des livres. Mihai Ralea, ''Explication de l'Homme''", in ''Études'', Nr. 6/1950, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1948, he had been accepted into the [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|recently purged]] [[Romanian Academy]], at the same time as Balmuș, [[Raluca Ripan]], [[Grigore Moisil]], [[Ștefan Milcu]], [[Camil Petrescu]], and PCdR historian [[Mihail Roller]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 300–302&lt;/ref&gt; A contributor to the PCdR daily, ''[[Scînteia]]'', as well as to its youth supplement and its cultural reviews (''Studii'', ''[[Contemporanul]]'', etc.),&lt;ref name="mstr586"/&gt; Ralea also sat on the editorial staff of the Academy Historical Section's trimonthly, ''Buletin Științific'', alongside Roller, [[David Prodan]], and [[Constantin Moisil]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Berindei]], "''Buletin Științific''", in ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei românești'', [[Editura Științifică și Enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1978, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Workers' Party (as the PCdR was known after absorbing the PSDR) was collecting evidence incriminating Ralea. In October 1949, taking its cue from Roller and [[Leonte Răutu]], the party press carried notes critical of Ralea and Gulian's research.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 242–247&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Roller suggested that Ralea's introduction to the works of [[Vasile Conta]] was not up to Marxist standards, and also hinted that Ralea held too many offices.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Securitate]] secret police opened a file on him, which recorded his criticism of Roller and other "ignoramuses" promoted by the regime; in exchange, the Securitate labeled Ralea "opportunistic" and "a danger to our regime."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1950, his office at the Institute was infiltrated by informants, and probably also [[Covert listening device|bugged]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea responded to the pressures by presenting his services as an anti-American propagandist, making his first-hand experience in America into an irreplaceable asset; this assignment was inaugurated in January 1951, when Ralea and Gulian published in ''Studii'' a piece addressing the immorality of "[[American imperialism|American imperialists]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; Working under direct Soviet supervision, Ralea took charge of a research project endorsed by the entire Institute: ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman al psihologiei americane'' ("The Anti-Science and Anti-Humanity Nature of American Psychology", published 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 248–249, 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; He was again able to rescue Vianu, this time from communist persecution,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 308–309; Vasile (2010), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; and intervened to save the career of writer [[Costache Olăreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cronicar, [http://www.romlit.ro/act4099 "Actualitatea: Costache Olăreanu par lui-même"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 40/1999&lt;/ref&gt; More discreetly, he paid the bills of his former teacher, Rădulescu-Motru, who had been expelled from academia,&lt;ref name="zavr256"/&gt; and rescued from eviction the conductor [[George Georgescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not protect either his brother-in-law Suchianu, who was arrested and held in communist prisons,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334; Zavarache, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; nor Chelariu, who was sacked and had to work as a rat-catcher.&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"/&gt; His disciple, [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguist]] [[Tatiana Slama-Cazacu]], was forced to abandon her doctorate studies because of her political nonconformism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Al. Niculescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/requiem_pentru_o_savant "Requiem pentru o savantă"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea still had friendly contacts with his former supervisors in Foreign Affairs, though he complained to his peers that Pauker was snubbing him.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea, who had fallen out with the Workers' Party regime and spent time in prison, later alleged that Ralea, "the impenitent servant", cultivated the friendship of communist women, from Pauker to [[Liuba Chișinevschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/extraordinarul_petre_pandrea_i "Extraordinarul Petre Pandrea (I)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea witnessed Pauker's 1952 downfall and banishment, and reputedly kept himself informed about her activities through mutual acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Brătescu]], ''Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2003, p. 268.  {{ISBN|973-50-0425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own survival in the post-Pauker era was an unusual feat. According to Pandrea, it was possible only because Ralea was "without scruples", always ready for a "cowardly submission", and a "valet" of Workers' Party potentates such as [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]].&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt; As a sign that he was still protected by the regime, in February 1953 Ralea was awarded the [[Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic|Star of the People's Republic]], Second Class.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt; A close bond existed between Ralea and the Workers' Party chief, [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who began cultivating his very own intellectual circle after engineering Pauker's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 161; Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in early 1953 signaled a path toward less dogmatism. This initially hurt Ralea: ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman'', now seen as embarrassing, was not given mass circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ralea supported Gheorghiu-Dej's adoption of a [[National communism in Romania|national communist]] platform, which was presented as an alternative to Soviet control.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Over the early 1950s, he had grown disgusted and alarmed by the impact of communist policies in education, but still fearful of approaching the topic in his dealings with communist potentates.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, with the relaxation of political pressures, he went public with his criticism, issued as a report to the Workers' Party leadership. It spoke about the poor scientific standards at Romania's universities, and criticized the appointment of political workers as school principals.&lt;ref&gt;Cristian Vasile, "Propaganda and Culture in Romania at the Beginning of the Communist Regime", in [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] (ed.), ''Stalinism Revisited: The Establishment of Communist Regimes in East-Central Europe''. [[Central European University|CEU Press]], Budapest, 2009, pp. 378–379.  {{ISBN|978-963-9776-63-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also condemned the Art Ministry for promoting "mediocrities" as cultural inspectors,&lt;ref&gt;Vasile (2010), pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; but avoided any proposal for actual liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957, the Romanian school of psychology had been relaunched, and its official publications recommended Ralea as a main reference, but without mentioning ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman''.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 236, 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, some Romanian anticommunist circles also began taking an interest in Ralea, vainly hoping that he would be appointed premier of a [[De-Stalinization in Romania|post-Stalinist Romania]].&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"/&gt;

===Final years===
[[File:Bucuresti, Romania, Cimitirul Bellu Ortodox (Mormantul lui Mihai Ralea).JPG|thumb|300px|Ralea's grave at [[Bellu cemetery]]]]
In 1956, the psychology section became an independent Institute, and Ralea became its chairman.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 255"&gt;Zavarache, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Ralea published his historical essay on French politics and culture, ''Cele două Franțe'' ("The Two Frances"). It came out in a 1959 French edition, as ''Les Visages de France'', with a preface by [[Roger Garaudy]].&lt;ref name="adf253"&gt;Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Traditions of Invention: Romanian Ethnic and Social Stereotypes in Historical Context'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 2013, p. 253.  {{ISBN|978-90-04-21617-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also one of the select few Romanians, most of them trusted figures of the regime, who could reissue selections from their interwar literary contributions, at the specialized state company [[Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă]]. Ralea was one of the first in this series, with the 1957 ''Scrieri din trecut'' ("Writings from the Past).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/istoria_unei_ediii "Istoria unei ediții"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 8/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a similar understanding with the regime, Ralea and other dignitaries could publish accounts of their travels in capitalist countries—in Ralea's case, the 1959 ''În extremul occident'' ("Into the Far West").&lt;ref name="adf253"/&gt; It had comments on the "iron fisted rule" of the [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]], and gibes at "the putrefied lazy specimens" of "exploiters" in [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|pre-communist Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was nevertheless active in reintegrating culturally some intellectuals who had been imprisoned and [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]: together with one such figure, Constantin I. Botez, he wrote the 1958 ''Istoria psihologiei'' ("History of Psychology").&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 149; (2010), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; According to memoirist C. D. Zeletin, Ralea and Vianu had a "courageous and noble" stand after the [[Bucharest student movement of 1956|student protest of 1956]]: acting together, they obtained the release from Securitate custody of Dumitru D. Panaitescu, son of the critic [[Perpessicius]].&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Zeletin, "Perpessicius, sau Pentru ca fresca să nu se șteargă (1)", in ''Acolada'', Nr. 12/2014, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea and his family lived at a luxurious villa on Washington Street, [[Dorobanți]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 36, 118, 197&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he had been re-inducted into the literary canon, mentioned in official manuals as one of sixteen critics whose work supported "socialist construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/canonul_literar_proletcultist_iii "Canonul literar proletcultist (III)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 29/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Ralea and Vianu mounted campaign for Marxist humanism, and were elected to the National Board of [[UNESCO]] (Ralea was its vice president). Their actions were condemned at the time by the exile writer [[Virgil Ierunca]], who described their "solemn agitation" as a new ruse on the part of Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Laszlo Alexandru]], [http://193.226.7.140/~laszlo/eleonardo/n18/Laszlo7.htm "Domnul T."], in ''E-Leonardo'', Nr. 18/2012; retrieved July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also sent abroad with a dossier on exile writer [[Vintilă Horia]], who had received the [[Prix Goncourt]]. It showed evidence of Horia's support for interwar fascism. Ralea's mission was hampered by revelations about his own compromises with fascism, published in ''[[Le Monde]]'', ''[[Paris-Presse]]'' and the Romanian diaspora press, under such titles as: "Ralea used to [[Roman salute|lift his arm really high]]".&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt; According to later assessments, the Horia affair and Ralea's participation therein were instrumented by the Securitate.&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 312; {{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ultimul_mesaj_al_lui_vintil_horia "Ultimul mesaj al lui Vintilă Horia"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 50/2008; Geo Vasile, [http://www.romlit.ro/vintil_horia_exorcist_al_exilului "Vintilă Horia, exorcist al exilului"], in ''România Literară'', Nr. 30/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Adhering to the official cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Mihai, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cerberul-ceausescu-contra-lui-zaharia-stancu-agentul-sigurantei "Cerberul Ceaușescu contra lui Zaharia Stancu, 'agentul Siguranței'"], in ''Historia'', March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but he was honored with the vice presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; and a seat on the republican [[State Council of Romania|Council of State]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334; S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a [[Geneva]] conference on the [[generation gap]], alongside [[Louis Armand]], [[Claude Autant-Lara]], and [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;C. V., "Bibliographie critique. ''La vie et le temps. Les générations dans le monde actuel. Texte des conférences et entretiens des Rencontres internationales de Genève 1962''", in ''Population'', Nr. 3/1964, p. 604&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, [[Traian Herseni]]. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they published ''Sociologia succesului'' ("The Sociology of Success"); Herseni used the pseudonym ''Traian Hariton''.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, p. 703; Straje, p. 323; Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 7; Zavarache, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such interventions, Ralea was publicly shamed by the dissident poet [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]], who nicknamed him the communist "Viceroy", or "Immo-Ralea".&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his younger colleague George C. Basiliade, Ralea was an "unfulfilled sybarite", whose luxurious lifestyle did not fit his physical frame and his background.&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy smoker, and prone to culinary excesses, Ralea checked himself in [[Otopeni]] hospital showing symptoms of [[facial nerve paralysis]], with [[hypertension]] and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 437–438&lt;/ref&gt; Against the advice of his doctors, he decided to attend a UNESCO meeting in [[Copenhagen]]. He died aboard the train, outside [[East Berlin]], on the morning of August 17, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 438. See also S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; His body was transported back to Bucharest, and buried at [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], Bucharest, 1972, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and Herseni had been working on a textbook, ''Introducere în psihologia socială'' ("Companion to Social Psychology"), which only saw print in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 702, 703&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of culture==

===Generic traits===
As seen by Zavarache, Ralea was a man of "outstanding intelligence" with an "encyclopedic knowledge, tightly aligned with the rhythms of Western culture."&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 187, 189&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's contemporaries left remarks on not just his hyperactivity, but also his neglect of details, and his eclecticism. [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]] remarked of "petulant" Ralea: "Here is a soul who will not stand for the label of specialization!"&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Eugen Lovinescu]] dismissed Ralea as "a fecund ideologue, paradoxical in his association and dissociation of varied and superficial ideals that have happened to have points of contact with Romanian literature."&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He reads both Ralea and Suchianu as displays of "useless erudition" and "failure of logic".&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 117, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Completing this verdict, [[Monica Lovinescu]] saw Ralea as "not truly a literary critic", but "a sociologist, a psychologist, a moralist—a moralist with no morals, and yet a moralist".&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 483–484&lt;/ref&gt; More leniently, [[George Călinescu]] noted that Ralea was an "[[Epicureanism|epicurean]]" of "vivid intelligence", who only chronicled "books that he has enjoyed reading". His free associations of concepts were "very often surprising, quite often admirable".&lt;ref name="gc911"/&gt; Ralea, Călinescu proposes, was Romania's own "little [[Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]".&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt;

After his French sojourn, Ralea infused Poporanism and collectivism with both [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'s corporatism&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 118. See also Vianu, p. 146; Zavarache, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s theory of "[[class consciousness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In his earliest work, he also referenced [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]]'s ideas about the [[Conflict theories|fundamental inequality]] of class-based societies. These references helped him build a critique of innate "class solidarity" as presumed by early corporatism, and also of Proudhon's [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, pp. 27, 101–102, 144, 147, 149, 152, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this collectivist-functionalist outlook, and although he spoke out against [[art for art's sake]], Ralea was adamant that strictly sociological explanations of creativity were doomed to fail. As he put it, all attributes of a writer were "subsidiary to [his] creative originality".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea reduced [[aestheticism]] and [[social determinism]] to the basic units of "aesthetics" and "ethnicity". As he saw it, an ethnic consciousness was biologically and psychologically necessary: it helped structure perception, giving humans a reference point between the particularity and generality.&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, p. 195; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 128–129, 130; E. Lovinescu, pp. 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; An artist, Ralea argued in 1925, was "obliged" to address the national society he lived in, "at the present stage in civilization": "If he were human, he would be discarding specificity itself, that is to say the very essence of art, and would fall into science; if he were too specific, too original, he'd stand to lose his means of expression, the point of contact with his public".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea believed that the origin of beauty was biological, before being human or social; he also claimed (questionably so, according to art critic [[Petru Comarnescu]]) that traditional society allowed no depiction of ugliness before the arrival of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;

With this analysis of aesthetic principles, borrowing from [[Henri Bergson]], Ralea toned down his own rationalism and determinism, taking in [[relativism]] and [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; With his respect for critical intuition, his critique of determinism, and his cosmopolitanism, he came unexpectedly close to the aestheticism of his rival Lovinescu, and, though him, to the "aesthetic autonomism" of [[Titu Maiorescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 151–152; Ornea (1998), pp. 146–147, 377&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea even sketched out his own relativist theory, according to which works of art could have limitless interpretations (or "unforeseen significances"),&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; thus unwittingly paralleling, or anticipating, the [[semiotics]] of [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="agutopia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex Goldiș, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/10/adrian-marino-si-utopia-teoriei-literaturii/ "Adrian Marino și utopia teoriei literaturii"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 343, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Între două lumi'', he still rejected individualism and subjectivity, but also nuanced his corporatist collectivism. As he noted, militancy in favor of either philosophy had sparked the modern crisis. The solution, Ralea suggested, was for man to rediscover the simple joys of anonymity.&lt;ref name="pcom193-194"/&gt;

===National psychology===
In his essay ''Fenomenul Românesc'' ("The Romanian Phenomenon"), Ralea elaborated on the issue of Romanian [[national psychology]]. He understood this as a natural development of [[Dimitrie Gusti]]'s sociological "science of the nation", but better suited to the topic and more resourceful.&lt;ref&gt;Verdery, pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea, Romanians were structurally opposed to mysticism, which could not compliment their true character: "good-natured, even-minded, sharp-witted like all meridional men, [and] extremely lucid."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The "Romanian soul" was therefore an adaptable and pragmatic entity, mixing a Western propensity for action with a [[Levant]]ine [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, p. 195; Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Combating antisemitism, Ralea applied this theory to the issue of [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|European Jewish intelligence]]: quoting [[Werner Sombart]], he deduced that the "rationalist", "progressive" and "utilitarian" essence of Jewishness was socially determined by the Jews' participation in capitalist competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Oișteanu]], ''Inventing the Jew. Antisemitic Stereotypes in Romanian and Other Central East-European Cultures'', [[University of Nebraska Press]], Lincoln, 2009, pp. 56, 149.  {{ISBN|978-0-8032-2098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ralea was personally responsible for establishing a laboratory of [[experimental psychology]] at Iași, he in fact abhorred experimental methods, and preferred to rely on intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 188, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; As a theorist, he gave a humanistic praise to dilettantism and vitality, in the face of philosophical sobriety. He commended [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], the creator of modern [[Romanian humor]], as the voice of lucidity, equating irony with intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Călinescu, Ralea "either intentionally or unconsciously [suggests] that intense flippancy is in fact sobriety".&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; Ralea did have his uncertainties about the grounding of his own idea. Caragiale's humor risked making Romanians too accepting of their superficiality: "maybe this genius portraitist of our bourgeoisie has done us a great harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/iari_despre_caragiale "Iarăși despre Caragiale"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 16/2006&lt;/ref&gt; During his polemic with ''[[Sburătorul]]'' modernism, Ralea attacked the new schools of aesthetics for their artificiality and obsessiveness: "Not one of the truly terrible chapters in life is familiar to [the modernists]. They are not humans, just clowns. [...] Only the demented and children are unilateral. True aesthetics expresses the mature and normal spiritual functions. The alternative is comparative or infantile aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; According to Monica Lovinescu, his critique of "lassitude" and "cowardice" in urban life is "a severe diagnostic of his own disease."&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

On such grounds, Ralea concluded that Romanian writers "have had no deep spiritual experience", lacking "a comprehension of humanity, of life and death."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In a notorious socio-critical essay, first published in ''Perspective'', Ralea asked: "Why Did We Not Produce a Novel?". He contended that the grand epic genre, unlike the short story, did not yet suit the Romanian psyche, since it required discipline, anonymity, and a "great moral significance".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 187–188; Vianu, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He also postulated a deterministic relationship between the staples of ancestral [[Romanian folklore]] and modern literary choices: in the absence of any ambitious poetic cycles (as found in Western literature), Romanian ballads and ''[[Doina|doine]]'' had naturally mutated into novellas.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In order to mend such a historical disadvantage, he set himself the goal of writing his own novel, but eventually gave up on the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 153, 154&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its writing, the essay claimed to count only a few living novelists; by 1935, however, there was already talk of an "inflation of novels".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/carte/articol/granta-romania#"Granta de România"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 502, September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conformist Marxism===
In a 1945 interview with writer [[Ion Biberi]], Ralea explained himself as a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]], influenced by [[André Malraux]] and by unspecified "recent Russian doctrinaires".&lt;ref name="istnm28"/&gt; Expanding on his earlier stances, he understood the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] as both desirable and inevitable, to be received with "enthusiasm" by the masses: "[it] provides practically infinite production opportunities, because it excludes personal gain and is no longer dominated by the game of markets, of supply and demand."&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived of a socialism wherein "man, integrated with communal life, shall have full liberty in his actions".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to political scientist [[Ioan Stanomir]], Ralea's discourse is to be read as a "celebration of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The transformation was accelerated during Ralea's last 15 years of life. Around 1950, Ralea was studying [[Marxist aesthetics]] and [[Marxist literary criticism]], advising young literati, and his colleague Vianu, to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} G. Pienescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/70_via-a-romaneasca-1-2-2011/49_note-din-launtru/793_sub-vremi.html "...sub vremi"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 1&amp;ndash;2/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also going back on his cosmopolitanism, seeing it as an obstacle to the proper understanding of Romanian society.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Christian Maner, "Noțiunea de Europa din perspectiva științei istorice românești", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching aid for social psychology was similarly adjusted, introducing chapters on "class psychology", though, as Zavarache argues, these modifications were "surprisingly kept to a minimum".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in his reedited ''Scrieri din trecut'', Ralea sought to reconcile Ibrăileanu's [[social Darwinism]] with the official readings of Marxism, as well as with [[Lysenkoism|Michurinism]] and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Teodora Dumitru, "«Selecție» și «mutație»: două concepte pentru explicarea fenomenului literar", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Vol. VII, Issue 2, 2011, pp. 44, 48, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaped by political command, ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman'' excoriated American psychologists as tools of the capitalist regime, claiming that capitalism cultivated "force", "triviality", and "sexual debauchery"; Ralea also stated his outrage at the absence of socialized health care in the United States, even though he privately explained that American workers led "satisfactory" lives.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; To his peers, Ralea complained that "the adoption of a Marxist canon was stifling his ability to interpret", and therefore prevented him from "elaborating valuable papers."&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; He "doubtlessly never imagined that there would be such excess and distortion", and tried to persuade [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]] not to exaggerate his works' anti-Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 251, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Explicarea omului'', Vianu notes, Ralea brought up "a fundamental cultural motif, man's urge to create himself ''obstacles'' and consequently break through them with his natural instinct [Vianu's emphasis]."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea, brute ethics existed as "a mechanism for social self-regulation", which helped to distill the "[[Élan vital|vital impulse]]", whereas the accomplished human being would internalize its requirements and verify them against his own rationality.&lt;ref name="apmorală3"/&gt; Overall, Ralea contended that "[[dialectical materialism]] has the complete answer to any fundamental issue regarding social structuring". That answer was in "[[Base and superstructure|superstructures]]", and the references were Marx, [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], alongside [[Ludwig Klages]] and [[Max Scheler]].&lt;ref name="feexpl418"/&gt; According to philosopher François Evain, Ralea's study failed as a work of [[psychological anthropology]], and merely showed "what superstructures become under Marxist materialism."&lt;ref name="feexpl418"/&gt; Contrarily, critic [[Antonio Patraș]] noted the links between ''Explicarea omului'' (a "brilliant study") and Ralea's earlier contributions to sociology.&lt;ref name="apmorală3"/&gt;

''Sociologia succesului'' was to some extent dependent on Ralea's study of Durkheim's ''[[The Division of Labour in Society|Division of Labor]]'', with its distinction between laws of punishment and laws of restitution (or reward). Ralea maintained that remedial sanctions were a characteristic of modern civilized society, and that the [[social fact]] of "success" was created within that setting.&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, pp. 547–548&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work was heavily reliant on [[Marxist sociology]], hypothesizing that socialist societies had perfected new incentives for workers to set collective objectives and succeed at them.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huhnwald, "Bibliographie. Ralea M., Hariton T., ''Sociologia succesului''", in ''Revue Française de Sociologie'', Nr. 2/1964, pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Edgar Krau, Ralea and Herseni gave credibility to "the tenet that the individualistic ethics of capitalism disunites and hurts people"; however, they ignored the reality of communism, which was "not [its] collectivism, but the all-pervading party tuition".&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Krau, ''Social and Economic Management in the Competitive Society'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], Dordrecht, 1998, pp. 36–37.  {{ISBN|0-7923-8028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, ''Sociologia succesului'' was mainly noted for reintegrating professional (albeit antiquated) references to American psychology and sociology.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 255"/&gt; It marked a fundamental step in the restoration of Romanian sociology, and also allowed Ralea to publish again on a subject which had preoccupied him since 1944.&lt;ref name="cz&amp;al7"&gt;Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ralea was survived by his only child, daughter Catinca Ralea (1929–1981). In her twenties, she cultivated a literary circle which included poet [[Geo Dumitrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a career in letters, before becoming a [[Radio Romania International]] reporter and [[Romanian Television]] producer.&lt;ref name="acfresh"&gt;Alice Caster, "A Short, Fresh Look At Canadian Life", in ''[[The Ottawa Journal]]'', March 18, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 157; (2010), pp. 307, 517&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Catinca provided live coverage of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, including the first [[Moon landing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Un mare comentator sportiv – Ion Ghiţulescu", in ''Buletin de Istoria Presei'', Issues 8–9/2015, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she is remembered for her translations from [[J. D. Salinger]] (which fed Romania's [[counterculture of the 1960s]])&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Brumaru]], "Crepusculul civil de dimineață.

Mihai Ralea's death, coinciding with a spell of liberalization, created unexpected room for maneuver for a younger generation of literary critics and historians, who were anti-sociological, subjectivist, and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]].&lt;ref&gt;Florin Mihăilescu, ''De la proletcultism la postmodernism'', Editura Pontica, Constanța, 2002, pp. 117–118.  {{ISBN|973-9224-63-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some members of this intellectual school, such as [[Adrian Marino]]&lt;ref name="agutopia"/&gt; and [[Matei Călinescu]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Axinte]], "Modele ale criticii literare postbelice. E. Lovinescu, G. Ibrăileanu, G. Călinescu", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Nr. 2/2011, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; continued to draw inspiration from Ralea, having rediscovered his early Bergsonian essays. They were joined in this by [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]], the novelist and Marxist literary theorist.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 395–398&lt;/ref&gt; From within the anti-communist movement, Ralea was defended by author [[Nicolae Steinhardt]]. Although a devout Orthodox, Steinhardt treasured the non-believers Ralea and [[Paul Zarifopol]] for their "quick wit".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Simion]], "Nicolae Steinhardt", in ''Caiete Critice'', Issues 1–2/2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] and the fall of communism, Ralea's Dobrina estate was transferred by government order to the [[Diocese of Huși|Orthodox Diocese of Huși]], and came to host a convent.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; His Dorobanți villa, which Catinca Ralea had sold, bears a memorial plaque honoring the sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 197, 325&lt;/ref&gt; By Government Act 503/1998, the Romanian Academy Institute of Psychology was renamed ''Mihai Ralea Institute''.&lt;ref&gt;"Guvernul României. Hotărârea nr. 503/1998 privind modificarea denumirii unor unități de cercetare din subordinea Academiei Române", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Part I, Nr. 307/1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Huși library, also named after Ralea, has been hosting the entire corpus of his works since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.vrn.ro/biblioteca-husi-are-acum-intreaga-colectie-a-scrierilor-lui-mihai-ralea "Biblioteca Huși are acum întreaga colecție a scrierilor lui Mihai Ralea!"], in ''Vremea Nouă'', November 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's early sociological writings were republished, as ''Fenomenul Românesc'', in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 355, 376&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his sociological contribution was being reassessed in various ways, leading to a reissue of his essays as a 1997 volume, put out by [[Constantin Schifirneț]] at [[Editura Albatros]].&lt;ref name="zavr187–188"/&gt; Around 1995, a heated public debate erupted, focusing on the careers of leftist intellectuals such as Ralea, and their supposed acts of self-betrayal. The central question, brought up by researcher [[Marin Nițescu]], was: would they have done better not to publish at all under communism?&lt;ref&gt;Vasile (2010), pp. 21, 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a group of sociologists defended Ralea's prestige, noting that "we [Romanians] are inexcusably delaying in recognizing Mihai Ralea's sociological contribution".&lt;ref name="cz&amp;al7"/&gt;

The '''Northern''' or '''Northwestern''' is a [[genre]] in various arts which tell stories set primarily in the later half of the 19th century in the north of North America, primarily in [[Canada]] but also in [[Alaska]].  It is similar to the [[Western (genre)|Western genre]] but many elements are different, as appropriate to its setting.  It is common for central character to be a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mountie]] instead of a [[cowboy]] or [[sheriff]].  Other common characters include fur trappers and traders, [[lumberjack]]s, [[Prospecting|prospectors]], [[First Nations]] people, settlers and townsfolk.

International interest in the region and the genre was fuelled by the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896–99) and subsequent works surrounding it, fiction and non-fiction.  The genre was extremely popular in the inter-war years of the twentieth century.  Northerns are still produced but popularity waned in the late 1950s.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Nwmp 1900.jpg|thumb|The North-West Mounted Police, and later the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], were often the heroes of Northern fiction]]
[[File:Yukon Donjek Valley 001.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Yukon]] (occasionally near the [[Canada–United States border|Alaskan border]]) was a common setting for Northern fiction.]]
Northerns are similar to [[Western (genre)|westerns]] but are set in the frozen north of [[North America]]; that is, [[Canada]] or [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chasing the Sun: A Reader's Guide to Novels Set in the American West|first=Edward Joseph|last=Beverly|publisher=Sunstone Press|year=2008|isbn=9780865346031|chapter=Preface|page=11|quote=Some book reviewers, however, contend that the one thing all Western settings have in common is aridity, and wouldn't consider novels set in Missouri or along the Pacific Coast or in the other non-arid regions to be Western fiction. Some include stories set in Canada and Alaska; others differentiate these as 'Northerns.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the two, Canada was the most common setting, although many tropes could apply to both.  Popular locations within Canada are the [[Yukon]], the [[Barren Grounds]], and area around [[Hudson Bay]].&lt;ref name="Pronzini"&gt;{{cite book|title=Six-Gun in Cheek|first=Bill|last=Pronzini|chapter=The Bull Moose and Other Scourges of the Frozen North|publisher=Courier Dover|year=2017|isbn=9780486820347|quote=Northerns—tales set in the rough-and-tumble frontier days of Alaska, the Yukon, the Canadian Barrens, the Hudsons's Bay region—were a popular adjunct to the Western story during the first half of this century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generic names used for this general setting included the "Far North", the "Northlands", the "North Woods", and the "Great Woods".

Common settings include [[Boreal forest of Canada|boreal forests]], isolated cabins, and mining towns.&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt; Snow featured to such an extent that Northern films were sometimes termed "snow pictures".&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;  Animals were a common feature too.  Dogs and [[dog sled]]s were popularized by ''The Call of the Wild'' and ''White Fang''.  Scenes involving attacks by bears date back to ''The Klondyke Nugget''.&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;

The primary antagonist in a Northern can be the wilderness, the weather and other natural elements, which the protagonists must endure, overcome and survive.&lt;ref name="Hutchison"&gt;{{cite book|year=1998|chapter=Introduction: Scarlet Fiction|title=The Scarlet Riders|first=Don|last=Hutchison|isbn=9780889626478|publisher=Mosaic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;

Northerns often explore the 'Matter of Canada' (the national mythos of Canada, after the [[Matter of Rome]]).&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt;  Common elements of which are the [[Black Donnellys|Black Donnelly murders]] (February 1880), the [[North-West Rebellion]] (1885), the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896–99), the pursuit of [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]] (January 1932), the [[October Crisis]] (October 1970), and persistent national anxiety about [[Annexation movements of Canada|potential annexation]] by the United States.&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt;

The Western idea of [[lawlessness]] set in American towns was not a part of the Canadian Northern, though individual lawbreakers or uprisings by Canadians feature in works such as ''[[Quebec (1951 film)|Quebec]]'' (1951), ''[[Riel (film)|Riel]]'' (1979), and ''[[Northwest Mounted Police (film)|Northwest Mounted Police]]'' (1940).  In Northerns and wider crime fiction, the general Canadian preference is for law enforcement to be performed by the state rather than vigilantes or private investigators.&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt;  Likewise, Northerns rarely feature the heroic outlaws often found in Westerns.&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt;  On the subject, David Skene-Melvin writes "Canada never had a Wild West because the Mounties got there first,"&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt; while [[Margaret Atwood]] writes "No outlaws or lawless men for Canada; if one appears, the Mounties always get their man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature]]|authorlink=Margaret Atwood|first=Margaret|last=Atwood|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law and order in Northerns set in Canada is most often represented by the Mounties, either the [[North-West Mounted Police]] or [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] depending on era.  Like snow, Mounties are a common enough feature to become a synonym for the genre, with Northern films sometimes called "Mountie films".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=9781134317066|section=Canada|quote='Mounties' (RCMP officers) have been widely mythologized and lampooned in Anglophone popular culture, from the dozens of early Hollywood Mountie films or 'Northerns' (''McGuire of the Mounted'', ''Rose Marie'') and popular television series ''Sergeant Preston of the Yukon'' and ''Due South'', to the cinematic spoof ''Dudley Do-Right'' [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their popularity was not confined to film; by 1930, 75 volumes of written Mountie fiction had been published, not including juvenile fiction and material published in magazines.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Best Mounted Police Stories|first=Dick|last=Harrison|publisher=University of Alberta|year=1978|isbn=9780888640543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a protagonist in a Western is often part of both civilization and the wild (whether native or criminal), Mounties in Northerns are entirely a part of civilization.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;  The nature of fictional Mounties can vary depending on the nationality of the author.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;  Mounties as written by British authors are often younger members of upper class British families serving the British Empire in the colonies.  American-authored Mounties are often little different from [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshalls]] and project the values of Westerns in that they place their individual sense of justice and conscience above their duty to the law. Canadian-authored Mounties represent, and are self-abnegating champions of, the Canadian establishment and its laws.  Further, their authority does not come from either their social class or physical abilities; such a Mountie "upholds the law by moral rather than physical force".&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;  A common story outline for Northerns involving Mounties is a pursuit, confrontation and capture: the Mountie's pursuit of a fugitive takes place across the Canadian wilderness and may be resolved non-violently.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;

According to [[Pierre Berton]] "the French-Canadian was to the northerns what the Mexican was to the westerns — an exotic primitive, adaptable as a chameleon to play a hero or a heavy."&lt;ref name=Berton&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Berton|authorlink=Pierre Berton|chapter=Hollywood's Canada|title=Canadian Culture|editor-first=Elspeth|editor-last=Cameron|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|year=1997|isbn=9781551300900}}&lt;/ref&gt; French-Canadians were a ubiquitous element of the genre.  As characters, French-Canadians are typically depicted as rustic and uneducated. These characters were usually divided into two broad types: the heroic, happy-go-lucky bon-vivant and the villainous, lecherous killer.  Some later examples merged the two stereotypes into a charming, roguish [[anti-villain]].&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  Common visual elements were a [[tuque]], a sash and a pipe.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  All were present in the first appearance in film, in ''[[A Woman's Way (film)|A Woman's Way]]'' (1908).&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  Female French-Canadian characters also followed the "tempestuous" stereotype of female Mexican characters.  Mexican actress [[Lupe Vélez]], in line with her identity as "The Mexican Spitfire", played the title character in ''[[Tiger Rose (1929 film)|Tiger Rose]]'' (1929) in this mode; as did [[Renée Adorée]] in ''[[The Eternal Struggle (film)|The Eternal Struggle]]'' (1923) and Nikki Duval in ''[[Quebec (1951 film)|Quebec]]'' (1951).&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;

A common anachronism in Northerns was the tyranny and absolute power of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and its officers, even into the modern period.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  This was repeated not just in fiction but by reviewers and critics too.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  The concept of ''La Longue Traverse'', or the Journey of Death, comes from ''[[The Call of the North (1914 film)|The Call of the North]]'' (1914) and was popular in later films.  In this, the Hudson's Bay Company executes convicts by forcing them into the wilderness without equipment or supplies.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  In 1921, the Hudson's Bay Company successfully sued the [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players-Lasky Corporation]] for the villainous portrayal of their Company in the latters' remake ''[[The Call of the North (1921 film)|The Call of the North]]''.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;

[[Alaska Natives]] or [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] are featured in some depictions.

Besides being set in [[Canadian Prairies]], the stories often contrast the [[American frontier]] with the Canadian frontier in several ways.  In films such as ''[[Pony Soldier]]'' and ''[[Saskatchewan (film)|Saskatchewan]]'' the North-West Mounted Police display reason, compassion and a sense of fair play in their dealings with [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal people]] ([[First Nations]]) as opposed to hotheaded American visitors (often criminals), lawmen or the American Army who seem to prefer [[Genocide|extermination]] with violence.

==History==
David Skene-Melvin classes the "second period" of Canadian crime literature (1880–1920), as "the heyday of the 'Northern' and the literary exploration of Canada's remote and romantic frontiers."&lt;ref name=SkeneMelvin&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Skene-Melvin|chapter=Canadian Crime Writing in English|title=Detecting Canada|editor-first=Jeannette|editor-last=Sloniowski|editor-first2=Marilyn|editor-last2=Rose|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781554589289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He refers to [[Joseph Edmund Collins]] as an important figure in this period because, despite his work being of low quality, he was the first Canadian author to address some aspects of the 'Matter of Canada' in his novels, such as ''The Story of Louis Riel: The Rebel Chief'' (1885) and ''Annette, the Métis Spy'' (1886).&lt;ref name=SkeneMelvin /&gt;  Northerns continued to be written after 1920 but Canadian authors largely moved to other genres after World War 1 as they moved away from a frontier and colonial ethos.&lt;ref name=SkeneMelvin /&gt;

The [[Klondike Gold Rush]] during the 1890s in Canada and Alaska brought a lot of wider, international attention to the far north of North America.&lt;ref name="Pronzini" /&gt;  Adventure novels from veterans of the gold rush—such as [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' (1903), [[Rex Beach]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (1906) and [[Robert W. Service]]'s ''[[The Trail of Ninety-Eight]]'' (1909)—became best sellers.&lt;ref name="Pronzini" /&gt;  These inspired more adventure fiction which grew in popularity throughout the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Pronzini" /&gt;  The genre was extremely popular in the inter-war years,&lt;ref name="Pronzini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt; with a "Mountie craze" hitting its peak during the mid-1920s.&lt;ref name="Berton" /&gt;

A large amount of Northern fiction is the work of non-Canadians.  Nevertheless, Skene-Melvin writes "Just as the Western is widely regarded as emblematic of American culture, it can be argued that the Northern is the only truly indigenous Canadian art form, even if most of its exponents have been foreigners."&lt;ref name=SkeneMelvin /&gt;

One of the earliest international examples of the genre is the British play ''The Klondyke Nugget'', which was first performed in 1898.&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;  Its author, [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] initially wrote it as a Western but changed the location to capitalize on the contemporary gold rush.&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;

[[Charlie Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin's]] 1925 film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' is a comedy that parodies some of the cliches of the Northern genre.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Solomon|title=The Gold Rush|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=9781137516114|quote=Chaplin's decision to have ''The Gold Rush'' take place during the 1897–8 Klondike Gold Rush placed it squarely within the well established Northern genre, which spanned theatre, literature and film, encompassing stories about trappers, adventurers, lumberjacks, miners, Mounties, Eskimos, and others-even animals-in the Far North.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Looney Tunes]] character [[Blacque Jacque Shellacque]], who first appeared in the 1959 short ''[[Bonanza Bunny]]'', is another parody.&lt;ref name="Hutchison" /&gt;

While the Hollywood [[Western (genre)|Western]] began to change in the post-World War 2 era and the Western myth was eventually debunked, Hollywood Northerns remained unchanged until they stopped being produced in the late 1950s and the underlying mythology was never examined.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">The '''Ondaatje Letters''' (1729-1737), are the earliest examples of private correspondence in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] prose and most probably in any languages of [[South Asia]]. It is preserved at the Cape Town Archive Repositories, [[South Africa]]. The correspondence is between one [[Nicolaas Ondaatje]] (in Tamil, Ukantācci), a ''[[Chetty|Chettiyar]]'' from [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] who was sent to the [[Cape of Good Hope]] for ten years as a punishment by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC). There are up to 50 letters addressed to Nicolaas by his family members and friends from Sri Lanka although his replies have not been preserved. 

The letters consist mainly of family matters like births and deaths, caste rules, ideas on rehabilitation to get back to Sri Lanka. The letters are noted for their ungrammatical construction, lack of punctuation and many loan words from [[Loan words in Sri Lankan Tamil|Sanskrit, Persian, Portuguese and Dutch]]. 

The members of the Ondaatje family, originally hailing from [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] made their home in Southern Sri Lanka. They have for several centuries functioned as mediators between the colonial powers and the local people. Nicolaas, a prominent member of the trading caste generally known as Chettys in Southern India and Sri Lanka, lived as a free man at the Cape during his stay. He was proficient in Tamil, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]. He was trader, accountant, physician, interpreter and schoolmaster. Nicolaas died just before his exile ended. He is considered to be a direct ancestor of authors [[Michael Ondaatje]] and [[Christopher Ondaatje]].&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpindia.org/ecrire/upload/abstracts/simon.pdf/|title=Research Theme: Ondaatje Letters (1729-1737).

'''[[Persian Empire|Persian]]-[[Sassanide]] art patterns''' have similarities with the art of the [[Bulgars]], [[Khazars]], and Saka-[[Scythians]], and have recurred in Asia. They predominantly feature motifs of fighting animals. Gold was frequently used as a base for their art creations.

== Patterns ==
The characteristic patterns of [[Empire|Persian]]-[[Sassanide]] art exhibit similarities to the art of the [[Bulgars]],&lt;ref&gt;Bulgarian's Treasures from the past by Ivan Venedikov, Sava Boyadjiev and Dimiter Kartalev, Foreign Languages Press Sofia 1965, pp. 345-55&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khazars]], and Saka-[[Scythian]], and have recurred at different locations in the [[Central Asia]] region. A "[[griffin]] fighting an [[elk]]" motif from the [[Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós]], found in 1799 in what is today [[Romania]], bears similarities with another griffin &amp; elk motif discovered in the tombs of [[Hsiung-nu]]&lt;ref&gt;The Empire of the Steppes, a History of Central Asia by Rene Grousset (transl. by Naomi Walford), Rutgers University Press, 2005, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; (early [[Huns]], also [[Xiongnu]]) during Colonel [[Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov]]&lt;ref&gt;Buddha: Radiant Awakening by Jackie Menzies, Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildlife of the Tibetan Steppe by George B. Schaller, University Of Chicago Press, 2000, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; expedition (1907–09) near [[Ulan Bator|Urga]] (Outer [[Mongolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Discoveries of the Kozlov Expedition by W. Perceval Yetts, he Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 48, No. 277 (Apr., 1926), pp. 168-185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pazirik Burial of Altai by Eugene A. Golomshtok, M. P. Griaznov in American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 37, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1933), pp. 30-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Recent Russian Archaeological Exploration by W. E. D. Allen in The Geographical Journal, Vol. 69, No. 3 (Mar., 1927), pp. 262-264&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[gold]] symbolization of "animals-in-fight" has been also found in the vicinity of the city of [[Turpan]],&lt;ref&gt;The Old Silk Road - From Xi'an to Pamir, Chapter XIII: A Tour of Turpan by Bi Yading, Chinese Intercontinental Press (CIP) 2003, p.121 ({{ISBN|7-5032-2125-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; the principal crossroad of the northern [[Silk Road]]. [[Gold]]en "animals-in-fight" have also been identified as 3rd – 2nd century B.C. [[Mongolia]] (or southern [[Siberia]]), being characteristic of [[Hsiung-nu]] or [[Xiongnu]].

==The Art of the Nomads==

The early history of the [[Nomads]] is not well recorded, which changed after their contact with cultures possessing written history. [[Nomadic people]] of the vast steppes of [[Asia]] were a major force in history.&lt;ref&gt;The Perilous Frontier by Thomas J. Barfield, lackwell Publishers, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Their power was not in the empires they built, but rather the turmoil they created among [[ancient civilizations]] such as [[China]] or [[Persia]], impacting their historical development substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Warriors of the Steppe by Erik Hildinger, De Capo Press, 1997, pp. 57-92&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the [[nomads]] ranged widely, forever moving on for sake of richer grazing for their horses and sheep.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Nomad|Migrations]] were often seasonal. Their skill at extracting [[gold]] was unprecedented.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In summer, during the tribe's seasonal migration, a [[Wool|fleece]] would be weighted on a riverbed to collect particles of [[alluvial]] [[gold]]. Upon the tribes' return, the [[Wool|fleece]] would be sheared, burned, and a [[gold]] ingot the size of a horse's hoof would result.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The ''tay tayak'' (the horse's hoof) was a unit of gold for a long period, which was used as a measure of an amount of golden metal rather than money, since gold was not fabricated as currency.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Using gold was a spiritual practice, as emblems of priestly office, prizes for physical prowess in ritual sport, or as adornment of the sacral ceremony of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Kazakhstan, Coming of Age by Michael Fergus and Janar Jandosova, Stacey International 2003, p.106 ({{ISBN|1-900988-615}})&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18777">[[File:AcademyOfMusic1870.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Academy of Music in Philadelphia.]]
The '''Philadelphia Grand Opera Company''' was the name of four different American [[opera]] companies active at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] during the twentieth century. The last and best known of the four was founded in November 1954 with the merger of the [[Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company]] and the [[Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company]]. That company in turn merged with the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] in 1975 to form the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]]. Of the three earlier companies, only one lasted beyond one season; a company founded in 1926 which later became associated with the [[Curtis Institute of Music]] in 1929. That company closed its doors in 1932 due to financial reasons during the [[Great Depression]].

==The first Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1916==
The first company to be known as the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company (PGOC) was founded in 1916. Its first production, [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'', opened on December 18 of that year at the Academy of Music with [[Regina Vicarino]] in the title role, [[Forrest Lamont]] as Edgardo, and [[Ettore Martini]] conducting. Short lived, the company produced one more opera in December 1916, [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'', before disbanding.&lt;ref name="PGOC"&gt;[[Free Library of Philadelphia]]: ''Folder: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1916&amp;ndash;1934 miscellaneous''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salmaggi's Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1920-1921==
The second company to be known as the PGOC was actually a company based out of New York City that was active in both NYC and Philadelphia. The company was founded by [[impresario]] [[Alfred Salmaggi]] (later founder of the [[Salmaggi Opera Company]]) in the spring of 1920 under the name the Italian Lyric Federation. The company's first performance at the Academy of Music was Verdi's ''[[Otello]]'' on June 30, 1920 with [[Nicola Zerola]] in the title role. The company changed its name to the PGOC in November 1920 after the financial backers fired Salmaggi. From this point on the company worked out of Philadelphia, although Salmaggi countered his firing by continuing to perform works with different singers under the name of the Italian Lyric Federation in NYC. Like the first PGOC, this company was also short lived, with its last production, ''[[Rigoletto]]'', being held on [[Halloween]] of 1921.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

==The Hammer's Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1926-1932==
The third PGOC was founded in 1926 by [[Helen Redington Carter]], socialite wife of well known Philadelphia neurologist [[Joseph Leidy (neurologist)|Joseph Leidy]], [[William Carl Hammer]], an importer and trumpeter, and his wife, [[Kathryn O'Gorman Hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HBhehuI5dbEC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=%22Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NRlEPa7ebT&amp;sig=ozVKDGEmq-SiWFQJl2NGywL_18Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0KRBSp2mM43GM7TTmcEH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Philadelphia: A Guide to the Nation's Birthplace By Federal Writers' Project at google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/07/07/archives/dr-leidy-is-dead-eminent-pby5iciam-member-of-one-of-the-oldest.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=216&amp;st=p|title=DR. LEIDY IS DEAD; EMINENT PHYSICIAN; Member of One of the Oldest Families of Philadelphia Succumbs at 66. NEUROLOGIST OF HIGH RANK Medical Director and Instructor In Gas Defense for 30th Division In World War.|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=July 7, 1932| accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Hammers ran the business side of the company, with William running the Box Office and Kathryn hiring artists, putting together sets and costumes, and sometimes directing productions. Kathryn was a bandmaster and trombonist and she was notably the world's only female opera director at that time. Mrs. Leidy served as the opera board's president and provided a considerable amount of financial backing to get the company started. She also was able to get the opera house filled, being influential among Philadelphia's high society of the day.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753128,00.html|title=Music: Philadelphia Curtain|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 2, 1931| accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the company's first year, the Hammers announced six performances for the first season.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; The company's first performance at the Academy of Music was a production of Verdi's ''[[Aida]]'' on October 28, 1926 with [[Vera Curtis]] in the title role, [[Jerome Uhl]] as the King of Egypt, [[John Sample]] as Radames, and [[Marta Wittkowska]] as Amneris. Other operas that season included ''Rigoletto'' with [[Millo Picco]] in the title role and [[Josephine Lucchese]] as Gilda, [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' with [[Charles Hart (tenor)|Charles Hart]] in the title role and [[Irene Williams]] as Marguerite, [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]'' with [[Robert Steel (baritone)|Robert Steel]] as Tonio and [[Euphemia Giannini Gregory]] as Nedda, ''Otello'' with Sample in the title role and [[Chief Caupolican]] as Iago, and ''[[Carmen]]'' with Wittkowska in the title role and [[Armand Tokatyan]] as Don José.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

During the company's first three seasons the company was struggling to get by. Kathryn was able to save the company a lot of money by making the company's costumes from [[cheesecloth]] on her home sewing-machine and begging and borrowing sets and properties at bargain prices. Largely due to her shrewd efforts the company managed to stay in the black.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; The company opened its second season on October 20, 1927 with [[Amilcare Ponchielli]]'s ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'', starring [[Clara Jacobo]] in the title role, [[Mignon Sutorius]] as Laura, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as Alvise Badoero, and [[Berta Levina]] as La cieca. Conductor [[Artur Rodziński]] joined the company that year and remained one of the PGOC's major conductors through 1929. Highlights of that second season included productions of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Tosca]]'' with [[Martha Attwood]] in the title role and [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' with [[Lisa Roma]] as Santuzza. Highlights of the 1928&amp;ndash;1929 season included [[Franco Leoni]]'s ''[[L’oracolo]]'' with {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as Uin-Sci and [[Adamo Didur]] as Cim-Fen, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'' with Sample as Samson and [[Madame Cahier]] as Dalila, [[Jules Massenet]]'s ''[[Manon]]'' with [[Hope Hampton]] in the title role and [[Ralph Errolle]] as Des Grieux, [[Eleanor Painter]] as Carmen, ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with [[Frances Peralta]] as Leonora, and ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' with [[Josephine Lucchese]] as Rosina.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

In 1929 a major [[Windfall gain|windfall]] came to the PGOC when [[Mary Louise Curtis Bok]] offered to support the company in exchange for using the company as an outlet for opera talent in the [[Curtis Institute of Music]]. The PGOC accepted the offer and a partnership was formed with Curtis students appearing mostly in minor roles with the company.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Plans were initially made to build a new $7,000,000 opera house for the company and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1927/10/15/archives/philadelphia-plans-a-new-opera-house-home-for-its-grand-opera.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=15&amp;st=p|title=PHILADELPHIA PLANS A NEW OPERA HOUSE; Home for Its Grand Opera Company and Orchestra May Cost $7,000,000|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=October 15, 1927| accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, like many projects of the day, these plans were ultimately abandoned as a result of the financial crisis of the [[Great Depression]]. Bok's support, however, did manage to keep the company afloat longer than it probably would have, producing three more seasons of opera at the Academy of Music. Indeed, the company's two major rivals, the [[Pennsylvania Grand Opera Company]] and the [[Philadelphia Civic Opera Company]], both closed their doors not long after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].&lt;ref name="Time2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882402,00.html|title=Music: Up Go Curtains|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 3, 1930| accessdate= June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its remaining years the quality of PGOC's productions increased, particularly in regards to the sets and costumes. The quality of the singers remained high.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; A highlight of these years was the United States premiere of [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Wozzeck]]'' on March 19, 1931 with [[Ivan Ivantzoff]] in the title role, [[Anne Roselle]] as Marie, [[Gabriel Leonoff]] as the Drum Major, [[Sergei Radamsky]] as Andres, [[Bruno Korell]] as the Captain, {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Steschenko|uk|3=Стешенко Іван Никифорович|vertical-align=sup}} as the Doctor, and [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting. Stokowski also conducted the world premiere of [[Carlos Chávez]] and [[Diego Rivera]]'s ballet ''[[H. P.]]'' for the PGOC on March 31, 1932. The company was also notably the first American company to perform [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' in the original German on October 29, 1931 with Roselle in the title role and [[Charlotte Boerner]] as Chrysothemis.&lt;ref name="PGOC"/&gt;

The PGOC's final performance was a production of ''Aida'' on April 14, 1932 with Roselle in the title role, [[Aroldo Lindi]] as Radames, [[Cyrena van Gordon]] as Amneris, and [[Leo de Hierapolis]] as the King of Egypt. The company closed due to financial reasons in 1932. At the time they canceled the end of the 1931&amp;ndash;1932 season and announced the intention of commencing another season for 1933-1934.&lt;ref name="NYT3"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/10/02/archives/opera-suspended-in-philadelphia-the-company-plans-to-present-next.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=220&amp;st=p|title=OPERA SUSPENDED IN PHILADELPHIA; The Company Plans to Present Next Season a New Form of "Drama With Music."|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=October 2, 1932| accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That never happened, possibly because Mrs. Liedy and her husband both died in 1932.&lt;ref name="NYT8"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1933/02/10/archives/mrs-leidy-dies-opera-supporter-president-of-the-philadelphia-opera.html?sq=%2522Philadelphia+Grand+Opera+Company%2522&amp;scp=229&amp;st=p|title=MRS.

==The last Philadelphia Grand Opera Companies:1954-1974==
The last company to be called the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company was formed in November 1954 when the [[Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera]] and the [[Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company]] merged. [[Anthony Terracciano]] served as the company's first General Director in its first season but was then succeeded by General Manager [[Humbert A. Pelosi]] who was appointed that position at the end of the 1955&amp;ndash;1956 season.&lt;ref name="NYT5"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20816FC345F177A93CAAB178FD85F428585F9|title=Pelosi Named Opera Manager|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=July 7, 1932| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terracciano remained with the company as an Artistic Director through the Spring of 1972. Pelosi left in March 1956 after a feud with Terracciano. He was replaced by conductor [[Giuseppe Bamboschek]] who had been working for the company since it began.&lt;ref name="NYT6"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00813FB355A137A93C3AA1788D85F438585F9|title=Bamboschek Gets Post|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=March 31, 1957| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamboschek remained the company's director until 1961 when Terracciano was again made General Manager by longtime friend and musical colleague, Max M. Leon, who was then the opera company's president. This time Terracciano stayed on until 1972.&lt;ref name="NYT9"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30F12FD3E5D1B728DDDA80B94DB405B818AF1D3|title=Terracciano to Head Opera|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=|date=March 31, 1961| accessdate= April 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although formed in 1954, the company finished the 1954&amp;ndash;1955 season performing under the title of the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company. The company's inaugural performance as the PGOC was of ''Rigoletto'' under the baton on Giuseppe Bamboschek on October 13, 1955 at the Academy of Music. The production starred [[Frank Guarrera]] in the title role, [[Lisa di Julio]] as Gilda, and [[Eugene Conley]] as the Duke of Mantua. Other productions that first season included Puccini's ''[[La bohème]]'' (with [[Rosanna Carteri]] as Mimì, [[Jan Peerce]] as Rodolfo, and [[Virginia MacWatters]] as Musetta), ''Faust'' (with [[Robert Rounseville]] in the title role, [[Nicola Moscona]] as Méphistophélès, and [[Ellen Faull]] as Marguerite), Puccini's ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' (with [[Licia Albanese]] as Cio-cio-san, [[Walter Fredericks]] as Pinkerton, [[Margaret Roggero]] as Suzuki, and [[Cesare Bardelli]] as Sharpless), [[Italo Montemezzi]]'s ''[[L'amore dei tre re]]'' (with [[Beverly Sills]] as Fiora and [[Ramón Vinay]] as Avito), ''Il barbiere di Siviglia'' (with MacWatters as Rosina, Guarrera as Figaro, and [[Cesare Valletti]] as Almaviva), ''Cavalleria rusticana'' (with [[Maria Gasi]] as Santuzza), ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (with Fredericks as Canio and [[Eva Likova]] as Nedda), and ''[[Aida]]'' (with [[Astrid Varnay]] in the title role, [[Kurt Baum]] as Radamès, [[Claramae Turner]] as Amneris, and [[John Lawler]] as the King of Egypt).&lt;ref name="PGOC2"&gt;[[Free Library of Philadelphia]]: ''Bound: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1955-1974''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philadelphia Grand Opera Company remained active for two decades, producing six operas during an annual season. The company notably presented the world premiere of [[Pietro Aria]]'s ''[[Jericho Road (opera)|Jericho Road]]'' on March 12, 1969. Many notable singers performed with the company during its history including, [[John Alexander (tenor)|John Alexander]], [[Thelma Altman]], [[Salvatore Baccaloni]], [[Cesare Bardelli]], [[Gaetano Bardini]], [[Daniele Barioni]], [[Ara Berberian]], [[Frances Bible]], [[John Brownlee (baritone)|John Brownlee]], [[Giuseppe Campora]], [[Richard Cassilly]], [[George Cehanovsky]], [[Anita Cerquetti]], [[Eugene Conley]], [[Fernando Corena]], [[Viorica Cortez]], [[Mary Costa]], [[Mary Curtis Verna]], [[Jon Crain]], [[Gilda Cruz-Romo]], [[Enrico di Giuseppe]], [[Mignon Dunn]], [[Pierre Duval (singer)|Pierre Duval]], [[Otto Edelmann]], [[Rosalind Elias]], [[Edith Evans]], [[Jean Fenn]], [[Giulio Fioravanti]], [[Nicolai Gedda]], [[Leyla Gencer]], [[Bonaldo Giaiotti]], [[Tito Gobbi]], [[Thomas Hayward (tenor)|Thomas Hayward]], [[Jerome Hines]], [[Laurel Hurley]], [[Raoul Jobin]], [[Robert Kerns]], [[Dorothy Kirsten]], [[Flaviano Labò]], [[Albert Lance]], [[Brenda Lewis]], [[Thomas LoMonaco]], [[Chester Ludgin]], [[Cornell MacNeil]], [[Jean Madeira]], [[Elaine Malbin]], [[Adriana Maliponte]], [[Susanne Marsee]], [[Robert Merrill]], [[Anna Moffo]], [[Licinio Montefusco]], Irene Kramerich, Sonia Leon, [[Barry Morell]], [[Nicola Moscona]], [[Herva Nelli]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[Roberta Peters]], [[Louis Quilico]], [[Luciano Rampaso]], [[Nell Rankin]], [[Regina Resnik]], [[Graciela Rivera]], [[Elinor Ross]], [[Jane Shaulis]], [[Giulietta Simionato]], [[Joanna Simon (singer)|Joanna Simon]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Teresa Stratas]], [[Brian Sullivan (tenor)|Brian Sullivan]], [[Giuseppe Taddei]], [[Ferruccio Tagliavini]], [[Pia Tassinari]], [[Blanche Thebom]], [[Giorgio Tozzi]], [[Norman Treigle]], [[Gabriella Tucci]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Giuseppe Valdengo]], [[Frank Valentino]], [[Luigi Vellucci]], and [[Jon Vickers]] to name just a few. The PGOC's last performance was of [[Johann Strauss II]]'s ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' on December 6, 1974 with [[Joseph Venezia]] as Alfred, [[June Fiske]] as Adele, [[Eileen Schauler]] as Rosalinde, [[Robert Goodloe]] as Eisenstein, and [[Carlo Moresco]] conducting.&lt;ref name="PGOC2"/&gt;

In the companies last three years the opera board's long-term president, [[Max Leon]], served as the company's manager after the departure of Terracciano. Experiencing some financial difficulties, the company began talks with the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] about a possible merger in 1974. An agreement was reached and the two companies merged to form the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]] in 1975 with Leon serving as General Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/maxleon.html Biography of Max Leon at broadcastpioneers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Red''' is the color at the end of the [[visible spectrum]] of light, next to [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and opposite [[violet (color)|violet]]. It has a [[dominant wavelength]] of approximately  625–740 [[nanometre]]s.&lt;ref name="Georgia State University Department of Physics and Astronomy" /&gt; It is a primary color in the [[RGB color model]] and the [[CMYK color model]], and is the [[complementary color]] of [[cyan]]. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] and [[Vermilion|vermillion]] to bluish-red [[crimson]], and vary in shade from the pale red [[pink]] to the dark red [[burgundy (color)|burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A dictionary of color|last=Maerz|first=A|last2=Paul|first2=M.

Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet [[Mars]]. The red colour of [[blood]] comes from protein [[hemoglobin]], while ripe [[strawberries]], [[Red Delicious|red apples]] and reddish [[Autumn leaf color|autumn leaves]] are colored by [[anthocyanin]]s.&lt;ref name="tree1044"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archetti|first1=Marco|last2=Döring|first2=T.

Red pigment made from [[ochre]] was one of the first colors used in [[prehistoric art]]. The Ancient Egytians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories.  It was also an important color in China, where it was used to colour early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/319395390|title=Chinese red|last=Chunling|first=Y.|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|year=2008|isbn=9787119045313|location=Beijing|oclc=319395390}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|60-61}} In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] and [[cochineal]]. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red also became the color of revolution; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries.

Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love and joy. In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color of symbolizing happiness and good fortune.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychologie de la couleur: effets et symboliques|last=Heller|first=Eva|date=1948|publisher=Pyramid|isbn=9782350171562|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=470802996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|39-63}}

=== Seeing red ===
[[File:Madrid Bullfight.JPG|thumb|Bulls, like dogs and many other animals, have [[dichromacy]], which means they cannot distinguish the color red. They charge the matador's cape because of its motion, not its color.]]
The human eye sees red when it looks at light with a wavelength between approximately 625 and 740 [[Nanometre|nanometers]].&lt;ref name="Georgia State University Department of Physics and Astronomy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/specol.html |title=Spectral Colors |website=HyperPhysics site |author=Georgia State University Department of Physics and Astronomy |accessdate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a primary color in the [[RGB color model]] and the light just past this range is called infrared, or below red, and cannot be seen by human eyes, although it can be sensed as heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html |title=What Wavelength Goes With a Color? |website=Atmospheric Science Data Center |accessdate=2009-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105431/http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the language of optics, red is the color evoked by light that stimulates neither the S or the M (short and medium wavelength) cone cells of the retina, combined with a fading stimulation of the L (long-wavelength) cone cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to psychology|last=Kalat|first=J.

[[Primates]] can distinguish the full range of the colors of the spectrum visible to humans, but many kinds of mammals, such as dogs and cattle, have [[dichromacy]], which means they can see blues and yellows, but cannot distinguish red and green (both are seen as gray). Bulls, for instance, cannot see the red color of the cape of a bullfighter, but they are agitated by its movement.&lt;ref name="Ali&amp;Klyne1985"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ali |first=Mohamed Ather |last2=Klyne |first2=M.A. |title=Vision in Vertebrates |place=New York |publisher=Plenum Press |year=1985 |pages=174–75 |isbn=978-0-306-42065-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[color vision]]).

One theory for why [[primates]] developed sensitivity to red is that it allowed ripe fruit to be distinguished from unripe fruit and inedible vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/primate/color.htm |title=Primate Color Vision |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |date=March 19, 2010 |website=Primates |publisher=Palomar Community College |accessdate=22 April 2010 |location=San Marcos, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability, such as the emergence of red faces.&lt;ref name="scidaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070524155313.htm|title=Color Vision Drove Primates To Develop Red Skin And Hair, Study Finds|last=Hogan|first=Dan|last2=Hogan|first2=Michele|date=May 25, 2007|website=Science News|publisher=ScienceDaily|location=Rockville, Maryland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red illumination was (and sometimes still is) used as a [[safelight]] while working in a [[darkroom]] as it does not expose most photographic paper and some films.&lt;ref name="redsafelight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kodak.com/global/en/consumer/products/techInfo/k4/k4Facts.shtml|title=Important Facts About Safelights|last=|first=|date=|website=How Safe is Your Safelight?|publisher=Eastman Kodak|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122225707/https://www.kodak.com/global/en/consumer/products/techInfo/k4/k4Facts.shtml|archive-date=Jan 22, 2009|dead-url=yes|accessdate=Apr 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today modern darkrooms usually use an [[amber (color)|amber]] safelight.

=== In color theory and on a computer screen ===
On the [[color wheel]] long used by painters, and in traditional color theory, red is one of the three [[primary colors]], along with blue and yellow. Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet:  [[Cennino Cennini]], in his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, "If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac [red lake], ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder" he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue [[indigo]] and red [[hematite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archetype.co.uk/our-titles/cennino-cenninis-i-il-libro-dellarte-i/?id=224|title=Cennino Cennini's Il libro dell'arte: a new English translation and commentary with Italian transcription|last=|first=|publisher=Archetype|year=2015|isbn=9781909492288|editor-last=Broecke|editor-first=Lara|location=London|pages=115|oclc=910400601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern color theory, also known as the [[RGB color model]], red, green and blue are [[additive primary colors]]. Red, green and blue light combined together makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television.  For example, magenta on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using [[additive colors]] and light instead of pigment:  it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen.  Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.&lt;ref name="huevaluechroma1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/041.php|title=The Dimensions of Colour: Part 4. Additive Mixing|last=Briggs|first=David|date=|website=huevaluechroma.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So that the maximum number of colors can be accurately reproduced on your computer screen, each color has been given a code number, or [[sRGB]], which tells your computer the intensity of the red, green and blue components of that color. The intensity of each component is measured on a scale of zero to 255, which means the complete list includes 16,777,216 distinct colors and shades. The sRGB number of pure red, for example, is 255, 00, 00, which means the red component is at its maximum intensity, and there is no green or blue. The sRGB number for crimson is 220, 20, 60, which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker, there is some green, which leans it toward orange; and there is a larger amount of blue, which makes it slightly blue-violet.&lt;ref name="huevaluechroma1" /&gt;

=== Color of sunset ===
[[File:Crimson sunset.jpg|Sunsets and sunrises are often red because of an optical effect called [[Rayleigh scattering]].|thumb|right]]
As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particles]] due to [[Rayleigh scattering]], changing the final color of the beam that is seen. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye.&lt;ref name="saha"&gt;{{cite book |author=K. Saha |title=The Earth's Atmosphere – Its Physics and Dynamics |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-78426-5 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]], when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon its red glow.&lt;ref name="guenther"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Optics|last=|first=|publisher=Elsevier|year=2005|isbn=9780123693952|editor-last=Guenther|editor-first=B.|volume=1|location=|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lasers ===
[[Laser]]s emitting in the red region of the spectrum have been available since the invention of the [[ruby laser]] in 1960. In 1962 the red [[helium–neon laser]] was invented,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=A. D.|last2=Rigden|first2=J. D.|date=1962|title=Continuous Gas Maser Operation in the Visible|url=|journal=Proc. IRE|volume=50|pages=1697|postscript=. US Patent 3242439.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these two types of lasers were widely used in many scientific applications including [[holography]], and in education. Red helium–neon lasers were used commercially in [[LaserDisc]] players. The use of red [[laser diode]]s became widespread with the commercial success of modern [[DVD]] players, which use a 660&amp;nbsp;nm laser diode technology. Today, red and red-orange laser diodes are widely available to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive [[laser pointer]]s. Portable, high-powered versions are also available for various applications.&lt;ref name="laserglow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laserglow.com/GRH|title=Laserglow – Blue, Red, Yellow, Green Lasers|last=|first=|date=|website=Laserglow.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805054301/https://www.laserglow.com/GRH|archive-date=Aug 5, 2011|dead-url=yes|accessdate=Sep 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, 671&amp;nbsp;nm diode-pumped solid state ([[DPSS]]) lasers have been introduced to the market for all-DPSS laser display systems, [[particle image velocimetry]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], and holography.&lt;ref name="laserglow2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/GRH |title=Laserglow&amp;nbsp;– Lab/OEM Lasers |publisher=Laserglow.com |accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red's wavelength has been an important factor in laser technologies; red lasers, used in early [[compact disc]] technologies, are being replaced by blue lasers, as red's longer wavelength causes the laser's recordings to take up more space on the disc than would blue-laser recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usbyte.com/common/dvd_7.htm|title=DVD|last=|first=|date=|website=usbyte.com|publisher=eMag Solutions LLC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106063624/http://www.usbyte.com/common/dvd_7.htm|archive-date=Jan 6, 2010|dead-url=yes|access-date=Nov 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Astronomical objects that are moving away from the observer exhibit a Doppler [[redshift|red shift]].
* [[Jupiter]]'s surface displays a [[Great Red Spot]] caused by an oval-shaped mega storm south of the planet's [[equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/jupiter/redspot.html|title=The Great Red Spot|last=Cardall|first=Christian|last2=Daunt|first2=Steven|date=|year=2003|website=The Solar System|publisher=University of Tennessee|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331125637/http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/jupiter/redspot.html|archive-date=Mar 31, 2010|dead-url=yes|accessdate=Apr 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Red giant]]s are stars that have exhausted the supply of [[hydrogen]] in their cores and switched to [[thermonuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in a shell that surrounds its core. They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the [[Sun]]. However, their outer envelope is much lower in temperature, giving them an orange hue. Despite the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun due to their large size.
* [[Red supergiant star|Red supergiants]] like [[Betelgeuse]], [[Antares]] and [[VY Canis Majoris]], one of the  [[List of largest stars|biggest stars]] in the [[Universe]], are the biggest variety of red giants, They are huge in size, with radii 200 to 800 times greater than our Sun, but relatively cool in temperature (3500–4500 K), causing their distinct red tint. Because they are shrinking rapidly in size, they are surrounded by an envelope or skin much bigger than the star itself. The envelope of Betelgeuse is 250 times bigger than the star inside.
* A [[red dwarf]] is a small and relatively [[temperature|cool]] [[star]], which has a mass of less than half that of the [[Sun]] and a surface temperature of less than 4,000&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]]. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Galaxy, but due to their low luminosity, from Earth, none is visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kencroswell.com/thebrightestreddwarf.html|title=The Brightest Red Dwarf|last=Croswell|first=Ken|date=|website=kencroswell.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020223954/http://www.kencroswell.com/thebrightestreddwarf.html|archive-date=Oct 20, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=Nov 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire ===
* Fire is often shown as red in art, but flames are usually yellow, orange or blue. Some elements exhibit a red color when burned: [[calcium]], for example, produces a brick-red when combusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://editors.eol.org/eoearth/wiki/Calcium|title=Calcium|last=Hogan|first=C.

=== Pigments and dyes ===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="150px"&gt;
Hematite.jpg|[[Hematite]], or iron ore, is the source of the red color of red ochre.
Roussillon sentier des ocres2.JPG|Red [[ochre]] cliffs near [[Roussillon]] in France. Red ochre is composed of clay tinted with hematite. Ochre was the first pigment used by man in prehistoric cave paintings.
Cinnabarit 01.jpg|The mineral [[cinnabar]], the ore of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], is the source of the color [[vermilion]]. In Roman times, most cinnabar came from mines at [[Almadén]] in Spain, where the miners were usually prisoners and slaves. Mercury is highly toxic, and working in the mines was often a death sentence for the miners.
Vermillon pigment.jpg|Vermilion pigment, made from cinnabar. This was the pigment used in the murals of [[Pompeii]] and to color Chinese [[lacquerware]] beginning in the [[Song dynasty]].
Rubia tinctorum - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-123.jpg|Despite its yellow greenish flower, the roots of the ''[[Rubia tinctorum]]'', or madder plant, produced the most common red dye used from ancient times until the 19th century.
Red lead.jpg|[[Red lead]], also known as [[minium (pigment)|minium]], has been used since the time of the ancient Greeks. Chemically it is known as [[lead tetroxide]]. The Romans prepared it by the roasting of lead white pigment. It was commonly used in the Middle Ages for the headings and decoration of illuminated manuscripts.
Dragon's blood (Daemomorops draco).jpg|[[Dragon's blood]] is a bright red [[resin]] that is obtained from different species of a number of distinct plant genera: ''[[Croton (plant)|Croton]]'', ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'', ''[[Daemonorops]]'', ''[[Calamus rotang]]'' and ''[[Pterocarpus]]''. The red resin was used in ancient times as a [[medicine]], [[incense]], [[dye]] and [[varnish]] for making [[violin]]s in Italy.
Cochineal drawing.jpg|The tiny female [[cochineal]] insect of Spanish Mexico (on the left), was crushed to make the deep [[crimson]] color used in Renaissance costumes.
Dactylopius coccus 02.jpg|Extract of [[carmine]], made by crushing [[cochineal]] and other [[scale insect]]s which feed on the sap of live oak trees. Also called [[kermes (dye)|kermes]], it was used from the Middle Ages until the 19th century to make [[crimson]] dye. Now it is used as a coloring for yoghurt and other food products.
Pau-brasil mococa sp.jpg|The [[Sappanwood]] tree, native to India, [[Malaysia]] and [[Sri Lanka]], and later the related [[Brazilwood]] tree (shown here), from the coast of South America, were the source of a popular red pigment and dye called [[brazilin]]. The red wood was ground to powder and mixed with an alkaline solution. The brazilwood gave its name to the nation of Brazil.
Alizarin-sample.jpg|[[Alizarin]] was the first synthetic red dye, created by German chemists in 1868. It duplicated the colorant in the madder plant, but was cheaper and longer lasting. After its introduction, the production of natural dyes from the madder plant virtually ceased.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Red lac, red lake and crimson lake ===
[[File:Titian - The Vendramin Family Venerating a Relic of the True Cross (detail) - WGA22811.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]] used glazes of red lake to create the vivid crimson of the robes in ''The Vendramin Family Venerating a Relic of the True Cross'', completed 1550–60 (detail).]]
'''Red lac''', also called '''red lake''', '''crimson lake''' or '''carmine lake''', was an important red pigment in Renaissance and Baroque art. Since it was translucent, thin layers of red lac were built up or glazed over a more opaque dark color to create a particularly deep and vivid color.

Unlike [[vermilion]] or red [[ochre]], made from minerals, red [[lake pigments]] are made by mixing organic dyes, made from insects or plants, with white [[chalk]] or [[alum]]. Red lac was made from the gum [[lac]], the dark red resinous substance secreted by various scale insects, particularly the [[Laccifer lacca]] from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Webster's New World dictionary of American English|last=|first=|publisher=Webster's New World|year=1988|isbn=0131926594|editor-last=Neufeldt|editor-first=V.|edition=3rd college|location=Cleveland|pages=|oclc=36197258|editor-last2=Guralnik|editor-first2=D. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmine]] lake was made from the [[cochineal]] insect from Central and South America, [[Kermes (dye)|Kermes]] lake came from a different scale insect, ''[[kermes vermilio]]'', which thrived on oak trees around the Mediterranean. Other red lakes were made from the [[rose madder]] plant and from the [[brazilwood]] tree.

Red lake pigments were an important part of the palette of 16th-century Venetian painters,  particularly [[Titian]], but they were used in all periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9781857094428/closer-look-colour|title=Colour|last=Bomford|first=David|last2=Ashok|first2=Roy|date=2009|publisher=National Gallery Co.|year=|isbn=9781857094428|edition=Rev.|location=London|pages=41-42|oclc=280440129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the red lakes were made from organic dyes, they tended to be fugitive, becoming unstable and fading when exposed to sunlight.

=== Food coloring ===
The most common synthetic food coloring today is [[Allura Red AC]] is a red [[azo dye]] that goes by several names including: '''Allura Red''', '''Food Red 17''', '''C.I. 16035''', '''FD&amp;C Red 40''',&lt;ref name="Shampoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/col-221.html |title=From Shampoo to Cereal: Seeing to the Safety of Color Additives |accessdate=2008-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115194446/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/col-221.html |archivedate=January 15, 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Food Colour Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/colorfac.html|title=Food Color Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001050645/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/colorfac.html|archivedate=October 1, 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally manufactured from coal tar, but now is mostly made from petroleum.

In Europe, Allura Red AC is not recommended for consumption by children. It is banned in Denmark, Belgium, France and Switzerland, and was also banned in Sweden until the country joined the European Union in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001050645/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/colorfac.html|title=E129|last=|first=|date=2007|website=The UK Food Guide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] approves Allura Red AC as a food colorant, but EU countries' local laws banning food colorants are preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Jun 30, 1994|title=European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC on colours for use in foodstuffs|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/1994/36/oj|journal=European Parliament and Council of the European Union|volume=|pages=|postscript=. Precise volume, tome, and page numbers for all languages are available on the cited website.|via=EUR-Lex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Allura Red AC is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in [[cosmetics]], [[drugs]], and food. It is used in some tattoo inks and is used in many products, such as [[soft drink]]s, children's medications, and [[cotton candy]]. On June 30, 2010, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI) called for the FDA to ban Red 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/30/food-dyes-a-health-risk/|title=Group urges ban of 3 common dyes|last=Young|first=Saundra|date=Jun 30, 2010|work=CNN|access-date=Jul 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703013023/http://pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/30/food-dyes-a-health-risk/|archive-date=Jul 3, 2010|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of public concerns about possible health risks associated with synthetic dyes, many companies have switched to using natural pigments such as [[carmine]], made from crushing the tiny female [[cochineal]] insect. This insect, originating in Mexico and Central American, was used to make the brilliant [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] dyes of the European Renaissance.

=== Autumn leaves ===
The red of autumn leaves is produced by pigments called [[anthocyanin]]s. They are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer.&lt;ref name="tree1044" /&gt; They develop in late summer in the [[sap]] of the cells of the leaf, and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influences—both inside and outside the plant. Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of [[phosphate]] in the leaf is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant pigments and their manipulation|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=|isbn=1405117370|editor-last=Davies|editor-first=Kevin M.|location=Oxford|pages=6|oclc=56963804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer growing season, phosphate is at a high level. It has a vital role in the breakdown of the [[sugar]]s manufactured by chlorophyll. But in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients, moves out of the leaf into the [[Plant stem|stem]] of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes, leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop.

Anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young [[leaves]] as they unfold from the [[bud]]s in early spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as [[cranberry|cranberries]], [[Red Delicious|red apples]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[cherry|cherries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], and [[plums]].

Anthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas—a [[autumn in New England|famous example being New England]]—up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment.&lt;ref name="tree1044" /&gt; In autumn forests they appear vivid in the [[maple]]s, [[oak]]s, [[sourwood]], [[Liquidambar|sweetgums]], [[dogwood]]s, [[tupelo]]s, [[cherry]] trees and [[persimmon]]s. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species. (See [[Autumn leaf color]]).

=== Blood and other reds in nature ===
Oxygenated blood is red due to the presence of oxygenated [[hemoglobin]] that contains iron molecules, with the iron components reflecting red light.&lt;ref name="UCSBblood"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why is blood red? |url=http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2419 |website=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] |accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm|title=Hemoglobin|last=Nabili|first=Siamak|date=|website=Procedures and Tests|publisher=MedicineNet|page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323145336/http://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm|archive-date=Mar 23, 2010|dead-url=yes|accessdate=Apr 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red meat gets its color from the iron found in the [[myoglobin]] and hemoglobin in the muscles and residual blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleming|first=H.

Plants like [[apples]], [[Garden strawberry|strawberries]], [[cherry|cherries]], [[tomato]]es, [[Capsicum|peppers]], and [[pomegranate]]s are often colored by forms of [[carotenoids]], red pigments that also assist [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss3/pigments.html |title=Photosynthetic Pigments |last=Speer |first=Brian |website=UCMP Glossary |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=22 April 2010 |location=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* When used to describe natural animal coloration, "red" usually refers to a brownish, reddish-brown or ginger color. In this sense it is used to describe coat colors of reddish-brown cattle and dogs, and in the names of various animal species or breeds such as [[red fox]], [[red squirrel]], [[red deer]], [[European robin]], [[red grouse]], [[red knot]], [[redstart]], [[redwing]], [[red setter]], Red Devon cattle, etc. This reddish-brown color is also meant when using the terms [[red ochre]] and red hair.
* The red herring dragged across a trail to destroy the scent gets its color from the heavy salting and slow smoking of the fish, which results in a warm, brown color.
* When used for flowers, red often refers to purplish (red deadnettle, red clover, red helleborine) or pink (red campion, red valerian) colors.

=== Hair color ===
[[File:Woman redhead natural portrait 1.jpg|thumb|Woman with red hair]]
'''Red hair''' occurs naturally on approximately 1–2% of the human population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.garreau.com/main.cfm?action=chapters&amp;id=20|title=Red Alert!|last=Garreau|first=Joel|date=Mar 18, 2002|website=The Garreau Group|publisher=The Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527035304/http://www.garreau.com/main.cfm?action=chapters&amp;id=20|archive-date=May 27, 2013|dead-url=yes|access-date=Nov 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears in people with two copies of a [[Dominance relationship|recessive gene]] on [[chromosome 16]] which causes a mutation in the [[melanocortin 1 receptor|MC1R]] protein.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Red hair varies from a deep [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] through [[Orange (color)#Burnt orange|burnt orange]] to bright [[Copper (color)|copper]]. It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment [[pheomelanin]] (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment [[eumelanin]]. The term '''redhead''' (originally ''redd hede''){{citation needed|date=May 2017}} has been in use since at least 1510. Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered. (See [[red hair]]).

=== Prehistory ===
Inside cave 13B at [[Pinnacle Point]], an archeological site found on the coast of South Africa, [[paleoanthropologists]] in 2000 found evidence that, between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago, [[Late Stone Age]] people were scraping and grinding [[ochre]], a clay colored red by [[iron oxide]], probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies.&lt;ref name="Marean 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marean|first1=C.

Red [[hematite]] powder was also found scattered around the remains at a grave site in a [[Zhoukoudian]] cave complex near [[Beijing]]. The site has evidence of habitation as early as 700,000 years ago. The hematite might have been used to symbolize blood in an offering to the dead.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|4}}

Red, black and white were the first colors used by artists in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] age, probably because natural pigments such as red ochre and iron oxide were readily available where early people lived. [[Rubia|Madder]], a plant whose root could be made into a red dye, grew widely in Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le petit livre des couleurs|last=Pastoureau|first=Michel|last2=Simonnet|first2=Dominique|date=2014|publisher=Seuil|year=|isbn=9782757841532|location=Paris|pages=32|oclc=881055677}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cave of Altamira]] in Spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15,000 and 16,500 BC.

A red dye called [[Kermes (dye)|Kermes]] was made beginning in the [[Neolithic Period]] by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny [[scale insect]] in the genus ''[[Kermes (genus)|Kermes]]'', primarily ''[[Kermes vermilio]]''. The insects live on the sap of certain trees, especially [[Kermes oak]] trees near the Mediterranean region. Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prehistoric Textiles|last=Barber|first=E. J.

A different variety of dye was made from [[Armenian cochineal|''Porphyrophora hamelii'' (Armenian cochineal)]] scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs. It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC, and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A perfect red|last=Greenfield|first=Amy Butler|date=2005|publisher=Autrement|year=|isbn=9782746710948|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=470600856}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|45}}

Kermes is also mentioned in the [[Bible]]. In the [[Book of Exodus]], [[God]] instructs [[Moses]] to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth "of blue, and purple, and scarlet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+25:4&amp;version=KJV|title=Exodus 25:4 - King James Version|last=|first=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 23, 2018|quote=And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, (...).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term used for scarlet in the 4th-century [[Latin Vulgate]] version of the Bible passage is ''coccumque bis tinctum'', meaning "colored twice with coccus."

In ancient Egypt, red was associated with life, health, and victory. Egyptians would color themselves with red ochre during celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/reds.html |title=Pigments through the Ages – Intro to the reds |publisher=Webexhibits.org |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian women used red ochre as a [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] to redden cheeks and lips&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Egypt: The Kingdom of the Pharaohs|last=Hamilton|first=R.|date=2007|publisher=Paragon Inc.|year=|isbn=9781405486439|location=Bath|pages=62|oclc=144618068}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also used [[henna]] to color their hair and paint their nails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100788210|title=Sacred luxuries|last=Manniche|first=Lise|date=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0801437202|location=New York|pages=127-43|oclc=41319991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, like many colors, it also had a negative association, with heat, destruction and evil. A prayer to god [[Isis]] states: "Oh Isis, protect me from all things evil and red."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|45}} The ancient Egyptians began manufacturing pigments in about 4000 BC. Red ochre was widely used as a pigment for wall paintings, particularly as the skin color of men. An ivory painter's palette found inside the tomb of King [[Tutankhamun]] had small compartments with pigments of red ochre and five other colors. The Egyptians used the root of the [[rubia]], or madder plant, to make a dye, later known as [[alizarin]], and also used it as a pigment, which became known as [[madder lake]], alizarin or alizarin crimson.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bright Earth: the Invention of Colour|last=Ball|first=Philip|date=2001|publisher=Viking|year=|isbn=0670893463|location=London|pages=100|oclc=48363546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ancient China, artisans were making red and black painted [[pottery]] as early as the [[Yangshao Culture]] period (5000–3000 BC). A red-painted wooden bowl was found at a [[Neolithic]] site in Yuyao, Zhejiang. Other red-painted ceremonial objects have been found at other sites dating to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770–221 BC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the [[Han dynasty]] (200 BC–200 AD) Chinese craftsmen made a red pigment, [[lead tetroxide]], which they called ''ch-ien tan'', by heating lead white pigment. Like the Egyptians, they made a red dye from the madder plant to color silk fabric for gowns and used pigments colored with madder to make red lacquerware.

[[Red lead]] or Lead tetroxide pigment was widely used as the red in Persian and Indian miniature paintings as well as in European art, where it was called minium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In India, the [[rubia]] plant has been used to make dye since ancient times. A piece of cotton dyed with rubia dated to the third millennium BC was found at an archaeological site at [[Mohenjo-daro]].&lt;ref name="bhardwaj&amp;jain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhardwaj|first=H.

The early inhabitants of America had their own vivid crimson [[dye]], made from the [[cochineal]], an insect of the same family as the Kermes of Europe and the Middle East, which feeds on the [[Opuntia]], or prickly pear cactus plant. Red-dyed textiles from the [[Paracas culture]] (800–100 BC) have been found in tombs in [[Peru]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Red also featured in the burials of royalty in the Maya city-states. In the [[Tomb of the Red Queen]] inside Temple XIII in the ruined Maya city of [[Palenque]] (600–700 AD), the skeleton and ceremonial items of a noble woman were completely covered with bright red powder made from [[cinnabar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Reina Roja: una tumba real de Palenque|last=Cruz|first=Arnoldo González|date=2011|publisher=Turner|year=|isbn=9788475069739|edition=1|location=Mexico|pages=|oclc=778840942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]] and the [[Minoan civilization]] of ancient [[Crete]], red was widely used in murals and in the [[polychrome]] decoration of temples and palaces. The Greeks began using [[red lead]] as a pigment.

In [[Ancient Rome]], [[Tyrian purple]] was the color of the Emperor, but red had an important religious symbolism. Romans wore [[togas]] with red stripes on holidays, and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl, called a ''flammeum''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|46}} Red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators. Red was also the color associated with army; Roman soldiers wore red tunics, and officers wore a cloak called a [[paludamentum]] which, depending upon the quality of the dye, could be crimson, [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]] or purple. In [[Roman mythology]] red is associated with the god of war, [[Mars (god)|Mars]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colour|last=Feisner|first=Edith A.|date=2006|publisher=Laurence King|year=|isbn=1856694410|edition=2nd|location=London|pages=127|oclc=62259546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[vexilloid]] of the [[Roman Empire]] had a red background with the letters [[SPQR]] in [[Gold (color)|gold]].

The Romans liked bright colors, and many [[Roman villas]] were decorated with vivid red murals. The pigment used for many of the murals was called [[vermilion]], and it came from the mineral [[cinnabar]], a common ore of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. It was one of the finest reds of ancient times – the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries. The source of cinnabar for the Romans was a group of mines near [[Almadén]], southwest of [[Madrid]], in Spain. Working in the mines was extremely dangerous, since mercury is highly toxic; the miners were slaves or prisoners, and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles and Methods of Toxicology |edition=5th |author=Hayes, A.

=== Postclassical history ===

==== In Europe ====
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, red was adopted as a color of majesty and authority by the [[Byzantine Empire]], the princes of Europe, and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. It also played an important part in the rituals of the [[Catholic Church]] – it symbolized the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs – and it associated the power of the kings with the sacred rituals of the Church.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor [[Charlemagne]] painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|36-37}} Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red colored [[Religious habit|habitus]]. When [[Abbe Suger]] rebuilt [[Saint Denis Basilica]] outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added [[stained glass]] windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both [[Christ]] and the [[Virgin Mary]] were commonly painted wearing red mantles.

Red clothing was a sign of status and wealth. It was worn not only by cardinals and princes, but also by merchants, artisans and townspeople, particularly on holidays or special occasions. Red dye for the clothing of ordinary people was made from the roots of the [[rubia tinctorum]], the madder plant. This color leaned toward brick-red, and faded easily in the sun or during washing. The wealthy and aristocrats wore [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] clothing dyed with [[kermes (dye)|kermes]], or [[carmine]], made from the [[carminic acid]] in tiny female [[scale insects]], which lived on the leaves of oak trees in Eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean. The insects were gathered, dried, crushed, and boiled with different ingredients in a long and complicated process, which produced a brilliant scarlet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|38-45}}

[[Brazilin]] was another popular red dye in the Middle Ages. It came from the [[sapanwood]] tree, which grew in India, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. A similar tree, [[brazilwood]], grew on the coast of South America. The red wood was ground into sawdust and mixed with an [[alkaline]] solution to make dye and pigment. It became one of the most profitable exports from the [[New World]], and gave its name to the nation of Brazil.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|38-45}}

==== In Asia ====
Red has been an important color in Chinese culture, religion, industry, fashion and court ritual since ancient times.
Silk was woven and dyed as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 BC). China had a monopoly on the manufacture of silk until the 6th century AD, when it was introduced into the Byzantine Empire. In the 12th century, it was introduced into Europe.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Couleurs: pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples|last=Varichon|first=Anne|date=2000|publisher=Seuil|year=|isbn=2020381095|location=Paris|oclc=300129030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Han Dynasty, Chinese red was a light red, but during the [[Tang dynasty]] new dyes and pigments were discovered. The Chinese used several different plants to make red dyes, including the flowers of the [[safflour]] (''Carthamus tinctorius''), the thorns and stems of a variety of [[sorghum]] plant called Kao-liang, and the wood of the [[sappanwood]] tree. For pigments, they used [[cinnabar]], which produced the famous vermillion or "Chinese red" of Chinese [[lacquerware]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|111}}

Red played an important role in Chinese philosophy. It was believed that the world was composed of five elements: metal, wood, water, fire and earth, and that each had a color. Red was associated with fire. Each Emperor chose the color that his fortune-tellers believed would bring the most prosperity and good fortune to his reign. During the Zhou, Han, Jin, Song and Ming Dynasties, red was considered a noble color, and it was featured in all court ceremonies, from coronations to sacrificial offerings, and weddings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|26}}

Red was also a badge of rank. During the [[Song dynasty]] (906–1279), officials of the top three ranks wore purple clothes; those of the fourth and fifth wore bright red; those of the sixth and seventh wore green; and the eighth and ninth wore blue. Red was the color worn by the royal guards of honor, and the color of the carriages of the imperial family. When the imperial family traveled, their servants and accompanying officials carried red and purple umbrellas. Of an official who had talent and ambition, it was said "he is so red he becomes purple."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|26}}

Red was also featured in Chinese Imperial architecture. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, gates of palaces were usually painted red, and nobles often painted their entire mansion red. One of the most famous works of Chinese literature, ''A Dream of Red Mansions'' by [[Cao Xueqin]] (1715–63), was about the lives of noble women who passed their lives out of public sight within the walls of such mansions. In later dynasties red was reserved for the walls of temples and imperial residences. When the [[Manchu]] rulers of the [[Qing Dynasty]] conquered the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and took over the [[Forbidden City]] and Imperial Palace in Beijing, all the walls, gates, beams and pillars were painted in red and gold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|36-37}}

Red is not often used in traditional Chinese paintings, which are usually black ink on white paper with a little green sometimes added for trees or plants; but the round or square seals which contain the name of the artist are traditionally red.

=== Modern history ===

==== In the 16th and 17th centuries ====
In [[Renaissance]] painting, red was used to draw the attention of the viewer; it was often used as the color of the cloak or costume of [[Christ]], the [[Virgin Mary]], or another central figure. In [[Venice]], [[Titian]] was the master of fine reds, particularly [[vermilion]]; he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi-transparent glaze, which let the light pass through, to create a more luminous color.

During the Renaissance trade routes were opened to the New World, to Asia and the Middle East, and new varieties of red pigment and dye were imported into Europe, usually through [[Venice]], [[Genoa]] or [[Seville]], and [[Marseille]]. Venice was the major depot importing and manufacturing pigments for artists and dyers from the end of the 15th century; the catalog of a Venetian ''Vendecolori'', or pigment seller, from 1534 included vermilion and [[kermes (dye)|kermes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/11413/chapter/3|title=Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis|last=Berrie|first=Barbara H.|last2=Matthew|first2=Louisa C.|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=12-26|chapter=Material Innovation and Artistic Invention: New Materials and New Colors in Renaissance Venetian Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://filipvermeylen.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Pu_Arti_TIAM-Vermeylen-pp.356_365-LR2.pdf|title=Trade in Artists' Materials: Markets and Commerce in Europe to 1700|last=Vermeylen|first=Filip|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=Kirby|editor-first=J.|location=London|pages=359|chapter=The Colour of Money: Dealing in Pigments in Sixteenth-Century Antwerp|editor-last2=Cannon|editor-first2=J.|editor-last3=Nash|editor-first3=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The [[Rubia]] plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was kermes, made from a tiny [[scale insect]] which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was [[Polish Cochineal]]; also known as ''Kermes vermilio'' or "Blood of Saint John", which was made from a related insect, the ''Margodes polonicus''. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the "Kermes" of Armenia ([[Armenian cochineal]], also known as Persian ''kirmiz''), made by collecting and crushing ''Porphyophora hamelii'', an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called [[Venetian red]], which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was [[arsenic]], which brightened the color.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

But early in the 16th century, a brilliant new red appeared in Europe.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|64-100}} When the [[Spanish conquistador]] [[Hernán Cortés]] and his soldiers conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] in 1519–21, they discovered slowly that the Aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold; they had the tiny [[cochineal]], a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants, which, when dried and crushed, made a magnificent red. The cochineal in Mexico was closely related to the Kermes varieties of Europe, but unlike European Kermes, it could be harvested several times a year, and it was ten times stronger than the Kermes of Poland. It worked particularly well on silk, satin and other luxury textiles. In 1523 Cortes sent the first shipment to Spain. Soon cochineal began to arrive in European ports aboard convoys of Spanish [[galleons]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|64-100}}

At first the guilds of dyers in Venice and other cities banned cochineal to protect their local  products, but the superior quality of cochineal dye made it impossible to resist. By the beginning of the 17th century it was the preferred luxury red for the clothing of cardinals, bankers, courtesans and aristocrats.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or [[alum]], kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and [[madder lake]], made from the [[rubia tinctorum]] plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, [[carmine]], which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including [[Rembrandt]], [[Vermeer]], [[Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Tintoretto]]. Later it was used by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Seurat]] and [[J.M.W. Turner]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|102-05}}

==== In the 18th and 19th centuries ====
During the [[French Revolution]], the [[Jacobins]] and other more radical parties adopted the red flag;  it was taken from red flags hoisted by the French government to declare a state of siege or emergency.   Many of them wore a red [[Phrygian cap]], or liberty cap, modeled after the caps worn by freed slaves in Ancient Rome. During the height of the [[Reign of Terror]], Women wearing red caps gathered around the [[guillotine]] to celebrate each execution. They were called the "Furies of the guillotine". The guillotines used during the Reign of Terror in 1792 and 1793 were painted red, or made of red wood. During the Reign of Terror a statue of a woman titled liberty, painted red, was placed in the square in front of the guillotine. After the end of the Reign of Terror, France went back to the blue, white and red tricolor, whose red was taken from the red and blue colors of the city of Paris, and was the traditional color of Saint [[Denis]], the Christian martyr and patron saint of Paris.

In the mid-19th century, red became the color of a new political and social movement, [[socialism]]. It became the most common banner of the worker's movement, of the [[French Revolution of 1848]], of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1870, and of socialist parties across Europe. (see red flags and revolution section below).

As the [[Industrial Revolution]] spread across Europe, chemists and manufacturers sought new red dyes that could be used for large-scale manufacture of textiles. One popular color imported into Europe from Turkey and India in the 18th and early 19th century was [[Turkey red]], known in France as ''rouge d'Adrinople''. Beginning in the 1740s, this bright red color was used to dye or print cotton textiles in England, the Netherlands and France. Turkey red used [[Rubia|madder]] as the colorant, but the process was longer and more complicated, involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye, olive oil, sheep's dung, and other ingredients. The fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red, similar to [[carmine]], perfectly suited to cotton. The fabric was widely exported from Europe to Africa, the Middle East and America. In 19th-century America, it was widely used in making the traditional patchwork [[quilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/lowengard/C_Chap36.html#txt7|title=The Creation of Color in Eighteenth-Century Europe|last=Lowengard|first=Sarah|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1826, the French chemist [[Pierre-Jean Robiquet]] discovered the organic compound [[alizarin]], the powerful coloring ingredient of the madder root, the most popular red dye of the time.  In 1868, German chemists [[Carl Graebe]] and [[Liebermann]] were able to synthesize alizarin, and to produce it from [[coal tar]]. The synthetic red was cheaper and more lasting than the natural dye, and the plantation of madder in Europe and import of cochineal from Latin America soon almost completely ceased.

The 19th century also saw the use of red in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colour and Culture: Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction|last=Gage|first=John|date=1993|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=|isbn=9782878112955|location=Paris|pages=|oclc=494388115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Describing his painting, The ''Night Cafe'', to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Vincent van Gogh, ''Corréspondénce general'', number 533, cited by John Gage, ''Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== In the 20th and 21st centuries ====
In the 20th century, red was the color of Revolution; it was the color of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and of the Chinese Revolution of 1949, and later of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Red was the color of [[Communist Parties]] from Eastern Europe to [[Cuba]] to [[Vietnam]].

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the German chemical industry invented two new synthetic red pigments: [[cadmium red]], which was the color of natural vermilion, and mars red, which was a synthetic red ochre, the color of the very first natural red pigment.

The French painter [[Henri Matisse]] (1869–1954) was one of the first prominent painters to use the new cadmium red. He even tried, without success, to persuade the older and more traditional [[Renoir]], his neighbor in the south of France, to switch from vermilion to cadmium red.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour|last=Ball|first=Philip|date=2010|publisher=Hazan|year=|isbn=9782754105033|location=Paris|pages=|language=fr|oclc=717877902}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|440}}

Matisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting, chosen to evoke emotions. "A certain blue penetrates your soul", he wrote. "A certain red affects your blood pressure."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{Rp|437}} He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors, such as red and green, strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other. He wrote, "My choice of colors is not based on scientific theory; it is based on observation, upon feelings, upon the real nature of each experience ... I just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{Rp|440}}

Later in the century, the American artist [[Mark Rothko]] (1903–70) also used red, in even simpler form, in blocks of dark, somber color on large canvases, to inspire deep emotions. Rothko observed that color was "only an instrument;" his interest was "in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books/about/Mark_Rothko_1903_1970.html?id=Yo7qAAAAMAAJ|title=Mark Rothko, 1903-1970|last=Rothko|first=Mark|date=1987|publisher=Tate Gallery|year=|isbn=0946590621|location=London|pages=|oclc=18961969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothko also began using the new synthetic pigments, but not always with happy results. In 1962 he donated to Harvard University a series of large murals of the Passion of Christ whose predominant colors were dark pink and deep crimson. He mixed mostly traditional colors to make the pink and crimson; synthetic ultramarine, cerulean blue, and titanium white, but he also used two new organic reds, Naphtol and Lithol. The Naphtol did well, but the Lithol slowly changed color when exposed to light. Within five years the deep pinks and reds had begun to turn light blue, and by 1979 the paintings were ruined and had to be taken down.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{Rp|475-76}}

== Symbolism ==

=== Courage and sacrifice ===
Surveys show that red is the color most associated with courage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|43}} In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the [[First Crusade]] was a red cross on a white field, the [[St. George's Cross]].  According to Christian tradition, [[Saint George]] was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George's Cross became the [[Flag of England]] in the 16th century, and now is part of the [[Union Flag]] of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

In 1587, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], accused of treason against Queen [[Elizabeth I]], wore a red shirt at her execution, to proclaim that she was an innocent martyr.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|32}}

[[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|The Thin Red Line]] was a famous incident in the [[Battle of Balaclava]] (1854) during the [[Crimean War]], when a thin line of Scottish Highlander infantry, assisted by Royal Marines and Turkish infantrymen, repulsed a Russian cavalry charge. It was widely reported in the British press as an example of courage in the face of overwhelming odds and became a British military legend.

In the 19th-century novel ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]'' by [[Stephen Crane]], a story about the [[American Civil War]], the red badge was the blood from a wound, by which a soldier could prove his courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The poetry of Stephen Crane|last=Hoffman|first=Daniel|date=1971|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=0231086628|location=New York|pages=150|oclc=3153316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman de la Rose]], the Romance of the Rose, a thirteenth-century French poem, was one of the most popular works of literature of the Middle Ages. It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/illmanus/other/028har000004425u00012v00.html|title=Description of the Roman de la Rose on the site of the British Library|last=de Lorris|first=Guillaume|date=Nov 30, 2003|website=|publisher=The British Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=Sep 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 19th century, British and French authors described a specific [[language of flowers]] – giving a single red rose meant 'I love you'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Forms of Meaning: Modeling Systems Theory and Semiotic Analysis|last=Sebeok|first=Thomas A.|last2=Danesi|first2=Marcel|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2000|isbn=9783110816143|location=Berlin|pages=150-52|oclc=868974205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Valentine]], a Roman Catholic Bishop or priest who was martyred in about 296 AD, seems to have had no known connection with romantic love, but the day of his martyrdom on the Roman Catholic calendar, Saint Valentine's Day (February 14), became, in the 14th century, an occasion for lovers to send messages to each other. In recent years the celebration of Saint Valentine' s day has spread beyond Christian countries to Japan and China and other parts of the world. The celebration of Saint Valentine's Day is forbidden or strongly condemned in many Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran. In [[Saudi Arabia]], in 2002 and 2011, [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|religious police]] banned the sale of all Valentine's Day items, telling shop workers to remove any red items, as the day is considered a Christian holiday.&lt;ref name="bbc 2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1818642.stm|title=Cooling the ardour of Valentine's Day|last=|first=|date=Feb 3, 2002|work=BBC News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Happiness, celebration and ceremony ===
Red is the color most commonly associated with joy and well being.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|46}} It is the color of celebration and ceremony. A [[red carpet]] is often used to welcome distinguished guests. Red is also the traditional color of seats in opera houses and theaters. Scarlet academic gowns are worn by new Doctors of Philosophy at degree ceremonies at Oxford University and other schools. In China, it is considered the color of good fortune and prosperity, and it is the color traditionally worn by brides.
In Christian countries, it is the color traditionally worn at [[Christmas]] by [[Santa Claus]], because in the 4th century the historic [[Saint Nicholas]] was the Greek Christian Bishop of [[Myra]], in modern-day Turkey, and bishops then dressed in red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The world encyclopedia of Christmas|last=Bowler|first=Gerald|date=2004|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart Ltd|year=|isbn=9780771015359|location=Toronto|pages=|oclc=44154451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hatred, anger, aggression, passion, heat and war ===
{{expand section|1=more information about associating red with hatred, anger, aggression, passion, heat and war.|date=June 2015}}
While red is the color most associated with love, it also the color most frequently associated with hatred, anger, aggression and war. People who are angry are said to "{{wt|en|see red}}." Red is the color most commonly associated with passion and heat. In [[ancient Rome]], red was the color of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[god of war]]—the planet [[Mars]] was named for him because of its red color.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|42, 53}}

=== Warning and danger ===
Red is the traditional color of warning and danger. In the Middle Ages, a [[Red flag (signal)|red flag]] announced that the defenders of a town or castle would fight to defend it, and a red flag hoisted by a warship meant they would show no mercy to their enemy.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In Britain, in the early days of motoring, motor cars had to follow a man with a red flag who would warn horse-drawn vehicles, before the [[Locomotives on Highways Act 1896]] abolished this law.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In automobile races, the red flag is raised if there is danger to the drivers.{{cn|date=March 2018}} In international football, a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red [[penalty card]] and ejected from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/datdz0pms85gbnqy4j3k.pdf|title=Laws of The Game|first=|date=|website=fifa.com|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|pages=39, 72, 82–83|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311174803/https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/datdz0pms85gbnqy4j3k.pdf|archivedate=Mar 11, 2018|dead-url=yes|accessdate=Mar 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have indicated that red carries the strongest reaction of all the colors, with the level of reaction decreasing gradually with the colors orange, yellow, and white, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary ergonomics 1996|last=|first=|date=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=|isbn=0748405496|editor-last=Robertson|editor-first=S.

In fact, teachers at a primary school in the UK have been told not to mark children's work in red ink because it encourages a "negative approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/2688623.stm|title=Red ink banned from primary books|last=|first=|date=Jan 23, 2003|work=BBC News World Edition|accessdate=Aug 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red is the international color of stop signs and stop lights on highways and intersections. It was standardized as the international color at the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] of 1968. It was chosen partly because red is the brightest color in daytime (next to orange), though it is less visible at twilight, when green is the most visible color. Red also stands out more clearly against a cool natural backdrop of blue sky, green trees or gray buildings. But it was mostly chosen as the color for stoplights and stop signs because of its universal association with danger and warning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|54}}

=== The color that attracts attention ===
[[File:Magdalena Frackowiak.jpg|150px|thumb|Fashion model [[Magdalena Frackowiak]] at [[Paris Fashion Week]] (Fall 2011)]]
Red is the color that most attracts attention. Surveys show it is the color most frequently associated with visibility, proximity, and extroverts.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It is also the color most associated with dynamism and activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|48, 58}}

Red is used in modern fashion much as it was used in Medieval painting; to attract the eyes of the viewer to the person who is supposed to be the center of attention. People wearing red seem to be closer than those dressed in other colors, even if they are actually the same distance away.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|48, 58}} Monarchs, wives of presidential candidates and other celebrities often wear red to be visible from a distance in a crowd. It is also commonly worn by lifeguards and others whose job requires them to be easily found.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Because red attracts attention, it is frequently used in advertising, though studies show that people are less likely to read something printed in red because they know it is advertising, and because it is more difficult visually to read than black and white text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|60}}

It was associated with sexual passion, anger, sin, and the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theology of the Old Testament|last=Oehler|first=Gustav Friedrich|date=2015|publisher=Arkose Press|year=|isbn=9781345212341|editor-last=Day|editor-first=George E.|location=|pages=320|asin=1345212348}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Isaiah]] said: "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+1:18&amp;version=KJV|title=Isaiah 1:18 - King James Version|last=|first=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 26, 2018|quote=Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], in the [[Book of Revelation]], the Antichrist appears as a red monster, ridden by a woman dressed in scarlet, known as the [[Whore of Babylon]]:

"So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
"And upon her forehead was a name written a mystery: ''Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and of all the abominations of the earth'':

In 1915, Irving Berlin wrote a song, ''At the Devil's Ball'', and the devil in red appeared more often in cartoons and movies than in religious art.

In 17th-century New England, red was associated with [[adultery]]. In the 1850 novel by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[The Scarlet Letter]], set in a [[Puritan]] [[New England]] community, a woman is punished for adultery with ostracism, her sin represented by a red letter 'A' sewn onto her clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The scarlet letter|last=Hawthorne|first=Nathaniel|date=2004|publisher=Pocket|year=|isbn=0743487567|editor-last=Brantley|editor-first=Margaret|location=New York|pages=136|oclc=55483830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red is still commonly associated with [[prostitution]]. Prostitutes in many cities were required to wear red to announce their profession, and houses of prostitution displayed a red light. Beginning in the early 20th century, houses of prostitution were allowed only in certain specified neighborhoods, which became known as [[red-light districts]]. Large red-light districts are found today in [[Bangkok]] and [[Amsterdam]].

In [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], red represents wrath, one of the [[seven deadly sins]].

In both Christian and Hebrew tradition, red is also sometimes associated with murder or guilt, with "having blood on one's hands", or "being caught red-handed. {{cn|date=March 2018}}

The early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks led by the first Ottoman Sultan, [[Osman I]], carried red banners symbolizing sovereignty, [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazis]] and [[Sufism]], until, according to legend, he saw a new red flag in his dream inlaid with a [[crescent]].

=== Wedding dresses ===
In many Asian countries, red is the traditional color for a [[wedding dress]] today, symbolizing joy and good fortune.
* In India, brides traditionally wear a red sari, called the sari of blood, offered by their father, signifying that his duties as a father are transferred to the new husband, and as a symbol of his wish for her to have children. Once married, the bride will wear a sari with a red border, changing it to a white sari if her husband dies. In Pakistan and India, some brides traditionally also have their hands and feet painted red with [[henna]] by the family of their new spouse, to bring happiness and signify their new status.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|95}}

== In religion ==
* In Christianity, red is associated with the blood of Christ and the sacrifice of [[martyrs]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] it is also associated with [[pentecost]] and the Holy Spirit. Since 1295, it is the color worn by Cardinals, the senior clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. Red is the [[liturgical color]] for the feasts of martyrs, representing the blood of those who suffered death for their faith. It is sometimes used as the liturgical color for [[Holy Week]], including [[Palm Sunday]] and [[Good Friday]], although this is a modern (20th-century) development. In Catholic practice, it is also the liturgical color used to commemorate the Holy Spirit (for this reason it is worn at Pentecost and during Confirmation masses). Because of its association with martyrdom and the Spirit, it is also the color used to commemorate the Apostles (except for the Apostle St. John, who was not martyred, where white is used), and as such, it is used to commemorate bishops, who are the successors of the Apostles (for this reason, when funeral masses are held for bishops, cardinals, or popes, red is used instead of the white that would ordinarily be used).
* In [[Buddhism]], red is one of the five colors which are said to have emanated from the [[Buddha]] when he attained enlightenment, or [[nirvana]]. It is particularly associated with the benefits of the practice of Buddhism; achievement, wisdom, virtue, fortune and dignity. It was also believed to have the power to resist evil. In China red was commonly used for the walls, pillars, and gates of temples.
* In the [[Shinto]] religion of Japan, the gateways of temples, called [[torii]], are traditionally painted vermilion red and black. The torii symbolizes the passage from the profane world to a sacred place. The bridges in the gardens of Japanese temples are also painted red (and usually only temple bridges are red, not bridges in ordinary gardens), since they are also passages to sacred places.  Red was also considered a color which could expel evil and disease.

== Military uses ==

[[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems]] uses red to denote hostile forces, hence the terms "[[red team]]" and "[[Red Cell]]" to denote challengers during exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Korkolis |first1=M. |title=APP-6 Military Symbols For Land Based Symbols |url=https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/NATO_Symbols/APP-6.pdf |website=alternatewars.com |format=PDF |date=July 1986 |page=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The red uniform ===
The red military uniform was adopted by the English Parliament's [[New Model Army]] in 1645, and was still worn as a dress uniform by the British Army until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.  Ordinary soldiers wore red coats dyed with [[Rubia|madder]], while officers wore scarlet coats dyed with the more expensive [[cochineal]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{Rp|168-69}} This led to British soldiers being known as [[Red coat (British army)|red coats]].

In the modern British army, scarlet is still worn by the [[Foot Guards#British Army|Foot Guards]], the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]], and by some regimental bands or [[drum]]mers for ceremonial purposes. [[Commissioned Officer|Officers]] and [[Non-Commissioned Officer|NCOs]] of those regiments which previously wore red retain scarlet as the color of their "mess" or formal evening jackets. The [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] has a scarlet tunic in its winter dress.

Scarlet is worn for some full dress, military band or mess uniforms in the modern armies of a number of the countries that made up the former British Empire. These include the Australian, [[Jamaica]]n, New Zealand, [[Fiji]]an, Canadian, [[Kenya]]n, [[Ghanaian]], Indian, [[Singapore]]an, [[Sri Lanka]]n and Pakistani armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World uniforms in colour|last=d'Ami|first=Rinaldo|date=1968|publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd|year=|isbn=0850590310|volume=Vol. 2: Nations of America, Africa, Asia and Oceania|location=London|pages=|oclc=14994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musicians of the [[United States Marine Corps Band]] wear red, following an 18th-century military tradition that the uniforms of band members are the reverse of the uniforms of the other soldiers in their unit. Since the US Marine uniform is blue with red facings, the band wears the reverse.

[[Red Serge]] is the uniform of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], created in 1873 as the [[North-West Mounted Police]], and given its present name in 1920. The uniform was adapted from the tunic of the [[British Army]]. Cadets at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] also wear red dress uniforms.

The [[Brazilian Marine Corps]] wears a red dress uniform.

== In sports ==
The first known team sport to feature red uniforms was [[chariot racing]] during the late [[Roman Empire]]. The earliest races were between two chariots, one driver wearing red, the other white. Later, the number of teams was increased to four, including drivers in light green and sky blue. Twenty-five races were run in a day, with a total of one hundred chariots participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|publisher=Harcourt|year=1960|isbn=0151355371|editor-last=Low|editor-first=M. D.|location=New York|pages=554|asin=0151355371|oclc=402038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today many sports teams throughout the world feature red on their uniforms. Along with [[blue]], red is the most commonly used non-white color in sports. Numerous national sports teams wear red, often through association with their national flags. A few of these teams feature the color as part of their nickname such as Spain (with their [[association football]] (soccer) national team nicknamed ''La Furia Roja'' or "The Red Fury") and Belgium (whose [[Belgium national football team|football team]] bears the nickname ''Rode Duivels'' or "Red Devils").

In club [[association football]] (soccer), red is a commonly used color throughout the world. A number of teams' nicknames feature the color. A red [[penalty card]] is issued to a player who commits a serious infraction: the player is immediately disqualified from further play and his team must continue with one less player for the game's duration.

In [[rugby union]], Ireland's [[Munster rugby]], New Zealand's [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] provincial team and the [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] Super 14 rugby side wear red as a major color in their playing strips.

[[Rosso Corsa]] is the red international motor racing color of cars entered by teams from Italy. Since the 1920s Italian race cars of [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Maserati]], [[Lancia]], and later [[Ferrari]] and [[Abarth]] have been painted with a color known as ''rosso corsa'' ("racing red"). National colors were mostly replaced in [[Formula One]] by commercial sponsor liveries in 1968, but unlike most other teams, Ferrari always kept the traditional red, although the shade of the color varies.

The color is commonly used for professional sports teams in Canada and the United States with eleven [[Major League Baseball]] teams, eleven [[National Hockey League]] teams, seven [[National Football League]] teams and eleven [[National Basketball Association]] teams prominently featuring some shade of the color. The color is also featured in the league logos of Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3533300.ece|title=Teams with red shirts have a head start|last=Dart|first=Tom|date=Mar 12, 2008|work=Times Online|accessdate=Apr 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133533/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3533300.ece|archive-date=Jun 29, 2011|dead-url=yes|publisher=News International Group|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the National Football League, a red flag is thrown by the head coach to challenge a referee's decision during the game. During the 1950s when red was strongly associated with [[communism]] in the United States, the modern [[Cincinnati Reds]] team was known as the "Redlegs" and the term was used on baseball cards. After the red scare faded, the team was known as the "Reds" again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manhood and American Political Culture in the Cold War|last=Cuordileone|first=Kyle A.|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=0415925991|location=New York|pages=13|oclc=56535047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[boxing]], red is often the color used on a fighter's gloves. [[George Foreman]] wore the same red trunks he used during his loss to [[Muhammad Ali]] when he defeated [[Michael Moorer]] 20 years later to regain the title he lost. Boxers named or nicknamed "red" include [[Red Burman]], [[Ernie Lopez|Ernie "Red" Lopez]], and his brother [[Danny Lopez (boxer)|Danny "Little Red" Lopez]].

== On flags ==
Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of [[blood of Christ|Christ's blood]] (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the British Empire. The [[Union Flag|British flag]] bears the colors red, white and blue; it includes the [[cross (heraldry)|cross]] of [[Saint George]], patron saint of England, and the [[saltire]] of [[Saint Patrick's Flag|Saint Patrick]], patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tracking the jack|last=Brabazon|first=Tara|date=2000|publisher=UNSW Press|year=|isbn=0868406996|location=Sydney|pages=|oclc=50382088}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|10}} The [[flag of the United States]] bears the colors of Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.va.gov/opa/feature/celebrate/Flag.asp|title=The United States Flag – Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Department of Veterans Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231081100/http://www1.va.gov/opa/feature/celebrate/Flag.asp|archivedate=Dec 31, 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=Dec 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the colors of the French [[Flag of France|tricolore]] include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]], [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], and [[Flag of Fiji|Fiji]], carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;{{Rp|13-20}} Many former colonies of Spain, such as [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Venezuela]], also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers. Navy flags are often red and yellow. Red is prominently featured in the flag of the [[United States Marine Corps]].

The red on the [[flag of Nepal]] represents the [[floral emblem]] of the country, the [[rhododendron]].

Red, blue, and white are also the [[Pan-Slavic colors]] adopted by the Slavic solidarity movement of the late nineteenth century. Initially these were the colors of the Russian flag; as the Slavic movement grew, they were adopted by other Slavic peoples including [[Slovaks]], [[Slovenes]], and [[Serbs]]. The flags of the [[Flag of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] and [[Flag of Poland|Poland]] use red for historic heraldic reasons (see [[Coat of arms of Poland]] and [[Coat of arms of the Czech Republic]]) &amp; not due to Pan-Slavic connotations. In 2004 [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] adopted a new white [[flag of Georgia (country)|flag]], which consists of four small and one big red cross in the middle touching all four sides.

Red, white, and black were the colors of the [[German Empire]] from 1870 to 1918, and as such they came to be associated with German nationalism. In the 1920s they were adopted as the colors of the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] flag. In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler explained that they were "revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past." The red part of the flag was also chosen to attract attention – Hitler wrote: "the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement." The red also symbolized the social program of the Nazis, aimed at German workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/pimpfhitler.htm|title=The Life of the Führer|last=|first=|date=1938|website=German Propaganda Archive|publisher=Calvin.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=Sep 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mein Kampf|title-link=Mein Kampf|last=Hitler|first=Adolf|publisher=|year=1926|isbn=|volume=Vol. 2|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter VII|authorlink=Adolf Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red, white, green and black are the colors of [[Pan-Arabism]] and are used by many Arab countries.&lt;ref name="flags"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/geography/flags/colors.shtml |title=Colors as Symbols in Flags |publisher=EnchantedLearning.com |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red, gold, green, and black are the colors of [[Pan-Africanism]]. Several African countries thus use the color on their flags, including South Africa, [[Ghana]], [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Benin]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. The [[Pan-African colours|Pan-African colors]] are borrowed from the [[flag of Ethiopia]], one of the oldest independent African countries.&lt;ref name="flags" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chanting Down Babylon|last=Murrell|first=Nathaniel S.|last2=Spencer|first2=William D.|last3=McFarlane|first3=Adrian A.|date=1998|publisher=Temple University Press|year=|isbn=1566395836|location=Philadelphia|pages=135|oclc=37115199|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rwanda, notably, removed red from [[Flag of Rwanda|its flag]] after the [[Rwandan Genocide]] because of red's association with blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/rw-ad01.html#var|title=Rwandan: Adoption of the new flag|last=|first=|date=Dec 31, 2005|website=Crwflags.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913164945/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/rw-ad01.html#var|archivedate=Sep 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=Dec 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flags of Japan and [[Bangladesh]] both have a red circle in the middle of different colored backgrounds. The flag of the [[Philippines]] has a red trapezoid on the bottom signifying blood, courage, and valor (also, if the flag is inverted so that the red trapezoid is on top and the blue at the bottom, it indicates a state of war). The flag of [[Singapore]] has a red rectangle on the top. The field of the [[flag of Portugal]] is green and red. The Ottoman Empire adopted several different red flags during the six centuries of its rule, with the successor [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] continuing the 1844 Ottoman [[Flag of Turkey|Flag]].

The red flag appeared as a political symbol during the [[French Revolution]], after the fall of [[Bastille]]. A law adopted by the new government on October 20, 1789 authorized the [[Garde Nationale]] to raise the red flag in the event of a riot, to signal that the Garde would imminently intervene. During a demonstration on the Champs de Mars on July 17, 1791, the Garde Nationale fired on the crowd, killed up to fifty people. The government was denounced by the more radical revolutionaries. In the words of his famous hymn, the [[Marseillaise]], [[Rouget de Lisle]] wrote: "Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!" (''Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve''). Beginning in 1790, the most radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag themselves, to symbolize the blood of those killed in the demonstrations, and to call for the repression of those they considered counter-revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Bernard Lacroix, « Troubles et criminalité de 1789 à l'an VI », ''La Révolution dans les Basses-Alpes'', Annales de Haute-Provence, bulletin de la société scientifique et littéraire des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, no. 307, 1&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt; trimestre 1989, 108&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; année, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the French Revolution, many in the Paris crowds also wore a red [[phrygian cap]], a symbol of liberty, modeled after the caps worn in ancient Rome by freed slaves; but the colors of the Revolution finally became blue, white and red. The red in the French flag was taken from the emblem of the city of Paris, where it represented the city's patron saint, [[Denis|Saint Denis]].

[[Karl Marx]] published the [[Communist Manifesto]] in February 1848, with little attention. However, a few days later the [[French Revolution of 1848]] broke out, which replaced the monarchy of [[Louis Philippe]] with the [[Second French Republic]]. In June 1848, Paris workers, disenchanted with the new government, built barricades and raised red flags. The new government called in the French Army to put down the uprising, the first of many such confrontations between the army and the new worker's movements in Europe.

Red was also the color of the movement to unify Italy, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi. His followers were known as the ''camicie rosse'', or ([[redshirts (Italy)|redshirts]]) during the fight for Italian [[Risorgimento]] in 1860.

In 1870, following the stunning defeat of the French Army by the Germans in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], French workers and socialist revolutionaries seized Paris and created the [[Paris Commune]]. The Commune lasted for two months before it was crushed by the French Army, with much bloodshed. The original red banners of the Commune became icons of the socialist revolution; in 1921 members of the French Communist Party came to Moscow and presented the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government with one of the original Commune banners; it was placed (and is still in place) in the tomb of Vladimir Lenin, next to his open coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft467nb2w4;query=;brand=ucpress|title=Bolshevik Festivals 1917–21|last=von Geldern|first=James|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the red flag, with a hammer to symbolize the workers and sickle to symbolize peasants, became the official flag of Russia, and, in 1923, of the Soviet Union. It remained so until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

After the Communist Party of China took power in 1949, the [[flag of China]] became a red flag with a large star symbolizing the Communist Party, and smaller stars symbolizing workers, peasants, the urban middle class and rural middle class. The flag of the Communist Party of China became a red banner with a [[hammer and sickle]], similar to that on the Soviet flag. In the 1950s and 1960s, other Communist regimes such as [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] also adopted red flags. Some Communist countries, such as Cuba, chose to keep their old flags; and other countries used red flags which had nothing to do with Communism or socialism; the red flag of [[Nepal]], for instance, represents the national flower.

In 18th-century Europe, red was usually associated with the monarchy and with those in power. The [[Pope]] wore red, as did the [[Swiss Guards]] of the [[Kings of France]], the soldiers of the [[British Army]] and the [[Danish Army]].

The [[French Revolution]] saw red used by the [[Jacobins]] as a symbol of the martyrs of the Revolution. In the nineteenth century, with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise of worker's movements, it became the color of [[socialism]] (especially the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Socialism (Marxism)|variant]]), and, with the [[Paris Commune]] of 1870, of revolution.

In the 20th century, red was the color first of the Russian [[Bolsheviks]] and then, after the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, of [[Communist Parties]] around the world.

Red also became the color of many [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties in Europe, including the Labour Party in Britain (founded 1900); the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (whose roots went back to 1863) and the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]], which dated back under different names, to 1879. The [[Socialist Party of America]] (1901–72) and the [[Communist Party USA]] (1919) both also chose red as their color.

Members of the [[Christian-Social People's Party (Liechtenstein)|Christian-Social People's Party]] in [[Liechtenstein]] (founded 1918) advocated an expansion of democracy and progressive social policies, and were often referred to disparagingly as "Reds" for their social liberal leanings and party colors.&lt;ref name="NA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Christlich-soziale Volkspartei |url=http://www.e-archiv.li/koerperschaftDetail.aspx?backurl=auto&amp;koerperID=3396 |website=e-archiv.li |publisher=Liechtenstein National Archives |accessdate=22 February 2014 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of China]], founded in 1920, adopted the red flag and hammer and sickle emblem of the Soviet Union, which became the national symbols when the Party took power in China in 1949. Under Party leader [[Mao Zedong]], the Party anthem became "[[The East Is Red (song)|The East Is Red]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943793,00.html |title=The East Is Red |work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]] |accessdate=2009-04-10 |date=1970-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mao Zedong himself was sometimes referred to as a "red sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morningsun.org/red/redfamily_cp_69.html |title=The Reddest Red Sun |publisher=[[Morning Sun (documentary)|Morning Sun]] |accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China, Party ideology was enforced by the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]], and the sayings of Mao Zedong were published as a small red book in hundreds of millions of copies. Today the Communist Party of China claims to be the largest political party in the world, with eighty million members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-06/24/c_13947698.htm|title=China's Communist Party members exceed 80 million|last=|first=|date=2011-06-24|website=|publisher=News.xinhuanet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929111323/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-06/24/c_13947698.htm|archivedate=2011-09-29|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s and the 1970s, paramilitary extremist groups such as the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany, the [[Japanese Red Army]] and the [[Shining Path]] Maoist movement in [[Peru]] used red as their color. But in the 1980s, some European socialist and social democratic parties, such as the Labour Party in Britain and the Socialist Party in France, moved away from the symbolism of the far left, keeping the red color but changing their symbol to a less-threatening red rose.

Red is used around the world by political parties of the left or center-left. In the United States, it is the color of the Communist Party USA, of the [[Social Democrats, USA]], and in Puerto Rico, of the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico]].

In the United States, political commentators often refer to the "red states", which traditionally vote for Republican candidates in presidential elections, and "blue states", which vote for the Democratic candidate. This convention is relatively recent: before the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], media outlets assigned red and blue to both parties, sometimes alternating the allocation for each election. Fixed usage was established during the 39-day recount following the 2000 election, when the media began to discuss the contest in terms of [[Red states and blue states|"red states" versus "blue states"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17079-2004Nov1.html|title=Elephants Are Red, Donkeys Are Blue|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=Nov 2, 2004|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=Apr 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819102044/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17079-2004Nov1.html|archive-date=Aug 19, 2018|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social and special interest groups ==
Such names as Red Club (a bar), Red Carpet (a discothèque) or Red Cottbus and Club Red (event locations) suggest liveliness and excitement. The [[Red Hat Society]] is a social group founded in 1998 for women 50 and over. Use of the color red to call attention to an emergency situation is evident in the names of such organizations as the Red Cross (humanitarian aid), Red Hot Organization (AIDS support), and the Red List of Threatened Species (of [[IUCN]]). In reference to humans, term "red" is often used in the West to describe the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Canadian Criminal Justice System|last=Larsen|first=Nick|date=1995|publisher=Canadian Scholars' Press|year=|isbn=155130046X|location=Toronto|pages=440|oclc=30666261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Idioms ==
Many idiomatic expressions exploit the various connotations of red:
; Expressing emotion
* "to see red" (to be angry or aggressive)
* "to have red ears / a red face" (to be embarrassed)
* "to paint the town red" (to have an enjoyable evening, usually with a generous amount of eating, drinking, dancing)
; Giving warning
* "to raise a red flag" (to signal that something is problematic)
* "like a red rag to a bull" (to cause someone to be enraged)
* "to be in the red" (to be losing money, from the accounting habit of writing deficits and losses in red ink)
; Calling attention
* "a [[red letter day]]" (a special or important event, from the medieval custom of printing the dates of saints' days and holy days in red ink.)
* "to print in red ink" (for emphasis or easy identification)
* "to lay out the [[red carpet]]" or "give red-carpet treatment" (to treat someone royally as a very special person)
* "to catch someone red-handed" (in the act of doing something wrong, such with blood on his hands after a murder or poaching game)

; Other idioms
* "to tie up in [[red tape]]". In England red tape was used by lawyers and government officials to identify important documents. It became a term for excessive bureaucratic regulation. It was popularized in the 19th century by the writer [[Thomas Carlyle]], who complained about "red-tapism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://npu.edu.ua/!e-book/book/djvu/A/iif_kgpm_The%20Facts%20on%20File%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Word%20and%20Phrase%20Origins.pdf|title=The Facts on File encyclopedia of word and phrase origins|last=Hendrickson|first=Robert|publisher=Facts On File, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=9780816069668|edition=4th|location=New York|pages=|asin=0816069662|oclc=166383622}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[red herring]]." A false clue that leads investigators off the track. Refers to the practice of using a fragrant smoked fish to distract hunting or tracking dogs from the track they are meant to follow.

== Superstition ==
* It is a common belief in the United States that red cars are stopped for speeding more often than other color cars. However, there is no statistical evidence that this is true. Many police departments have denied it, saying their officers stop drivers for their behavior, not the color of their cars. The one survey that was made on this subject in 1990 by a St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper showed that the number of speeding tickets given to drivers of red cars was about the same as the proportion of red cars on the road in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/red-handed/|title=Do Red Cars Get More Speeding Tickets?|last=Mikkelson|first=David|date=Jun 12, 2014|work=Snopes.com|access-date=Nov 26, 2018|quote=The survey showed that 16 percent of the cars seen on the road were red, and 18 percent of cars which received tickets in a year period were red.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In film ==
Many film titles have included the color's name, such as:
* [[The Woman in Red (1935 film)|''The Woman in Red'']], a 1935 American film
* [[Reds (film)|''Reds'']], a 1981 film about Communism in the United States and Russia
* [[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|''The Woman in Red'']], a 1984 American comedy film
* ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'', a 1991 Chinese film directed by [[Zhang Yimou]] about a concubine
* ''[[Three Colors: Red]]'', a French movie from 1994
* [[Red (2002 film)|''Red'']], a Tamil movie from 2002
* [[Red (2008 film)|''Red'']], a 2008 American film
* [[Red (2010 film)|''Red'']] and ''[[Red 2 (film)|Red 2]]'', American films from 2010 and 2013
* ''[[Red Dog (film)|Red Dog]]'', a 2011 Australian film
* ''[[Red State (2011 film)|Red State]]'', a 2011 American film
* ''[[Red Dawn]]'', 1984 and 2012 American films

The '''Red Wing Collectors Society, Inc.''' has been dedicated to the preservation of [[Red Wing Pottery|Red Wing]] and other American [[pottery]] since 1977. The Red Wing Collectors Society is a special interest collecting organization in the United States with a membership of about 5000.&lt;ref&gt;http://collectingclubs.com/Show_Club.asp?ID=820&amp;fmt=1 ACC RWCS informational entry&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization history ==
The Red Wing Collectors Society (RWCS) was founded in 1977 in conjunction with the Red Wing Collectors Society Newsletter, published by Dave Newkirk. The popularity of the RWCS Newsletter subscription and the publication of "The Clay Giants" by Rev. Lyndon Veil laid the cornerstone for a meeting of like-minded collectors to gather in Red Wing, MN in July 1977. It was at that one-day event held at the Goodhue County Historical Society in July 1977 that the RWCS officially became an organization. Those who attended the event and joined the RWCS that day are considered charter members of the organization. Of the 300-500 people that attended the event, just over 200 people became members and over 75 of those members are still active as of October 2008.

From its start the RWCS has been dedicated to keeping what its members refer to as the "Red Wing legacy" alive. Its members focus on continually learning about the pottery products made in Red Wing, Minnesota and on making that information available to others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redwingcollectors.org/content/blogcategory/18/51/ About Us - RWCS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization structure==
The RWCS maintains a [[board of directors]] that is responsible for many of the decisions of the Society.  Positions on the board include President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Historian, Auction Manager, Education Manager, Commemorative Manager, and two Representatives-at-large. The Society's [[Executive director|Executive Director]] is a non-voting member of the board.  Board meeting times and locations are published in the bimonthly newsletter and are open for any member to attend.

During the annual Convention, held the second weekend in July, there is a general business meeting in which all members of the Society present may vote on issues, bylaw changes, and elect new officers to the board during election years.

===Membership===
Membership is available to any individual who pays the annual membership dues.  There are two levels of membership, Primary and Associate.  A Primary member receives all benefits of membership, which include a bimonthly newsletter, the right to vote at the annual meeting, the ability to attend all portions of Society functions, the right to purchase a commemorative, and access to the Society's lending library of video materials.  The cost of Primary membership dues is $35 annually as of August, 2013.  An Associate membership is available to any member of a household in which there is already a Primary member (i.e. a spouse or child of a Primary member).  Associate membership is $15 annually and includes all the benefits of membership with the exclusion of receipt of a newsletter.

===Chapters===

There are multiple local chapters of the Society.  Each chapter is chartered by the RWCS and holds its own meetings and functions throughout the year.  Many of them also hold smaller functions in conjunction with the two RWCS sponsored events, the July Convention and the MidWinter GetTogether, held in February.  Membership in the RWCS is a requirement for membership in one of its chapters.  Chapters often operate much like the Society but on a smaller scale, including the production of chapter commemoratives as a fundraising activity.  As of 2008 there were sixteen chapters in the United States.
Golden State Red Wing Chapter founded In 1987 in California.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goldenstateredwing.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual events==
The RWCS holds two official events every year, the Convention and MidWinter GetTogether.

===Convention===
The July Convention is held every year and is the original event of the society.  The first convention was held in July 1977 in Red Wing, Minnesota.  Since then there has been an annual convention and business meeting of the society in July in Red Wing.  The most recent venue has been the [[Red Wing High School]].  Educational seminars, an auction, a show and sale, displays of pottery, and children's events are held.

===MidWinter GetTogether===
The MidWinter GetTogether is held in February.  Meant to be an event that may relocate to new locations if possible, it has been held in [[Des Moines, Iowa]] since at least 2003.  It was held in Wisconsin in 2015 and 2016 and will return to Des Moines in 2017. This is a smaller event than the Convention and is attended by fewer members.  Educational seminars, a show and sale, social events, and children's events are held.

===Chapter meetings and events===
Chapters of the RWCS hold meetings throughout the year.  Depending on the chapter these meetings may be held anywhere from monthly to four times annually.  Some chapters hold annual special events in addition to their regular business meetings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goldenstateredwing.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''regents group portrait''', '''regentenstuk''' or '''regentessenstuk''' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], literally "regents' piece", is a [[Portrait painting|group portrait]] of the board of trustees, called regents or regentesses, of a [[charitable organization]] or [[guild]].  This type of group portrait was popular in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] during the 17th century, and in the 18th century.  They were intended to be hung in the ''regentenkamer'', the regents' meeting room,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/media/medialibrary/2013/04/Informatiepakket_Frans_Hals_2013.pdf "Informatiepakket Frans Hals", Frans Hals Museum] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; or another prominent location in the institution.

The regents of a charitable organization (such as an [[orphanage]], [[poorhouse]], [[hospital]] or ''[[hofje]]'')  or guild were drawn from the ''[[regenten]]'', the upper class of Dutch society. It was a prestigious honorary office, so the regents were keen to have themselves depicted in this role. The leading portraitists of the day were commissioned to make ''regentenstukken'', including [[Rembrandt]] (whose ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]]'' is a subtle treatment of a group round a table), [[Frans Hals]], [[Ferdinand Bol]], and [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. The commissions proved lucrative, particularly since the regents only served for a few years, to be replaced with a new set of regents that were equally eager to be painted.
[[File:Frans Hals - De regentessen van het oudemannenhuis.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse]] in [[Haarlem]], [[Frans Hals]], 1664]]

In some institutions the regentesses were all female, and so the portraits were of all-female groups, or there were mixed-gender regents who were painted separately, as in Hals' two portraits of the ''[[Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse|Regents]]'' and ''[[Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse]]''.  Occasionally the painting depicted not just the regents but also others, such as the ''binnenvader'' or ''binnenmoeder'', who was in charge of the day-to-day operations. For instance, [[Abraham de Vries (painter)|Abraham de Vries]] in 1633 painted a ''regentenstuk'' for the ''Burgerweeshuis'' orphanage in [[Amsterdam]] showing not only the regents but also the ''binnenvader'' leading in a young orphan girl.

Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the [[militia group portrait]] or ''schuttersstuk'' showing officers of a city's ''[[schutterij]]'' or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the 17th century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Boards of trustees preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces.  Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter. 

The cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. 

In Amsterdam most of these paintings ultimately ended up in possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the [[Amsterdam Museum]].

[[File:William Davenant.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Davenant]], owner of Rutland House, Aldersgate Street.]]

'''Rutland House''' was the name of at least two [[London]] houses occupied by the  [[Duke of Rutland|Earls]] and [[Dukes of Rutland]].
Rutland House on Aldersgate Street was leased by playwright Sir [[William Davenant]], who converted a room of it into a private theatre in the 1650s. Rutland House in Knightsbridge was a six-acre site until its demolition in the 1830s.

==Rutland House, Aldersgate Street==
Rutland House on [[Aldersgate|Aldersgate Street]], near [[Charterhouse Square]] in the [[City of London]], close to [[Smithfield Market]], was leased by the playwright and impresario Sir [[William Davenant]] (1606–1668).

In 1656, freshly released from imprisonment, Davenant turned a room of the house into what was, at first, a private [[theatre]] performing his own [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. Soon the performances were advertised and semi-open to the public at a cost of 5 [[shilling]]s a head, a figure that ensured that only persons of quality would be able to attend. The reason for Rutland House being used rather than a conventional theatre was to overcome the laws of [[censorship]] which operated in all public places following the closures of all public theatres by the [[Puritan]] government of [[Oliver Cromwell]].

The house seems to have been not totally suitable for theatrical use; however, a low narrow hall, or [[salon (room)|salon]], at the rear of the house was adapted for the performances. Rather than sitting in comfort, the audience had to sit on improvised [[Bench (furniture)|bench]]es, and so confined was the space available that the benches had to be arranged at an angle to the small [[stage (theatre)|stage]] to accommodate the large audiences who came.  The small stage, described by Davenant as a  "Cup-board stage", was adorned with gold and purple curtains.  Above the stage in what was contemporarily described as a "louver hole" was concealed a small [[orchestra]].

Davenant had seen Italian [[opera]] sung in [[Paris]]; this inspired him to conceive a cunning plan: as the Puritan government had no objection to music, only drama, he obtained permission to stage a performance of his opera  ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]'', to be sung in "[[recitative]] music".  Thus, the first English opera was performed at Rutland House in May 1656 &lt;!--https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/3/8/14380/14380-8.txt says 23 May, http://www.hoasm.org/VIIA/Davenant.html says 21 May--&gt;, simultaneously overcoming the prohibition of drama.  The Rutland House production also included [[England]]'s first professional [[actress]], Mrs. Coleman &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/4/1/2/4126/4126.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and was later transferred to the [[Cockpit Theatre]] in [[Drury Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/3/8/14380/14380-8.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Davenant established at least two other "private performance houses" in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] and [[Drury Lane]]. After Davenant opened more conventional theatres, he continued to use Rutland House to preview new productions, to gauge audience reaction.

Another Rutland House occupied a six-acre site in [[Knightsbridge]], then just outside London, from the mid 18th century until it was demolished in 1836. Rutland Gate, a street-cum-square of well-proportioned houses was erected on its site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZMEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22levett+blackborne%22&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;q=thoroton#PPA54-IA2,M1 Some Account of the Military, Political and Social Life of the Right Hon.

"'''Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja'''" is a song by Welsh [[rock music|rock]] band [[Lostprophets]]. Written by frontman [[Ian Watkins (Lostprophets)|Ian Watkins]], the song was released in 2001 as the first single from the band's debut studio album, ''[[The Fake Sound of Progress]]''. It was the only charting single on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts from the album, and was still on the band's [[concert tour|tour]] [[setlist]] when they broke up in 2013.&lt;ref name="uktourso"&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lostprophets/16114 |title=Feel My Pain!| date = 10 February 2004 | accessdate=2009-02-19 |format= |work=NME |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing and production ==
The band wrote the song in under an hour. According to frontman [[Ian Watkins (Lostprophets)|Ian Watkins]], it is a song about nostalgia for when the band were growing up together in their home town of [[Pontypridd]], South Wales, and was originally inspired by the [[Shinobi]] arcade game they used to play at the Park View Café in Pontypridd. The song's name is derived from the video games [[Shinobi series|''Shinobi'']] and ''[[Bad Dudes vs. DragonNinja]]''.

== Release and reception ==
"Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja" was released in the summer of 2001 and became the most successful song from ''The Fake Sound of Progress'' on the American rock charts. It appeared on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart at 33. In the [[United Kingdom]] the album peaked at 41 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2001 and stayed on the charts for two weeks. After the release of the follow-up single "[[The Fake Sound of Progress (song)|The Fake Sound of Progress]]" in 2002 "Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja" re-charted and peaked at 161.&lt;ref name="Zobbel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt; The song was featured on the soundtrack of [[ATV Offroad Fury 2]].

==Music video==
The video for this single is one of few Lostprophets videos actually filmed in the UK. It features the band performing to a crowd of people on the roof of a disused [[multi-storey car park]] in [[Edmonton Green Shopping Centre|Edmonton]], North London. The video received significant airplay on [[MTV2]]. The music video was directed by Mike Piscitelli, who would direct the music video for "The Fake Sound of Progress," the follow-up single to "Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja."&lt;ref name="metalhammer"&gt;{{cite web |author= Dan Hammer |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/lostprophets-making-more-fucking-videos/  |title=Lostprophets: Making More Fucking Videos! | date= 3 January 2002 |accessdate=2009-02-18 |format= |work=Metal Hammer |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting for the music video started on 5 October on a Friday at an undisclosed location.&lt;ref name="nme"/&gt; Any fan that wanted to participate in the music video could simply [[email]] their name, age, gender and contact number to the band.&lt;ref name="nme"/&gt; Once the email was received, the band chose who they wanted to include in the music video.&lt;ref name="nme"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.nme.com/news/lostprophets/9472 |title=Prophet From Your Favourite Band's Needs! |accessdate=2009-02-18 | date= 1 October 2001 |format= |work=NME |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate version of the music video exists in a completely different setting, showing the band performing live.

'''''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[feminist]] [[academic journal]]. It was established in 1975 by [[Catharine R. Stimpson]], and is published quarterly by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. ''Signs'' publishes essays examining the lives of women, men, and [[Non-Binary|non-binary]] people around the globe from both historical and contemporary perspectives, as well as theoretical and critical articles addressing processes of [[gender]]ing, [[sexualization]], and [[racialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=M|year=2011|title=Signs 2005–2015: Reflections on the Nature and Global Reach of Interdisciplinary Feminist Knowledge Production|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1086/657513|journal=Signs|volume=36|issue=3|pages=511–519|doi=10.1086/657513|jstor=10.1086/657513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and significance ==
The founding of ''Signs'' in 1975 was part of the early development of the field of [[women's studies]], born of the [[women's liberation movement]] of the late 1960s and 1970s. The journal had two founding purposes, as stated in the inaugural editorial: (1) "to publish the new scholarship about women" in the U.S. and around the globe, and (2) "to be [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stimpson|first=Catharine R.|last2=Burstyn|first2=Joan N.|last3=Stanton|first3=Domna C.|last4=Whisler|first4=Sandra M.|date=1975-10-01|title=Editorial|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/493202|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=1|issue=1|pages=v–viii|doi=10.1086/493202|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was for readers of the journal to "grasp a sense of the totality of women's lives and the realities of which they have been a part."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The meaning behind the name ''Signs'' is that signs "represent" and "point": the original editors wanted the journal to "represent the originality and rigor" of women's studies and to "point" to new directions for feminist scholarship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Former editor-in-chief Ruth-Ellen Boetcher Joeres said in an article in the [[Yale Journal of Criticism]] that ''Signs'', from its inception, was meant to be "something different, even insurgent...an agent for change", because it emerged from the "[[grassroots]]" feminist movement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joeres|first=Ruth-Ellen B.|date=1997-10-01|title=The Paradox of a Feminist Academic Journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/36767|journal=The Yale Journal of Criticism|volume=10|issue=2|pages=439–443|doi=10.1353/yale.1997.0021|issn=1080-6636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joeres explored the "paradox" of how a journal can be both an "agent for change" and regarded as "respectable in the academy," and concluded with the hope that ''Signs'' could retain its activist roots and transform the academy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the effort to avoid the tendency of the academy to "codify" and limit scholarship, ''Signs'' rotates institutional homes roughly every 5 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is currently based at [[Northeastern University]], with [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], Director of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Professor of Sociology, serving as editor-in-chief. In her inaugural editorial, Walters laid out five "core concerns" for ''Signs'': (1) for the field of women's studies to "substantively reckon" with [[Gender studies|gender and sexuality studies]] and [[queer studies]]; (2) to focus on "racial and ethnic difference"; (3) to re-emphasize "inter- or transdisciplinarity"; (4) to not lose sight of "the big questions about gender and sexuality" by getting too narrow in scope; and (5) to expand the journal's "digital presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/inaugural-editorial-thinking-and-doing-feminism/|title=Inaugural Editorial: Thinking and Doing Feminism|date=2014-12-08|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of ''Signs'' is explored extensively in Kelly Coogan-Gehr's 2011 book ''The Geopolitics of the Cold War and Narratives of Inclusion: Excavating a Feminist Archive''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcJgAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Geopolitics+of+the+Cold+War+and+Narratives+of+Inclusion:+Excavating+a+Feminist+Archive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4prGtkuvVAhVJ2oMKHRciAeAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Geopolitics%20of%20the%20Cold%20War%20and%20Narratives%20of%20Inclusion:%20Excavating%20a%20Feminist%20Archive&amp;f=false|title=The Geopolitics of the Cold War and Narratives of Inclusion: Excavating a Feminist Archive|last=Coogan-Gehr|first=K.|date=2011-11-03|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230370555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coogan-Gehr uses ''Signs'' as a case study to complicate what she calls the "stock narrative of feminist field formation." She argues that dominant histories of the development of academic feminism, in focusing solely on the women's movement and other radical movements of the 1960s, fail to take into account the role of "changes the Cold War produced in higher education."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the book, she calls ''Signs'' a "premier academic feminist journal."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Feminist Public Intellectuals Project (FPIP) ==
In 2015, ''Signs'' launched the [http://signsjournal.org/feminist-public-intellectuals-project/ Feminist Public Intellectuals Project], which seeks to engage feminist theorizing with pressing political and social problems via three open-access, online-first initiatives: [http://signsjournal.org/short-takes/ Short Takes: Provocations on Public Feminism,] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/ Currents: Feminist Key Concepts and Controversies], and [http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist/ Ask a Feminist.] Given the fragmentation of feminist activism and the persistent negative freighting of the term “feminist,” the Feminist Public Intellectuals Project seeks to reimagine what role a journal can play in provoking activism.

''Short Takes'' features commentaries by feminist activists and public intellectuals on recent books that "have shaped popular conversations about feminist issues," alongside a response by the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/short-takes/|title=Short Takes|date=2015-06-12|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured books include [[Roxane Gay|Roxane Gay's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/bad-feminist Bad Feminist]'', [[Rebecca Traister|Rebecca Traister's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/all-the-single-ladies/ All the Single Ladies]'', and [[Andi Zeisler|Andi Zeisler's]] ''[http://signsjournal.org/zeisler/ We Were Feminists Once.]''

''Currents'' publishes essays that put forth "a nuanced and edgy take on a key issue circulating in the feminist definitional landscape."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Issues addressed include [http://signsjournal.org/currents-identity-politics/ "identity politics,"] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-trigger-warnings/ "trigger warnings,"] [http://signsjournal.org/currents-celebrity-feminism/ "celebrity feminism,"] and [http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/ "affirmative consent."]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/currents-affirmative-consent/|title=Currents: Affirmative Consent|date=2015-11-02|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ask a Feminist'' is an interview series that seeks to create "conversation between and among feminist scholars, media activists, and community leaders," to bridge the divide between scholarship and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/ask-a-feminist/|title=Ask a Feminist|date=2016-05-17|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent features include "[[Angela P.

== Catharine R. Stimpson Prize ==
''Signs'' awards the Catharine R. Stimpson Prize for Outstanding Feminist Scholarship, named for the founding editor-in-chief of ''Signs,'' biennially to the best paper from an international competition of "emerging" feminist scholars (meaning "fewer than seven years since receipt of the terminal degree").

== Safety Classes ==
Software classification is based on potential for hazard(s) that could cause injury to the user or patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mddionline.com/article/developing-medical-device-software-iec-62304|title=Developing Medical Device Software to IEC 62304 {{!}} MDDI Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry News Products and Suppliers|website=www.mddionline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per [[IEC 62304|IEC 62304:2006]], software can be divided into three separate classes:
* Class A: No injury or damage to health is possible
* Class B: Nonserious injury is possible
* Class C: Death or serious injury is possible

=== Serious injury ===

Injury or illness that directly or indirectly
* is life threatening
* results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or
* necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.

'''Standard manuscript format''' is a formatting style for manuscripts of short stories, novels, poems and other literary works. Even with the advent of [[desktop publishing]], making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally [[typesetting|typeset]], many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines. Although there is no single set of guidelines, the "standard" format describes formatting that is considered to be generally acceptable.&lt;ref name="Shunn"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shunn|first1=William|title=Proper Manuscript Format|journal= Writers Write: The Internet Writing Journal|date=December 1998|url=http://www.shunn.net/format/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although publishers guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=5, 10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[style guide]]s are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since "virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation: A Handy Reference to Resolve All Your Grammatical Problems|last= Stevenson|first=Jay|year=2005|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-393-6|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscript formatting depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers' standards will take precedence over [[style guide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Formatting and Submitting your Manuscript|edition= 3rd|last1= Sambuchino|first1= Chuck |last2= The Editors of Writer's Digest Books|year= 2009|publisher= Writer's Digest Books|location= Cincinnati, OH|isbn= 978-1-58297-571-9|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In general, a document with standard manuscript format will have the following features:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfwa.org/2008/11/manuscript-preparation/|title = Manuscript Preparation|date = 2008-11-07|last = McIntyre|first = Vonda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Splane&gt;{{cite book|last1=Splane|first1=Lily|title=The Book Book: A Complete Guide to Creating a Book on Your Computer|date=2002|page=31|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSCFzLxu-58C&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=www.aw-bc.com&gt;{{cite book|last1=Addison-Wesley/Benjamin Cummings publishing team|title=Author guidelines|publisher=Addison-Wesley or Benjamin Cummings|url=http://www.aw-bc.com/publishing/authorguidelines/|chapter=Chapter 6: Preparing the Text Manuscript|chapter-url=http://www.aw-bc.com/publishing/authorguidelines/Ch06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Letter (paper size)|8.5"×11"]] or [[A4 (paper size)|A4]] paper size.
* [[Courier (font)|Courier]] or a similar [[Monospaced font|monospaced]] [[serif]] font.
* 12-[[Point (typography)|point]] (10 [[Pitch (typewriter)|{{abbr|pitch|characters and spaces per inch of running text}}]]) or 10-point (12 pitch) font size.
* [[Leading|Double-spaced]] lines of text (set in a [[word processor]] as 24-point or 20-point line spacing).
* 24 or 25 lines of text.
* 1, 1.25 or 1.5 inch margins.
* Paragraph indentation of 0.5 inches.
* Printed one-sided with black ink.
On the first page of the document, the author's name and contact information appears in the top left corner. In the top right corner of the first page, the wordcount appears.&lt;ref name="Shunn" /&gt;

Subsequent pages only have text in the top right corner. This text includes: the author's name, a slash, an abbreviated title, another slash, and the page number.&lt;ref name="Shunn" /&gt;

Writers can add the [[word count]] of the manuscript, although this may also be noted on a [[query letter]]. Most publishers pay writers based on a hypothetical number of words in the manuscript. However, this is not the physical count of actual words; this is a rough count of the number of characters divided to better estimate the space that the final text will consume in the published version. Normally, this involves counting every character in the manuscript, including spaces, and dividing by 6. If the correct font size is used, and if the [[Margin (typography)|margins]] are set so that lines contain an average of 60 characters, the editor can easily assume that there are 10 words per line. Furthermore, if the top and bottom margins are set so that there are, for example, 20 lines on each page, the editor can easily count 250 words per page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.davidfarland.net/writing_tips/?a=230|title = The Importance of Standard Manuscript Format|date = 2013-06-18|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Splane/&gt;&lt;ref name=www.aw-bc.com/&gt;

==Manuscript handling==
The final reason involves how editors, copy editors, and typesetters handle manuscripts. They might work on an entire manuscript at one time or the editor might hand groups of pages to the typesetter at a time. Unstapled pages facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://homeschoolmagazinereviews.com/en/dissertation-writing-process|title = Dissertation Writing Process|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page numbers, author's name, and title on every page ensure that if an unstapled manuscript is shuffled on a table, shared among two or more people, or dropped, it can easily be reassembled, and if a stack of unstapled manuscripts is dropped, it can easily be sorted into the correct sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-basics-standard-manuscript-format-and-mailing/|title = The Basics of Manuscript Format and Mailing|date = 2010-03-27|accessdate = 2015-02-09|website = Brad R. Torgersen|publisher = |last = Torgersen|first = Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other manuscript formats==

There are formatting conventions for different kinds of written works, including:
* Plays and screenplays
* Novels and novellas
* Essays and longer nonfiction works
* Stories and collections of stories

'''''The Informant''''' is a [[nonfiction]] [[white-collar crime]] book written by journalist [[Kurt Eichenwald]] and published in 2000 by [[Random House]].&lt;ref name="Webber"&gt;{{cite news |last=Webber |first=Susan |title=Tale of the Tapes |work=The Daily Deal |publisher=[[Aurora Advisors]], Inc. |date=2000-09-25 |url=http://www.auroraadvisors.com/articles/2000-09_dailydeal.html |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It documents the mid-1990s [[lysine price-fixing conspiracy]] case and the involvement of [[Archer Daniels Midland]] executive [[Mark Whitacre]], inspiring [[The Informant!|a film adaptation]] starring [[Matt Damon]] as Whitacre.

==Summary==
{{see also|Lysine price-fixing conspiracy}}
{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?160555-1/informant-true-story-part-1 Part One of ''Booknotes'' interview with Kurt Eichenwald  on ''The Informant'', February 4, 2001], [[C-SPAN]]| video2 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?160555-2/informant-true-story-part-2 Part Two of ''Booknotes'' interview, February 11, 2001], [[C-SPAN]]}}
In the early 1990s, at the [[agri-business]] conglomerate [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), [[Mark Whitacre]] is a corporate vice president and head of the bio-products division. In November 1992, under pressure from his wife, Whitacre confesses to an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent that he, along with other ADM executives, routinely met with competitors to fix the price of [[lysine]], a food additive. Afterwards, Whitacre assists in gathering evidence against the other conspirators by secretly taping their activities during overseas business meetings. Over the course of three years, the FBI collects hundreds of hours of video and audio tapes documenting the largest case of price-fixing in history.

Whitacre is revealed to have defrauded $9 million from ADM at the same time he was aiding the FBI. After federal agents stage raid on ADM, the company hits back with damning evidence against the government's star witness. Whitacre becomes delusional and engages in [[pathological lying]] to save himself, leading the FBI to learn that he suffers from [[bipolar disorder]]. Worst of all, he gives false stories to the media about being forced to destroy evidence by the FBI. Whitacre becomes extremely manic, stops sleeping, and exhibits bizarre behavior as his meltdown continues. He attempts suicide a few months later, but is saved by his groundskeeper.

After seeing the movie ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'', Whitacre's delusional fantasy causes him to record and collect his conversations with FBI agents. Because he violated his immunity agreement with the government, Whitacre is charged with price-fixing along with the other ADM conspirators. Whitacre's attorney, James Epstein, successfully convinces the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] officials that the government was culpable for Whitacre's behavior as he was emotionally unprepared for the case. Epstein manages to get a very light sentence for Whitacre. However, Whitacre, unwilling to serve any jail time, fires Epstein.

At his trial, Whitacre is convicted and receives a federal prison sentence three times longer than the other conspirators. Whitacre's FBI handlers, along with [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], attempt to obtain a [[presidential pardon]] for Whitacre. With remarkable support from the FBI and his wife, Whitacre recovers from his mental problems and, after leaving prison, is promoted to COO and president of a California biotechnology company.&lt;ref name="News Blaze"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writers |title=Mark Whitacre, Ph.D. Promoted at Cypress Systems, Inc. and a Warner Bros.

'''''The Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome''''' is a glue-[[tempera]] on canvas painting measuring 73.5 cm by 268 cm. It was produced in 1505–1506 by [[Andrea Mantegna]] and is now in the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/andrea-mantegna-the-introduction-of-the-cult-of-cybele-at-rome|title=Catalogue page|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of Mantegna's output after 1495 it is in [[monochrome]], linked to contemporary sculpture and also part of the trend for illusion and [[trompe l'oeil]] favoured by the Mantuan court and especially by [[Isabella d'Este]].

==History==
It was commissioned in 1505 by cardinal [[Marco Cornaro (cardinal)|Marco Cornaro]] for the study of his brother [[Francesco Cornaro (cardinal)|Francesco]], a patrician of [[Venice]]. The Cornaro family was said to be descended from the [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]] [[gens]] of ancient Rome - the same cardinal signed himself "Marcus Cardinalis Cornelius" in a letter asking [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] for a work from Mantegna, who was the latter's court painter at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Alberta De Nicolò Salmazo, ''Mantegna'', Electa, Milano 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The chosen subject was from the history of the Cornelii, specifically the arrival of [[Cybele]]'s image in Rome during the [[Second Punic War]], as told in [[Ovid]], [[Appian]] and [[Livy]]. [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] had consulted the [[Sibylline Books]] and ordered the image brought from [[Mount Ida]]. The [[Delphic Oracle]] requested that the most worthy Roman be sent to collect it and so the senate had chosen Africanus' cousin [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica|Scipio Nasica]] for the role. The ship carrying the image back got stuck in the shallows of the [[River Tiber]], but the [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Claudia Quinta]] proved her virginity by helping to free it.&lt;ref&gt;Tatjana Pauli, ''Mantegna'', serie ''Art Book'', Leonardo Arte, Milano 2001. {{ISBN|9788883101878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrea Mantegna 113.jpg|thumb|left|Detail]]
[[File:Andrea_Mantegna_112.jpg|thumb|right|The shepherd]]
Mantegna showed a scene after the image had been brought ashore, just as it arrives at the temple built in Rome for it. He based it on ancient Roman sarcophagi, then starting to be rediscovered and entering collections such as the [[Gonzaga collection]] in Mantua. He painted the scene as if it was carved into a piece of marble with two differently mottled layers, one forming the scene and the other the background. Two pyramid tombs to the left bear the names of Nasica's father [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]] and Africanus' father [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] - Gnaeus and Publius were brothers. 

The two bearers in front of the image are turbaned like [[Moors]], and the bearded pair at the back wear [[papal tiara|tiara]]-like hats. One of the two rear bearers also holds a laurel branch, as used in a [[Roman triumph]], as does a young slave crouching in front of the bust. The bust wears a [[corona turrita]] and stands on a sphere on a precious carpet, with the sphere representing universality. Behind it is a ritual torch, whilst Nasica is shown as a young man kneeling before the bust - his words welcoming it are shown on the lower border. Behind him is another senator, probably Africanus, who is speaking to another man, possibly his fellow-consul [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius Crassus Dives]]. The furthest right figure is a shepherd, wearing a [[Phrygian cap]], playing a flute and drum and standing on the steps of the temple to which the image is being brought - a trumpet protrudes from the temple doors.

[[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''[[Continence of Scipio (Bellini)|Continence of Scipio]]'' ([[National Gallery of Art, Washington]]) was painted as a pendant for it, but two other intended paintings were never produced. Garavaglia cites a spoken assertion by [[Roberto Longhi]] that the painting could have been accompanied by the two smaller monochrome works ''[[Sofonisba (Mantegna)|Sofonisba]]'' and ''[[Tuccia (Mantegna)|Tuccia]]'' – they are certainly the same height as ''The Introduction'', but they are on panel not canvas and no documents support the theory.

[[Pietro Bembo]] wrote a letter to [[Isabella Gonzaga]] in 1505, referring to arguments about payment between the commissioner and the painter, which meant it was still mentioned in the inventory of Mantegna's studio contents after his death in 1506, which refers to it as "principiata" (ie begun but incomplete). It was completed by Mantegna's son Francesco, by Bellini or another painter. Like other works in Mantegna's studio upon his death, it was acquired by cardinal [[Sigismondo Gonzaga]], who in 1507 finally delivered it to Francesco Cornaro.&lt;ref&gt;Ettore Camesasca, ''Mantegna'', in AA.VV., ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Firenze 2007. {{ISBN|888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Life and Times of Juniper Lee''''' is an American [[animated television series]], created by former [[MTV]] reality star [[Judd Winick]] for [[Cartoon Network]]. The show was produced by [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. It premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on May 30, 2005, and ended its run on April 9, 2007. The show currently reruns on [[Pogo (TV channel)|Pogo]] in India, [[Boing (Africa)|Boing]] in Nigeria, South Africa and France, [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] in Thailand and [[Tooncast]] in Latin America. On April 11, 2017, it was added to Boomerang's streaming app in the United States, making it one of the few shows that are on the app that did not air on the actual Boomerang channel in the US.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-JsApPkoYI&lt;/ref&gt;

The show had been renewed for two additional seasons. However, the show was cancelled for unknown reasons, thus leaving it off on a cliffhanger.

==Premise==
The series centers on the life of a preteen girl named Juniper Lee, who lives in Orchid Bay City. Based on Winick's adopted hometown of [[San Francisco, California]], the city is a hub for magical activity and is filled with various monsters and demons, both good and evil. The magic and human worlds have been separated by a magical barrier, known as "The Veil," which prevents ordinary humans from seeing any magic-related events or the creatures related to them. Juniper has recently been made the new Te Xuan Ze, the protector and the keeper of the balance between the human and magic worlds. To accomplish her task, she has been magically enhanced, making her far stronger and faster than ordinary humans. She can also use various kinds of magic to assist her. Maintaining the balance often interferes with her personal life, including her schoolwork and her social life, but she always manages to keep everything flowing. The show has a fairly campy and lighthearted take on the genre, often makes fun of itself, and rarely seems to take itself seriously.

==Inspiration==
Winick has stated that Juniper Lee was inspired by both ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. However, Juniper does follow in the footsteps of ''Buffy'', as stated in the quote below:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Interviewer''': We've touched on just about everything else, so hit us with the high concept. Sum up the show for us…

'''Judd''': I’m sounding like a broken record, but it's kind of like ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' meets ''The Simpsons''. That's the simplest way to put it. At the end of the day, it's about a little girl who fights monsters. There's a rather massive backstory to the whole thing, which really provides a spine to build from. I've only tapped into it a little in the show, but for me, knowing it's there is important. The show needs a spine, and needs a place to work from...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt |last=Brady |title=JUDD WINICK TALKS JUNIPER LEE |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=34655 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=2005-05-27 |accessdate=2007-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105136/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=34655 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Main characters==
{{Overly detailed|date=May 2011}}

===Juniper "June" Kim Lee===
Juniper Lee (voiced by [[Lara Jill Miller]]) is the [[main character]] of the series. Juniper is an eleven-year-old short tempered girl who lives in Orchid Bay City, and is the current Te Xuan Ze. Juniper is relatively uneducated in the world of magic, mostly relying on brute force, a real talent for insults, and the advice of her grandmother, Ah-Mah, and her enchanted dog, Monroe, to defeat her foes. She has long black hair, and after she inherits the powers of the Te Xuan Ze, a lock of hair on the left side changes to pure white from root to end (Juniper's grandmother Jasmine, the former Te Xuan Ze, has the same stripe in her hair) and Juniper later dyes this reddish-pink. The [[juniper]] [[flower]] symbolizes protection, referring to Juniper's role as the Te Xuan Ze, protecting others. She wishes to go to astronaut camp, but cannot because she can't leave Orchid Bay City while she is the Te Xuan Ze until another member of her family is chosen. She's also hoping for a breathtaking [[Romance (love)|romance]] with her close friend Marcus Conner.

===Jasmine Lee===
Jasmine Lee, or "Ah-Mah" ({{zh|c=阿嬤|p=Ā-mā|l=grandma}}, voiced by [[Amy Hill]]) as Juniper calls her, is Juniper's grandmother, and the previous Te Xuan Ze. Many in the magical world consider her to be the greatest Te Xuan Ze ever. Calm and deliberate in most respects but crude and tough when she needs to be, the 69-year-old gives June advice on dealing with the magical community and their expectations of her, and assists her when she is in serious trouble. As of the "Monster Con" episode, Ah-Mah was shown to still possess a significant amount of magically-enhanced speed and strength, though her stamina and durability are severely diminished (in comparison to her granddaughter who has superhuman strength) to the point of being unable to stand unassisted after two to three minutes of combat (this is because of her old age). This supports her assertion in the first episode - that it was no longer her place to act as Te Xuan Ze - and is pragmatic, in the sense that it prevents June from shirking her responsibilities. In "Little Big Mah", she claims that she knows about 26 different styles of hand-to-hand combat, and that she hasn't been to China for 40 years (as Roxanne: "I haven't been to China in 40 years! Uh, I mean weeks. For weeks."). Younger Jasmine is depicted with a purple streak in her hair, instead of the usual magenta Te Xuan Ze streak.

===Ray Ray Lee===
Ray Ray Lee (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) is Juniper's hyperactive, dimwitted eight-year-old little brother. Like Juniper, Ray Ray can see through the magic barrier, though this is not a naturally occurring ability. In the episodes after "Star Quality", he is occasionally seen watching monster TV. When Juniper first gained her powers, a group of demons attempted to drain her powers. Ray Ray unwittingly intervened, causing some of her powers to transfer to him, as seen in "Adventures in Babysitting". Whether or not he'll gain other powers similar to hers remains to be seen, as Ah-Mah has implied that he may over time.

He is hyperactive and careless, has crazy hair, and often gets himself into trouble when dealing with the magic world. Ray Ray is often over-eager in regards to the magic world, finding every single event involving it, no matter how bad or ominous, to be "cooool." A recurring joke about him is that asks if he has ever run out of energy, where someone would say, "but there's always a first time." He also has a [[sibling rivalry]] relationship with Juniper, although it is often seen that he cares for her deeply. Since episode "Feets too big", he has a crush on Lila, the [[Sasquatch]]. In the episodes after "O Brother, What Art Thou?", Ray Ray is a [[homunculus]], his mind having been transferred to an artificial body after accidentally mutating his original body into a massive dinosaur by ingesting the growth potion that was supposed to make a giant grow back to his proper size. In "Meet the Parent", Monroe states that Ray Ray has a bladder control problem, though this has never been confirmed, save in "The World According to LARP" when Juniper said that he wet his pants on the jungle gym once, and again in "Dream Date" where he has trouble making it to the bathroom after drinking punch. Since he is very young still, it is probable he will outgrow these tendencies. In "Te Xuan Me", where after Juniper was erased from knowledge he took up being the Te Xuan Ze, and being particularly skilled at his position, even earning Monroe's praise. However, after everything was set back to normal, Ray Ray started to study in magic spells as a way to help his sister in future battles.

===Monroe===
Monroe Connery Boyd Carlyle McGregor Scott V (Monroe for short, voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) is an enchanted [[pug]] of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] origin. He is quite educated in the world of magic, having been alive for several centuries and assisting each Te Xuan Ze for nearly that entire time. Despite his knowledge, Juniper Lee makes him his pet dog, due to his lack of grasping hands or opposable thumbs (according to Ray Ray, he uses this as an excuse for everything). Monroe has been magically enhanced, allowing him to be understood by those who can see through the magic barrier. Anyone else listening to him will only hear barking. He is also lactose intolerant.

===Dennis Lee===
Dennis Lee (voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]]) is Juniper's [[irritation|grumpy]], [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] older brother who does not take June or Ray Ray seriously and usually calls them names. He loves manga and video games and does not like anyone touching his stuff. In "Not in my Backyard", it is revealed that Dennis never gives June a turn in his video games (he says if monkeys fly out of his butt, she will have a turn, which will never happen). Also, when he saw that Ray-Ray got one of his comics books, he didn't like it at all. In "The World According to L.A.R.P.", he's been known to take stuff out of June's room, which annoys her. In "Sealed With a Fist", Dennis has grown to trust June after they work together with Boomfist and the heroic team of H.A.T.E. (Heroes Against Terrible Evildoers) to defeat the villainous team of L.O.V.E. (League of Villainous Evildoers).

===Jody Irwin===
Jody Irwin (voiced by [[Colleen Villard]]) is Juniper's best friend and usually the happiest of the group. She tries her best to cheer the group, even in the most ridiculous of ways. June tries her best not to disappoint Jody, but, being Te Xuan Ze, she ends up doing so but Jody forgives her.

===Ophelia Ramírez===
Ophelia Ramírez (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) is one of Juniper's friends. She is a [[Goth subculture|gothic]], [[emo]], grumpy, cynical girl with pinkish-purple colored hair and [[Latino]] descendancy. She doesn't like a lot of stuff and especially hates Roger (in fact, at some nights, Ophelia has nightmares that she's dating Roger). When she is in charge, she wants everything done perfectly and usually has Roger doing something ridiculous.

===Roger Radcliffe===
Roger Radcliffe (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is one of Juniper's friends and the school's clown, he wears a gangsta rapper costume, is a [[British people|Brit]] raised in [[United States|America]] and constantly asks Ophelia to go on a date, which she refuses. He's been known to imitate really famous people or songs in the most crude and ridiculous of ways, as in "Enter Sandman" when he was doing arm farts to [[New World Symphony (orchestra)|New World Symphony No. 9]], and in "It's the Great Pumpkin, Juniper Lee" where he was dressed up as a combination of a werewolf, a robot, and Abraham Lincoln. His family is eventually revealed to be wealthy, but he has never even come close to becoming spoiled due to his cheerful personality.

'''The Magic Circle''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[organisation]], dedicated to promoting and advancing the art of [[magic (illusion)|magic]].

Applicants must qualify for membership, either through a performance exam or by a written thesis on a branch of magic, after which they will be designated Member of the Magic Circle (M.M.C.) Further distinctions may earn them the title Associate of the Inner Magic Circle (A.I.M.C.), and Member of The Inner Magic Circle (M.I.M.C) a select group limited to 300 members. The Circle was founded in 1905, and was male-only until 1991. There is a junior branch, the Young Magicians Club, which gained popularity through the success of the [[Harry Potter]] franchise.

== History ==
[[File:Magic Circle Blue Plaque 2017.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Blue plaque]] commemorating the founding of the Magic Circle on the former Pinoli's in [[Wardour Street]]]]
[[File:Magic Circle staircase.jpg|thumb|upright|A staircase at the Magic Circle building]]
The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 after a meeting of 23 amateur and professional magicians at London's Pinoli's Restaurant. At this founders meeting, chaired by [[Servais Le Roy]], those present decided upon the name of the Society: it was initially felt that the name of the Society should be the Martin Chapender Club, in memory of the performer and founding member who had recently died at the age of twenty-five. However, it was then agreed that the name "Magic Circle" would be more appropriate and that this name shared the same initials as those of Martin Chapender.&lt;ref name="londonist"/&gt;

The first official meeting was at the Green Man [[public house]] in [[Soho]], but meetings were later in a room at [[St. George's Hall (London)|St George's Hall]] in Langham Place, where [[David Devant]] and [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] were regularly seen performing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illusionist.co.uk/magician-blog/2010/06/magic-circle-magician-faq/ |title=Magic Circle Magician FAQ |first=Andi |last=Gladwin |authorlink=Andi Gladwin |date=June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devant became the first president of the Magic Circle, and in 1906, Maskelyne edited the first issue of ''The Magic Circular'' magazine, a regular feature for members ever since. The ''Magic Circular'' claims to be the longest-running regular magic magazine in conjuring history.

The club was male-only until 1991, when more than 75% of members voted to admit women. As of 2010 there were around eighty female members of the Magic Circle, including [[Paul Daniels]]' wife, [[Debbie McGee]].&lt;ref name="londonist"/&gt; In 2014, [[Megan Knowles-Bacon]] became the first female officer in the Magic Circle, as well as the youngest person to be elected as an officer; she was elected as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/11217461/Magic-Circle-elects-Megan-Knowles-Bacon-as-first-female-officer.html|title=Magic Circle elects Megan Knowles-Bacon as first female officer|date=7 November 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motto ==
The motto of the society is the Latin ''indocilis privata loqui'', roughly translated as "not apt to disclose secrets" (lit. "incapable [of] speaking [of] private [things]") ; members give their word not to wilfully disclose magic secrets other than to bona fide students of magic. Anyone breaking this or any other rule may be expelled.

== Headquarters ==
[[File:Houdini's cabinet.jpg|thumb|'[[Harry Houdini|Houdini']]s Cabinet' at The Magic Circle Museum, London]]
Since 1998, the Magic Circle building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venue.themagiccircle.co.uk/ |title=Welcome to The Magic Circle |publisher=The Magic Circle |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in central London near [[Euston Station]] in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] has been available for meetings and corporate entertainment. It was voted the UK's Number One Venue in the hospitality industry's Top 20 UK Venues poll 2008.

The Magic Circle's headquarters houses a [[theatre]], library, museum, a dining room, a clubroom and bars. The museum features magic tricks, props, posters, programs, toys, photographs and artefacts related to conjuring history. Items of interest include, [[Robert Harbin]]’s original [[Zig Zag Girl|Zig Zag]] illusion, [[Chung Ling Soo]]'s robes, an original [[Sooty]] with associated [[Harry Corbett]] apparatus, sets of props used by television magicians [[David Nixon (magician)|David Nixon]] and [[Tommy Cooper]], items and a sound recording of [[Harry Houdini]] taken from an Edison cylinder, and a set of cups and balls used by HRH [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] when he took his Magic Circle exam in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/prince-charles-performs-his-first-conjuring-trick-in-public-news-photo/888813084#/prince-charles-performs-his-first-conjuring-trick-in-public-to-gain-picture-id888813084|title=Prince Charles performs his first conjuring trick in public to gain his membership to the Magic Circle|work=Getty Images|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Membership ==
Magicians who wish to join may spend up to two years as an Apprentice before applying for full membership.  They need to have known two current members for at least one year and must be at least 18 years old. These two members are then asked to act as sponsors, or referees, on the candidate's application form and propose them as a suitable candidate for membership. Following the receipt and processing of the application, the candidate is invited to an interview with the examinations secretary, usually at the London headquarters. If the candidate proves suitable and sufficiently knowledgeable a performance exam is scheduled or a thesis may be written. The exam takes place in front of a panel of judges, and candidates must demonstrate their skills to members in a rehearsed act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themagiccircle.co.uk/attachments/193_193_GuideFullRevised.pdf|title=The Magic Circle guide to examinations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a thesis is chosen, it is read by two examiners and a copy is made available in the Magic Circle library. The final stage is by vote by members of the Council, who will approve the candidate as a member. Once the applicant is successful, they are free to call themselves "Members of the Society" and use the letters '''''M.M.C.''''' after their name.

Members of the Magic Circle include: [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Luis de Matos (magician)|Luis de Matos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ionline.pt/artigos/mais/magico-luis-matos-premiado-londres-pelo-the-magic-circle|title=ionline|website=ionline|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Vincent (magician)|Michael Vincent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c3qI4ijaP8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael+Vincent&amp;f=false|title=Circle Without End: The Magic Circle 1905-2005|first1=Edwin Alfred|last1=Dawes|first2=Michael|last2=Bailey|date=1 July 2005|publisher=Jeremy Mills Publishing|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themagiccircle.co.uk/news/716-dynamo-wins-best-entertainment-programme|title=Dynamo wins Best Entertainment Programme|website=themagiccircle.co.uk|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom London (magician)|Tom London]], &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/americas-got-talent-star-surprises-129383/|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Archer (magician)|John Archer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2009/06/10/huddersfield-magic-circle-to-celebrate-60th-anniversary-86081-23831071/|title=Huddersfield Magic Circle to celebrate 60th anniversary|date=10 June 2009|publisher=Huddersfield Daily Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members may take a further examination to achieve the degree of '''''Associate of the Inner Magic Circle'''''. The designation '''A.I.M.C.''' shows this higher membership.  The A.I.M.C. degree can also be attained through thesis, and in rare cases &amp;ndash; that is when a candidate gains 18 or higher out of a possible 20 marks in the written exam &amp;ndash; examinees taking the M.M.C. exam are awarded the A.I.M.C. degree. Those who attain an A.I.M.C. degree as a result of a performance examination are awarded the A.I.M.C. with silver star.

Within the society, there are a number of members never exceeding three-hundred known as the "'''Inner Magic Circle'''". Full membership of the Inner Magic Circle is denoted by the letters '''M.I.M.C.''' after the member's name. '''Membership of the Inner Magic Circle''' is by call of The Society's President. The M.I.M.C. degree may be awarded with a gold star, to signify that the recipient is a performer of magic (as opposed to e.g. an inventor, historian or noteworthy volunteer for the Society). The honour of a gold star does not necessarily signify the holder's excellence as a performer and not all recipients are performers of excellence.

Members must undertake not to reveal magic secrets to anyone except bona fide magicians, on pain of expulsion.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Sponsored by the Magic Circle, members of the Young Magicians Club meet for monthly workshops at the Magic Circle Headquarters, the 'Centre for the Magic Arts' in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magicweek.co.uk/magic_articles/article_young_magicians.htm |title=The Young Magicians Club |last=Thomson |first=Ian A. |date=July 2000  |work=MagicWeek |accessdate=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Young Magicians Club's principal means of communication among its members is its bi-monthly magazine ''Secrets''. The worldwide membership also communicates through a members-only on-line forum on the Young Magicians Club website.

Membership in The Young Magicians Club requires no interview or exam and is open to all young people interested in magic. There are monthly all-day workshops for members who come from all over the country to take part. Adult members of the Magic Circle take on the responsibility of instructing the members of the Young Magicians Club. Local adult magic clubs will often have a junior magicians club attached to them but The Young Magicians Club is the only such club associated with the Magic Circle. Members of the Young Magicians Club are eligible to join the Magic Circle at a reduced rate when they reach 18, but then they must complete the examination procedure for full membership.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Young Magicians Club holds their annual one-day convention every October called 'J-Day'. The convention includes lectures and the finals of two competitions with awards, which include the ''Home Counties Trophy'' for stage magic, ''The Mark Leveridge Cup'' for close-up magic, ''Kaymar Komedy Cup'' and the ''Peter McCahon Award for Originality''. In recent years, the celebrity guest lectures have been presented by [[Derren Brown]] in 2010, [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]] in 2011, [[John Archer (magician)|John Archer]] in 2012, [[Marvin Berglas]] in 2013, [[Luis de Matos (magician)|Luis De Matos]]  in 2014 and Dave Loosley and [[Andi Gladwin]] in 2015.

The popularity of the [[Harry Potter]] franchise was one of the key reasons for the organisation's growth this century with membership doubling after the announcement of the first film in 2001.&lt;ref name="potter"/&gt;

'''''The Real''''' is an American [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]]. The series initially received a trial run on [[Fox Television Stations|Fox owned]] markets in the summer of 2013. The series was developed as a talk show designed to appeal to younger female viewers who, like the co-hosts, were experiencing new events in their lives. It was green-lit for national syndication later that fall and officially premiered the following year.

On January 3, 2018, [[Fox Television Stations]] picked up two more seasons of the series, effectively allowing [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]] to continue to produce it into the 2019-20 television season.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=‘The Real’ Renewed By Fox TV Stations Through 2020|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-real-renewed-fox-tv-stations-through-2020-1202234929/|website=Deadline Hollywood|accessdate=3 January 2018|date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">"'''The Visitor'''" is a 1965 short story  by British writer [[Roald Dahl]], centered on the fictional [[Uncle Oswald]] and the lurid adventures he describes in his elaborate diaries. In this story, set in 1946, Oswald has amorous designs on his [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]] host's wife and teenage daughter, with unfortunate and unexpected consequences.

==Plot==
Oswald becomes stranded for a night near [[Cairo]] at the mansion of a wealthy businessman, Abdul Aziz, whose wife and daughter are both very beautiful. Oswald plots to seduce either the wife or daughter, and believes he has succeeded after a woman slips into his bedroom under cover of darkness and spends several passionate hours with him, although he cannot see her face and she refuses to converse with him. The next day, Oswald leaves the house none the wiser as to which of the two women he has slept with.  The story ends with a dark twist as Mr. Aziz reveals to Oswald that he has a ''second'' daughter who lives in seclusion in another part of the house – because she has incurable [[leprosy]].

==Publication history==
"The Visitor" was first published in the May 1965 issue of ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref name=moses&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moses|first1=Norton H.|title=The Source of Roald Dahl's “The Visitor”|journal=ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews|url=http://literature.proquestlearning.com/quick/displayItemById.do?origin=toc&amp;PubID=12161&amp;QueryType=criticism&amp;ItemID=41099775%20pqllit_crit_lib|date=1999|volume=12|issue=2|pages=34–36|doi=10.1080/08957699909598055|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118124052/http://literature.proquestlearning.com/quick/displayItemById.do?origin=toc&amp;PubID=12161&amp;QueryType=criticism&amp;ItemID=41099775%20pqllit_crit_lib|archivedate=2015-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later included in the 1974 collection ''[[Switch Bitch]]''.

Norton H. Moses states that Dahl's story was expanded from an anecdote found in [[George "Dod" Orsborne]]'s ''Master of the Girl Pat'', published in 1949.&lt;ref name="moses"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Orsborne|first= George "Dod"|authorlink=George "Dod" Orsborne|title=Master of the Girl Pat|url= https://archive.org/details/masterofthegirlp009424mbp#page/n71|publisher= Doubleday|location= New York|pages=58-60|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===

In his later years, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] occasionally told this story as a black joke during his appearances on American talk shows, most notably during an appearance on ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'' on 29 May 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tomorrow Show (hosted by Tom Snyder)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QioPMnR9HM&amp;t=36m49s|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skerry|first1=Philip J.|title=Dark Energy: Hitchcock's Absolute Camera and the Physics of Cinematic Spacetime|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781623568696|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snjHAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22alfred+hitchcock%22+%22tomorrow+show%22&amp;q=tomorrow#v=onepage&amp;q=tomorrow%20show&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It preserves and makes available to the public documents, photographs, plans and drawings relating to the company and its predecessor bodies, such as [[London Regional Transport|London Transport]].  It is based at TfL headquarters building, 55 Broadway, built over [[St James's Park underground station]].

== History ==

London Transport did not appoint an archivist until 1992, by which time a significant volume of records had accumulated in the vaults under 55 Broadway since the opening of the first Victorian underground lines in the 1860s.  With the formation of Transport for London in 2000, the corporate archives became the responsibility of TfL Group Archives and Records Management department.

== Material held ==

TfL Group Archives holds records from a large number of predecessor bodies, including: 
* The [[London General Omnibus Company]]
* [[London County Council Tramways]]
* [[London United Tramways]]
* The [[Metropolitan Railway]]
* The [[District Railway]]
* The [[Central London Railway]]
* The [[City and South London Railway]]
* The [[Northern line|Great Northern and City Railway]]
* The [[Hammersmith &amp; City line|Hammersmith and City Railway]]
* The [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]]

Some of the records of predecessor companies, such as the Metropolitan Railway Company and early minutes from the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], are held on behalf of TfL by the [[London Metropolitan Archives]].

The majority of TfL Group Archives holdings are records of:
* London Transport (in its various incarnations running 1933-2000)
* Transport for London (2000–present day)

== Storage and access ==

Documents are stored offsite in the work-out parts of [[Winsford Rock Salt Mine]], [[Winsford]], [[Cheshire]], Britain's largest [[rock salt]] mine. The storage facility is operated by [[DeepStore Ltd.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepstore.co.uk/ Welcome to Deep Store]&lt;/ref&gt; a records' management company. Access to the archives is restricted and is by advance appointment only.  TfL Group Archives catalogue of all records held will be made available online and searchable to the public.

A '''Tree of 40 Fruit''' is one of a series of [[fruit tree]]s created by the [[New York City|New York]]-based artist Sam Van Aken using the technique of [[grafting]]. Each tree produces forty types of [[stone fruit]], of the genus ''[[Prunus]]'', ripening sequentially from July to October in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/08/03/337164041/the-gift-of-graft-new-york-artists-tree-to-grow-40-kinds-of-fruit|title=The Gift Of Graft: New York Artist's Tree To Grow 40 Kinds Of Fruit|date=3 August 2014|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/news/20142107-25892.html|title=This tree produces 40 different types of fruit|work=ScienceAlert|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Sam Van Aken is an Associate Professor of Sculpture at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notimpossiblenow.com/lives/could-a-tree-of-40-fruit-hold-a-clue-to-solving-world-hunger|title=Could a Tree of 40 Fruit Hold a Clue to Solving World Hunger?|last=Elliot|first=Danielle|date=19 November 2014|work=Not Impossible|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family is [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], and he grew up on the family farm.&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt;
[[File:Tree of 40 Fruit - tree 071 diagram.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Artist's planning diagram of "Tree 71"]]

In 2008, while looking for specimens to create a multicolored blossom tree as an art project, Van Aken acquired the {{convert|3|acre|ha}} orchard of the [[New York State Agricultural Experiment Station]], which was closing due to funding cuts.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert" /&gt; He began to graft buds from some of the over 250 heritage varieties grown there, some unique, onto a stock tree.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert" /&gt; Over the course of about five years the tree accumulated branches from forty different "donor" trees, each with a different fruit, including [[almond]], [[apricot]], [[cherry]], [[nectarine]], [[peach]] and [[plum]] varieties.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert" /&gt;
[[File:Tree of 40 Fruit - nursery - DSC 0302.jpg|thumb|A Tree of 40 Fruit fruiting in the artist's nursery]]

Each spring the tree's blossom is a mix of different shades of red, pink and white.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert" /&gt;

== Distribution ==

{{as of|2014}}, Van Aken had produced 16 Trees of 40 Fruit, installed in a variety of private and public locations, including community gardens, museums, and private collections.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert" /&gt; Locations include [[Newton, Massachusetts]]; [[Pound Ridge, New York]]; [[Short Hills, New Jersey]]; [[Bentonville, Arkansas]]; and [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name=Epicurious&gt;{{cite news|last1=Salkeld|first1=Lauren|title=The Tree of 40 Fruit Is Exactly as Awesome as It Sounds|url=http://www.epicurious.com/archive/chefsexperts/interviews/sam-van-aken-interview|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=Epicurious}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has plans to populate a city orchard with the trees.&lt;ref name="ScienceAlert" /&gt;

The '''Waldalgesheim chariot burial''' ({{lang-de|Waldalgesheimer Fürstengrab}}) was a 4th-century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] princely [[chariot burial]] site in [[Waldalgesheim]], Germany, discovered in 1869.
It has given its name to the "'''Waldalgesheim Style'''" of artifacts of the [[La Tène culture]], a more fluid and confident style of decoration than early [[Celtic art]], with Greek and Etruscan influences. The objects from the burial site were dug up by the farmer who found them on his land. The site was not investigated by archaeologists, and has recently been covered by a housing development.

==Site==

Waldalgesheim is in the middle Rhine valley to the west of the point where the Rhine is joined by the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe]].{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The first objects were found there by the plowman Peter Heckert on 18 October 1869 while digging holes to plant beets.
He did not attach any importance to them at first, but a passer-by said they could be historically important.
Eventually a [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] antique dealer bought the pieces for 450 Thaler.
Heckert continued to explore, and eventually found over 30 pieces.{{sfn|"Waldalgesheimer Stil" – Zukunftsgemeinde}}
It was not until the 20th century that it was recognized that the objects dated to the 4th century BC.
Objects from the site including gold rings and a bronze pot are held in the ''[[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn|Rheinischen Landesmuseum]]'' in [[Bonn]].{{sfn|"Waldalgesheimer Stil" – Zukunftsgemeinde}}

After the objects had been found the exact location was forgotten and no effort was made to preserve the site.{{sfn|Schönherr|2006|p=6}}
In 1997 Professor Michael Schönherr tried to organize an investigation of the arable area where the site was presumed to be located, based on fragmentary records.
He received no response from the state archaeologists apart from a request not to publish the location since that could attract looters.
In 2002 it emerged that there were plans to build housing over the plot.{{sfn|Schönherr|2006|p=7}}

==Contents==

The Waldalgesheimer [[chariot burial]] is one of the most important finds from the early Celtic period.{{sfn|"Waldalgesheimer Stil" – Zukunftsgemeinde}}
The grave dates from about 330 BC.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|2008|p=142}}
It was a wooden chamber under a barrow mound, with the fragments of a two-wheeled chariot to one side.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The burial dates from the La Tène Iron Age of the Rhineland.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=596}}
From the absence of warrior equipment and presence of jewelry the burial is presumed to be of a woman.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=45}}
Based on the rich array of grave goods, it is thought to have been that of a Celtic princess.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The objects mostly belong to the La Tène B period, apart from a spouted flagon, which is older.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=45}}

The funerary offerings include gold ornaments, a bronze flagon, a bucket and bronze plaques with repoussé human figures.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=596}}
The finest of the ornaments were a gold [[torc]], an arm ring and two bracelets.
The torc and the bracelets were decorated with low-relief "Waldalgesheim style" designs.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The style of the objects show influences from eastern France and southern Italy.{{sfn|"Waldalgesheimer Stil" – Zukunftsgemeinde}}
The bronze bucket from [[Campania]] probably dates to the second quarter of the 4th century BC, or soon after.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
The artifacts also include the fittings of the chariot. 
The harness and belt attachments have similar styles of ornament to the personal jewelry.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
Two similar sheets of bronze, badly damaged, are decorated with repoussé busts ornamented with the new style.{{sfn|Sandars|1995|p=363}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[File:Grabfund Waldalgesheim04.jpg|Bronze flagon|thumb]]
The flagon is in Early Style.{{sfn|Collis|2003|loc=PT191}}
It is at least a generation older than the other objects.
The precise engraving indicates that the flagon was made by skilled and specialized smiths.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=}}
It is heavily worn on the body, where it would have been held when pouring, showing that it was already old when it was buried.{{sfn|Collis|2003|loc=PT191}}
The flagon has a flattened pedestal base, a pot belly and a tubular spout.
Similar vessels have been found as far apart as [[Eigenbilzen]] in Belgium and [[Dürrnberg]] in Austria, and pottery versions have also been found.
There is a benign human face at the foot of the flagon's handle, and a stylized ram's head at the upper end of the handle.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=45}}
A horse decorates the lid of the flagon, showing eastern influences. Similarities with a gilt-bronze spouted flagon found at [[Reinheim]] indicate the same artist may have made both, or they may have been made by artists from the same school.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=47}}

The flagon and the bronze bucket seem to have been more deeply buried than the gold torc and bracelets, which has been taken as possible evidence of two burials at different dates.
However, it is entirely possible that the older objects were heirlooms buried at the same time as the more recent jewelry.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=47}}

==Waldalgesheim style==

The term "Waldalgesheim Style" was coined by [[Paul Jacobsthal]] (1880–1957) for objects with similar style to those found at Waldalgesheim.
It continues to draw on classical Celtic plant motifs, but marks the highest artistic level of the early Le Tene period with its confident interpretation and execution.
There is disagreement about the origin of the style, with no reason to suppose that it first appeared in the Rhineland. 
For this reason, some archaeologists prefer the term "vegetal" to reflect the emphasis on design derived from plants, and particularly from tendrils.
However, it is not the only style to use such motifs, and it included motifs unrelated to plants.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=70}}

Metalwork in this style appeared throughout Celtic Europe after about 350 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=596}}
The style shows influence from the Early Style, but generally has been found in different locations apart from the Marne region of the north of France.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
Although the Waldalgesheimer objects were found in a late barrow, Waldalgesheimer style objects are more often found in flat cemeteries in southern Germany, Switzerland, Italy and central and southeast Europe.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|2008|p=142}}
Some archaeologists see Waldalgesheimer influences in British objects, but this is questionable.{{sfn|Harding|2014|loc=PT208}}
The decorative style is found on different types of objects in different regions: sword sheaths in Italy, [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] in Switzerland and neck rings in France.
This indicates that the style was developed by specialized local craftsmen who adapted new decorative designs from Greek models, as opposed to being spread by traveling craftsmen.{{sfn|Sandars|1995|p=363}}

[[File:Casque d'Agris, musée d'Angoulême, Lamiot 2015 03.JPG|thumb|300px|Ornamentation on the neck guard of the [[Agris Helmet]] ]]
The Waldalgesheimer style is less naturalistic than the Early Style, with plant motifs that characteristically flow into each other in a continuous manner.
The designs subtly incorporate elements of human and animal faces and bodies.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|2008|p=142}}
Sometimes the designs incorporate chains of triskels, or curved-sided triangles.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=}}
The style includes sinuous tendrils and scrolls and asymmetrical plant spirals.
The low-relief compositions have over-and-under patterns.
Megaw (1970) has called the style "assured irrationality".{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=72}}
Two basic themes are the serpentine scroll and the lyre-motif, often combined with [[palmette]].{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=74}}

The parade armor helmets found in [[Amfreville-sous-les-Monts]] and in [[Agris]] are examples of the style.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=75}}
The [[Agris Helmet]] is remarkable as an example of high-status Le Tene metalwork which may have been buried as a ritual offering to the underworld spirits. The upper and lower panels of the helmet are decorated with unconnected palmettes, and the central panel with a series of S-curves, again unconnected. The infilling designs on the center panel show similarities to the Waldalgesheim objects, while the ornament of the neck-guard shows a freer experiment with a sinuous composition.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}

'''Wei Chen''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[television]] and radio [[journalism|journalist]].  She has worked for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] and its main rival [[CTV Television Network|CTV]].  In 2003, Chen surprised many by leaving [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], where she was a national correspondent, to work for a new local station called [[Toronto 1]] (now called SunTV), where she would host the station's morning news program.

The program, ''[[Toronto Today]]'', was a failure; ratings were low. It was cancelled after only eight months on the air. The majority of the staff was laid off. Chen was reassigned as a reporter for the primetime magazine program ''[[Toronto Tonight]]'', as well as host of ''The Source''. Both shows were also cancelled. She joined the [[CBC Television|CBC]] and worked at TV stations in [[Calgary, Alberta]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] and [[Toronto, Ontario]].

In January 2007, Chen became the new host of [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[Ontario Morning]]'', the network's local morning show for [[Southern Ontario]]. She lives in Toronto with her husband and daughter.

Chen was also a university roommate of singer-songwriter [[Jann Arden]].

''''' Woman, Culture, and Society''''', first published in 1974 ([[Stanford University Press]]), is a book consisting of 16 papers contributed by female authors and an introduction by the editors [[Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo]] and [[Louise Lamphere]]. On the heels of the 1960s [[feminist movement]], this book challenged [[anthropology]]'s status quo of viewing studied [[culture]]s from a male perspective while diminishing female perspectives, even considering women as comparatively imperceptible. It is considered to be a pioneering work.&lt;ref name=heider&gt;

The book features a number of widely cited essays including:
* In "Family Structure and Feminine Personality," [[Nancy Chodorow]] offers a psychoanalytic explanations for gender differences in personality, based on mother's primary role in raising small children and socializing girls into their gendered roles.
* In "Is female to male as nature is to culture?," first published in ''Feminist Studies'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortner|first=Sherry B.|date=1972|title=Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=1|issue=2|pages=5|doi=10.2307/3177638|issn=0046-3663|jstor=3177638}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sherry Ortner]] argues that the universal (or near universal) subordination of women across cultures is explained in part by a common conception of women as "closer to nature than men" (73). The title describes a [[Structural anthropology|structuralist]] analogy between deep cultural structures, in the sense theorized by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making gender: The politics and erotics of culture|last=Ortner|first=Sherry B.,|date=1996|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8070-4633-3|location=Boston|pages=173–80|chapter=So, Is Female to Male as Nature Is to Culture?|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It described cultural oppositions including culture/nature, man/woman, mind/body, public/private, civilized/primitive, and active/passive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist anthropology: Past, present, and future|last2=Stockett|first2=Miranda K.|date=2006|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=|isbn=978-0-8122-2005-6|location=Philadelphia|pages=6|chapter=Feminist anthropology: Perspectives on our past, present, and future|quote=|last1=Geller|first1=Pamela L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Ortner remembered it as "my first piece of feminist writing and my second professional publication."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
The title of the book alludes to the gendered nature of a prior anthropological text, ''Man, Culture, and Society''.
