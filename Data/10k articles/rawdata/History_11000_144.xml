      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7604">The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that calls international attention to [[cultural heritage]] around the world that is threatened by [[neglect]], [[vandalism]], [[war|conflict]], or [[natural disaster|disaster]].&lt;ref name=press_release&gt;{{cite web | title = World Monuments Fund Announces 2018 World Monuments Watch | author = Hillary Prim | date = October 16, 2017 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url =https://www.wmf.org/press-release/world-monuments-fund-announces-2018-world-monuments-watch|accessdate= July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of Endangered Sites that are in urgent need of [[Historic preservation|preservation]] funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2006 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES |author=Holly Evarts |date= October 6, 2009 |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |accessdate= July 29, 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Montefiore Hyamson''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (27 August 1875 – 5 October 1954) was a British civil servant and historian who served as chief immigration officer in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] from 1921 to 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==The Political Zionist of the 1910s and 1920s==

Hyamson was born in London and educated at [[Swansea Grammar School]] and Beaufort College, St Leonards. He entered the Civil Service in 1895, where he initially worked at the [[General Post Office|Post Office]]. During the First World War, Hyamson was one of the most active Zionist writers in the UK. His work had been published by the Anglo-Zionist lobby group, the British Palestine Committee, the Zionist leadership in London and the British press. [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] even claimed that one of Hyamson's articles in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' had stimulated his interest in Zionism.&lt;ref&gt;Renton, James. ''The Zionist Masquerade: The Birth of the Anglo-Zionist Alliance, 1914–1918'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2007 p.73,75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1917, Hyamson was made the editor of ''The Zionist Review'' (the newspaper published by the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Zionist Federation]]). In October of that year [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]] proposed a Jewish Bureau for the UK government's [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Department of Information]], however as Jabotinsky was preoccupied with organising the [[Jewish Legion]], the role fell to Hyamson. His work at the Bureau in December 1917 involved distributing news items that illustrated the British government's support for Zionism and the growing support for Zionism among the world's Jews. The main focus of his output was in America, where he distributed cables to two Jewish daily newspapers, ''[[The American Hebrew]]'' and ''American Jewish Chronicle''. At the same time, Hyamson became a senior member of a new committee created by the London Zionist Federation designed to publicise the Zionist message. The Jewish Bureau in the Department of Information and the London Zionist Federation ran in close contact, with members of the Federation writing much of the material for the Bureau. This enabled the Department of Information to hide the official nature of its propaganda, and allowed Zionists to produce material to promote their movement.&lt;ref&gt;Renton, 2007, pps.75–76&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Hyamson's work for the Department of Information included ''Great Britain and the Jews'', a pamphlet he wrote in response to the [[Balfour Declaration]] of 1917 that explained how the agreement was a part of a long tradition of British sympathy for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Renton, 2007, p.85-86&lt;/ref&gt; A film ''The British Re-conquering Palestine for the Jews'', made after General Allenby had taken Jerusalem, which was sent to Jewish centres around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Renton, 2007, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Palestine: The Rebirth of an Ancient People'' set out "the benefits the recent Jewish colonisation of Palestine has brought to the land".&lt;ref&gt;Renton, 2007, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Hyamson also made Jabotinsky the official British journalist for Zionist affairs in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Renton, 2007, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]], the British High Commissioner of Palestine, made Hyamson Commissioner for Migration of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] in 1921 which put him in charge of the Palestinian Administration's immigration department. Samuel reasoned that like himself, Hyamson was a Zionist, but would not give preference to these interests over those of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, Tom. ''One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate'', Abacus, 2001 p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; His attempts to administer British immigration quotas earned him a bad reputation, at least in [[Vilnius]], where he was known as a 'Jewish anti-semite'.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, 2001, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edwin Samuel, 2nd Viscount Samuel|Edwin Samuel]], the son of Sir Herbert, who worked with Hyamson in 1926, Hyamson had a "jaundiced view of his own staff: none, even the most senior, was allowed much discretion". He worked late into the night on immigration applications, deciding many of them personally.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Edwin H. ''A Lifetime in Jerusalem: The Memoirs of the Second Viscount Samuel'', Transaction Publishers, 1970 p.79&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Ronald Storrs|Sir Ronald Storrs]], Hyamson was one those Jews (like [[Norman Bentwich]]) whose work for the Administration of Palestine put him in an impossible position where he was criticised by both Arabs and Jews. He felt that Hyamson's attempts to apply the immigration regulations made him very unpopular with pan-Zionists despite having admitted many thousands of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Storrs, Ronald ''The Memoirs of Sir Ronald Storrs'', G.P. Putnams, 1937 p.390-391&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1926 Hyamson went on a tour of centres of Jewish population in Eastern Europe to investigate the conditions of the countries sending the largest numbers of immigrants to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;"News in Brief."

==The Bi-nationalist of the 1930s and 1940s==

Hyamson was made an [[OBE]] in the [[Birthday Honours|Birthday Honours list]] of 1931.&lt;ref&gt;(3 June 1931) [http://www.jta.org/1931/06/03/archive/jews-in-the-honours-list-knighthoods-for-lion-simon-and-montague-burton-distinctions-for-albert-hy ''Jews in the Honours List, Knighthoods for Lion Simon and Montague Burton: Distinctions for Albert Hyamson''] jta.org&lt;/ref&gt; The Mandate's Department of Immigration and Travel was reorganised in 1934 due to the increasing pressure of immigration from Germany. According to Edwin Samuel, Hyamson's insistence on doing as much work as possible himself had led to an application backlog of nine months. The Palestine Government responded to criticism about the situation by replacing Hyamson and his deputy Richard Badcock with Eric Mills and Samuels himself.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, 1970 p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

Talks to try to break the impasse between Arabs and Jews in Mandate Palestine took place in London during July and August 1937 between Arabs, Gentile Anti-Zionists, and Hyamson, who represented Jews opposed to a Jewish state. This led to the drafting of the Hyamson-Newcombe proposal in August–September 1937. Colonel Newcombe was a leading British Arabist who had been a colleague of [[T.E. Lawrence]] in the First World War and was the treasurer of the Palestine Information Office (the leading Gentile anti-Zionist lobbying group in the UK at the time). The Hyamson-Newcombe proposal suggested the founding of an independent Palestinian state with all citizens having equal rights and each community had autonomy, including for municipal authority for Jewish villages, towns and districts. It also stated that a Jewish State could not be created in any part of Palestine in the future, that the existing Arab majority would continue to rule, there would be limits on land sales to Jews, and although Jewish immigration could continue Jews should constitute no more than 50% of the population. The Zionist leadership rejected the proposal, while [[Judah Leon Magnes]] (who had received a letter from [[David Ben-Gurion]] warning him that it was a 'deception') welcomed the ideas as the 'portals to an agreement'. Magnes then used the proposal to work with moderate Arabs on an alternative to partition that was not tainted by official British endorsement. His efforts, however, fell through.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rory ''Divided Against Zion: Anti-Zionist Opposition to the Creation of a Jewish State in Palestine, 1945–1948'', Routledge, 2013, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rory 2006 ''J.L. Magnes and the Promotion of Bi-Nationalism in Palestine'' p.56 in Jewish Journal of Sociology, vol 48, no.

But there is another line that might be followed, in which there is at least a germ of hope. This is to keep before one the ideal of a united Palestine, with Jewish and Arab citizens all civilly and politically equal and free. Both these communities - if religious instead of racial lines are followed there would be more than two - should be given the widest possible autonomy in all matters - cultural, religious, even municipal - that concern their members alone."

|}

In 1942 Hyamson published ''[[Palestine: A Policy]]'', his work outlining his case against political Zionism and for a 'spiritual Zionism'. He was one of the original members of The Jewish Fellowship, founded on 7 November 1944, to campaign against (political) Zionism from a Jewish perspective. Founding members also included [[Basil Henriques]], [[Jack Cohen (politician)|Sir Brunel Cohen]], [[Joseph Leftwich]], [[Louis Gluckstein]], and Rabbi Israel Mattuck. The fellowship saw political Zionism as damaging the good relations the diaspora had achieved in the country of their birth, and as linked to a moral decline within Jewry. They held that the solution to problems faced by the Jewish community would be found in the revival of religious principles rather than political ones. By 1947, Leftwich felt that Hyamson was trying to turn the Fellowship into an organisation similar to Judah Magnes' [[Ihud]] (which sought Jewish-Arab co-operation for a bi-national unitary state).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2013 pps. 82 &amp; 182&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1945, Hyamsom was one of three Jews (the others being Jewish Fellowship members Emile Marmorstein and Rabbi Dr Israel Mattuck), and three Christians (Col. Newcombe, Arab specialist Nevill Barbour and [[Ralph Beaumont]] MP) as well as three Arabs to draw up A Constitution for Palestine. This was, according to Newcombe, a 'logical and moderate plea written in a matter of fact and convincing way' that attempted to show a non-Zionist solution to the Palestine problem composed by Christians, Jews and Muslims. The document broadly reiterated the Hyamson-Newcombe proposal, where an independent Palestinian state would be characterised by control of their own municipal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2013 p.160-161&lt;/ref&gt; However, the document did not refer to, or support, the more contentious clauses of the [[White Paper of 1939|MacDonald White Paper of 1939]], specifically clause 10(6) which called of an independent Palestinian state, and clause 10(7) which gave Arabs control over immigration. Although Hyamson and his Jewish colleagues were in agreement with the White Paper, these clauses were omitted so the Constitution would appeal to more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 2013 p.219-220&lt;/ref&gt;

==General information==
[[File:The American School of Classical Studies at Athens (Princeton).jpg|thumb|left|150px|The American offices of the school, located at 6-8 Charlton St, [[Princeton, New Jersey]]]]
Founded in 1892, the ASCSA is the most significant resource in Greece for American scholars in the fields of ancient and post-classical studies in Greek language, literature, history, archaeology, philosophy, and art. The mission of the School is to advance knowledge of Greece in all periods, as well as other areas of the classical world, by training young scholars, sponsoring and promoting archaeological fieldwork, providing resources for scholarly work, and disseminating research. The ASCSA is also charged by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism with primary responsibility for all American archaeological research, and seeks to support the investigation, preservation, and presentation of Greece's cultural heritage.

The School offers two major research libraries: the [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/Blegen-Library/ Blegen Library], with 94,000 volumes dedicated to the ancient Mediterranean world; and the [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/gennadius/ Gennadius Library], with over 120,000 volumes and archives devoted to post-classical Hellenic civilization and, more broadly, the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. The School also sponsors excavations and provides centers for advanced research in archaeological and related topics at its excavations in the [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/excavationagora Athenian Agora] and [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/excavationcorinth/ Ancient Corinth], and it houses an archaeological laboratory ([http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/Wiener-Laboratory/ the Wiener Laboratory]) at the main building complex in Athens.

==Resources and Services==
The ASCSA offers graduate students enrolled in member universities an unparalleled immersion into the sites and monuments of Greek civilization. Although there are many activities and programs at the School, its [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/programs/ core programs] are:

The Academic Year or 'Regular' Program, which runs from early September to early June, offers advanced graduate students from a variety of fields an intensive survey of the art, archaeology, history, and topography of Greece, from antiquity to the present.  The program for Regular Members is an integrated participatory program over nine months. Regular Members are expected to be in attendance for the full nine-month program. Students receive comprehensive training through visits to the principal archaeological sites and museums of Greece as well as in seminars led by resident and visiting scholars. They also take part in the training program at the Corinth excavations. The School accepts 15 to 20 students in this program.

The Summer Sessions, which run for two six-week periods each, are open to North American graduate and advanced undergraduate students and to high school and college instructors of classics and related fields. In these sessions, the School condenses its academic year program into an intensive introduction to the sites, museums, and monuments of Greece. The Summer programs are open to 20 participants each session.

The School welcomes scholars to its libraries year-round for research.  In addition, the School is a recognized leader in [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/digital-library/ digital resources], providing an ever-expanding collection of books, journals, photographs, excavation notebooks, personal papers, maps, and scientific data sets online.

==Archaeological fieldwork==
[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 22 View from Acropolis Hill - Museum of Ancient Agora.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Finds from the ASCSA excavations on the [[Athenian Agora]] are displayed in the reconstructed [[Stoa of Attalos]].]]

===ASCSA Projects===
Throughout its existence, the ASCSA has been involved in a large number of archaeological projects, as well as a major programme of primary archaeological publications. It is responsible for two of the most important archaeological sites in Greece, the [[Athenian Agora]] and [[Ancient Corinth]].  The [[Corinth Excavations]] commenced in 1896 and have continued to present day with little interruption, and the [[Ancient Agora of Athens#Excavations|Athenian Agora excavations]] first broke ground in 1932.  At both sites, the ASCSA operates important museums and extensive facilities for the [[Post excavation|study]] of the archaeological record.  Excavation records and artifacts are made available to wider audiences via [http://ascsa.net/ ASCSA.net]

===ASCSA Affiliated Projects===
Other archaeological projects with ASCSA involvement, past and present, include [[archaeological field survey|surveys]] in the Southern [[Argolid]], in [[Messenia]] and at [[Vrokastro]] ([[Crete]]) and [[excavations]] at [[Olynthus]] ([[Greek Macedonia]]), [[Samothrace temple complex|Samothrace]] ([[North Aegean]]), the islet of Mitrou ([[Central Greece]]), Halai ([[Phthiotis]]), [[Isthmian Games|Isthmia]], [[Kechries|Kenchreai]], [[Nemea]], [[Sicyon]] (all in [[Corinthia]]), [[Lerna]], [[Argos]], [[Franchthi]] cave and [[Porto Cheli|Halieis]] ([[Argolid]]), Mt. Lykaion (Acadia), 
[[Nichoria]] and the [[Palace of Nestor]] at [[Pylos]] ([[Messenia]]), Haghia Irini ([[Keos]]), as well as [[Azoria]], [[Mochlos]], [[Gournia]], [[Kavousi Vronda|Kavousi]] and [[Kommos (Crete)|Kommos]] on [[Crete]].

==Publications==
ASCSA publishes the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Hesperia (journal)|Hesperia]]'' quarterly as well as monographs for final reports of archaeological fieldwork conducted under School auspices, supplements to Hesperia, Gennadeion monographs; and miscellaneous volumes relating to the work of the School. These books range in format from large hardbacks to slim paperback guides.

Araujo's first book published in French, ''Romantisme tropical: l'aventure d'un peintre français au Brésil'',  examines how French travelogues, especially the travel account of French artist [[François-Auguste Biard]] (1799-1882), ''Deux années au Brésil'', contributed to construct a particular image of Brazil in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unmpress.com/books/brazil-through-french-eyes/9780826337450|title=Brazil through French Eyes {{!}} University of New Mexico Press|website=unmpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the University of New Mexico Press published a different version of this book ''Brazil Through French Eyes: A Nineteenth-Century Artist in the Tropics''.

The '''Aztec Empire''', or the '''Triple Alliance''' ({{lang-nci|'''Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān'''}}, [[Help:IPA for Nahuatl|[ˈjéːʃkaːn̥ t͡ɬaʔtoːˈlóːjaːn̥]]]), began as an alliance of three [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] {{lang|nci|[[altepetl]]}} city-states: {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan|Mexico-Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}}, {{lang|nci|[[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]|italic=no}}, and {{lang|nci|[[Tlacopan]]|italic=no}}. These three city-states ruled the area in and around the [[Valley of Mexico]] from 1428 until the combined forces of the Spanish {{lang|es|[[conquistador]]es}} and their native allies under {{lang|es|[[Hernán Cortés]]|italic=no}} defeated them in 1521.

The Triple Alliance was formed from the victorious factions in a civil war fought between the city of {{lang|nci|[[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]]|italic=no}} and its former tributary provinces.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"/&gt; Despite the initial conception of the empire as an alliance of three self-governed city-states, {{lang|nci|[[Tenochtitlan]]|italic=no}} quickly became dominant militarily.&lt;ref name="Hassig 1988"&gt;Hassig 1988&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, the lands of the Alliance were effectively ruled from {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}, while the other partners in the alliance had taken subsidiary roles.

The alliance waged wars of conquest and expanded rapidly after its formation. At its height, the alliance controlled most of central [[Mexico]] as well as some more distant territories within [[Mesoamerica]], such as the [[Soconusco|Xoconochco province]], an Aztec [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] near the present-day [[Guatemala]]n border. Aztec rule has been described by scholars as "[[hegemony|hegemonic]]" or "indirect".&lt;ref name="Smith2001"&gt;Smith 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztecs left rulers of conquered cities in power so long as they agreed to pay semi-annual [[tribute]] to the Alliance, as well as supply military forces when needed for the Aztec war efforts. In return, the imperial authority offered protection and political stability, and facilitated an integrated economic network of diverse lands and peoples who had significant local autonomy.

The [[state religion]] of the empire was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], worshiping a diverse pantheon that included dozens of [[deities]]. Many had officially recognized cults large enough so that the deity was represented in the central temple precinct of the capital {{lang|nci|Tenochtitlan|italic=no}}. The imperial cult, specifically, was that of {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}}, the distinctive warlike patron god of the Mexica. Peoples in conquered provinces were allowed to retain and freely continue their own religious traditions, so long as they added the imperial god {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}} to their local pantheons.

==Etymology and definitions==
{{Main|Aztec#Definitions}}
The word "[[Aztec]]" in modern usage would not have been used by the people themselves. It has variously been used to refer to the Triple Alliance empire, the [[Nahuatl]]-speaking people of central Mexico prior to the Spanish conquest, or specifically the [[Mexica]] ethnicity of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p3-4"&gt;Smith 2009 pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from a Nahuatl word meaning "people from [[Aztlan]]," reflecting the mythical place of origin for Nahua peoples.&lt;ref name="Smith1984"&gt;Smith 1984&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of this article, "Aztec" refers only to those cities that constituted or were subject to the Triple Alliance. For the broader use of the term, see the article on [[Aztec| Aztec civilization]].

==History==

===Before the Aztec Empire===
[[File:Aztlan codex boturini.jpg|thumb|left|250px|First page of [[Codex Boturini]], showing the migration of the Mexica]]
Nahua peoples descended from [[Chichimeca|Chichimec peoples]] who migrated to central Mexico from the north in the early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Davies1973p3-22"&gt;Davies 1973, pp. 3–22&lt;/ref&gt; The migration story of the Mexica is similar to those of other polities in central Mexico, with supernatural sites, individuals, and events, joining earthly and divine history as they sought political legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo López Austin, "Aztec" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Culture'', vol. 1, p. 68. Oxford University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the pictographic codices in which the Aztecs recorded their history, the place of origin was called [[Aztlán]]. Early migrants settled the [[Basin of Mexico]] and surrounding lands by establishing a series of independent city-states. These early [[Nahuas|Nahua]] city-states or ''[[altepetl]]'', were ruled by dynastic heads called ''[[tlatoani|tlahtohqueh]]'' (singular, ''tlatoāni''). Most of the existing settlements had been established by other indigenous peoples before the Mexica migration.&lt;ref name=Smith2009p37&gt;Smith 2009 p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

These early city-states fought various small-scale wars with each other, but due to shifting alliances, no individual city gained dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Calnek 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mexica]] were the last of the Nahua migrants to arrive in Central Mexico. They entered the Basin of Mexico around the year 1250 AD, and by then most of the good agricultural land had already been claimed.&lt;ref name="Davies1973"&gt;Davies 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexica persuaded the king of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], a small city-state but important historically as a refuge of the [[Toltecs]], to allow them to settle in a relatively infertile patch of land called [[Chapultepec]] (''Chapoltepēc,'' "in the hill of grasshoppers"). The Mexica served as mercenaries for Culhuacan.&lt;ref name="Tezozomocp49-51"&gt;Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975 pp. 49–51&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Mexica served Culhuacan in battle, the ruler appointed one of his daughters to rule over the Mexica. According to mythological native accounts, the Mexica instead sacrificed her by flaying her skin, on the command of their god [[Xipe Totec]].&lt;ref name="Tezozomocp52-60"&gt;Alvarado Tezozomoc (1975), pp. 52–60&lt;/ref&gt; When the ruler of Culhuacan learned of this, he attacked and used his army to drive the Mexica from Tizaapan by force. The Mexica moved to an island in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]], where, as legend is said to have predicted, an eagle nested on a [[nopal]] cactus. The Mexica interpreted this as a sign from their god and founded their new city, [[Tenochtitlan]], on this island in the year ''ōme calli,'' or "Two House" (1325 AD).&lt;ref name="Smith2009"/&gt;

===Aztec warfare===
{{Main|Aztec warfare}}
The Mexica rose to prominence as fierce warriors and were able to establish themselves as a military power.  The importance of warriors and the integral nature of warfare in Mexica political and religious life helped propel them to emerge as the dominant military power prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1519.

The new Mexica city-state allied with the city of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]] and paid tribute to its ruler, [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]].&lt;ref name="Smith2009p44"&gt;Smith 2009 p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; With Mexica assistance, Azcopotzalco began to expand into a small tributary empire. Until this point, the Mexica ruler was not recognized as a legitimate king. Mexica leaders successfully petitioned one of the kings of Culhuacan to provide a daughter to marry into the Mexica line. Their son, [[Acamapichtli]], was enthroned as the first ''tlatoani'' of Tenochtitlan in the year 1372.&lt;ref name="Tezozomoc"&gt;Alvarado Tezozomoc 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Tepanec]]s of Azcapotzalco expanded their rule with help from the Mexica, the [[Acolhua]] city of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] grew in power in the eastern portion of the lake basin. Eventually, war erupted between the two states, and the Mexica played a vital role in the conquest of Texcoco. By then, Tenochtitlan had grown into a major city and was rewarded for its loyalty to the Tepanecs by receiving Texcoco as a tributary province.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p46"&gt;Smith 2009 p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tepanec War===

In 1426, the Tepanec king Tezozomoc died, and the resulting succession crisis precipitated a civil war between potential successors.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p46"/&gt; The Mexica supported Tezozomoc's preferred heir, Tayahauh, who was initially enthroned as king. But his son, [[Maxtla]], soon usurped the throne and turned against factions that opposed him, including the Mexica ruler [[Chimalpopoca]]. The latter died shortly thereafter, possibly assassinated by Maxtla.&lt;ref name="Davies1973"/&gt;

The new Mexica ruler [[Itzcoatl]] continued to defy Maxtla; he blockaded Tenochtitlan and demanded increased tribute payments.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p47"&gt;Smith 2009 p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Maxtla similarly turned against the [[Acolhua]], and the king of Texcoco, [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], fled into exile. Nezahualcoyotl recruited military help from the king of Huexotzinco, and the Mexica gained the support of a dissident Tepanec city, [[Tlacopan]]. In 1427, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan, and Huexotzinco went to war against Azcapotzalco, emerging victorious in 1428.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p47"/&gt;

After the war, Huexotzinco withdrew, and in 1430 &lt;ref name="arqueologiamexicana.mx"/&gt;, the three remaining cities formed a treaty known today as the Triple Alliance.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p47"/&gt; The Tepanec lands were carved up among the three cities, whose leaders agreed to cooperate in future wars of conquest. Land acquired from these conquests was to be held by the three cities together. Tribute was to be divided so that two-fifths each went to Tenochtitlan and Texcoco, and one-fifth went to Tlacopan. Each of the three kings of the alliance in turn assumed the title "huetlatoani" ("Elder Speaker", often translated as "Emperor"). In this role, each temporarily held a ''[[de jure]]'' position above the rulers of other city-states ("tlatoani").&lt;ref name="Evans2008p460"&gt;Evans 2008, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next 100 years, the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan came to dominate the Valley of Mexico and extend its power to the shores of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]]. Tenochtitlan gradually became the dominant power in the alliance. Two of the primary architects of this alliance were the half-brothers [[Tlacaelel]] and [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]], nephews of Itzcoatl. Moctezuma eventually succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica ''huetlatoani'' in 1440. Tlacaelel occupied the newly created title of "[[Cihuacoatl (position)|Cihuacoatl]]", equivalent to something between "Prime Minister" and "Viceroy".&lt;ref name="Smith2009p47"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term ''cihuācōātl'' literally means "woman-snake" or "female snake", and the origin of this designation is not well understood. The position was certainly not reserved for women, although the title may perhaps suggest a metaphoric dichotomy between the "masculine" ''Tlahtoāni'' dealing with external imperial affairs and the "feminine" ''Cihuācōātl'' managing the domestic affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial reforms===
[[File:Jaguar warrior.jpg|thumb|[[Jaguar Warrior]], from the [[Codex Magliabechiano]].]]

Shortly after the formation of the Triple Alliance, Itzcoatl and Tlacopan instigated sweeping reforms on the Aztec state and [[Aztec religion|religion]]. It has been alleged that Tlacaelel ordered the burning of some or most of the extant Aztec books, claiming that they contained lies and that it was "not wise that all the people should know the paintings".&lt;ref name="Leon-Portilla1963p155"&gt;Leon-Portilla 1963 p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Even if he did order such book-burnings, it was probably limited primarily to documents containing political propaganda from previous regimes; he thereafter rewrote the history of the Aztecs, naturally placing the Mexica in a more central role.

After [[Moctezuma I]] succeeded Itzcoatl as the Mexica emperor, more reforms were instigated to maintain control over conquered cities.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p48"&gt;Smith 2009 p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Uncooperative kings were replaced with puppet rulers loyal to the Mexica. A new imperial tribute system established Mexica tribute collectors that taxed the population directly, bypassing the authority of local dynasties. Nezahualcoyotl also instituted a policy in the Acolhua lands of granting subject kings tributary holdings in lands far from their capitals.&lt;ref name="Evans2008p462"&gt;Evans 2008 p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to create an incentive for cooperation with the empire; if a city's king rebelled, he lost the tribute he received from foreign land. Some rebellious kings were replaced by ''calpixqueh'', or appointed governors rather than dynastic rulers.&lt;ref name="Evans2008p462"/&gt;

Moctezuma issued new laws that further separated nobles from commoners and instituted the death penalty for adultery and other offenses.&lt;ref name="Duran1994p209-210"&gt;Duran 1994, pp. 209–210&lt;/ref&gt; By royal decree, a religiously supervised school was built in every neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Duran1994p209-210"/&gt; Commoner neighborhoods had a school called a "telpochcalli" where they received basic religious instruction and military training.&lt;ref name="Evans2008p456-457"&gt;Evans 2008 pp. 456–457&lt;/ref&gt; A second, more prestigious type of school called a "calmecac" served to teach the nobility, as well as commoners of high standing seeking to become priests or artisans. Moctezuma also created a new title called "quauhpilli" that could be conferred on commoners.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p48"/&gt; This title was a form of non-hereditary lesser nobility awarded for outstanding military or civil service (similar to the English [[knight]]). In some rare cases, commoners that received this title married into royal families and became kings.&lt;ref name="Evans2008p462"/&gt;

One component of this reform was the creation of an institution of regulated warfare called the [[flower war|Flower Wars]]. Mesoamerican warfare overall is characterized by a strong preference for capturing live prisoners as opposed to slaughtering the enemy on the battlefield, which was considered sloppy and gratuitous. The Flower Wars are a potent manifestation of this approach to warfare. These highly ritualized wars ensured a steady, healthy supply of experienced Aztec warriors as well as a steady, healthy supply of captured enemy warriors for [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifice]] to the gods. Flower wars were pre-arranged by officials on both sides and conducted specifically for the purpose of each polity collecting prisoners for sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Evans2008p451"&gt;Evans 2008, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; According to native historical accounts, these wars were instigated by Tlacaelel as a means of appeasing the gods in response to a massive drought that gripped the Basin of Mexico from 1450 to 1454.&lt;ref name="Duran1994"&gt;Duran 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The flower wars were mostly waged between the Aztec Empire and the neighboring cities of their arch-enemy [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].

===Early years of expansion===
[[File:Aztecexpansion.png|thumb|450px|Map of the expansion of the empire, showing the areas conquered by the Aztec rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Hassig 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After the defeat of the Tepanecs, Itzcoatl and Nezahualcoyotl rapidly consolidated power in the Basin of Mexico and began to expand beyond its borders. The first targets for imperial expansion were Coyoacan in the Basin of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac and Huaxtepec in the modern Mexican state of [[Morelos]].&lt;ref name="Smith2009p47-48"&gt;Smith 2009 pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; These conquests provided the new empire with a large influx of tribute, especially agricultural goods.

On the death of Itzcoatl, Moctezuma I was enthroned as the new Mexica emperor. The expansion of the empire was briefly halted by a major four-year drought that hit the Basin of Mexico in 1450, and several cities in Morelos had to be re-conquered after the drought subsided.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2009 p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Moctezuma and Nezahualcoyotl continued to expand the empire east towards the Gulf of Mexico and south into [[Oaxaca]]. In 1468, Moctezuma I died and was succeeded by his son, [[Axayacatl]]. Most of Axayacatl's thirteen-year-reign was spent consolidating the territory acquired under his predecessor. Motecuzoma and Nezahualcoyotl had expanded rapidly and many provinces rebelled.&lt;ref name="Davies1973"/&gt;

At the same time as the Aztec Empire was expanding and consolidating power, the [[Purépecha Empire]] in West Mexico was similarly expanding. In 1455, the Purépecha under their king Tzitzipandaquare had invaded the Toluca Valley, claiming lands previously conquered by Motecuzoma and Itzcoatl.&lt;ref name="Pollard1993p169"&gt;Pollard 1993, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; In 1472, Axayacatl re-conquered the region and successfully defended it from Purépecha attempts to take it back. In 1479, Axayacatl launched a major invasion of the Purépecha Empire with 32,000 Aztec soldiers.&lt;ref name="Pollard1993p169"/&gt; The Purépecha met them just across the border with 50,000 soldiers and scored a resounding victory, killing or capturing over 90% of the Aztec army. Axayacatl himself was wounded in the battle, retreated to Tenochtitlan, and never engaged the Purépecha in battle again.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p51"&gt;Smith 2009 p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1472, Nezahualcoyotl died and his son [[Nezahualpilli]] was enthroned as the new huetlatoani of Texcoco.&lt;ref name="Evans2008p450"&gt;Evans 2008, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the death of Axayacatl in 1481.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p51"/&gt; Axayacatl was replaced by his brother [[Tizoc]]. Tizoc's reign was notoriously brief. He proved to be ineffectual and did not significantly expand the empire. Apparently due to his incompetence, Tizoc was likely assassinated by his own nobles five years into his rule.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p51"/&gt;

===Later years of expansion===
[[File:Aztec Empire 1519 map-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The maximal extent of the Aztec Empire, according to María del Carmen Solanes Carraro and Enrique Vela Ramírez.]]

Tizoc was succeeded by his brother [[Ahuitzotl]] in 1486. Like his predecessors, the first part of Ahuitzotl's reign was spent suppressing rebellions that were commonplace due to the indirect nature of Aztec rule.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p51"/&gt; Ahuitzotl then began a new wave of conquests including the [[Oaxaca Valley]] and the [[Soconusco|Soconusco Coast]]. Due to increased border skirmishes with the Purépechas, Ahuitzotl conquered the border city of Otzoma and turned the city into a military outpost.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p54"&gt;Smith 2009 p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Otzoma was either killed or dispersed in the process.&lt;ref name="Pollard1993p169"/&gt; The Purépecha subsequently established fortresses nearby to protect against Aztec expansion.&lt;ref name="Pollard1993p169"/&gt; Ahuitzotl responded by expanding further west to the Pacific Coast of [[Guerrero]].

By the reign of Ahuitzotl, the Mexica were the largest and most powerful faction in the Aztec Triple Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2009 pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the prestige the Mexica had acquired over the course of the conquests, Ahuitzotl began to use the title "huehuetlatoani" ("Eldest Speaker") to distinguish himself from the rulers of Texcoco and Tlacopan.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p51"/&gt; Even though the alliance still technically ran the empire, the Mexica Emperor now assumed nominal if not actual seniority.

Ahuitzotl was succeeded by his nephew [[Moctezuma II|Motecuzoma II]] in 1502. Motecuzoma II spent most of his reign consolidating power in lands conquered by his predecessors.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p54"/&gt; In 1515, Aztec armies commanded by the Tlaxcalan general Tlahuicole invaded the Purépecha Empire once again.&lt;ref name="Pollard1993p169-170"&gt;Pollard 1993 pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt; The Aztec army failed to take any territory and was mostly restricted to raiding. The Purépechas defeated them and the army withdrew.

Motecuzoma II instituted more imperial reforms.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p54"/&gt; After the death of Nezahualcoyotl, the Mexica Emperors had become the ''de facto'' rulers of the alliance. Motecuzoma II used his reign to attempt to consolidate power more closely with the Mexica Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Davies 1973 p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; He removed many of Ahuitzotl's advisors and had several of them executed.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p54"/&gt; He also abolished the "quauhpilli" class, destroying the chance for commoners to advance to the nobility. His reform efforts were cut short by the Spanish Conquest in 1519.

===Spanish conquest===
{{Main article|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}

Spanish expedition leader [[Hernán Cortés]] landed in Yucatán in 1519 with approximately 630 men (most armed with only a sword and shield). Cortés had actually been removed as the expedition's commander by the governor of Cuba, [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar|Diego Velásquez]], but had stolen the boats and left without permission.&lt;ref name="DiazdelCastillo2003pp35-40"&gt;Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 35–40&lt;/ref&gt; At the island of Cozumel, Cortés encountered a shipwrecked Spaniard named [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]] who joined the expedition and translated between Spanish and Mayan. The expedition then sailed west to Campeche, where after a brief battle with the local army, Cortés was able to negotiate peace through his interpreter, Aguilar. The King of Campeche gave Cortés a second translator, a bilingual Nahua-Maya slave woman named [[La Malinche]] (she was known also as Malinalli [maliˈnalːi], Malintzin [maˈlintsin] or Doña Marina [ˈdoɲa maˈɾina] ). Aguilar translated from Spanish to Mayan and La Malinche translated from Mayan to Nahuatl. Once Malinche learned Spanish, she became Cortés's translator for both language and culture, and was a key figure in interactions with [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] rulers. An important article, "Rethinking Malinche" by [[Frances Karttunen]] examines her role in the conquest and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Karttunen, "Rethinking Malinche" in ''Indian Women of Early Mexico,'' Susan Schroeder, et al. eds. University of Oklahoma Press 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortés then sailed from Campeche to [[Cempoala]], a tributary province of the Aztec Triple Alliance. Nearby, he founded the town of [[Veracruz]] where he met with ambassadors from the reigning Mexica emperor, [[Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin|Motecuzoma II]]. When the ambassadors returned to Tenochtitlan, Cortés went to Cempoala to meet with the local [[Totonac]] leaders. After the Totonac ruler told Cortés of his various grievances against the Mexica, Cortés convinced the Totonacs to imprison an imperial tribute collector.&lt;ref name="DiazdelCastillo2003pp92-94"&gt;Diaz del Castillo 2003, pp. 92–94&lt;/ref&gt; Cortés subsequently released the tribute collector after persuading him that the move was entirely the Totonac's idea and that he had no knowledge of it. Having effectively declared war on the Aztecs, the Totonacs provided Cortés with 20 companies of soldiers for his march to Tlaxcala.&lt;ref name="DiazdelCastillo2003p120"&gt;Diaz del Castillo 2003, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; At this time several of Cortés's soldiers attempted to mutiny. When Cortés discovered the plot, he had his ships scuttled and sank them in the harbor to remove any possibility of escaping to Cuba.&lt;ref name="Cortés"&gt;Hernán Cortés, 1843.

The Spanish-led Totonac army crossed into [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] to seek the latter's alliance against the Aztecs. However, the Tlaxcalan general [[Xicotencatl the Younger]] believed them to be hostile, and attacked. After fighting several close battles, Cortés eventually convinced the leaders of Tlaxcala to order their general to stand down. Cortés then secured an alliance with the people of Tlaxcala, and traveled from there to the Basin of Mexico with a smaller company of 5,000-6,000 Tlaxcalans and 400 Totonacs, in addition to the Spanish soldiers.&lt;ref name="Cortés" /&gt; During his stay in the city of Cholula, Cortés claims he received word of a planned ambush against the Spanish.&lt;ref name="Cortés" /&gt; In a pre-emptive response, Cortés directed his troops attack and kill a large number of unarmed Cholulans gathered in the main square of the city.

Following the massacre at Cholula, Hernan Cortés and the other Spaniards entered Tenochtitlan, where they were greeted as guests and given quarters in the palace of former emperor Axayacatl.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p275"&gt;Smith 2009 p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; After staying in the city for six weeks, two Spaniards from the group left behind in Veracruz were killed in an altercation with an Aztec lord named Quetzalpopoca. Cortés claims that he used this incident as an excuse to take Motecuzoma prisoner under threat of force.&lt;ref name="Cortés" /&gt; For several months, Motecuzoma continued to run the kingdom as a prisoner of Hernan Cortés. Then, in 1520, a second, larger Spanish expedition arrived under the command of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]] sent by Diego Velásquez with the goal of arresting Cortés for treason. Before confronting Narváez, Cortés secretly persuaded Narváez's lieutenants to betray him and join Cortés.&lt;ref name="Cortés" /&gt;

While Cortés was away from Tenochtitlan dealing with Narváez, his second in command [[Pedro de Alvarado]] massacred a group of Aztec nobility in response to a ritual of human sacrifice honoring [[Huitzilopochtli]].&lt;ref name="Cortés" /&gt; The Aztecs retaliated by attacking the palace where the Spanish were quartered. Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan and fought his way to the palace. He then took Motecuzoma up to the roof of the palace to ask his subjects to stand down. However, by this point the ruling council of Tenochtitlan had voted to depose Motecuzoma and had elected his brother [[Cuitlahuac]] as the new emperor.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p275" /&gt; One of the Aztec soldiers struck Motecuzoma in the head with a sling stone, and he died several days later – although the exact details of his death, particularly who was responsible, are unclear.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p275" /&gt;

The Spaniards and their allies, realizing they were vulnerable to the hostile Mexica in Tenochtitlan following Moctezuma's death, attempted to retreat without detection in what is known as the "Sad Night" or [[La Noche Triste]]. Spaniards and their Indian allies were discovered clandestinely retreating, and then were forced to fight their way out of the city, with heavy loss of life. Some Spaniards lost their lives by drowning, loaded down with gold.&lt;ref&gt;''The Early History of Greater Mexico'', chapter 3 "Conquest and Colonization", Ida Altman, S.L. (Sarah) Cline, and Javier Pescador. Pearson, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; They retreated to [[Tlacopan]] (now Tacuba) and made their way to [[Tlaxcala]], where they recovered and prepared for the second, successful assault on Tenochtitlan. After this incident, a [[smallpox]] [[outbreak]] hit Tenochtitlan. As the indigenous of the New World had no previous exposure to smallpox, this outbreak alone killed more than 50% of the region's population, including the emperor, Cuitlahuac.&lt;ref name="Smith2009p279"&gt;Smith 2009, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; While the new emperor [[Cuauhtémoc]] dealt with the smallpox outbreak, Cortés raised an army of Tlaxcalans, Texcocans, Totonacs, and others discontent with Aztec rule. With a combined army of up to 100,000 warriors,&lt;ref name="Cortés" /&gt; the overwhelming majority of which were indigenous rather than Spanish, Cortés marched back into the Basin of Mexico. Through numerous subsequent battles and skirmishes, he captured the various indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]] around the lake shore and surrounding mountains, including the other capitals of the Triple Alliance, Tlacopan and [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. Texcoco in fact had already become firm allies of the Spaniards and the city-state, and subsequently petitioned the Spanish crown for recognition of their services in the conquest, just as Tlaxcala had done.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, ''Ally of Cortés: Account 13 of the Coming of the Spaniards and the Beginning of Evangelical Law.'' Douglass K. Ballentine, translator. El Paso: Texas Western Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using boats constructed in Texcoco from parts salvaged from the scuttled ships, Cortés blockaded and laid siege to Tenochtitlan for a period of several months.&lt;ref name="Cortés" /&gt; Eventually, the Spanish-led army assaulted the city both by boat and using the elevated causeways connecting it to the mainland. Although the attackers took heavy casualties, the Aztecs were ultimately defeated. The city of Tenochtitlan was thoroughly destroyed in the process. Cuauhtémoc was captured as he attempted to flee the city. Cortés kept him prisoner and tortured him for a period of several years before finally executing him in 1525.&lt;ref name="Restall2004p148"&gt;Restall, Matthew (2004).

==Government==
The Aztec Empire was an example of an [[empire]] that ruled by indirect means.
Like most European empires, it was [[Ethnic group|ethnically]] very diverse, but unlike most European empires, it was more a system of tributes than a single unitary form of government. In the theoretical framework of imperial systems posited by American historian [[Alexander J. Motyl]] the Aztec empire was an informal type of empire in that the Alliance did not claim supreme authority over its tributary provinces; it merely expected tributes to be paid.&lt;ref name="motyl"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The empire was also territorially discontinuous, i.e. not all of its dominated territories were connected by land. For example, the southern peripheral zones of [[Soconusco|Xoconochco]] were not in immediate contact with the central part of the empire. The [[hegemonic]] nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs as long as the tribute payments were made.&lt;ref&gt;Berdan, ''et al.'' (1996), Aztec Imperial Strategies. Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the form of government is often referred to as an empire, in fact most areas within the empire were organized as city-states (individually known as ''[[altepetl]]'' in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Aztecs). These were small polities ruled by a king or ''tlatoani'' (literally "speaker", plural ''tlatoque'') from an aristocratic dynasty. The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepeme. Even after the empire was formed in 1428 and began its program of expansion through conquest, the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level. The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire's hegemonic form of control.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E. (2000), Aztec City-States. In A Comparative Study of Thirty City-State Cultures, edited by [[Mogens Herman Hansen]], pp. 581–595. The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be remembered that the term "Aztec empire" is a modern one, not one used by the Aztec themselves. The Aztec realm was at its core composed of three [[Nahuatl]]-speaking city states in the densely populated Valley of Mexico. Over time, asymmetries of power elevated one of those city states, Tenochtitlan, above the other two. The "Triple Alliance" came to establish [[hegemony]] over much of central Mesoamerica, including areas of great linguistic and cultural diversity. Administration of the empire was performed through largely traditional, indirect means. However, over time something of a nascent [[bureaucracy]] may have been beginning to form insofar as the state organization became increasingly centralized.

===Central administration===
[[Image:Tlacochcalcatl.jpg|thumb|180px|A ''[[tlacochcalcatl]]'' pictured in the [[Codex Mendoza]]]]
Before the reign of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] (1429–1472), the Aztec empire operated as a confederation along traditional [[Mesoamerica]]n lines. Independent altepetl were led by tlatoani (lit., "speakers"), who supervised village headmen, who in turn supervised groups of households. A typical Mesoamerican confederation placed a ''[[Huey Tlatoani]]'' (lit., "great speaker") at the head of several tlatoani. Following Nezahualcoyotl, the Aztec empire followed a somewhat divergent path, with some tlatoani of recently conquered or otherwise subordinated altepetl becoming replaced with ''calpixque'' stewards charged with collecting tribute on behalf of the Huetlatoani rather than simply replacing an old tlatoque with new ones from the same set of local nobility.&lt;ref&gt;
Evans, Susan T. (2004). Ancient Mexico &amp; Central America: Archaeology and Culture History. Thames &amp; Hudson: New York, pp. 443–446, 449–451&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the Huey tlatoani was not the sole executive. It was the responsibility of the Huey tlatoani to deal with the ''external'' issues of empire; the management of tribute, war, diplomacy, and expansion were all under the purview of the Huey tlatoani. It was the role of the ''[[Cihuacoatl]]'' to govern the city of Tenochtitlan itself. The Cihuacoatl was always a close relative of the Huey tlatoani; [[Tlacaelel]], for example, was the brother of Moctezuma I. Both the title "Cihuacoatl", which means "female snake" (it is the name of a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] deity), and the role of the position, somewhat analogous to a European [[Viceroy]] or [[Prime Minister]], reflect the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature of Nahua [[cosmology]]. Neither the position of Cihuacoatl nor the position of Huetlatoani were priestly, yet both did have important ritual tasks. Those of the former were associated with the "female" wet season, those of the latter with the "male" dry season. While the position of Cihuacoatl is best attested in Tenochtitlan, it is known that the position also existed the nearby altepetl of [[Atzcapotzalco]], [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacan]], and Tenochtitlan's ally [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. Despite the apparent lesser status of the position, a Cihuacoatl could prove both influential and powerful, as in the case of Tlacaelel.&lt;ref&gt;

Townshend, Richard F. (2000). The Aztecs. Revised Ed. Thames &amp; Hudson: London, pp. 200–202.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the history of the empire, Tenochtitlan developed a four-member military and advisory Council which assisted the Huey tlatoani in his decision-making: the ''tlacochcalcatl''; the ''tlaccatecatl''; the ''ezhuahuacatl'';&lt;ref name="BerdanAnawalt1992p196"&gt;
Berdan, Francis F. and Patricia Rieff Anawalt. 1992. The Codex Mendoza Vol. 1. University of California Press, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''tlillancalqui''. This design not only provided advise for the ruler, it also served to contain ambition on the part of the nobility, as henceforth [[Huey Tlatoani]] could only be selected from the Council. Moreover, the actions of any one member of the Council could easily be blocked by the other three, providing a simple system of checks on the ambition higher officials. These four Council members were also generals, members of various military societies. The ranks of the members were not equal, with the tlacochcalcatl and tlaccatecatl having a higher status than the others. These two Councillors were members of the two most prestigious military societies, the ''cuauhchique'' ("shorn ones") and the ''otontin'' ("[[Otomi (military)|Otomies]]").&lt;ref&gt;Brumfiel, Elizabeth M. (1983). Aztec State Making: Ecology, Structure, and the Origin of the State. American Anthropologist, New Series (85)2, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townshend, Richard F. (2000). The Aztecs. Revised Ed. Thames &amp; Hudson: London, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provincial administration===
Traditionally, provinces and altepetl were governed by hereditary tlatoani. As the empire grew, the system evolved further and some tlatoani were replaced by other officials.The other officials had similar authority to tlatoani. As has already been mentioned, directly appointed stewards (singular ''calpixqui'', plural ''calpixque'') were sometimes imposed on altepetl instead of the selection of provincial nobility to the same position of tlatoani. At the height of empire, the organization of the state into tributary and strategic provinces saw an elaboration of this system. The 38 tributary provinces fell under the supervision of high stewards, or ''huecalpixque'', whose authority extended over the lower-ranking calpixque. These calpixque and huecalpixque were essentially managers of the provincial tribute system which was overseen and coordinated in the paramount capital of Tenochtitlan not by the ''huetlatoani'', but rather by a separate position altogether: the ''petlacalcatl''. On the occasion that a recently conquered altepetl was seen as particularly restive, a military governor, or ''cuauhtlatoani'', was placed at the head of provincial supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Calnek, Edward E. (1982). Patterns of Empire Formation in the Valley of Mexico, in The Inca and Aztec States: 1400–1800. Collier, Rosaldo &amp; Wirth (Eds.) Academic Press: New York, pp. 56–59&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of Moctezuma I, the calpixque system was elaborated, with two calpixque assigned per tributary province. One was stationed in the province itself, perhaps for supervising the collection of tribute, and the other in Tenochtitlan, perhaps for supervising storage of tribute. Tribute was drawn from commoners, the ''macehualtin'', and distributed to the nobility, be they 'kings' (''tlatoque''), lesser rulers (''teteuctin''), or provincial nobility (''pipiltin'').&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael E. (1986). Social Stratification in the Aztec Empire: A View from the Provinces, in American Anthropologist,
(88)1, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribute collection was supervised by the above officials and relied upon the coercive power of the Aztec military, but also upon the cooperation of the ''pipiltin'' (the local nobility who were themselves exempt from and recipient to tribute) and the hereditary class of merchants known as ''pochteca''. These pochteca had various gradations of ranks which granted them certain trading rights and so were not necessarily pipiltin themselves, yet they played an important role in both the growth and administration of the Aztec tributary system nonetheless. The power, political and economic, of the pochteca was strongly tied to the political and military power of the Aztec nobility and state. In addition to serving as diplomats (''teucnenenque'', or "travelers of the lord") and spies in the prelude to conquest, higher-ranking pochteca also served as judges in market plazas and were to certain degree autonomous [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]], having administrative duties within their own [[Estates of the Realm|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Donald V. (1984). Strategies of Legitimation and the Aztec State, in Ethnology, 23(4), pp. 308–309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Almazán, Marco A. (1999).

===Provincial structure===
[[File:Territorial Organization of the Aztec Empire 1519.png|thumb|Territorial Organization of the Aztec Empire 1519]]
Originally, the Aztec empire was loose alliance between three cities: [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], and the most junior partner, [[Tlacopan]]. As such, they were known as the 'Triple Alliance.' This political form was very common in Mesoamerica, where alliances of city-states were ever fluctuating. However, over time, it was Tenochtitlan which assumed paramount authority in the alliance, and although each partner city shared spoils of war and rights to regular tribute from the provinces and were governed by their own Huetlatoani, it was Tenochtitlan which became the largest, most powerful, and most influential of the three cities. It was the de facto and acknowledged center of empire.&lt;ref&gt;Brumfiel, Elizabeth M. (2001). Religion and state in the Aztec Empire, in Empires (Alcock et al, Eds). Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they were not described by the Aztec this way, there were essentially two types of provinces: Tributary and Strategic. Strategic provinces were essentially subordinate [[client states]] which provided tribute or aid to the Aztec state under "mutual consent". Tributary provinces, on the other hand, provided regular tribute to the empire; obligations on the part of Tributary provinces were mandatory rather than consensual.&lt;ref name=Evans470-471&gt;Evans, pp. 470–471&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith1-2&gt;Smith, Michael E. (1996). The Strategic Provinces, in Aztec Imperial Strategies. Dumbarton Oaks: Washington, D.C., pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and state==
{{See also|Aztec religion}}
[[File:Tovar Codex (folio 134).png|thumb|270px|This page from the [[Codex Tovar]] depicts a scene of [[Xipe Totec#Human sacrifice|gladiatorial sacrificial]] rite, celebrated on the festival of ''Tlacaxipehualiztli''.]]
Rulers, be they local teteuctin or tlatoani, or central Huetlatoani, were seen as representatives of the gods and therefore ruled by [[divine right of kings|divine right]]. ''Tlatocayotl'', or the principle of rulership, established that this divine right was inherited by descent. Political order was therefore also a cosmic order, and to kill a tlatoani was to transgress that order. For that reason, whenever a tlatoani was killed or otherwise removed from their station, a relative and member of the same bloodline was typically placed in their stead. The establishment of the office of Huetlatoani understood through the creation of another level of rulership, ''hueitlatocayotl'', standing in superior contrast to the lesser ''tlatocayotl'' principle.&lt;ref&gt;Almazán, pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of the empire was guided by a [[militaristic]] interpretation of Nahua religion, specifically a devout veneration of the sun god, [[Huitzilopochtli]]. Militaristic state rituals were performed throughout the year according to a ceremonial calendar of events, rites, and mock battles.&lt;ref&gt;Brumfiel (2001), pp. 287, 288–301&lt;/ref&gt; The time period they lived in was understood as the ''Ollintonatiuh'', or Sun of Movement, which was believed to be the final age after which humanity would be destroyed. It was under Tlacaelel that Huitzilopochtli assumed his elevated role in the state pantheon and who argued that it was through blood sacrifice that the Sun would be maintained and thereby stave off the end of the world. It was under this new, militaristic interpretation of Huitzilopochtli that Aztec soldiers were encouraged to fight wars and capture enemy soldiers for sacrifice. Though blood sacrifice was common in Mesoamerica, the scale of [[human sacrifice]] under the Aztecs was likely unprecedented in the region.&lt;ref&gt;León-Portilla, Miguel. (1963). Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the ANcient Nahuatl Mind. Davis, Jack E., Trans. University of Oklahoma Press: Norman, pp. 6, 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
The most developed [[Code (law)|code of law]] was developed in the city-state of Texcoco under its ruler [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]. It was a formal written code, not merely a collection of customary practices. The sources for knowing about the legal code are colonial-era writings by Franciscan [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]], Franciscan [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]], and Texcocan historians [[Juan Bautista Pomar]], and [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl]]. The law code in Texcoco under Nezahualcoyotl was legalistic, that is cases were tried by particular types of evidence and the social status of the litigants was disregarded, and consisted of 80 written laws. These laws called for severe, publicly administered punishments, creating a legal framework of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, Jerome A. ''Law and Politics in Aztec Texcoco''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp.81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much less is known about the legal system in Tenochtitlan, which might be less "legalistic or sophisticated as those of Texcoco for this period.&lt;ref&gt;Offner, 1983, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to have been established under the reign of [[Moctezuma I]]. These laws served to establish and govern relations between the state, classes, and individuals. Punishment was to be meted out solely by state authorities. Nahua mores were enshrined in these laws, criminalizing public acts of homosexuality, drunkenness, and nudity, not to mention more universal proscriptions against theft, murder, and property damage. As stated before, ''pochteca'' could serve as judges, often exercising judicial oversight of their own members. Likewise, [[Court-martial|military courts]] dealt with both cases within the military and without during wartime. There was an [[appeal]] process, with appellate courts standing between local, typically market-place courts, on the provincial level and a [[supreme court]] and two special higher appellate courts at Tenochtitlan. One of those two special courts dealt with cases arising within Tenochtitlan, the other with cases originating from outside the capital. The ultimate judicial authority laid in hands of the ''[[Huey tlatoani]]'', who had the right to appoint lesser judges.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="817">A '''bailleur''', a French term, is a land owner who outsourced uncultivated parcels of land as part of an early [[Middle Age]] sharecropping system known as ''complant'' &amp;mdash; a precursor to the [[métayage]] system. Under this system, a laborer known as a [[prendeur]] would agree to cultivate land owned by the ''bailleur'' in exchange for ownership of the crop and its production. For use of the ''bailleur's'' soil, the ''prendeur'' promised a share (normally a third to two-thirds) of the crop's production or its revenue to the ''bailleur''. The length of this partnership varied and sometimes would extend over generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Johnson, ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 116. Simon and Schuster 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5173">The '''Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute for Art History''' is a German research institute located in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. It was founded by a donation of [[Henriette Hertz]] in 1912 as a [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]]. Of the 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft), it is one of the few not located in Germany. The institute is situated in the historical centre of Rome near [[Trinità dei Monti]] in a cluster of four buildings along the Via Gregoriana: the 16th-century [[Palazzo Zuccari, Rome|Palazzo Zuccari]], the adjacent Palazzo Stroganoff, the Villino Stroganoff across the road and the new library building (completed in 2012) designed by the Spanish architect [[Juan Navarro Baldeweg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblhertz.it/en/institute/history-of-the-institute/#c1760 The Palazzo Zuccari and the new Library Building]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose/Activities ==
The Bibliotheca Hertziana was founded in 1913 in Rome as an institute of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Society for research on Italian art from the period immediately following antiquity, and in particular the Renaissance and the Baroque periods. These two epochs take centre stage in the research to date and soon will be joined by a third focus, the art of the Italian Middle Ages. The programme of the Hertziana focuses on the art of Rome as well as that of central and southern Italy, as they were the cradle of important developments that affected European art history as a whole. Last but not least, Roman art owes its status to Roman artists' permanent confrontation with ancient art in all its forms—an interaction that is unavoidable in Rome. The institute supports the following projects:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-kultur-international.de/en/org/organisations/bibliotheca-hertziana-max-planck-institut-fuer-kunstgeschichte.html Deutsche Kultur International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320031341/http://www.deutsche-kultur-international.de/en/org/organisations/bibliotheca-hertziana-max-planck-institut-fuer-kunstgeschichte.html |date=2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Regular workshops on current projects, monthly lectures, study courses for younger academics from the German-speaking countries as well as numerous symposia and congresses provide opportunities for academic exchange between the members of the institute and guests from outside. The Bibliotheca Hertziana's holdings of specialist literature as well as its collection of more than 800.000 photographs of historical assets, with its focus on the history of Italian art from the Middle Ages to modern times, are accessible online via the institute's online catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblhertz.it/cgi-bin/gucha_en.pl Online Catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990, the Bibliotheca Hertziana has awarded the [[Hanno and Ilse Hahn Prize]] every second year for outstanding merit in the field of Italian art and architectural history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpg.de/english/aboutTheSociety/aboutUs/scientificAwards/awardsOfMPS/hannoIlseHahnPrize/index.html Hanno and Ilse Hahn Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is named after the only son and daughter-in-law of the late president of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft [[Otto Hahn]], who were killed in an accident in France in 1960.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3454">'''Carl Walter Salser, Jr.''' (16 August 1921 &amp;ndash; 11 April 2006) was an [[United States|American]] author, businessperson and educator.

Salser was born in [[Emporia, Kansas]]. He grew up in [[Corvallis, Oregon]] after his father left Kansas State Teacher's College (now [[Emporia State University]]) to become Dean of Education at Oregon State College (now [[Oregon State University]] (OSU)). He graduated from [[Corvallis High School (Oregon)|Corvallis High School]] and enrolled at Oregon State College.

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] he served as a [[United States Navy|Navy]] Corpsman, stationed at the Naval Hospital in [[Corona, California]] before being ordered to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] for the assault on [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]]. Following the war he joined the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]], from which he retired as a [[lieutenant commander]].

After the war, he graduated from Oregon State, where he also met his future wife, Barbara Anderson (1926-2000), of [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]]. They opened a men's clothing store and a restaurant that also served the training table for the OSU college football team, before joining [[McGraw-Hill]] Publishing and moving to [[Portland, Oregon]]. He received his master's degree from OSU in 1956. Also in the mid-1950s he became editor-in-chief for Allied Publishers of Portland, and in 1960 took over a college of business (then Pacific Business College, now known as Capstone English Mastery Center) before forming the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Educational Research Associates in 1965.

The author or editor of more than 100 instructional titles, Salser authored two books on educational policy, ''A Tyrant in Cap and Gown'', and ''Public Education from A to Z''. He co-authored numerous titles in the use of the alphabetic shorthand system known as [[Personal Shorthand]].  Beginning in 1965 he led the development of the [[Individualized instruction]] system of school and classroom management.

He was appointed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] to the [[National Council on Educational Research]] (NCER) on 28 May 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1982/52882c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmed by the [[United States Senate]], he served two terms on the Council until its purpose was changed and it became the [[National Advisory Council on Educational Research and Improvement]].

He spent almost his entire life in Oregon. A lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he was manager for U.S. Senator [[Mark Hatfield]]'s successful 1956 campaign for [[Oregon Secretary of State]]. He twice campaigned for a position in the [[Oregon House of Representatives]], losing once in the primary and once in the general election.

He suffered a stroke in September 1991 and thereafter used a wheelchair. He died 11 April 2006. He was survived by three children, Mark Salser, Lori Fraser, and Linda Salser, and three grandchildren, Andrew Fraser, Alanna Fraser, and Matthew Salser.

'''Carronade Island''' lies off the northern ([[Kimberley (WA)|Kimberley]]) coast of [[Western Australia]] ({{coord|13|56|42|S|126|36|09|E|display=inline,title}}). The small island in Napier Broome Bay owes its name to two [[swivel guns]] found there in 1916, mistakenly described as [[carronades]] at the time.

In July 1916, the Royal Australian Navy cruiser {{HMAS|Encounter|1902|6}} entered Napier Broome Bay on Australia’s north west coast. On a small island in the bay, a party from the ship found two bronze cannons, protruding from the ground and placed about six feet apart.&lt;ref name="Island"&gt; Green, Jeremy, N: ''The Carronade Island Guns and South East Asian Gun Founding.''[Fremantle, W.A.]: Dept. of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Maritime Museum,[2007]. Report No.215 {{cite web |url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/No.%20215%20Carronade%20Is%20Gun_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012040/http://museum.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/No.%20215%20Carronade%20Is%20Gun_1.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The two bronze guns, of different bore and design but both about one metre in length, were removed to [[Garden Island, New South Wales|Garden Island Naval dockyard]].&lt;ref&gt; Photos of the guns on display in the 1930s at Garden Island can be seen in the National Library of Australia E.W.Searle Photo collection [http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.pic-vn4655122] The more ornate of the guns is now on display at the Fremantle Maritime Museum, part of Western Australian Museum. The gun carriages are a 20th century addition.&lt;/ref&gt; They were initially interpreted as "part of the armament of a Spanish or Portuguese caravel,"&lt;ref&gt; Captain Robins, RAN, 1917, correspondence cited in Fitzgerald, L (1984) ''Java La Grande.'' The Publishers, Hobart. p.118 {{ISBN|0 949325 007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a conclusion also made by writer Kenneth McIntyre in 1977. McIntyre cited the guns as evidence to advance his [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]] and described the cannons as "the most tangible extant link with the first European discovery of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, K.(1977) ''The Secret Discovery of Australia: Portuguese ventures 200 years before Captain Cook.'' P 81-83. Souvenir Press, Medindie, South Australia. {{ISBN|0 285 62303 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed report by Jeremy Green of the Western Australian Museum has identified both of the guns as swivel guns. Using metallurgical examination, including X-ray and chemical analysis, the guns have been identified as of late 18th century South East Asian origin and likely to have arrived through [[Makassan contact with Australia]]. The claim that the more decorated gun displays a Portuguese "rose and crown" is incorrect.&lt;ref name="Island"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, Jeremy N.

'''Charles Marie Adolphe Louis Bayet''' (25 May 1849, [[Liège]] &amp;ndash; 16 September 1918, [[Toulon]]) was a French historian, who was a specialist in [[Byzantine art]].

== Biography ==
From 1868 he studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]], then enlisted for military service during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In late September 1871 he obtained French citizenship. After spending time studying in [[Rome]], he became a member of the [[French School at Athens]] (1873). During the following year, with [[Louis Duchesne]], he participated in a research expedition to [[Mount Athos]].&lt;ref name=IH&gt;[http://irhis.recherche.univ-lille3.fr/00-SiteUniversite/htdocs/bayet.html Bayet, Charles] IRHiS&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1881 to 1890 he was a professor of history and antiquities of the [[Middle Ages]] at the Faculty of Letters in [[University of Lyon|Lyon]].

'''Costa Chekrezi''' (31 March 1892 – 10 January 1959), also known as '''Constantin Anastas Chekrezi''' ({{lang-sq|Kostandin Çekrezi}}) was an [[Albanian people|Albanian]] patriot, historian, and publicist.

==Biography==
Chekrezi was born on 31 March 1892 in [[Ziçisht]] village, in the Upper [[Devoll District|Devoll]] region located near [[Korça]] (back then [[Ottoman Empire]], now [[Albania]]).&lt;ref name="Naqo"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gazetakritika.net/Forumi/index.php?itemid=4502|author=Thani Naqo|title=Nga jeta dhe veprimtaria e patriotit Kostandin Çekrezi|accessdate=2013-09-30|language=Albanian|trans-title=Regarding life and activity of the patriot Kosta Chekrezi|date=2012-01-09|publisher=Gazeta Kritika}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After finishing a 5-year school in his native village, he finished the Greek high school in the town of [[Korça]] in June 12, 1910.  The school documents show he was awarded as "excellent student in all subjects", and earned a scholarship from the Ottoman government to attend (where he stayed for a year only till 1912) the law school in [[Thessaloniki]], now Greece. The studies were interrupted by the start of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{cite book| accessdate= 2013-09-30| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;q=costa+chekrezi#v=onepage&amp;q=chekrezi&amp;f=false|author=Robert Elsie|page=79|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|publisher=Scarecrow Press|edition=2|date=2010-03-19|isbn=978-0810861886}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] until 1914 Chekrezi lived in [[Vlorë]] where he worked as a secretary in the Civil Court of the town, later as an interpreter for the International Control Commission assigned near [[Ismail Qemali]]'s government and later [[Prince Wied]].&lt;ref name="RPress"&gt;{{cite news| language=Albanian| accessdate=2014-01-24| url=http://rajonipress.com/shfleto-artikujt.php?id=6158| publisher=Rajoni Press| title=Pas 93 vjetësh, botohet në shqip historia e parë e Shqipërisë e shkruar në gjuhën angleze|trans-title=After 93 years, the first history of Albania written in English get published|date=2012-12-30| author=Naim Zoto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[World War I]] started, Chekrezi emigrated to the US via Italy. Despite his young in age, only 23 years old, Costa Chekrezi became editor of the newspaper "[[Dielli|The Sun]]" ({{lang-sq|Dielli}}), in [[Boston]] and was [[chief editor]] of the newspaper from 1915 to 1919. He also published monthly magazine ''Illyria'', and gave a huge contribution to the [[Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America|Vatra]]'s monthly publication ''[[The Adriatic Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NOzRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=adriatic+review&amp;dq=adriatic+review&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TPBJUvfIKbTKyQG22IDoDg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6wEwAA |title=The Adriatic Review |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasized the atrocities over Albanians during [[World War I]]. Meanwhile, besides being a [[polyglot]], he studied economics, public administration and English language at [[Harvard University]]. He graduated at 17 June 1918, with a ''[[Bachelor of Arts]]'' degree.&lt;ref name="Naqo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Constantine has also translated into Albanian, a short history of Albania, written by [[Frederick Gibert]], which was published in Boston, and wrote a historical study named "Albania, past and present", published in 1919 in [[New York City]]&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/albaniapastprese00chek |title=Albania past and present (1919) |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated and published in Albania only in 2012 during the 100th anniversary of Declaration of Independence.

For a period of two years, he has been a professor of history at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="RPress"/&gt; According to Elsie he briefly returned to Albania in 1920 to participate in the [[Congress of Lushnje]].&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; In the years 1922-1932, has been the accredited representative of the Albanian Government (coming out of the Congress of Lushnje), with the title "Albanian Commissioner in Washington",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zicisht.weebly.com/personalitete---kosta-ccedilekrezi.html |title=Biography: Kostandin Anastas Çekrezi (in Albanian) |publisher=Zicisht.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; also a member of the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club in the U.S.]] In 1923, his English-Albanian dictionary came out.

After returning in Albania in 1925, he would come in sharp conflict with [[King Zog]], specifically to some concessions made in favor of the Italian-Albanian banks newly positioned as part of Zog's affiliation with Italy. Since the first meeting with [[Ahmet Zogu|Ahmet Zagolli]], he criticized Albanian political relations with [[Belgrade]] as well. In 1929, he served as member of the first [[Albanian Council of State|Council of State]] ({{lang-sq|Këshilli i Shtetit}}), established on April 11 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=Albanian|year=1937|publisher=Komisioni i Kremtimeve te 25-vjetorit te Vete-qeverrimit|title=Shqipenia me 1937|volume=I|page=79|url=http://omnilib.com/Topics/Collections/Albania/Books/Shqipenia-me-1937-Vellimi-I.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925091710/http://omnilib.com/Topics/Collections/Albania/Books/Shqipenia-me-1937-Vellimi-I.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following years will show him as an impressive publicist, editor of the newspapers ''Telegraf'' ("Telegraph")  and ''Ora'' ("Watch"), where he was pushed to publish some pro-monarchy articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMZaPjrHqYYC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=kosta+cekrezi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0y-jJheWTU&amp;sig=REbMpqRCOIJh2ilt4--4rZr3Th0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m-9JUonGM7CWyAGK9IGIBQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kosta%20cekrezi&amp;f=false|accessdate=2013-09-30|author=Bernd Jürgen Fischer|page=40|isbn=978-1557534552|publisher=Purdue University Press|date=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but immediately after the announcement of the monarchy, Costa Chekrezi was arrested by direct orders of  [[Koço Kota]] and sentenced to one year imprisonment. His newspapers, "Telegraf" and "Ora" were shut down forever.&lt;ref name="Naqo"/&gt;

After being an active leader and participant of the [[Revolt of Fier, 1935|Fier Revolt of 1935]],&lt;ref name="RPress"/&gt; he had to flee Albania towards Italy together with his friends Musa Kranja and Xhevahir Arapi on an Italian fishing boat. They reached [[Monopoli]] and were transferred to a prison in [[Bari]] for three month. There Chekrezi would write to [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] asking for his release. After three months they were released and gained the [[Right of asylum|right of Political Asylum]]. Meanwhile in Albania, he was sentenced to death in abstention. While trying to form the Organization of Albanian Emigrants ({{lang-sq| Organizata e Shqiptarëve në Emigracion}}), Chekrezi was arrested by the French government and surprisingly placed into the [[Camp Vernet|concentration camp of Vernet d' Ariege]] in France until 27 October 1941. It is not very clear why he was placed there and how he escaped from it. After that, he left for America.

It was 28 December 1941 when Chekrezi together with [[Tajar Zavalani]] formed in Boston "Free Albania" ({{lang-sq|Shqipëria e Lirë}}) organization trying to act like an Albanian Government in Exile, possibly with established connections with [[Office of Strategic Services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTZnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=tajar+zavalani&amp;dq=tajar+zavalani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rc-wVNqQBbDgsAS6jIGABw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADg8|title=Albania at War, 1939-1945|author= [[Bernd Jürgen Fischer]]| publisher=Purdue University Press|year= 1999| page=243 |isbn= 978-1557531414| series=Central European Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly to what Vatra somehow had functioned during the World War I.&lt;ref name= "Elsie2"&gt;{{citation| author=[[Robert Elsie]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA467&amp;dq=robert+elsie+vatra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F0XjUtqmGvLksASC2YHAAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20elsie%20vatra&amp;f=false| page=468| title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|publisher=Scarecrow Press|edition=2|date=2010-03-19|isbn=978-0810861886}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave up this organization in 1945.
&lt;br&gt;Costa Chekrezi has made efforts to maintain bridges between the Allies and Albania. In 1946, he was the one to receive a delegation headed by [[Tuk Jakova]] in [[New Yorker Hotel]], and the second meeting with [[Mihal Prifti]], where Costa suggested that the Albanian government should find the way to connect with the Western powers, especially USA, and abolish the "friendly" relations with [[Yugoslavia]] of [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], drawing parallels with [[King Zog]]-[[Nikola Pašić]] agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.panorama.com.al/2013/02/22/cekrezi-debati-ne-shba-me-te-derguarit-e-enverit/|accessdate=2013-09-30|publisher=Gazeta Panorama|language=Albanian|title=Çekrezi: Debati në SHBA me të dërguarit e Enverit|trans-title=Chekrezi: Debate in US with Enver's delegates|date=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1950, he hosted a meeting with Albanian representatives [[Behar Shtylla]] and [[Vilson Progri]] at the [[Governor Clinton Hotel]].

In 1951, he published the political analysis "The third plan for partitioning Albania" in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Plani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shtepiaelibrit.com/store/sq/historia-shqiptare/2964-plani-i-trete-per-copetimin-e-shqiperise-koste-cekrezi.html |title=The third plan for partitioning Albania |language=Albanian |publisher=Shtepiaelibrit.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantin Chekrezi, was overshadowed for half a century by the [[Communism in Albania|communist regime]]; he died near [[Boston]], on January 10, 1959, at the age of 66. At his funeral, [[Fan Noli]] would describe him as a "statesman, who had struggled all his life for his nation, and a great Albanian guy who had to die poor".&lt;ref name="Naqo"/&gt;

'''Einar Østvedt''' (30 November 1903 – 11 April 1980) was a Norwegian historian and educator.

Einar Østvedt was born in [[Skien]] in [[Telemark]], Norway. During 1927-1928, he was  resident student at the [[University of Besançon]].  He studied at the [[University of Oslo]], graduating with his [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1930 and [[dr.philos.]] in 1946.  He worked as a teacher in Skien from 1931 to 1971, except for a number of leaves.

He published the book ''Telemark i norsk malerkunst'' in 1942, with illustrations by [[Harald Kihle]]. In 1946 he published his diaries from imprisonment during the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]]. His thesis from 1946 was a treatment on [[Christian Magnus Falsen]].

He writes extensively on American political history, the history of freedom, the early [[History of the United States Republican Party|history of the Republican Party]], [[African American]] biography, [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], and [[historiography]], and has been a member of the faculty at the [[Columbia University]] Department of History since 1982. He is the author of several textbooks commonly used in college-level American history courses across the United States. 

Foner is a leading contemporary historian of the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period, having published ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'' in 1989 and more than 10 other books on the topic.&lt;ref name="reconstruction73"&gt;Perman, Michael.

In 2011, Foner's ''[[The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery]]'' (2010) won the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]], the [[Lincoln Prize]], and the [[Bancroft Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/house-divided/2011/02/prestigious_lincoln_prize_goes.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Prestigious Lincoln Prize goes to Eric Foner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newswire.ascribe.org/cgi-bin/behold.pl?ascribeid=20110210.071303&amp;time=02%2000%20PST&amp;year=2011&amp;public=0{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/historian-foner-among-3-winners-of-bancroft-prize-news-hollywood-ld2dkndehfi.html |title=Historian Foner among 3 winners of Bancroft Prize |publisher=Sify.com |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foner previously won the Bancroft in 1989 for his book ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877''. In 2000, he was elected president of the [[American Historical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historians.org/info/AHA_History/Efoner.htm|title=Eric Foner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/election-new-members-2018-spring-meeting&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Foner was born in [[New York City]], New York, the son of [[Jewish]] parents Liza (née Kraitz), a high school art teacher, and historian [[Jack D. Foner]], who was active in the [[trade union movement]] and the campaign for civil rights for [[African Americans]]. Eric Foner describes his father as his "first great teacher," and recalls how,

&lt;blockquote&gt;deprived of his livelihood while I was growing up, he supported our family as a freelance lecturer. ... Listening to his lectures, I came to appreciate how present concerns can be illuminated by the study of the past—how the repression of the [[McCarthy era]] recalled the days of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], the civil rights movement needed to be viewed in light of the great struggles of Black and White abolitionists, and in the brutal suppression of the [[Philippine insurrection]] at the turn of the century could be found the antecedents of [[Vietnam War|American intervention in Vietnam]]. I also imbibed a way of thinking about the past in which visionaries and underdogs—[[Tom Paine]], [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Eugene V. Debs]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]—were as central to the historical drama as presidents and captains of industry, and how a commitment to [[social justice]] could infuse one's attitudes towards the past.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Wiener, [https://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2000/0004/0004mem2.cfm "In Memoriam: Jack D. Foner." ''Perspectives'' (April 2000) – American Historical Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foner went to [[Columbia University]] for his B.A.; he was majoring in [[physics]] until he took a year-long seminar with James P. Shenton on the Civil War and Reconstruction during his junior year. "It probably determined that most of my career has been focused on that period," he recalled years later.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Watkin, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol22/vol22_iss3/Professor_Shenton.html "Professor James P. Shenton '49: History's Happy Warrior"], ''Columbia College Today'' 22:3 (Summer 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 1963, Foner graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' as a history major. He studied at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as a [[Kellett Fellowship|Kellett Fellow]]; he received a B.A. from [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] in 1965. Foner returned to Columbia for his Ph.D, where he worked under [[Richard Hofstadter]]; he finished in 1969.

==Career==
From 1973 to 1982, Foner served as a professor in the history department at [[City College of New York|City College]] and Graduate Center at [[City University of New York]]. In 1976 and 1977, he was a visiting professor of American History at [[Princeton University]]. In 1980, he was [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].

Appointed the [[DeWitt Clinton]] Professor of History at Columbia University in 1988, a chair previously held by his mentor [[Richard Hofstadter]], Foner specializes in 19th century [[American history]], the [[American Civil War]], [[slavery]], and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. He served as president of the [[Organization of American Historians]] in (1993–94), and of the [[American Historical Association]] (2000).
He is one of only two persons to serve as president of the Organization of American Historians, American Historical Association, and Society of American Historians.

===Writing on the Reconstruction Era===
Foner has long been considered a leading authority on the [[Reconstruction Era (United States)|Reconstruction Era]] of American history. In a seminal essay in ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' in October 1982, later reprinted in ''Reviews in American History'', Foner wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the past twenty years, no period of American history has been the subject of a more thoroughgoing reevaluation than Reconstruction—the violent, dramatic, and still controversial era following the Civil War. Race relations, politics, social life, and economic change during Reconstruction have all been reinterpreted in the light of changed attitudes toward the place of blacks within American society. If historians have not yet forged a fully satisfying portrait of Reconstruction as a whole, the traditional interpretation that dominated historical writing for much of this century has irrevocably been laid to rest.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Eric, "The New View Of Reconstruction," ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', October/November 1983, Volume 34, Issue 6.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

That year, he gave the [[Walter L. Fleming]] Lectures in southern history, which were later published as ''Nothing but Freedom: Emancipation and Its Legacy.''

In 1988, Foner published his definitive book ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877.''  It won the [[Bancroft Prize]], the [[Francis Parkman Prize]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Book Award, the [[Avery O. Craven]] Prize, and the [[Lionel Trilling]] Prize.

"Foner has established himself as the leading authority on the Reconstruction period," wrote historian Michael Perman in reviewing ''Reconstruction''.  "This book is not simply a distillation of the secondary literature; it is a masterly account – broad in scope as well as rich in detail and insight.&lt;ref name="reconstruction73" /&gt; "This is history written on a grand scale, a masterful treatment of one of the most complex periods of American history," [[David Herbert Donald]] wrote in ''[[The New Republic]]''. C. Vann Woodward, in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', wrote, "Eric Foner has put together this terrible story with greater cogency and power, I believe, than has been brought to the subject heretofore."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/winter12/features5 Columbia College Today: "Freedom Writer"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Foner has continued to lecture widely on Reconstruction and published several shorter versions of his major book, including ''A Short History of Reconstruction, 1863–1877'' (1990) and ''America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War'' (1995).

In a 2009 essay, Foner pondered whether Reconstruction might have turned out differently.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is wrong to think that, during the Civil War, [[Lincoln (president)|Lincoln]] embraced a single 'plan' of Reconstruction," he wrote. "Lincoln had always been willing to work closely with all factions of his party, including the Radicals on numerous occasions. I think it is quite plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing to a Reconstruction policy encompassing basic civil rights for blacks (as was enacted in 1866) plus limited black suffrage, along the lines he proposed just before his death."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120616125206/http://www.americanheritage.com/content/if-lincoln-hadn%E2%80%99t-died "If Lincoln Hadn't Died..."], ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2015|reason=Only the first sentence of the quote appears at the link}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foner's most recent summary of his views on the significance of Reconstruction was published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foner|first1=Eric|title=Why Reconstruction Matters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/opinion/sunday/why-reconstruction-matters.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederate statues===
In a  ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' op-ed, he criticised President Trump's tweet calling for the preservation of Confederate monuments and heritage, stating that they represented and glorified [[white supremacy]] rather than collective heritage.

===Secession and the Soviet Union===
As a visiting professor in [[Moscow]] in the early 1990s, Foner compared secessionist forces in the [[USSR]] with the secession movement in the U.S. in the 1860s. In a February 1991 article, Foner noted that the Baltic states claimed the right to secede because they had been unwillingly annexed. In addition, he believed that the Soviet Union did not protect minorities while it tried to nationalize the republics. Foner identified a threat to existing minority groups within the Baltic states, who were in turn threatened by the new nationalist movements.&lt;ref name="baltic"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=19lNAQAAIAAJ "Secession of Baltic States?"], Eric Foner, ''The Nation'', 11 February 1991, Volume 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions and testimony===
With Olivia Mahoney, chief curator at the Chicago History Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagohistory.org/documents/home/aboutus/pressroom/biographies/CHM-OliviaMahoney.pdf|title=Olivia Mahoney|work=About Us|publisher=Chicago History|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925060628/http://chicagohistory.org/documents/home/aboutus/pressroom/biographies/CHM-OliviaMahoney.pdf |archivedate=2010-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foner curated two prize-winning exhibitions on American history: ''A House Divided: America in the Age of Lincoln'', which opened at the [[Chicago History Museum]] in 1990, and ''America's Reconstruction: People and Politics After the Civil War,'' a traveling exhibit that opened at the [[Virginia Historical Society]] in 1995. He revised the presentation of American history at the [[Hall of Presidents]] at [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]], and [[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln]] at [[Disneyland]]. He has served as consultant to several [[National Park Service]] historical sites and historical museums.

Foner served as an expert witness for the [[University of Michigan]]'s defense of [[affirmative action]] in its undergraduate and law school admissions (''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'' and ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'') considered by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2003.

===Editorial boards===
Foner serves on the editorial boards of ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past and Present]]'' and ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]''.

Foner has written for ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[London Review of Books]]'', and other publications. In addition, he has spoken about history on television and radio, including ''[[Charlie Rose]]'', ''Book Notes'', and ''[[All Things Considered]].'' He has appeared in historical documentaries on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] and [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]. Foner contributed an essay and conversation with [[John Sayles]] in ''Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies'', published by the [[Society of American Historians]] in 1995. He was the historian in ''Freedom: A History of US'' on PBS in 2003.

===Media appearances===
Foner has appeared frequently on popular media to discuss US history:

==Reception==
The professional awards which Foner has received indicate the respect given his work. Journalist [[Nat Hentoff]] described his ''Story of American Freedom'' "an indispensable book that should be read in every school in the land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3812/is_200003/ai_n8891943 |work=The New Crisis |title=Books |first=Tom |last=Mansart |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Eric Foner is one of the most prolific, creative, and influential American historians of the past 20 years," according to ''[[The Washington Post]]''. His work is "brilliant, important" a reviewer wrote in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0393319628 |title=The Story of American Freedom: Eric Foner: 9780393319620: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of ''The Story of American Freedom'' in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', [[Theodore Draper]] disagreed with Foner's conclusions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the story of American freedom is told largely from the perspective of blacks and women, especially the former, it is not going to be a pretty tale. Yet most Americans thought of themselves not only as free but as the freest people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1999/sep/23/freedom-and-its-discontents |title=Freedom and Its Discontents by Theodore H. Draper |work=The New York Review of Books |date=1999-09-23 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Patrick Diggins of the [[City University of New York]] wrote that Foner's ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'', was a "magisterial" and "moving" narrative, but compared Foner's "unforgiving" view of America for its [[racist]] past to his notably different views on the fall of communism and Soviet history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2751/is_2002_Fall/ai_92042423/print John Patrick Diggins, "Review: Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877''"], ''The National Interest'', Fall 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Foner's most recent book ''Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad'' (2015) was judged "Intellectually probing and emotionally resonant by the ''Los Angeles Times.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Wendy|title=Review 'Gateway to Freedom' reveals underground railroad history|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-eric-foner-20150111-story.html|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His previous book ''The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery'' (2010) was described by ''Library Journal'' as "Original and compelling. … In the vast library on Lincoln, Foner's book stands out as the most sensible and sensitive reading of Lincoln's lifetime involvement with slavery and the most insightful assessment of Lincoln's—and indeed America's—imperative to move toward freedom lest it be lost. An essential work for all Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fiery Trial|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Fiery-Trial-Abraham-American/dp/039334066X|website=Amazon.com|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1989, Foner received the Avery O. Craven Award from the [[Organization of American Historians]]. In 1991, Foner received the Great Teacher Award from the ''Society of Columbia Graduates''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiaspectator.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/09/30/415bac2847275?in_archive=1 |accessdate=April 25, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he was named [https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/11072008/profile2.html Scholar of the Year] by the New York Council for the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyhumanities.org/ |title=New York Council for the Humanities |publisher=Nyhumanities.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an elected fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and of the [[British Academy]].

Foner has taught at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] as Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions, at [[Oxford University]] as [[Harmsworth Professorship of American History|Harmsworth Professor of American History]], where he is also an honorary fellow of the [[Rothermere American Institute]], and at [[Moscow State University]] as [[Fulbright]] Professor.

In 2007, the alumni of Columbia College voted to give Foner the [[John Jay]] Award for Distinguished Professional Achievement. In 2011, his book ''The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for history, the [[Bancroft Prize]] and the [[Lincoln Prize]].

Foner has been awarded honorary doctorates from [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]]; the [[State University of New York, Purchase]];  [[Queen Mary University of London]], [[Dartmouth College]], and [[Lehigh University]].

Foner was inducted as a Laureate of [[The Lincoln Academy of Illinois]] and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2009 as a Bicentennial Laureate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelincolnacademyofillinois.org/4632-2/#toggle-id-7|title=Laureates by Year – The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|website=The Lincoln Academy of Illinois|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1965 Foner married screenwriter [[Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal]], from whom he divorced in  1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm1197217/|title=Eric Foner|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 Foner married [[Lynn Garafola]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/newnews/news050205b.html Barnard College Newscenter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228013439/http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/newnews/news050205b.html |date=2006-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; professor of dance at [[Barnard College]] and dance critic, historian, and curator. They have one daughter.

Eric Foner's paternal uncles are the late [[Marxist historiography|Marxist labor historian]] [[Philip S. Foner]] (his father's twin brother) and labor activists [[Henry Foner]] and [[Moe Foner]].

==Comments on teaching==
Foner has frequently explored teaching moments that historians can use. He wrote, "Like all momentous events, September 11 is a remarkable teaching opportunity. But only if we use it to open rather than to close debate. Critical intellectual analysis is our responsibility—to ourselves and to our students."&lt;ref&gt;"Rethinking American History in a Post-9/11 World" [http://hnn.us/articles/6961.html ''History News Network'']&lt;/ref&gt;

"[S]uccessful teaching rests both on a genuine and selfless concern for students and on the ability to convey to them a love of history."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Who Owns History? Rethinking the Past in a Changing World,'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 2002), p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In a global age, the forever-unfinished story of American freedom must become a conversation with the entire world, not a complacent monologue with ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;"American Freedom in a Global Age" Presidential Address to the [http://www.historians.org/info/AHA_History/Efoner.htm American Historical Association annual meeting], January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filippo Tommaso Emilio Marinetti''' ({{IPA-it|fiˈlippo tomˈmaːzo mariˈnetti|lang}}; 22 December 1876 – 2 December 1944) was an Italian poet, editor, art theorist, and founder of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement. He was associated with the [[utopian]] and [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] artistic and literary community [[Abbaye de Créteil]] between 1907 and 1908. Marinetti is best known as the author of the first ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', which was written and published in 1909; and also of the [[Fascist Manifesto]].

==Childhood and adolescence==
Emilio Angelo Carlo Marinetti (some documents give his name as "Filippo Achille Emilio Marinetti") spent the first years of his life in [[Alexandria]], [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]], where his father (Enrico Marinetti) and his mother (Amalia Grolli) lived together ''more uxorio'' (as if married). Enrico was a lawyer from [[Piedmont]], and his mother was the daughter of a literary professor from [[Milan]]. They had come to Egypt in 1865, at the invitation of [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]], to act as legal advisers for foreign companies that were taking part in his modernization program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Berghaus, Günther|title=Filippo Tommaso Marinetti: Critical Writings|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=9780374706944|chapter=F.T. Marinetti (1876–1944): A Life Between Art and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-B9EJGYbAMC&amp;pg=PT14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His love for literature developed during the school years. His mother was an avid reader of poetry, and introduced the young Marinetti to the Italian and European classics. At age seventeen he started his first school magazine, ''Papyrus'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Somigli, Luca|title=Legitimizing the Artist: Manifesto Writing and European Modernism, 1885–1915|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2003|isbn=9780802037619|pages=97–98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQnGUy57jSsC&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Jesuits]] threatened to expel him for publicizing [[Émile Zola]]'s scandalous novels in the school.

He first studied in Egypt then in Paris, obtaining a ''[[baccalauréat]]'' degree in 1894 at the Sorbonne,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FReQVFC6ZJUC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=Enrico+Marinetti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sc9skuhwUL&amp;sig=o8KD6j0S7WlD_mYfDH3x2sQiUZA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PsWJTs_2EKnV0QGRxIz_Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Enrico%20Marinetti&amp;f=false Critical writings] / F.T. Marinetti ; edited by Günter Berghaus ; translated by Doug Thompson&lt;/ref&gt; and in Italy, graduating in law at the [[University of Pavia]] in 1899.

He decided not to be a lawyer but to develop a literary career. He experimented with every type of literature (poetry, narrative, theatre, ''words in liberty''), signing everything "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti".

==Futurism==
[[File:Filippo Tommaso Marinetti - Zang tumb tumb - Hoge Rijndijk 8, Leiden.JPG|thumb|Poem of Marinetti on a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall in Leiden]]]]
Marinetti and [[Constantin Brâncuși]] were visitors of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] c. 1908 along with young writers like Roger Allard (one of the first to defend [[Cubism]]), Pierre Jean Jouve, and Paul Castiaux, who wanted to publish their works through the Abbaye. The Abbaye de Créteil was a ''[[phalanstère]]'' community founded in the autumn of 1906 by the painter [[Albert Gleizes]], and the poets [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], [[Alexandre Mercereau]] and [[Charles Vildrac]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lredudrameessa00barz#page/134/mode/2up Barzun, Henri-Martin, ''L'Ere du Drame, Essai de Synthèse Poétique Moderne'', Figuière, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement drew its inspiration from the ''Abbaye de Thélème,'' a fictional creation by [[Rabelais]] in his novel ''[[Gargantua]]''. It was closed down by its members early in 1908.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/239 Daniel Robbins, ''Albert Gleizes, 1881–1953, a Retrospective Exhibition'', Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, 1964 (Guggenheim website)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marinetti is known best as the author of the ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', which he wrote in 1909. It was published in French on the front page of the most prestigious French daily newspaper, ''[[Le Figaro]]'', on 20 February 1909. In ''The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism'', Marinetti declared that "Art, in fact, can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and injustice." [[Georges Sorel]], who influenced the entire political spectrum from anarchism to Fascism, also argued for the importance of violence. Futurism had both anarchist and Fascist elements; Marinetti later became an active supporter of [[Benito Mussolini]].

Marinetti, who admired speed, had a minor car accident outside [[Milan]] in 1908 when he veered into a ditch to avoid two cyclists. He referred to the accident in the Futurist Manifesto: the Marinetti who was helped out of the ditch was a new man, determined to end the pretense and decadence of the prevailing [[Art nouveau|Liberty style]]. He discussed a new and strongly revolutionary programme with his friends, in which they should end every artistic relationship with the past, "destroy the museums, the libraries, every type of academy". Together, he wrote, "We will glorify war—the world's only hygiene—[[militarism]], patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/ The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Futurist Manifesto was read and debated all across Europe, but Marinetti's first 'Futurist' works were not as successful. In April, the opening night of his drama ''Le Roi bombance'' (The Feasting King), written in 1905, was interrupted by loud, derisive whistling by the audience... and by Marinetti himself, who thus introduced another element of Futurism, "the desire to be heckled." Marinetti did, however, fight a duel with a critic he considered too harsh.

His drama ''La donna è mobile'' (Poupées électriques), first presented in [[Turin]], was not successful either. Nowadays, the play is remembered through a later version, named ''Elettricità sessuale'' (Sexual Electricity), and mainly for the appearance onstage of humanoid automatons, ten years before the [[Czechs|Czech]] writer [[Karel Čapek]] would invent the term "[[robot]]".

[[File:FilippoTommasoMarinetti.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]
In 1910 his first novel, ''Mafarka il futurista'', was cleared of all charges by an obscenity trial. That year, Marinetti discovered some allies in three young painters ([[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]]), who adopted the Futurist philosophy. Together with them (and with poets such as [[Aldo Palazzeschi]]), Marinetti began a series of Futurist Evenings, theatrical spectacles in which Futurists declaimed their manifestos in front of a crowd that in part attended the performances in order to throw vegetables at them.

The most successful "happening" of that period was the publicization of the "Manifesto Against Past-Loving [[Venice]]" in Venice. In the flier, Marinetti demands "fill(ing) the small, stinking canals with the rubble from the old, collapsing and leprous palaces" to "prepare for the birth of an industrial and militarized Venice, capable of dominating the great [[Adriatic]], a great Italian lake."

In 1911, the [[Italo-Turkish War]] began and Marinetti departed for [[Libya]] as war correspondent for a French newspaper. His articles were eventually collected and published in ''The Battle of Tripoli''. He then covered the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–13, witnessing the surprise success of Bulgarian troops against the Ottoman Empire in the [[Siege of Adrianople (1912–13)|Siege of Adrianople]]. In this period he also made a number of visits to London, which he considered 'the Futurist city par excellence', and where a number of exhibitions, lectures and demonstrations of Futurist music were staged. However, although a number of artists, including [[Wyndham Lewis]], were interested in the new movement, only one British convert was made, the young artist [[C.R.W. Nevinson]]. Nevertheless, Futurism was an important influence upon Lewis's [[Vorticist]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Haycock, ''A Crisis of Brilliance'' (London: Old Street Publishing, 2009), 138–40, 142, 147, 187–8&lt;/ref&gt;

About the same time Marinetti worked on a very anti-[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and anti-[[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] verse-novel, ''Le monoplan du Pape'' (''The Pope's Aeroplane'', 1912) and edited an anthology of futurist poets. But his attempts to renew the style of poetry did not satisfy him. So much so that, in his foreword to the anthology, he declared a new revolution: it was time to be done with traditional syntax and to use "words in freedom"  (''parole in libertà''). His sound-poem ''[[Zang Tumb Tumb]]'', an account of the Battle of Adrianople,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.guggenheim.org/checklist/words-in-freedom-the-unique-colors-of-our-changeable-i/ Valesio, Paolo; ''Words-in-Freedom—"The Unique Colors of our Changeable 'I'"'', Guggenheim website,  August 28, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; exemplifies words in freedom. Recordings can be heard of Marinetti reading some of his sound poems: ''Battaglia, Peso + Odore'' (1912);&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/marinetti_ft/Marinetti-Filippo-Tommaso_Battaglia.mp3]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dune, parole in libertà'' (1914);&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117142522/http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/marinetti_ft/Marinetti-Filippo-Tommaso_Dune.mp3]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''La Battaglia di Adrianopoli'' (1926) (recorded 1935).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/artist_tellus/Tellus-21-Artists_03_marinetti.mp3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime==
Marinetti agitated for Italian involvement in the [[World War I]], and once Italy was engaged, promptly volunteered for service. In the Fall of 1915 he and several other Futurists who were members of the Lombard Volunteer Cyclists were stationed at [[Lake Garda]], in [[Trentino]] province, high in the mountains along the Italo-Austrian border. They endured several weeks of fighting in harsh conditions before the cyclists units, deemed inappropriate for mountain warfare, were disbanded.

Marinetti spent most of 1916 supporting Italy's war effort with speeches, journalism, and theatrical work, then returned to military service as a regular army officer in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13532944.2013.806289 Daly, Selena ; ''The Futurist mountains: Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's experiences of mountain combat in the First World War'', Modern Italy, 2013]; retvd 8 24 15&lt;/ref&gt; In May of that year he was seriously wounded while serving with an artillery battalion on the [[Soča|Isonzo]] front; he returned to service after a long recovery, and participated in the decisive Italian victory at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]] in October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus, Günter (editor; introduction to) Marinetti, Filippo Tommaso; ''Critical Writings: New Edition''; Macmillan, 2007; {{ISBN|0374706948}}, 9780374706944&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
After an extended courtship, in 1923 Marinetti married [[Benedetta Cappa]] (1897–1977), a writer and painter and a pupil of [[Giacomo Balla]].  Born in Rome, she had joined the Futurists in 1917.  They'd met in 1918, moved in together in Rome, and chose to marry only to avoid legal complications on a lecture tour of [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Futurism: an anthology By Lawrence S. Rainey, Christine Poggi, Laura Wittman, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;  They would have three daughters:  Vittoria, Ala, and Luce.

Cappa and Marinetti collaborated on a genre of mixed-media assemblages in the mid-1920s they called ''tattilismo'' ("Tactilism"), and she was a strong proponent and practitioner of the [[aeropittura]] movement after its inception in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkerart.org/archive/2/AC73F5BDEEF8DE5D6173.htm |title=WAC &amp;#124; La Futurista: Benedetta Cappa Marinetti (1917–1945) |publisher=Walkerart.org |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also produced three experimental novels.  Cappa's major public work is likely a series of five murals at the Palermo Post Office (1926–1935) for the Fascist public-works architect [[Angiolo Mazzoni]].

==Marinetti and Fascism==
In early 1918 he founded the ''Partito Politico Futurista'' or Futurist Political Party, which only a year later merged with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento]]''. Marinetti was one of the first affiliates of the [[Partito Nazionale Fascista|Italian Fascist Party]]. In 1919 he co-wrote with [[Alceste De Ambris]] the [[Fascist Manifesto]], the original manifesto of [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dahlia S. Elazar. The making of fascism: class, state, and counter-revolution, Italy 1919–1922. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Praeger Publishers, 2001, p.73&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, terming them "reactionary," and, after walking out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrew from politics for three years. However, he remained a notable force in developing the party philosophy throughout the regime's existence. For example, at the end of the ''Congress of Fascist Culture'' that was held in [[Bologna]] on 30 March 1925, [[Giovanni Gentile]] addressed [[Sergio Panunzio]] on the need to define Fascism more purposefully by way of Marinetti's opinion, stating, "Great spiritual movements make recourse to precision when their primitive inspirations—what F. T. Marinetti identified this morning as artistic, that is to say, the creative and truly innovative ideas, from which the movement derived its first and most potent impulse—have lost their force. We today find ourselves at the very beginning of a new life and we experience with joy this obscure need that fills our hearts—this need that is our inspiration, the genius that governs us and carries us with it."

As part of his campaign to overturn tradition, Marinetti also attacked traditional Italian food. His ''Manifesto of Futurist Cooking'' was published in the Turin ''[[Gazzetta del Popolo]]'' on 28 December 1930.&lt;ref name="Scarpellini"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scarpellini|first1=Emanuela|title=Food and Foodways in Italy from 1861 to the Present|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-56962-2|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hI8YDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sorini"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sorini|first1=Alex Revelli|last2=Cutini|first2=Susanna|title=Dining With Marinetti: the Manifesto of Futurist Cuisine|url=https://www.finedininglovers.com/stories/futurism-cuisine-manifesto-dining-marinetti/|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Fine Dining Lovers|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that "People think, dress and act in accordance with what they drink and eat",&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Food Fight|journal=Distillations|year=2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=22–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/food-fight|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinetti proposed wide-ranging changes to diet. He condemned pasta, blaming it for lassitude, pessimism and lack of virility,&lt;ref name="Theroux"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theroux|first1=Alexander|title=Einstein's Beets|date=2017|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|isbn=1606999761|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XpSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA647|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted the eating of Italian-grown rice.&lt;ref name="Brickman"/&gt; In this, as in other ways, his proposed [[Futurist cooking]] was nationalistic, rejecting foreign foods and food names. It was also militaristic, seeking to stimulate men to be fighters.&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;

Marinetti also sought to increase creativity.  His attraction to whatever was new made scientific discoveries appealing to him, but his views on diet were not scientifically based. He was fascinated with the idea of processed food, predicting that someday pills would replace food as a source of energy, and calling for the creation of "plastic complexes" to replace natural foods.&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt; Food, in turn, would become a matter of artistic expression. Many of the meals Marinetti described and ate resemble [[performance art]], such as the "Tactile Dinner",&lt;ref name="Theroux"/&gt; recreated in 2014 for an exhibit at the [[Guggenheim Museum]]. Participants wore pajamas decorated with sponge, sandpaper, and aluminum, and ate salads without using cutlery.&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brickman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brickman|first1=Sophie|title=The Food of the Future|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/food-future|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Fascist regime Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Italy but failed to do so. Mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the [[Novecento Italiano]] group in 1923, he said: "I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art. Art belongs to the domain of the individual.  The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braun, Emily, ''Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism'', Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini's mistress, [[Margherita Sarfatti]], successfully promoted the rival Novecento Group, and even persuaded Marinetti to be part of its board.

In Fascist Italy, modern art was tolerated and even approved by the Fascist hierarchy. Towards the end of the 1930s, some Fascist ideologues (for example, the ex-Futurist [[Ardengo Soffici]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdyCiukUaf8C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;dq=Soffici+%2B%22degenerate+art%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6_waDGcuJS&amp;sig=TYcjaLVHNdYTH8rXsB7n6MjAyRk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OTNrTruUEYu3hAfy6Y2DDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Soffici%20%2B%22degenerate%20art%22&amp;f=false Feinstein, Willy, ''The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy'', 2010, Associated University Presses]&lt;/ref&gt;) wished to import the concept of "[[degenerate art]]" from Germany to Italy and condemned modernism, although their demands were ignored by the regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/lh/article/viewFile/5436/4631 Kay, Carolyn, "Review of Affron, Matthew and Antliff, Mark, ''Fascist Vision: Art and Ideology in France and Italy (1997)''" ''Left History'', 7.1, 191–193]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, hearing that [[Adolf Hitler]] wanted to include Futurism in a traveling exhibition of [[degenerate art]], Marinetti persuaded Mussolini to refuse to let it enter Italy.

On 17 November 1938, Italy passed [[Italian Racial Laws|The Racial Laws]], discriminating against Italian Jews, much as the discrimination pronounced in the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. The anti-Semitic trend in Italy resulted in attacks against modern art, judged too foreign, too radical and anti-nationalist.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"&gt;[http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/futurism/timeline/ ''Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe''], Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 11 January 1939 issue of the Futurist journal ''Artecrazia'' Marinetti expressed his condemnation of such attacks on modern art, noting Futurism is both Italian and nationalist, not foreign, and that there are no Jews in Futurism. Furthermore, he claimed Jews were not active in the development of modern art. Regardless, the Italian state shut down ''Artecrazia''.&lt;ref name="Guggenheim" /&gt;

Marinetti made numerous attempts to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant garde with each attempt. He relocated from Milan to Rome. He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, saying, "It is important that Futurism be represented in the Academy." He was initially an atheist,&lt;ref&gt;Mario Isnenghi, ''Il mito della grande guerra da Marinetti a Malaparte'', Laterza, 1970, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the mid 1930's he had come to accept the influence of the [[Catholic Church]] on Italian society.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Berghaus, ''Futurism and the Technological Imagination'', Rodopi, 2009, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gazzetta del Popolo'', 21 June 1931, Marinetti expressed his view that it was essential for Futurists to create masterpieces of [[Christian art|sacred art]], proclaiming that "Only Futurist artists...are able to express clearly...the simultaneous dogmas of the Catholic faith, such as the Holy Trinity, the Immaculate Conception and Christ’s Calvary."&lt;ref name="ItalianFuturism.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=ItalianFuturism.org |url=http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/manifesto-of-sacred-art-english/ |title=Manifesto of Futurist Sacred Art (English translation) |publisher=Italianfuturism.org |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later works ''L'aeropoema di Gesù'' ("The Aeropoem of Jesus") and ''Quarto d'ora di poesia per the X Mas'' ("A Fifteen Minutes' Poem of the X Mas"), Marinetti sought to reconcile his newfound love for God and his passion for the action that accompanied him throughout his life.&lt;ref name="The Spirituality of Marinetti: Between Anticlericalism, Spiritism and Christianity ''(Italiano)''"&gt;{{cite web|author=Giovanni Balducci |url=https://www.centrostudilaruna.it/la-spiritualita-di-marinetti-fra-anticlericalismo-spiritismo-e-cristianesimo.html |title=La spiritualità di Marinetti: fra anticlericalismo, spiritismo e cristianesimo |publisher=Centro Studi La Runa |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were other contradictions in his character: despite his nationalism, he was international, educated in Egypt and France, writing his first poems in French, publishing the Futurist Manifesto in a French newspaper and traveling to promote his ideas.

Marinetti volunteered for active service in the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the [[Second World War]], serving on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] for a few weeks in the Summer and Autumn of 1942 at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;Ialongo, Ernest; ''Filippo Tommaso Marinetti: The Artist and His Politics'', p.289; Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015; {{ISBN|1611477573}}, 9781611477573&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of cardiac arrest in [[Bellagio (Italian region)|Bellagio]] on 2 December 1944 while working on a collection of poems praising the wartime achievements of the [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7907">'''Francisco de Asís Monterde García Icazbalceta''' (August 9, 1894 in [[Mexico City]] &amp;ndash; February 27, 1985 in Mexico City) was a prolific and multifaceted Mexican writer whose career spanned over fifty years. He was an important promoter of the arts and culture in Mexico in the years following the [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]].

==Bibliography==
His parents were Francisco de Asís Ángel María Monterde [[Spanish names#The particle "y"|y]] Adalid and María Trinidad de los Dolores García Icazbalceta y Travesi de Monterde, aristocrats who both died when he was still young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejournal.unam.mx/ehn/ehn34/EHN003400005.pdf La Familia Monterde y Antillón en Nueva España Reconstrucción Genealógica]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied  [[dentistry]] but never practiced. In 1924 he founded and edited the short-lived Mexican [[avant-garde]] cultural magazine ''Antena''. In 1925 he famously deciphered a letter that [[conquistador]] [[Hernán Cortés]] left written in code. He wrote, in addition to plays and poetry, various novels set in [[New Spain|colonial Mexico]], a [[genre]] known as ''colonialista''. In 1930 he created in conjunction with [[Alejandro Gómez Arias]], the department of [[Mexican Literature|Mexican]] and [[Hispanic|Hispano]]-American Literature at the [[National Preparatory School]]. He was a founding member in 1938 of the Asociación Mexicana de Críticos de Teatro (AMCT). He belonged to the "''grupo de los siete autores''" (group of seven authors), a circle of dramatists active in the 1950s who revived the [[theatre|theatrical arts]] in Mexico. He was an admirer of [[José Juan Tablada]] and an imitator of the latter's [[haiku]]-inspired poetry (a style at the time referred to as ''haikai''). He held important posts in the [[Ministry of Public Education (Mexico)|Ministry of Public Education]]. He was from 1922-65  a professor of [[Spanish literature|Spanish]] and [[Latin-American literature]] at the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM), his [[alma mater]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]] 1941, [[Ph.D.]] 1942). He served as subdirector of the [[Biblioteca Nacional de México]]; as head librarian of the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] (1931); and as director of the Imprenta Universitaria de la UNAM (UNAM University Press). He was director of the Centro Mexicano de Escritores from 1973-85.

Monterde was a [[wikt:numerary|numerary]] member ([[Chair (official)|seat]] 2) of the [[Academia Mexicana de la Lengua]] and served as its director from 1960-72.

'''George Louis Beer''' (July 26, 1872 – March 15, 1920) was a renowned American [[historian]] of the [[Historiography of the British Empire|"Imperial school"]].

Born in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to an affluent family that was prominent in New York's German-Jewish community, Beer's father owned a successful tobacco importing business. He studied at [[Columbia University]], where he received the A.B. degree (1892) and then an A.M. degree in 1893.  Beer's master's thesis ("The Commercial Policy of England Toward the American Colonies") was supervised by Professor [[Herbert Levi Osgood]] and was immediately published in the ''Columbia University Studies in History, Economics and Public Law''.  He taught European History at Columbia from 1893 to 1897 while also working in the tobacco business.  After retiring from business in 1903, he devoted his time to extensive research in British archives, and wrote three highly regarded and influential books on the British-American [[colonial history of the United States|colonial period]].  In 1913 he was the first [[Loubat Prize]] recipient for ''The Origins of the British Colonial System, 1578-1660'', one of those books.  His work ''The English Speaking Peoples'', was published in 1917.  He stressed the successful workings of the commercial dimensions of the [[British Empire]] and was part of the "Imperial School" which emphasized the economic benefits and efficient administration of the Empire.  He was American correspondent of the British ''[[The Round Table Journal|Round Table Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=afquest&gt;{{cite book
|title=African Questions at the Paris Peace Conference
|author=George Louis Beer, Louis Herbert Gray
|date=1923

|chapter=Editor's Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beer served as colonial expert to [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson's]] [[The Inquiry|American Commission of Inquiry]] during [[World War I]]&lt;ref name=afquest/&gt; and attended the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] as a member of the [[American Commission to Negotiate Peace]], for which he was chief of the Colonial Division in 1918-1919.  He was also a member of the [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates Commission]] of the [[League of Nations]], and was appointed director of the Mandatory Section of the League's [[Organisation of the League of Nations#Secretariat|Secretariat]] in 1919.

Beer married Edith Hellman on November 11, 1896.  She was the niece of one of his early mentors at Columbia, [[E. R. A. Seligman]], who had also married Beer's sister.  Beer and his wife had one daughter, and the marriage lasted until Beer's untimely death on March 15, 1920.

==The George Louis Beer Prize==
{{Main|George Louis Beer Prize}}
Beer left a bequest to establish a prize recognizing outstanding historical writing relating to European international history since 1895.

'''Graham Dodsworth''' is an [[Australian]] folklorist, performer of folk songs, and an oral history interviewer for the [[National Library of Australia]] and the [[National Film and Sound Archive]].

==Biography==
Born 1956 in the Yallourn Hospital in [[Gippsland, Victoria]], Graham Dodsworth lived his first five years in [[Moe, Victoria|Moe]] after which his family moved to [[Vermont, Victoria|Vermont]] in the outer eastern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], where he attended Vermont Primary and Secondary Schools. Dodsworth moved to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in 1969 and while attending Kew High School first heard [[Danny Spooner]] conducting workshops demonstrating attitudes to the [[industrial revolution]] in England, transportation and other aspects of Australian history via folk song performance.

Dodsworth began a performance career in 1971 with performances at The Outpost Inn, Frank Traynors,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dan O'Connell Hotel, and Fogarty's Union Hotel in Melbourne. In 2001 he achieved a [[Master of Arts]] degree in Australian Studies from [[Monash University]], his thesis being entitled "The Nature of Folk Song in Australia: Origins and Transmission". He was awarded the 2005 National Library of Australia National Folk Festival Fellowship culminating in a concert in the Budawang Theatre at the [[National Folk Festival (Australia)|National Folk Festival]] and in the foyer of the National Library of Australia in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Great Migration of Canada''' (also known as the '''Great Migration from Britain''') was a period of high [[immigration to Canada]] from 1815 to 1850, involving over 800,000 immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linksnorth.com/canada-history/thecolonies.html |title=The History of Canada and Canadians - Colonies Grow Up |publisher=Linksnorth.com |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Europe was becoming richer through the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[population growth]] made the relative number of jobs low, forcing many to look to the [[New World]] for economic success, especially Canada and America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/Events-leading-up-to-Canadian-Confederacy/1815-1850-The-Great-Migration-1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103061255/http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/Events-leading-up-to-Canadian-Confederacy/1815-1850-The-Great-Migration-1 |date=November 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|Industrial Revolution}}
In the late 18th and early 19th century, there occurred a transition in parts of [[Great Britain]]'s previously manual-labour-based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanization of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Though the Revolution began an era of expanded [[economic growth]] and higher standards of living, it was at the same time met with a rapid population explosion. A slow rise in quality of living standards throughout the past two hundred years allowed more children to survive and made child bearing more economic. Jobs that were previously done by poor peasants could now be done even cheaper by machinery, and this led to the loss of many jobs. The combined effects made it difficult for some to find jobs, leading them to look to the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonies]] in the Americas for work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis | url = http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm | title = The Industrial Revolution | access-date = 2007-11-14 | author = [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]] | year = 2003 | quote = it is fairly clear that up to 1800 or maybe 1750, no society had experienced sustained growth in per capital income. (Eighteenth century population growth also averaged one-third of 1 percent, the same as production growth.) That is, up to about two centuries ago, per capital [[real income|incomes]] in all societies were stagnated at around $400 to $800 per year. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516211911/http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/04-05/essay.cfm | archivedate = 2008-05-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vmccorley.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/The+Industrial+Revolution+and+the+Great+Migration.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Migration==
Because the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, the first (and therefore the majority of) settlers were English-speaking British. Sixty percent of these immigrants to Canada were British. This made them the largest group in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://etacanadaonline.com/ |title=Immigration to Canada |accessdate=2010-07-29}} &lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Irish people|Irish]] came first as workers, or [[navvies]] in the 1820-40s mostly to Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, later to escape the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Potato Famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.cbe.ab.ca/ict/2learn/jkshpur/2cultures/grmigrat.html |title=Cultures arriving between 1815–1860 |publisher=Projects.cbe.ab.ca |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other people from other countries migrated as well. [[United States|Americans]] went to [[British Columbia]] in order to look for [[gold]], a material that was quickly evaporating because of the [[California gold rush]]. [[Chinese people|Chinese]] went to [[British Columbia]] too in order to help build the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], and to escape war and famine in their own country. These migrations can be considered apart from those in earlier times.

==Impact==
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
The Great Migration had profound impacts on Canadian culture, and identity. Before 1815, 80% of English speaking Canadians were exiles or immigrants from the 13 American colonies or their descendants. Because of this until the 1830s English Canada had pronounced American cultural 'flavor' in spite of the political divide over membership in the British Empire and independence. This may account even today for many cultural similarities. At the beginning of the Great Migration, the [[French Canadian|Canadiens]], Canadians of French descent, outnumbered those of British descent. The total population of the provinces of Canada was approximately half a million. At the end the period, the English Canadian population was double that of the French Canadian population out of a total of 2.4 million. The British Canadians also expanded into [[Lower Canada]], which caused contentions with the French Canadian subjects. Crowded conditions on immigrant ships led to periodic outbreaks in diseases such as [[cholera]] in [[Lower Canada]] which spread to local urban populations and resulted in increased use of quarantine facilities such as [[Grosse Isle, Quebec]] and [[Partridge Island, New Brunswick]].

[[File:1486 Tiroler Guldengroschen of Sigismund coin.jpg|thumb|An official restrike of the 1486 Tiroler Guldengroschen]]

The '''Guldengroschen''' was a large [[silver]] [[coin]] originally minted in [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] in 1486. 

The Guldengroschen's name comes from the fact that it has an equivalent denomination value in silver relative to that of the [[goldgulden]] (60 [[kreuzer]]). In the latter years of the 1470s and early years of the 1480s [[Sigismund of Austria]] issued decrees that reformed the poor state of his region's coinage by improving the silver fineness back to a level not seen in centuries (.937 pure) and created denominations larger than the ubiquitous, but fairly low valued [[Groschen]] of 4 to 6 [[Kreuzer]] that were in use. 

In 1484, small numbers of "half guldengroschens" valued at 30 kreuzer were issued. This was a revolutionary leap in denomination from the smaller pieces, and surpassed even the large [[testone]]s of [[Italy]] which were the highest weight coins in use. Finally in 1486 the full sized guldengroschen of 60 kreuzers was put into circulation and it was soon nicknamed "guldiner". For a long time thereafter such coins were also called "unciales" because their actual silver weight was very nearly one [[ounce]]. As large quantities of silver became available other states began issuing guldiners of their own. Bern, in modern-day Switzerland was one of the earliest to follow Tirol by issuing its guldiners in 1493. In 1500, Saxony's mint at Annaberg took minting of guldiners to new heights and the economies of central Europe welcomed these large new coins. 

[[Image:Münze Erzherzog Sigismund.jpg|thumb|left|Guldengroschen]]

The original Tiroler guldiner was designed so that eight coins minted would weigh in pure silver at one Tiroler Mark. This was fine for Tirol, but much of Europe was accustomed to measuring by the more widely used [[Cologne mark]]. The penultimate development of the guldiner occurred in 1518 when the [[Joachimsthal]] mint in [[Habsburg]]-controlled [[Bohemia]] slightly altered the weight of the coin from 31.93 g down to 29.20 g. This made it possible to mint nine guldiners to have the silver weight equivalent of one Cologne Mark, rather than the eight in Tirol. This new coin was known as the Joachimsthaler (Joachimsthal guldiner), but like the guldengroschen being contracted to guldiner, the joachimsthaler became known simply as the [[thaler]]. This new coin was an instant success and was the great grandfather of many other similar weight coins like the [[daalder]], [[dollar]], [[tolar]], [[tallero]], etc.

==Guldengroschen represented in other coins==
Guldengroschen itself, has been the main motive for many collectors coins and medals.  One of the most recent is the Austrian [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2003 coinage|700 Years City of Hall in Tyrol commemorative coin]], minted on January 29, 2003. The reverse side of the coin shows the Guldiner silver coin. However, the design is negative, representing a [[coin die]], as a reference to Hall’s history as a significant centre for minting coins.

{{History of the United Kingdom}}
{{Periods in English History}}

'''Interwar Britain''' (1919–1939) was a period of peace and relative economic stagnation. In politics the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] collapsed and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] became the main challenger to the dominant [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] throughout the period. The [[Great Depression]] impacted Britain less severely economically and politically than other major nations, although there were severe pockets of [[Interwar unemployment and poverty in the United Kingdom|long-term unemployment and hardship]], especially in mining districts and in Scotland and North West England.

Historian [[Arthur Marwick]] sees a radical transformation of British society resulting from the [[Great War]], a deluge that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more egalitarian society. He sees the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, arguing there were major positive long-term consequences of the war to British society. He points to an energized self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, the coming of partial women's suffrage, and an acceleration of social reform and state control of the economy. He sees a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and the weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behaviour. The [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]] faded away; village chemists sold contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;John Peel, "The manufacture and retailing of contraceptives in England." ''Population Studies'' 17.2 (1963): 113–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Marwick says that class distinctions softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Marwick, ''The Deluge: British Society and the First World War'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics of 1920s==
===Enlarging democracy===
The [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] finally gave Britain universal manhood suffrage at age 21, with no property qualifications. Even more dramatically it opened up woman suffrage for most women over the age of 30. In 1928, all women were covered on the same terms as men.&lt;ref&gt; Robert Blackburn, "Laying the foundations of the modern voting system: The Representation of the People Act 1918." ''Parliamentary History'' 30.1 (2011): 33–52.&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of revolutionary forces, most notably in Bolshevik Russia and Socialist Germany, but also in Hungary, Italy and elsewhere, revolution to overthrow established elites and aristocracies was in the air. The Labour Party largely controlled working-class politics, and it strongly supported the government in London and opposed violent revolution. Conservatives were especially worried about "[[Red Clydeside]]" in industrial Scotland. Their fears were misplaced, for there was no organized attempt at any revolution. Indeed, the far left white working men in Red Clydeside were chiefly concerned with excluding blacks and women from good jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquelin Jenkinson, "Black Sailors on Red Clydeside: rioting, reactionary trade unionism and conflicting notions of ‘Britishness’ following the First World War." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 19.1 (2007): 29–60. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kay Blackwell, "Women on Red Clydside: The Invisible Workforce Debate." ''Journal of Scottish Historical Studies'' 21.2 (2001): 140–162. &lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there were concerns about republicanism. The king and his top advisors were deeply concerned about the republican threat to the British monarchy, so much so that it was a factor in the king's decision not to rescue his cousin the overthrown Tsar [[Nicholas II]] of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Rose]], ''King George V'' (2000) p 215 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9BuIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9BuIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 online excerpt]. &lt;/ref&gt; Nervous conservatives associated republicanism with the rise of socialism and the growing labour movement. Their concerns, although exaggerated, resulted in a redesign of the monarchy's social role to be more inclusive of the working class and its representatives, a dramatic change for George, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. In fact the socialists by 1911 no longer believed in their anti-monarchy slogans and took a wait-and-see attitude toward George V. They were ready to come to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "The conditions of royal rule: Australian and British socialist and labour attitudes to the monarchy, 1901–11." ''Social History'' 30.1 (2005): 64–88, especially p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war George took that step; he made nearly 300 visits to shipyards and munitions factories, chatting with and congratulating ordinary workers on their hard work for the war effort.&lt;ref name = "ODNBGeorgeV"&gt;[[H. C. G. Matthew]], "George V (1865–1936)" ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted a more democratic stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public. The king also cultivated friendly relations with leading Labour party politicians and trade union officials. George V's abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter. For example, in 1924 the king proved willing, in the absence of a clear majority for any one of the three parties, to replace Conservative Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] with [[Ramsay MacDonald]], the first Labour Party prime minister. King George's tactful and understanding reception of the MacDonald government allayed the suspicions of the party's supporters throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt; Frank Prochaska, "George V and Republicanism, 1917–1919." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 1999 10(1): 27–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
An armed insurrection by Irish republicans known as the [[Easter Rising]] took place in [[Dublin]] during Easter Week, 1916. It was badly organized, and quickly suppressed by the Army. The government responded with harsh repression, 2000 arrests, and quick execution of 15 leaders. The Catholic Irish then underwent a dramatic change of mood, and shifted to demand vengeance and independence.&lt;ref&gt;Fearghal McGarry, ''The Rising: Easter 1916'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 Lloyd George called the 1917–18 [[Irish Convention]] in an attempt to settle the outstanding [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule for Ireland]] issue. It had little support. The upsurge in republican sympathies in Ireland following the Easter Rising coupled with Lloyd George's disastrous attempt to extend [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription to Ireland]] in April 1918 led to the wipeout of the old [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Home Rule Party]] at the December 1918 election. They had supported the British war effort and were now displaced by [[Sinn Féin]], which had mobilised grass-roots opposition to helping the British rule.&lt;ref&gt;Caoimhe Nic Dhaibheid, "The Irish National Aid Association and the Radicalization of Public Opinion in Ireland, 1916–1918." ''The Historical Journal'' 55.3 (2012): 705–729.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinn Féin MPs did not take up their seats in the British Parliament, instead setting up their own new parliament in Dublin, and immediately declared an [[Irish Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Nick Pelling, ''Anglo-Irish Relations: 1798–1922'' (2003) pp. 98–109.&lt;/ref&gt; 

British policy was confused and contradictory, as the cabinet could not decide on war or peace, sending in enough force to commit atrocities that angered Catholics in Ireland and America, and Liberals in Britain, but not enough to suppress the rebels outside the cities. Lloyd George waxed hot and cold, denouncing murderers one day, but eventually negotiating with them. He sent in 40,000 soldiers as well as newly formed para-military units -- the "[[Black and Tans]]" and the [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]] -- to reinforce the professional police (the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]]). British firepower prevailed in the cities forcing the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) (the paramilitary force of Sinn Féin) into hiding. However the IRA controlled much of the countryside and set up an alternative local government.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars'' (1955) pp. 58–72.&lt;/ref&gt; The British units were poorly coordinated while [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] designed a highly effective organization for the IRA that used informers to destroy the British intelligence system by assassinating its leadership.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Lee, ''Ireland: 1912–1985'' (1989) pp. 42–45. &lt;/ref&gt; Although it was called "[[Irish War of Independence]]" historians generally agree that it was quite unlike the later [[Irish Civil War]] that was fought in 1922–23 between the forces of Collins and [[Éamon de Valera]]. The 1919–21 clash "was no war in any conventional sense of the term, but a highly contingent, very small-scale and low-intensity conflict in which assassination was as important as ambush or fixed battle."&lt;ref&gt; Shane Nagle, "[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=35891 Review of Leeson, D. M., ''The Black and Tans: British Police and Auxiliaries in the Irish War of Independence'' in ''H-Empire, H-Net Reviews.'' October, 2012.]] &lt;/ref&gt; 

Lloyd George finally solved the crisis with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] which partitioned Ireland into [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] in May 1921. Sinn Féin won control of the south and agreed to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in December 1921 with Irish leaders. Collins took power when de Valera refused to sign and led a breakaway faction.&lt;ref&gt;D.G. Boyce, ''The Irish question and British politics'' (2nd ed. 1996) pp. 58–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the treaty southern Ireland seceded in 1922 to form the [[Irish Free State]]. Meanwhile, the Unionists under [[Edward Carson]] controlled Ulster and Northern Ireland remained loyal to London.&lt;ref&gt; Thomas Hennessey, ''A History of Northern Ireland: 1920–1996'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars'' (1955) pp. 79–108.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1922 the Irish situation had stabilized, and no longer played a major role in British politics. Nevertheless, [[Ireland–United Kingdom relations|disputes sputtered for decades]] regarding the exact relationship to the monarchy, [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|a trade war in the 1930s]], and [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|British use of naval ports]]. The Irish Free State cut many of its ties to Britain in 1937. As the [[History of the Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] it was one of a handful of neutrals in Europe in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Lee, ''Ireland: 1912–1985'' (1989), ch 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanding the welfare state===
Two major programmes dealing with unemployment and housing that permanently expanded the welfare state passed in 1919 and 1920 with surprisingly little debate, even as the Conservatives dominated parliament. 

The [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920]] expanded the provisions of the [[National Insurance Act 1911]]. It set up the dole system that provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to practically the entire civilian working population except domestic servants, farm workers, and civil servants. Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women. It passed at a time of very low unemployment. Historian [[C. L. Mowat]] called these laws "Socialism by the back door," and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.&lt;ref name = "Mowat43-46"&gt;[[C. L. Mowat|Mowat, C. L.]], ''Britain between the Wars: 1918–1940'' (1955) pp. 43–46&lt;/ref&gt;

====Housing ====
{{Further|Housing in the United Kingdom#History|Public housing in the United Kingdom}} 
The rapid expansion of housing was a major success story of the interwar years, standing in sharp contrast to the United States, where new housing construction practically collapsed after 1929. The total housing stock In England and Wales was 7.6 million in 1911; 8.0 million in 1921; 9.4 million in 1931; and 11.3 million in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William D. Rubinstein| authorlink = William D. Rubinstein|title=Twentieth-Century Britain: A Political History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8M0cBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122|year=2003|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influential [[Tudor Walters Report]] of 1918 set the standards for council house design and location for the next 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Swenarton, "Tudor Walters and Tudorbethan: reassessing Britain's inter-war suburbs." ''Planning perspectives'' 17.3 (2002): 267–286.&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended housing in short terraces, spaced at {{convert|70|ft}} at a density of 12 to the acre.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnett (historian)|John Burnett]], ''A Social History of Housing : 1815–1985'' (2nd ed. 1986) pp. 222–26.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1919]] Lloyd George set up a system of government housing that followed his 1918 campaign promises of "homes fit for heroes."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wilding, "The Housing and Town Planning Act 1919—A Study in the Making of Social Policy." ''Journal of Social Policy'' 2#4 (1973): 317-334.&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the "Addison Act," it required local authorities to survey their housing needs, and start building houses to replace slums. The treasury subsidized the low rents.&lt;ref&gt;John Burnett, ''A Social History of Housing : 1815–1985'' (1986) pp. 226-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Older women could now vote. Local politicians consulted with them and in response put more emphasis on such amenities as communal laundries, extra bedrooms, indoor lavatories, running hot water, separate parlours to demonstrate their respectability, and practical vegetable gardens rather than manicured lawns.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], ''We Danced All Night: A Social History of Britain Between the Wars'' (2009), pp. 60–62 &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [[Noreen Branson]], ''Britain in the Nineteen Twenties'' (1976) pp. 103–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Progress was not automatic, as shown by the troubles of rural Norfolk. Many dreams were shattered as local authorities had to renege on promises they could not fulfill due to undue haste, impossible national deadlines, debilitating bureaucracy, lack of lumber, rising costs, and the non-affordability of rents by the rural poor.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Martin, "Shattered hopes and unfulfilled dreams: council housing in rural Norfolk in the early 1920s, ''Local Historian'' (2005) 35#2 pp. 107–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales 214,000 multi-unit council buildings were built by 1939; the Ministry of Health became largely a ministry of housing.&lt;ref name = "Mowat43-46"/&gt; Council housing accounted for 10 percent of the housing stock in Britain by 1938, peaking at 32 percent in 1980, and dropping to 18 percent by 1996, where it held steady for the next two decades. &lt;ref&gt;[[Pat Thane]], ''Cassel's Companion to 20th Century Britain'' 2001) 195–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly the British ideal was home ownership, even among the working class. Rates of home ownership rose steadily from 15 percent before 1914, to 32 percent by 1938, and 67 percent by 1996. The construction industry sold the idea of home ownership to upscale renters. The mortgage lost its old stigma of a millstone round your neck to instead be seen as a smart long-term investment in suburbanized Britain. It appealed to aspirations of upward mobility and made possible the fastest rate of growth in working-class owner-occupation during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Scott, "Marketing mass home ownership and the creation of the modern working-class consumer in inter-war Britain." ''Business History'' 50#1 (2008): 4–25. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Mark Swenarton and Sandra Taylor. "The scale and nature of the growth of owner‐occupation in Britain between the wars." ''Economic History Review'' 38#3 (1985): 373-392.&lt;/ref&gt; The boom was largely financed by the savings ordinary Britons put into their [[building societies]]. Starting in the 1920s favourable tax policies encouraged substantial investment in the societies, creating huge reserves for lending. Beginning in 1927, the societies encouraged borrowing through gradual liberalization of mortgage terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Humphries]], "Inter-war house building, cheap money and building societies: The housing boom revisited." ''Business History'' 29.3 (1987): 325-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative control===
[[File:Stanley Baldwin ggbain.35233.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Stanley Baldwin]] was [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister between 1923–1924, 1924–1929 and 1935–1937.]]

The [[Lloyd George ministry]] fell apart in 1922, and [[Bonar Law]] became prime minister of a Conservative government. In May 1923 Bonar Law resigned because of ill health and was replaced by [[Stanley Baldwin]]. Baldwin, as leader of the Conservative Party (1923–37) and as Prime Minister (in 1923–24, 1924–29 and 1935–37), dominated British politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Ball]], "Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867–1947)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004; [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30550, online edn, January 2011] {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/30550}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the [[UK National Government|National Government]]. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|general election of 1935]] Baldwin's was the last government to win over 50% of the vote. Baldwin's political strategy was to polarize the electorate so that voters would choose between the Conservatives on the right and the Labour Party on the left, squeezing out the Liberals in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Taylor, "Stanley Baldwin, Heresthetics and the Realignment of British Politics," ''British Journal of Political Science,'' (July 2005), 35#3 pp. 429–63,&lt;/ref&gt; The polarization did take place and while the Liberals remained active under Lloyd George, they won few seats. Baldwin's reputation soared in the 1920s and 1930s, but crashed after 1940 as he was blamed for the appeasement policies toward Germany, and as Churchill was made the Conservative icon by his admirers. Since the 1970s Baldwin's reputation has recovered somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Williamson, "Baldwin's Reputation: Politics and History, 1937–1967," ''Historical Journal'' (March 2004) 47#1 pp. 127–68 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4091548 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Socialism Would Mean.jpg|thumb|right|1929 Conservative poster attacking the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]]]

Having won an election just the year before, Baldwin's Conservative party had a comfortable majority in the Commons and could have waited another four years, but the government was concerned. Baldwin felt the need to receive a new mandate from the people. Oxford historian (and Conservative MP) [[John Marriott (British politician)|J.A.R. Marriott]] depicts the gloomy national mood: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The times were still out of joint. Mr. Baldwin had indeed succeeded in negotiating (January 1923) a settlement of the British debt to the United States, but on terms which involved an annual payment of £34 million, at the existing rate of exchange. The French remained in the Ruhr. Peace had not yet been made with Turkey; unemployment was a standing menace to national recovery; there was continued unrest among the wage-earners, and a significant strike among farm labourers in Norfolk. Confronted by these difficulties, convinced that economic conditions in England called for a drastic change in fiscal policy, and urged thereto by the Imperial Conference of 1928, Mr. Baldwin decided to ask the country for a mandate for Preference and Protection.&lt;ref&gt; J. A. R. Marriott, ''Modern England: 1885–1945'' (4th ed. 1948) p. 517&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Doerr, ''British foreign policy 1919–1939'' (1998) p. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The result however backfired on Baldwin, who lost a host of seats to Labour and the Liberals. For the first time in history, Labour formed a government. However, in 1924 Baldwin and the Conservatives returned with a large majority. [[Ross McKibbin]] finds that the political culture of the interwar period was built around an anti-socialist middle class, supported by the Conservative leaders, especially Baldwin.&lt;ref&gt;Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914–1951'' (Oxford, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===King George V===
{{Main|King George V}}
King George V (reigned 1910–1936) was scandal free. He appeared hard working and became widely admired by the people of Britain and the Empire, as well as "[[The Establishment]]"&lt;ref&gt;John Gore, ''King George V: A Personal Memoir'' (1941) pp. x, 116&lt;/ref&gt;. It was George V who established the modern norm of conduct for British royalty, reflecting middle-class values and virtues rather than upper-class lifestyles or vices&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Harrison (historian)|Brian Harrison]], ''The Transformation of British Politics, 1860–1995'' (1996), 332&lt;/ref&gt;. Anti-intellectual and lacking the sophistication of his two royal predecessors, as well as their cosmopolitan experiences, he nevertheless understood the British Empire better than most of his ministers; indeed he explained, "it has always been my dream to identify myself with the great idea of Empire." &lt;ref&gt;Brian Harrison, ''The Transformation of British Politics, 1860–1995'' pp. 320, 337.&lt;/ref&gt; He used his exceptional memory for details and faces to good effect in small talk with commoners and officials&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Nicolson]], ''King George the Fifth: His Life and Reign'' (1952) p 474.&lt;/ref&gt;. He invariably wielded his influence as a force of neutrality and moderation, seeing his role as mediator rather than final decision maker. &lt;ref&gt;Brian Harrison, ''The Transformation of British Politics, 1860–1995'' pp. 51, 327&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in 1921 he had General [[Jan Smuts]] draft a speech calling for a compromise truce to end the [[Irish War of Independence#Truce: July–December 1921|Irish war of independence]] and secured cabinet approval; the Irish also agreed and the war ended.&lt;ref&gt; Francis Costello, "King George V's Speech at Stormont (1921): Prelude to the Anglo-Irish Truce." ''Éire-Ireland'' (1987) 22#3: 43–57. &lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] praises the king's initiative as, "perhaps the greatest service performed by a British monarch in modern times."&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. P. Taylor]], ''English History 1914–1945'' (1965) p. 157. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Rose, ''King George V'' (1984) pp. 237–40.&lt;/ref&gt; His transparent sense of duty, his loyalty, his impartiality, and his unfailing example of good taste inspired the people and discouraged politicians from manipulating him to their own advantage. King George V was by temperament a cautious and conservative man who never fully appreciated or approved the revolutionary changes underway in British society. Nevertheless, everyone understood that he was earnestly devoted to Britain and the British Commonwealth&lt;ref&gt;Harold Nicolson, ''King George the Fifth'' pp. 33, 141, 510, 517; John Gore, ''King George V'' (1941), p 293&lt;/ref&gt;.

The king's popularity was enhanced during the World War when he made more than a thousand visits to hospitals, factories, and military and naval installations. He thereby gave highly visible support to the morale of ordinary workers and servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miranda Carter]], "How to keep your crown." ''[[History Today]]'' 59.10 (2009): 5+.&lt;/ref&gt; His Silver Jubilee in 1935 became a national festival of fervent rejoicing, tinged with a few complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Robson, "Fervent rejoicing and muted protest: London at the time of King George V 's Silver Jubilee,"''Local Historian'' (2015), 45#2 pp. 143–157.&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral and following commemorations were elaborately staged, very well attended ceremonies that redefined the role of royalty in a newly democratic nation. The people had new ways to affirm their loyalties, such as close attention to live radio broadcasts and followup newsreels. New ceremonies born of the commemoration of death in the Great War included the two-minute silence. Britain set up living memorials to honour and expand the king's lifelong belief in the physical, moral and social benefits of recreation and sports. The royal death thereby acted to enhance a shared Britishness. The funeral of King George VI in 1952 followed the same formula. Thereby the monarchy grew stronger and, more importantly, national cohesion was built up in the era of total war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ina Zweiniger‐Bargielowska]], "Royal death and living memorials: the funerals and commemoration of George V and George VI, 1936–52." ''Historical Research'' 89.243 (2016): 158–175. &lt;/ref&gt;

The king was the most active monarch in many ways since George III (reigned 1760–1820). Biographer [[H. C. G. Matthew]] concludes:
:His was the busiest service of any nineteenth- or twentieth-century British monarch. He dealt with a remarkable and arduous series of crises: the reaction of the Unionists to the Parliament Bill and the home rule crisis, the complex coalition-forming of the First World War, the incorporation of the Labour Party into the working of constitutional government, the replacement of orthodox politics by a national government. George V's assiduous and non-partisan approach smoothed the process of political change which these crises represented.&lt;ref name = "ODNBGeorgeV"/&gt;

==Economics==
Taxes rose sharply during the war and never returned to their old levels. A rich man paid 8% of his income in taxes before the war, and about a third afterwards. Much of the money went on unemployment benefits. About 5% of the national income every year was transferred from the rich to the poor. [[A. J. P. Taylor]] argues most people "were enjoying a richer life than any previously known in the history of the world: longer holidays, shorter hours, higher real wages."&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (1965) p 176, quote on p 317&lt;/ref&gt;

The British economy was lacklustre in the 1920s, with sharp declines and high unemployment in heavy industry and coal, especially in Scotland and Wales. Exports of coal and steel halved by 1939 and the business community was slow to adopt the new labour and management principles coming from the US, such as [[Fordism]], consumer credit, eliminating surplus capacity, designing a more structured management, and using greater economies of scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garside | first1 = W.R. | last2 = Greaves | first2 = J.I. | year = 1997 | title = Rationalisation and Britain's industrial Malaise: The interwar years revisited | url = | journal = Journal of European Economic History | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 37–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For over a century the shipping industry had dominated world trade, but it remained in the doldrums despite various stimulus efforts by the government. With the very sharp decline in world trade after 1929, its condition became critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greaves | first1 = Julian | year = 2007 | title = Managing decline: The political economy of British shipping in the 1930s | url = | journal = Journal of Transport History | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 57–130 | doi=10.7227/tjth.28.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Winston Churchill]] put Britain back on the [[gold standard]] in 1925, which many economists blame for the mediocre performance of the economy. Others point to a variety of factors, including the inflationary effects of the World War and supply-side shocks caused by reduced working hours after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Solomos Solomou and Dimitris Vartis, "Effective Exchange Rates in Britain, 1920–1930," ''Journal of Economic History,'' (September 2005) 65#3 pp. 850–59 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3875020 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1920s, economic performance had stabilised, but the overall situation was disappointing, for Britain had fallen behind the United States as the leading industrial power. There also remained a strong economic divide between the north and south of England during this period, with the south of England and the Midlands fairly prosperous by the Thirties, while parts of south Wales and the industrial north of England became known as "distressed areas" due to particularly high rates of unemployment and poverty. Despite this, the standard of living continued to improve as local councils built [[Council house|new houses]] to let to families rehoused from outdated [[slum]]s, with up to date facilities including indoor toilets, bathrooms and electric lighting now being included in the new properties. The private sector enjoyed a housebuilding boom during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Unstead, "A Century of Change: 1837–Today"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour===
{{Further|Interwar unemployment and poverty in the United Kingdom}}
During the war, [[trade unions]] were encouraged and their membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918. They peaked at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;B.R. Mitchell, ''Abstract of British Historical Statistics'' (1962) p 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], ''[[Speak for Britain!: A New History of the Labour Party]]'' (2011) pp. 100–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On workers see Ross McKibbin, ''Classes and Cultures: England 1918–1951'' (2000) pp. 106–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal was a sick industry; the best seams were being exhausted, raising the cost. Demand fell as oil began replacing coal for fuel. The [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 general strike]] was a nine-day nationwide walkout of 1.3 million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, iron workers and steelworkers supporting the 1.2 million coal miners who had been locked out by the owners. The miners had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices.&lt;ref&gt;W. N. Medlicott, ''Contemporary England 1914–1964'', pp, 223–30&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. To support the miners the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC), an umbrella organization of all trades unions, called out certain critical unions. The hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued in operation using students and middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The Labour Party leaders did not approve and feared it would tar the party with the image of radicalism, for the [[Comintern]] in Moscow had sent instructions for Communists to aggressively promote the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history, for TUC leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]] considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, "The General Strike, 1926," ''Historical Journal'' (1977) 20#4 pp. 1001–12 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638422 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pugh | first1 = Martin | authorlink = Martin Pugh (author)|year = 2006 | title = The General Strike | url = | journal = [[History Today]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5| pages = 40–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union dues to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946. The coal industry used up the more accessible coal. As costs rose, output fell from 267 million tons in 1924 to 183 million in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;B.R. Mitchell, ''Abstract of British Historical Statistics'' (1962) pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour government nationalised the mines in 1947.

Starting in 1909, Liberals, led especially by Lloyd George, promoted the idea of a minimum wage for farm workers. Resistance from landowners was strong, but success was achieved by 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Alin Howkins and Nicola Verdon. "The state and the farm worker: the evolution of the minimum wage in agriculture in England and Wales, 1909–24." ''Agricultural history review'' 57.2 (2009): 257–274.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robin Gowers and Timothy J. Hatton, the impact In England and Wales was significant. They estimate that it raised wages for farm labourers by 15 per cent by 1929, and by more than 20 per cent in the 1930s. It reduced the employment of such labourers by 54,000 (6.5 per cent) in 1929 and 97,000 (13.3 per cent) in 1937. They argue, "The minimum wage lifted out of poverty many families of farm labourers who remained employed, but it significantly lowered the incomes of farmers, particularly during the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;Robin Gowers and Timothy J. Hatton,, "The origins and early impact of the minimum wage in agriculture." ''Economic History Review'' 50#1 (1997): 82–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
After the War many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. The shortage of servants was felt in the kitchen, but now instead of an experienced cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings the housewife could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed. Breakfast porridge from branded, more finely milled, oats could now be cooked in two minutes, not 20. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. Shops carried more bottled and canned goods and fresher meat, fish and vegetables. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choices, the 1920s saw many new kinds of foods--especially fruits--imported from around the world, along with better quality packaging and hygiene. Middle class households now had ice boxes or electric refrigerators, which made for better storage and the convenience of buying in larger quantities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]] and Alan Hodge, ''[[The Long Week-End: A Social History of Great Britain 1918–1939]]'' (1940) pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies in the Depression years documented that the average consumer ate better than before. [[Seebohm Rowntree]] reported that the "standard to workers in 1936 was about 30 percent higher than it was in 1899."&lt;ref&gt; [[Noreen Branson]] and [[Margot Heinemann]], ''Britain in the 1930's'' (1971) pp. 241–42.&lt;/ref&gt; The dairy industry was producing too much, and profits were too low. So the government used the [[Milk Marketing Board]] to give a guaranteed price to dairy farmers – a policy ridiculed by ''[[The Economist]]'' as the "economics of Bedlam."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; Food prices were low, but the advantage went overwhelmingly to the middle and upper classes, with the poorest third of the population suffering from sustained poor nutrition. Starvation was not a factor, but widespread hunger was. The deleterious effects on poor children were obvious to teachers. In 1934, the government began a program of charging school children a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny a day]] for a third of a pint of milk. This dramatically improved their nutrition, and the new demand kept up the wholesale price of milk paid to farmers. About half the nation's school children participated by 1936. Milk was distributed for free in the Second World War, and participation rose to 90 percent. Indeed, the rationing system of the wartime years sharply improved the nutrition of poorest third, together with their capacity for manual labour. &lt;ref&gt;Branson and Heinemann, ''Britain in the 1930's'' (1971) pp. 202–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Depression==
{{main article|Great Depression in the United Kingdom}}
The [[Great Depression]] originated on [[Wall Street]] in the United States in late 1929, and quickly spread to the rest of the world. The main impact of the economic slump was felt in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;John Stevenson and Chris Cook, ''The Slump: Britain in the Great Depression'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Germany, Canada and Australia, Britain had not experienced a boom in the 1920s, so the downturn was less severe and ended sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = H.W. | year = 1969 | title = The Economic Significance of the Depression in Britain | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 3–19 | jstor=259833 | doi=10.1177/002200946900400401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldwide crisis===
By summer 1931 the world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of £2½ million a day.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp. 379-385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Williams, "London and the 1931 financial crisis." ''Economic History Review'' 15.3 (1963): 513–528.&lt;/ref&gt; Credits of £25 million each from the [[Bank of France]] and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] and an issue of £15 million in fiduciary notes slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits by 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but the King insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition "[[National Government (United Kingdom)|National government]]." The Conservative and Liberal parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister of a largely Conservative coalition.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Mowat, ''Britain between the wars, 1918–1940'' (1955) pp. 386–412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean Glynn and John Oxborrow, ''Interwar Britain : a social and economic history'' (1976) pp. 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight of gold continued, however, and the Treasury finally was forced to abandon the gold standard in September 1931. Until now the government had religiously followed orthodox policies, which demanded balanced-budgets and the gold standard. Instead of the predicted disaster, cutting loose from gold proved a major advantage. Immediately the exchange rate of the pound fell by 25%, from $4.86 for one pound to $3.40. British exports were now much more competitive, which laid the ground for a gradual economic recovery. The worst was over.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dewey, ''War and progress: Britain 1914–1945'' (1997) 224–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diane B. Kunz, ''The battle for Britain's gold standard in 1931'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's world trade fell in half (1929–33); the output of heavy industry fell by a third. Employment and profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment.&lt;ref&gt;William Ashworth, ''An economic history of England, 1870–1939'' (2005) pp. 325-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The government tried to work inside the Commonwealth, raising tariffs for products from the United States, France and Britain, while giving preference to Commonwealth members.&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars,'' pp. 366–68, 415–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean Glynn and Alan Booth, ''Modern Britain: An economic and social history'' (1996) pp. 118–24, 138–40.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Organized protests===
The north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales suffered particularly severe economic problems, especially if they depended on coal, steel or shipbuilding. Unemployment reached 70% in some mining localities at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally). The government was cautious and conservative, rejecting the Keynesian proposal for large-scale public works projects.&lt;ref&gt;John Stevenson and Chris Cook, ''The Slump: Britain in the Great Depression'' (3rd ed. 1994) pp. 64–115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Doomsayers on the left such as [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], [[J. A. Hobson]], and [[G. D. H. Cole]] repeated the dire warnings they had been making for years about the imminent death of capitalism, only now far more people paid attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''Twilight Years,'' ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1935 the [[Left Book Club]] provided a new warning every month, and built up the credibility of Soviet-style socialism as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samuels | first1 = Stuart | year = 1966 | title = The Left Book Club | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 65–86 | jstor=259923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, by which time unemployment was lower, 200 unemployed men made a highly publicized march from [[Jarrow]] to London in a bid to show the plight of the industrial poor. Although much romanticized by the Left, the [[Jarrow Crusade]] marked a deep split in the Labour Party and resulted in no government action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perry | first1 = Matt | year = 2002 | title = The Jarrow Crusade's Return: The 'New Labour Party' of Jarrow and Ellen Wilkinson, M.P. | url = | journal = Northern History | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 265–78 | doi=10.1179/007817202790180576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment remained high until the war absorbed all the job seekers. [[George Orwell]]'s book ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' gives a bleak overview of the hardships of the time.

===Historiography===
The economic crisis of the early 1930s, and the response of the Labour and National governments to the depression, have generated much historical controversy. Apart from the major pockets of long-term high unemployment, Britain was generally prosperous. Historian [[Piers Brendon]] writes: "Historians, however, have long since revised this grim picture, presenting the devil's decade as the cradle of the affluent society. Prices fell sharply between the wars and average incomes rose by about a third. The term "property-owning democracy" was coined in the 1920s, and three million houses were built during the 1930s. Land, labour and materials were cheap: a bungalow could be purchased for £225 and a semi for £450. The middle class also bought [[radiogram (furniture)|radiogram]]s, telephones, [[three-piece suite]]s, electric cookers, vacuum cleaners and golf clubs. They ate [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]] ("never miss a day"), drove to [[Odeon cinema]]s in [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] (costing £135 by 1930) and smoked [[Craven A]] cigarettes, cork-tipped "to prevent sore throats". The depression spawned a consumer boom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/05/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview7|title=Review: A Social History of Britain Between the Wars by Martin Pugh|last=Brendon|first=Piers|date=5 July 2008|work=[[TheGuardian.com]]|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades immediately following the Second World War, most historical opinion was critical of the governments of the period. Some historians, such as [[Robert Skidelsky]] in his ''Politicians and the Slump'', compared the orthodox policies of the Labour and National governments unfavourably with the more radical proto-Keynesian measures advocated by [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Oswald Mosley]], and the more [[economic interventionism|interventionist]] and [[Keynesian]] responses in other economies: Franklin Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] in the United States, the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]] in New Zealand, and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic government]] in Sweden. Since the 1970s opinion has become less uniformly hostile. In the preface to the 1994 edition, Skidelsky argues that recent experience of currency crises and [[capital flight]] make it hard to be so critical of the politicians who wanted to achieve stability by cutting labour costs and defending the value of the currency.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Floud and D.N. McCloskey, eds. ''The economic history of Britain since 1700'' (2nd ed. 1994) vol 2 pp. 291–414.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the econometric debate see Michael Collins, "Unemployment in Interwar Britain: Still Searching for an Explanation," ''Journal of Political Economy'' 90#2 (1982): 369-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonwealth and Empire==
{{Further|British Empire|Historiography of the British Empire}}
After taking over the [[League of Nations mandate]]s on certain German and Ottoman territories in 1919, the British Empire reached its territorial peak. The interwar years saw extensive efforts for economic and educational development of the colonies. The [[Dominion|Dominions]] were prosperous and largely took care of themselves. By far the most troublesome areas for London were India and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt; [[Judith M. Brown]] and [[Wm. Roger Louis]], eds. ''[[The Oxford History of the British Empire]]: Volume IV: The Twentieth Century'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Knaplund, ed. ''Britain: commonwealth and empire, 1901–1955'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. Hancock]], ed., ''Survey of British Commonwealth Affairs. Volume 1 - Problems of Nationality 1918–1936'' (1937).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. N. Medlicott, ''Contemporary England 1914–1964'' (1967),  272–31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Empire 1921.png|thumb|400px|right|British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921]]

The Dominions (Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand) achieved virtual independence in foreign policy in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], though each depended heavily upon British naval protection.&lt;ref&gt;[[K. C. Wheare]], ''The Statute of Westminster, 1931'' (1933).&lt;/ref&gt; After 1931 trade policy favoured [[Imperial Preference]] with higher tariffs against the U.S. and all others outside the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Glickman, "The British imperial preference system." ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 61.3 (1947): 439–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1879563 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the forces of nationalism were now being organized by the [[Indian National Congress]], led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. India contributed significantly to victory in the World War, and was bitterly disappointed by the very limited benefits conferred in the [[Government of India Act 1919]]. &lt;ref&gt;Amales Tripathi, ''Indian National Congress and the Struggle for Freedom: 1885–1947'' (2014) ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt; British fears of German wartime plots or postwar Communism following the [[Ghadar Mutiny]] ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the [[Rowlatt Act]] of 1919 that suppressed dissent. Tensions escalated particularly in the [[Punjab region]], where repressive measures culminated in the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar Massacre]]. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Kim A. Wagner, "‘Calculated to Strike Terror’: The Amritsar Massacre and the Spectacle of Colonial Violence," ''Past and Present'' 233#1 (2016): 185–225.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi developed the technique of nonviolent resistance, claiming moral superiority over the British use of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Chabot, "The Gandhian Repertoire as Transformative Invention." ''International Journal of Hindu Studies'' 18.3 (2014): 327-367. &lt;/ref&gt; Multiple negotiations were held in the 1930s, but a strong reactionary movement in Britain, led by Winston Churchill, blocked the adoption of reforms that would satisfy Indian nationalists. Historian [[Lawrence James]] states:
:From 1930 to 1935 [Churchill] was a Cassandra, warning the country that the government's policy of allowing self-determination for India would be a catastrophe for Britain and mark the beginning of the end for her Empire. His language was stark and his imagery apocalyptic: India was facing a prolonged crisis which successive governments had failed to resolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence James| authorlink = Lawrence James|title=Churchill and Empire: A Portrait of an Imperialist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nR5bBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT164|year=2014|pages=179–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservatives in Parliament designed the [[Government of India Act, 1935]] to create a federation that would facilitate continued British control and deflect the challenge of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Muldoon, ''Empire, politics and the creation of the 1935 India Act: Last Act of the Raj'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party, although in a weak minority in the 1930s, gave support to Congress and worked with Indians in Britain; after 1945 it was in a position to grant India independence.&lt;ref&gt; Judith M. Brown, "India" in Judith M. Brown and Wm. Roger Louis, eds. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume IV: The Twentieth Century'' (1999) pp. 421–46. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of Egypt|Egypt]] was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, although under British rule, until 1914, when London declared it a protectorate. [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|Independence was formally granted in 1922]], though it continued to be a British [[client state]] until 1954. British troops remained stationed to guard the Suez Canal. Egypt joined the [[League of Nations]]. [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraq]], a British [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. Iraq remained under firm British guidance regarding foreign affairs, defence policy, and oil policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samira Haj|title=The Making of Iraq, 1900–1963: Capital, Power, and Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlmOh6gAGBAC&amp;pg=PA82|year=1997|publisher=SUNY Press|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The [[1917 Balfour Declaration]], which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine. Tens of thousands of Jews immigrated from Europe. The Arab population [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|revolted in 1936]]. As the prospect of war with Germany loomed larger, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Segev|title=One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvT8CWv2DakC&amp;pg=PA366|year=2001|pages=360–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominions control their foreign policies===
[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|left|[[George V]] with the British and Dominion prime ministers at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]]]]

As Britain's Prime Minister, Lloyd George requested military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the [[Chanak Crisis]] in [[Turkey]] in 1922. He was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Darwin, "The Chanak Crisis and the British Cabinet", ''History'' (1980) 65#213 pp 32–48. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-229X.1980.tb02082.x/full online]&lt;/ref&gt; The World War had greatly strengthened the sense of nationalism and self-confidence in the dominions. They were now independent members of the League of Nations, and refused to automatically follow requests from Britain's leaders. The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the [[1923 Imperial Conference]]. The [[1926 Imperial Conference]] issued the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], declaring the Dominions to be "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another" within a "[[British Commonwealth of Nations]]". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]. India, however, was denied dominion status and its foreign policy was set by London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Simone Panter-Brick|title=Gandhi and Nationalism: The Path to Indian Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LQA49n4Zo4C&amp;pg=PA165|year=2012|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] was overwhelmed by the economic disasters of the Great depression and voluntarily gave up its dominion status.

''Labour'' (1990) 26: 85–124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish Free State broke its ties with London with a [[Constitution of Ireland|new constitution]] in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Coakley|author2=Michael Gallagher|title=Politics in the Republic of Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g84ajJ-1Yi4C&amp;pg=PA75|year=2010|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign policy==
{{Further information|International relations (1919–1939)#Great Britain|Treaty of Versailles }}
Britain had suffered little physical devastation during the war but the cost in death and disability and money were very high. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|Khaki Election of 1918]], coming a month after the Allied victory over Germany, Lloyd George promised to impose a harsh treaty on Germany. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in early 1919, however, he took a much more moderate approach. France and Italy demanded and achieved harsh terms, including German admission of guilt for starting the war (which humiliated Germany), and a demand that Germany pay the entire Allied cost of the war, including veterans' benefits and interest. Britain reluctantly supported the [[Treaty of Versailles]], although many experts, most famously [[John Maynard Keynes]], thought it too harsh on Germany &lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret MacMillan]], "Making War, Making Peace: Versailles, 1919." ''Queen's Quarterly'' 121.1 (2014): 24-38. [https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Making+war,+making+peace%3A+Versailles,+1919.-a0132468532 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret MacMillan]], ''Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the World'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antony Lentin, ''Lloyd George and the lost peace: from Versailles to Hitler, 1919–1940'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Britain began to look on a restored Germany as an important trading partner and worried about the effect of reparations on the British economy. In the end the United States financed German debt payments to Britain, France and the other Allies through the [[Dawes Plan]], and Britain used this income to repay the loans it borrowed from the U.S. during the war.

Vivid memories of the horrors and deaths of the World War made Britain and its leaders strongly inclined to pacifism in the interwar era.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pugh, ''Liberal internationalism: the interwar movement for peace in Britain'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s===

Britain maintained close relationships with France and the United States, rejected isolationism, and sought world peace through naval arms limitation treaties,&lt;ref&gt;B. J. C. McKercher, "The politics of naval arms limitation in Britain in the 1920s." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 4#3 (1993): 35–59.&lt;/ref&gt; and peace with Germany through the [[Locarno treaties]] of 1925. A main goal was to restore Germany to a peaceful, prosperous state.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Magee, "‘Limited Liability’? Britain and the Treaty of Locarno." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 6.1 (1995): 1–22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With disarmament high on the agenda, Britain played a major role following the United States in the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921 in working toward naval disarmament of the major powers. By 1933 disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. O'Connor, "The 'Yardstick' and Naval Disarmament in the 1920's." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 45.3 (1958): 441–463. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889320 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Washington Conference Britain abandoned the [[Two power standard]] - her long-time policy of paramount naval strength equal to or greater than the next two naval powers combined. Instead it accepted equality with United States, and weakness in Asian waters relative to Japan. It promised to not strengthen the fortifications of Hong Kong, which were within range of Japan. The treaty with Japan was not renewed, But Japan at the time was not engaged in expansion activities of the sort that grew momentous from 1931 onward. London cut loose from Tokyo but moved much closer to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;W.N. Medlicott, ''British foreign policy since Versailles, 1919–1963'' (1968). pp. 18-31 &lt;/ref&gt;

Politically the coalition government of Prime Minister David Lloyd George depended primarily on Conservative Party support. He increasingly antagonized his supporters with foreign policy miscues. The [[Chanak Crisis]] of 1922 brought Britain to the brink of war with Turkey, but the [[Dominion]]s were opposed and the British military was hesitant, so peace was preserved. This was one of the factors causing Conservative MPs to vote, at the [[Carlton Club meeting]], to fight the next election as a separate party; Lloyd George then resigned as Prime Minister, ending the coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Laird, "Wars Averted: Chanak 1922, Burma 1945–47, Berlin 1948," ''Journal of Strategic Studies'' (1996) 19#3 pp. 343-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success at Locarno in handling the German question impelled Foreign Secretary [[Austen Chamberlain]], working with France and Italy, to find a master solution to the diplomatic problems of Eastern Europe and the Balkans. It proved impossible to overcome mutual antagonisms, because Chamberlain's programme was flawed by his misperceptions and fallacious judgments.&lt;ref&gt;Dragan Bakić, "'Must Will Peace': The British Brokering of 'Central European' and 'Balkan Locarno', 1925–9." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 48.1 (2013): 24–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s===
{{Further information|Appeasement|European foreign policy of the Chamberlain ministry}}
The great challenge came from dictators, first [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy from 1923, then from 1933 [[Adolf Hitler]] of a much more powerful [[Nazi Germany]]. Britain and France led the policy of non-interference in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39). The [[League of Nations]] proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to "appease" them in the hopes they would be satiated. League-authorized sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Ethiopia had support in Britain but proved a failure and were dropped in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Robertson, "The Origins of British Opposition to Mussolini over Ethiopia." ''Journal of British Studies'' 9#1 (1969): 122–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany was the difficult case. By 1930 British leaders and intellectuals largely agreed that all major powers shared the blame for war in 1914, and not Germany alone as the [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified. Therefore, they believed the punitive harshness of the Treaty of Versailles was unwarranted, and this view, adopted by politicians and the public, was largely responsible for supporting appeasement policies down to 1938. That is, German rejections of treaty provisions seemed justified.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Ann Cline, "British Historians and the Treaty of Versailles." ''Albion'' 20#1 (1988): 43–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coming of Second World War===
{{Further information|Causes of World War II|Diplomatic history of World War II}}
By late 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. British military leaders warned that Germany would win a war, and Britain needed another year or two to catch up in terms of aviation and air defence. [[Appeasement]] of Germany—giving in to its demands—was the government's policy until early 1939. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Faber (politician)|David Faber]], ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of satiation Hitler then seized the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and menaced Poland. In response Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] rejected further appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler unexpectedly [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|cut a deal]] with [[Joseph Stalin]] to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Cameron Watt]], ''How War Came: Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938–39'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
While the Church of England was historically identified with the upper classes, and with the rural gentry, [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]] (1881–1944) was both a prolific theologian and a social activist, preaching [[Christian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Hastings, "Temple, William (1881–1944)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004) https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/36454 &lt;/ref&gt; He served as bishop of Manchester and York, and in 1942 became Archbishop of Canturbury. He advocated a broad and inclusive membership in the Church of England as a means of continuing and expanding the church's position as the established church. Temple was troubled by the high degree of animosity inside, and between the leading religious groups in Britain. In the 1930s he promoted ecumenicism, working to establish better relationships with the Nonconformists, Jews and Catholics, managing in the process to overcome his anti-Catholic bias.&lt;ref&gt; Dianne Kirby, "Christian co-operation and the ecumenical ideal in the 1930s and 1940s." ''European Review of History'' 8.1 (2001): 37–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Iremonger, ''William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury: His Life and Letters'' (1948) [https://www.questia.com/library/65973200/william-temple-archbishop-of-canterbury-his-life pp. 387–425.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slow decline in religiosity===
Although the overall population was growing steadily, and the Catholic membership was keeping pace, the Protestants were slipping behind. Out of 30–50 million adults, they dropped slowly from 5.7 million members in 1920, and 5.4 million in 1940, to 4.3 million in 1970. &lt;ref&gt; McKibben pp. 273–65&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of England decline was parallel. Methodism, the largest of the Nonconformist churches reached a peak of 841,000 members in Great Britain in 1910, slipped to 802,000 in 1920, 792,000 in 1940 729,000 in 1960, and 488,000 in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;David Hempton, ''Methodism: Empire of the Spirit'' (2005). p 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nonconformists had built a strong base In industrial districts that specialized in mining textiles agriculture and fishing; those were declining industries, who share of the total male workforce Was in steady decline, from 21 percent in 1921 to 13 percent in 1951. As the families migrated to southern England, or to the suburbs, they often lost contact with their childhood religion.&lt;ref&gt; McKibben p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; The political reverberations were most serious for the Liberal Party, which was largely based in the nonconformist community, and which rapidly lost membership in the 1920s as its leadership quarreled, the Irish Catholics and many from the working-class moved to the Labour Party, and part of the middle class moved to the Conservative party.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Glaser, "English Nonconformity and the Decline of Liberalism," ''American Historical Review'' 63#2 (1958), pp. 352–363 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1849549 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to stem the membership decline, the three major Methodist groups merged in 1932. In Scotland the two major Presbyterian groups, the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church, merged in 1929 for the same reason. Nonetheless the steady declension continued.&lt;ref&gt; McKibben pp. 284–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The nonconformist churches showed not just a decline in membership but a dramatic fall in enthusiasm. Sunday school attendance plummeted; there were far fewer new ministers. Antagonism toward the Anglican church sharply declined, and many prominent nonconformists became Anglicans, including some leading ministers. There was a falling away in the size and fervour of congregations, less interest in funding missionaries, a decline in intellectualism, and persistent complaints about the lack of money.&lt;ref&gt; Adrian Hastings, ''A History of English Christianity: 1920–1985'' (1986) pp. 264–72 &lt;/ref&gt; Commentator [[Denis William Brogan|D.W. Brogan]] reported in 1943:
:in the generation that has passed since the great Liberal landslide of 1906, one of the greatest changes in the English religious and social landscape has been the decline of Nonconformity. Partly that decline has been due to the general weakening of the hold of Christianity on the English people, partly it is been due to the comparative irrelevance of the peculiarly Nonconformist (as a part from Christian) view of the contemporary world and its problems."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|author=Rupert E. Davies et al.|title=A History of the Methodist Church in Great Britain, Volume Three|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qQoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA309|year=2017|pages=309–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of the long-term decline in religiosity was that Protestant showed less and less interest in sending their children to religious schools. In localities across England, fierce battles were fought between the Nonconformists, Anglicans, and Catholics, each with their own school systems supported by taxes, and secular schools, and taxpayers. The Nonconformists had long taken the lead in fighting the Anglicans, who a century before had practically monopolized education. The Anglican share of the elementary school population fell from 57% in 1918 to 39% in 1939.&lt;ref&gt; David Parker, "'Stand Therefore!'—Bishop Michael Bolton Furse, the Diocese of St. Albans, and the Church Schools Controversy, 1919–1939." ''History of Education Quarterly'' 39#2 (1999): 161–192. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/370037 online]&lt;/ref&gt; With the sustained decline in Nonconformist enthusiasm their schools closed one after another. In 1902 the Methodist Church operated 738 schools; only 28 remained in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Smith, "Ecumenism, economic necessity and the disappearance of Methodist elementary schools in England in the twentieth century." ''History of Education'' (2010) 39#4 pp. 631–657. &lt;/ref&gt;

Britain continued to think of itself is a Christian country; there were a few atheists or nonbelievers, but unlike the continent, there was no anti-clericalism worthy of note. A third or more prayed every day. Large majorities used formal church services to mark birth, marriage and death.&lt;ref&gt; McKibben pp. 280–90.&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority believed in God and heaven, although belief in hell fell off after all the deaths of the World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N. T. Wright|title=Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5df9T6QJjMC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2008|publisher=HarperCollins|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1918, Church of England services stopped practically all discussion of hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Murray Parkes et al.|title=Death and Bereavement Across Cultures: 2nd edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkHLCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT221|year=2015|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prayer Book crisis===
{{Main|Book of Common Prayer}}
Parliament had governed the Church of England since 1688, but was increasingly eager to turn control over to the church itself. It passed the [[Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919]] to establish the Church Assembly, with three houses for bishops, clergy, and laity, and permitted it to legislate regulations for the Church, subject to formal approval of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lloyd, ''The Church of England in the 20th Century'' (1950) 2:5–18 &lt;/ref&gt;

A crisis suddenly emerged in 1927 over the Church's proposal to revise the classic ''Book of Common Prayer,'' which had been in daily use since 1662. The goal was to better incorporate moderate [[Anglo-Catholicism]] into the life of the Church. The bishops sought a more tolerant, comprehensive established Church. After internal debate the Church Assembly gave its approval. Evangelicals inside the Church, and Nonconformists outside, were outraged because they understood England's religious national identity to be emphatically Protestant and anti-Catholic. They denounced the revisions as a concession to ritualism and tolerance of Roman Catholicism. They mobilized support in parliament, which twice rejected the revisions after intensely heated debates. The Anglican hierarchy compromised in 1929, while strictly prohibiting extreme and Anglo-Catholic practices.&lt;ref&gt;G. I. T. Machin, "Parliament, the Church of England, and the Prayer Book Crisis, 1927–8." ''Parliamentary History'' 19.1 (2000): 131–147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John G. Maiden, "English Evangelicals, Protestant National Identity, and Anglican Prayer Book Revision, 1927–1928." ''Journal of Religious History'' 34#4 (2010): 430–445.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce and the abdication of the King=== 
Standards of morality in Britain changed dramatically after the world wars, in the direction of more personal freedom, especially in sexual matters. The Church tried to hold the line, and was especially concerned to stop the rapid trend toward divorce. In 1935 it reaffirmed that, "in no circumstances can Christian men or women re-marry during the lifetime of a wife or a husband."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Sumner Holmes|title=The Church of England and Divorce in the Twentieth Century: Legalism and Grace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CglDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Cosmo Lang]], held that the King, as the head of the Church of England, could not marry a divorcée.&lt;ref&gt;G. I. T. Machin, "Marriage and the Churches in the 1930s: Royal abdication and divorce reform, 1936–7." ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' 42.1 (1991): 68–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] objected vigorously, noting that "although it is true that standards are lower since the war it only leads people to expect a higher standard from their King."&lt;ref&gt; Holmes, p 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin was supported by his Conservative Party (except Churchill), as well as the Labour Party, and the prime ministers of the Commonwealth. King Edward VIII therefore was [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|forced to abdicate the throne in 1936]] when he insisted on marrying an American divorcée. Although public opinion gave him considerable support, elite opinion was hostile, and he was practically forced into exile. Archbishop Lang in a radio broadcast lashed out, blaming the upper-class social circles that Edward frequented:
: Even more strange and sad it is that he should have sought his happiness in a manner inconsistent with the Christian principles of marriage, and within a social circle whose standards and ways of life are alien to all the best instincts and traditions of the people....Let those who belong to this circle know that to-day they stand rebuked by the judgment of the nation which loved King Edward.&lt;ref&gt;McKibbin, ''Classes and Cultures'' p 279,&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward's biographer [[Philip Ziegler]] argues that Edward was poorly prepared to be King, because of deep personal weaknesses; he was inconsistent, superficial and incapable of resisting distractions, and handled the constitutional issues poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ziegler, ''King Edward VIII'' (1991) p. 560. &lt;/ref&gt; Frank Mort argues that cultural historians have read the abdication story not so much as a constitutional crisis, but as an indicator of:
:The ascendancy of a female ethos of domesticity and privacy....Intense interest in the King's affair ...[exemplified] this obsession with personal life, which was itself part of the media-fueled emotional character of the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Mort, "Love in a Cold Climate: letters, public opinion and monarchy in the 1936 abdication crisis." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 25.1 (2013): 30–62, quote on p 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Charmley]] argues in the history of the Conservative Party that Baldwin was pushing for more democracy, and less of an old aristocratic upper-class tone. Monarchy was to be a national foundation, whereby the head of the Church. the State, and the Empire, by drawing upon 1000 years of tradition, could unify the nation.  George V was an ideal fit: "an ordinary little man with the philistine tastes of most of his subjects, he could be presented as the archetypical English paterfamilias getting on with his duties without fuss." Charmley finds that George V and Baldwin, “made a formidable conservative team, with their ordinary, honest, English decency proving the first (and most effective) bulwark against revolution.” Edward VIII, flaunting his upper-class playboy style, suffered from an unstable neurotic character. He needed a strong stabilizing partner—a role Mrs. Simpson was unable to provide. Baldwin's final achievement was to smooth the way for Edward to abdicate in favor of his younger brother who became George VI. Father and son both demonstrated the value of a democratic king during the severe physical and psychological hardships of the world wars, and their tradition was carried on by Elizabeth II. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Charmley|title=A History of Conservative Politics Since 1830 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_AcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|year=2008|pages=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
===Newspapers===
After the war, the major newspapers engaged in a large-scale circulation race. The political parties, which long had sponsored their own papers, could not keep up, and one after another their outlets were sold or closed down.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen E. Koss]], ''The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain: The Twentieth Century'' (1984) 2:471–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Sales in the millions depended on popular stories, with a strong human interesting theme, as well as detailed sports reports with the latest scores. Serious news was a niche market and added very little to the circulation base. The niche was dominated by ''[[The Times]]'' and, to a lesser extent, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]].'' Consolidation was rampant, as local dailies were bought up and added to chains based in London. James Curran and [[Jean Seaton]] report:

: after the death of Lord Northcliffe in 1922, four men–Lords [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]] (1879–1964), [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Rothermere]] (1868–1940), [[William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose|Camrose]] (1879–1954) and [[Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley|Kemsley]] (1883–1968)–became the dominant figures in the inter-war press. In 1937, for instance, they owned nearly one in every two national and local daily papers sold in Britain, as well as one in every three Sunday papers that were sold. The combined circulation of all their newspapers amounted to over thirteen million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Curran|author2=Jean Seaton|title=Power Without Responsibility: Press, Broadcasting and the Internet in Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GM6OAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72|date= 2009|publisher=Routledge|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' of London was long the most influential prestige newspaper, although far from having the largest circulation. It gave far more attention to serious political and cultural news.&lt;ref&gt;Koss, ''The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain: The Twentieth Century'' (1984) 2:516–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, [[John Jacob Astor, 1st Baron Astor of Hever|John Jacob Astor]] (1886–1971), son of the [[William Waldorf Astor|1st Viscount Astor]] (1849–1919), bought ''The Times'' from the [[Alfred Harmsworth|Northcliffe estate]]. The paper advocated [[appeasement]] of Hitler's demands. Its editor [[Geoffrey Dawson]] was closely allied with Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]], and pushed hard for the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938. Candid news reports by [[Norman Ebbut]] from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy. In March 1939, however, it reversed course and called for urgent war preparations.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Martel, ed. ''The Times and Appeasement: The Journals of A L Kennedy, 1932–1939'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank McDonough, "The Times, Norman Ebbut and the Nazis, 1927-37." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 27#3 (1992): 407–424. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/260898 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanded leisure===
As leisure, literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the late 19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.&lt;ref name "Beck453-469&gt;Peter J. Beck, "Leisure and Sport in Britain." in Chris Wrigley, ed., ''A Companion to Early Twentieth-Century Britain'' (2008): pp. 453–469.&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking was differentiated by class. with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs. However, drinking as a way of spending leisure time and spare cash declined during the Depression and pub attendance never returned to 1930 levels; it fell far below prewar levels.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Haydon, ''The English pub: a history'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes were raised on beer, but there were more alternatives now at hand, such as cigarettes (which attracted 8/10 men, and 4/10 women), the talkies, the dance halls, and Greyhound racing. [[Football pools]] offered the excitement of betting on a range of results. New estates with small, inexpensive houses offered gardening as an outdoor recreation. Church attendance declined to half the level of 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Noreen Branson and Margot Heinemann, ''Britain in the 1930's'' (1971) pp. 269–70. &lt;/ref&gt;

The annual holiday became common. Tourists flocked to seaside resorts; [[Blackpool]] hosted 7 million visitors a year in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[[John K. Walton]], ''The English Seaside Resort. A social history 1750–1914'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Organized leisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for the average Englishman, and his interest in spectator sports increased dramatically. By the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages and genders in very large numbers, with young women taking the lead.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Walton, ''Leisure in Britain, 1780–1939'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class men were boisterous football spectators. They sang along at the music hall, [[Pigeon fancier|fancied their pigeons]], gambled on horse racing, and took the family to seaside resorts in summer. Political activists complained that working-class leisure diverted men away from revolutionary agitation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Beck, "Leisure and Sport in Britain." in Chris Wrigley, ed., ''A Companion to Early Twentieth-Century Britain'' (2008) p 457&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema and radio===
[[file:Hitchcock, Alfred 02.jpg|thumb|Film director Alfred Hitchcock, 1955]]
The British film industry emerged in the 1890s, and built heavily on the strong reputation of the London legitimate theatre for actors, directors, and producers.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Barr, ''All our yesterdays: 90 years of British cinema'' (British Film Institute, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amy Sargeant, ''British Cinema: A Critical History'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Richards, ''Age of the Dream Palace: Cinema &amp; Society in Britain 1930–1939'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was that the American market was so much larger and richer. It bought up the top talent, especially when Hollywood came to the fore in the 1920s and produced over 80 percent of the total world output. Efforts to fight back were futile — the government set a quota for British made films, but it failed. Hollywood furthermore dominated the lucrative Canadian and Australian markets. [[Bollywood]] (based in Bombay) dominated the huge Indian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walsh | first1 = Michael | year = 1997 | title = Fighting the American Invasion with Cricket, Roses, and Marmalade for Breakfast | url = | journal = Velvet Light Trap: A Critical Journal of Film &amp; Television | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 3–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent directors remaining in London were [[Alexander Korda]], an expatriate Hungarian, and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. There was a revival of creativity in the 1933–45 era, especially with the arrival of Jewish filmmakers and actors fleeing the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Gough-Yates, "Jews and exiles in British cinema." ''The Leo Baeck Institute Yearbook'' 37#.1 (1992): 517–541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Hochscherf, ''The Continental Connection: German-Speaking Émigrés and British Cinema, 1927–45'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 percent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 percent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918–1940'' (1955) pp. 246–50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKibbin, ''Classes and Cultures: England 1918–1951'' (2000) pp. 419–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In radio British audiences had no choice apart from the highbrow programming of the BBC, which had a monopoly on broadcasting. [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] (1889 – 1971), an intensely moralistic engineer, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast, "All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement.... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance."&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918–1940'' (1955) p 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue. There was no paid advertising on the BBC; all the revenue came from a licence fee charged for the possession of receivers. Highbrow audiences, however, greatly enjoyed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendy | first1 = David | year = 2013 | title = Painting with Sound: The Kaleidoscopic World of Lance Sieveking, a British Radio Modernist | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 169–200 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/hws021|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/40822/1/Hendy_-_Painting_with_Sound_2013_%283%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when American, Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball, rugby and ice-hockey, the BBC emphasized service for a national, rather than a regional audience. Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing, but the BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games, regardless of their popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Huggins, "BBC Radio and Sport 1922-39," ''Contemporary British History'' (2007) 21#4 pp. 491–515. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKibbin, ''Classes and Cultures: England 1918–1951'' (2000) pp. 457–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{main article|Sport in the United Kingdom}}
The British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, than any rival. &lt;ref&gt;Ross McKibbin, ''Classes and Cultures: England 1918–1951'' (2000) pp. 332–85.&lt;/ref&gt; They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play.&lt;ref name "Beck453-469/&gt; Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing. New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Birley, ''Land of sport and glory: Sport and British society, 1887–1910'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek Birley, ''Playing the Game: Sport and British Society, 1914–1945'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cricket had become well-established among the English upper class in the 18th century, and was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada. Cricket test matches (international) began by the 1870s; the most famous are those between Australia and Britain for [[The Ashes]].&lt;ref&gt;Derek Birley, ''A Social History of English Cricket'' (1999) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1781311765/ excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

For sports to become fully professionalized, coaching had to come first. It gradually professionalized in the Victorian era and the role was well established by 1914. In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Day, ''Professionals, Amateurs and Performance: Sports Coaching in England, 1789–1914'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reading===
As literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900 reading became a popular pastime. New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year by 1935. Libraries tripled their stock, and saw heavy demand for new fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cottle | first1 = Basil | year = 1978 | title = Popular Reading And Our Public Libraries: The Abjured Prescription | url = | journal = Library Review | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 222–227 | doi=10.1108/eb012677}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by [[Allen Lane]] (1902–70) at [[Penguin Books]] in 1935. The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheaply (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's. Penguin aimed at an educated middle class "middlebrow" audience. It avoided the downscale image of American paperbacks. The line signalled cultural self-improvement and political education. The more polemical Penguin Specials, typically with a leftist orientation for Labour readers, were widely distributed during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Joicey, "A Paperback Guide to Progress Penguin Books 1935–c. 1951." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 4#1 (1993): 25–56. [https://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/1/25.extract online]&lt;/ref&gt; However the war years caused a shortage of staff for publishers and book stores, and a severe shortage of rationed paper, worsened by the air raid on [[Paternoster Row]] in 1940 that burned 5 million books in warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McAleer, ''Popular Reading and Publishing in Britain: 1914–1950'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Romantic fiction was especially popular, with [[Mills and Boon]] the leading publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McAleer, ''Passion's fortune: the story of Mills &amp; Boon'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Humble, ''The Feminine Middlebrow Novel, 1920s to 1950s: Class, Domesticity, and Bohemianism'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alison Light]], ''Forever England: femininity, literature and conservatism between the wars'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by [[DC Thomson]]; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Sackville Turner]], ''Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al.'' (3rd ed. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; D.C. Thomson issued the first [[The Dandy|''The Dandy Comic'']] in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful. Thomson capitalized on its success with a similar product ''[[The Beano]]'' in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

[[Nana (title)|Nana]] '''Joseph Kwame Kyeretwie Boakye Danquah''', [[PhD]] (18 December 1895 &amp;ndash; 4 February 1965) was a [[Ghana]]ian [[politician|statesman]], [[pan-Africanist]], [[scholar]], [[lawyer]], [[historian]] and one of the founding fathers of Ghana. He played a significant role in pre- and post-colonial [[Ghana]], which was formerly the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], and in fact is credited with giving [[Ghana]] its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Joseph (Kwame Kyeretwie) Boakye Danquah - Researched by NiiCa|url=http://www.niica.on.ca/Ghana/jbdanquah.aspx|website=|publisher=Niica|accessdate=4 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909053337/http://www.niica.on.ca/Ghana/jbdanquah.aspx|archivedate=9 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his political career, Danquah was one of the primary opposition leaders to Ghanaian president and independence leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]]. J. B. Danquah was described as the "doyen of Gold Coast politics" by the Watson Commission of Inquiry into the [[1948 Accra riots]].&lt;ref name=GhanaNation /&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Danquah was born on 18 December 1895 in the Ghanaian town of [[Bepong, Ghana|Bepong]] in [[Kwahu East District|Kwahu]] in the [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|Eastern Region]] of [[Ghana]]. He was descended from the royal family of Ofori Panyin Fie, once the rulers of the Akyem states, and one of the most influential families in Ghanaian politics. His elder brother is [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta I]] and his son is actor [[Paul Danquah]].

At the age of six, Danquah began schooling at the Basel Mission School at [[Kyebi]]. He attended the Basel Mission Senior School at [[Begoro]]. On successful completion of his standard seven examinations in 1912, he was employed by Vidal J. Buckle, a barrister-at-law in Accra, as a clerk, a job which aroused his interest in law.

After passing the Civil Service Examinations in 1914, Danquah became a clerk at the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, which gave him the experience to be appointed by his brother, [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta I]], who had become chief two years earlier, as secretary of the [[Omanhene]]'s Tribunal in Kyebi.&lt;ref name=GhanaNation&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. J.B. Danquah (1895-1965)|url=http://articles.ghananation.com/articles/flagbearers-of-ghana/3016-dr-j-b-danquah-1895-1965.html|website=|publisher=Ghana Nation|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the influence of his brother, Danquah was appointed as the assistant secretary of the Conference of Paramount Chiefs of the Eastern Province, which was later given statutory recognition to become the Eastern Provincial Council of Chiefs. His brilliance influenced his brother to send him to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1921 to read law.

===London years===
After two unsuccessful attempts at the [[University of London]] matriculation, Danquah passed in 1922, enabling him to enter the [[University College of London]] as a philosophy student. He earned his B.A. degree in 1925, winning the John Stuart Mill Scholarship in the Philosophy of Mind and Logic. He then embarked on a Doctor of Philosophy degree, which he earned in two years with a thesis entitled "The Moral End as Moral Excellence". He became the first West African to obtain the Doctor of Philosophy degree from a British university.

While he worked on his thesis, he entered the [[Inner Temple]] and was called to the Bar in 1926. During his student days, he had two sons and two daughters by two different women, neither of whom he married. In London, Danquah took time off his studies to participate in student politics, serving as editor of the [[West African Students' Union]] (WASU) magazine and becoming the Union's president. 

===Return to the Gold Coast===

Danquah went into private legal practice upon his return to Ghana in 1927. In 1929 he helped [[J. E. Casely Hayford]] found the Gold Coast Youth Conference (GCYC) and was Secretary General from 1937 to 1947.&lt;ref name=Vibe&gt;Kwesi Atta Sakyi, [http://vibeghana.com/2013/01/17/tribute-to-j-b-danquah/ "Tribute to J.B. Danquah"], Vibe Ghana, 17 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, Danquah established ''The Times of West Africa'' originally called the ''West Africa Times'', which was the first daily newspaper in Ghana published between 1931 and 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Danquah|first1=Meri Nana-Ama|authorlink=Meri Nana-Ama Danquah|title=Ideals that last|url=http://www.graphic.com.gh/features/opinion/38232-ideals-that-last.html |accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=|location=Ghana|issue=|work=[[Daily Graphic (Ghana)|Graphic Online]]|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A column called "Women's Corner" was pseudonymously written by [[Mabel Dove]], daughter of prominent barrister Francis Dove. She became Danquah's first wife in 1933 bearing him a son.&lt;ref name=GhanaNation /&gt; Danquah later married Elizabeth Vardon.&lt;ref name=GhanaNation /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vibe /&gt;  In 1935, he became an executive member of the [[International African Friends of Ethiopia]], a Pan-Africanist organization based in London.  

===Path to Independence===

Danquah became a member of the Legislative Council in 1946 and actively pursued independence legislation for his country. In 1947 he helped to found the pro-independence [[United Gold Coast Convention]] (UGCC) as a combination of chiefs, academics and lawyers,&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham, David. ''Kwame Nkrumah: The Father of African Nationalism'' (revised edition), Ohio University Press, 1998, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[George Alfred Grant]], Robert Benjamin Blay, R. A. Awoonor-Williams, [[Edward Akufo-Addo]], and [[Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey]]. Kwame Nkrumah was invited to be the new party's general secretary. In 1948, following a boycott of European imports and subsequent rioting in Accra, Danquah was one of "the big six" (the others being Nkrumah, Akufo-Addo, Obetsebi-Lamptey, [[Ebenezer Ako-Adjei]] and [[William Ofori Atta]]) who were detained for a month by the colonial authorities.

Danquah's historical research led him to agree with Nkrumah's proposition that on independence the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] be renamed Ghana after the early [[Ghana Empire|African empire of that name]].&lt;ref name=Ency.WorldBiog&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/joseph-b-danquah/ "Joseph B. Danquah"], ''Encyclopaedia of World Biography''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Danquah and Nkrumah subsequently disagreed over the direction of the independence movement and parted ways after two years. Nkrumah went on to form the [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP) and eventually became the first president of independent Ghana.

===Arrest, detention and death===

Danquah stood as a presidential candidate against Nkrumah in April 1960 but lost the election. On 3 October 1961, Danquah was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act, on the grounds of involvement with alleged plans to subvert the CPP government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=167 "Dr. J. B. Danquah Profile:"], GhanaWeb.&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on 22 June 1962. He was later elected president of the [[Ghana Bar Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/J-B-Danquah "J.B. Danquah"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Danquah was again arrested on 8 January 1964, for allegedly being implicated in a plot against the President. He suffered a [[heart attack]] and died while in detention at Nsawam Medium Prison on 4 February 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cameron Duodu]], [http://cameronduodu.com/uncategorized/dr-j-b-danquahs-death-is-sticking-in-the-throats-of-some-people-like-a-dead-rat "Dr J B Danquah's death is sticking in the throats of some people like a dead rat"], ''Daily Guide'', 21 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the overthrow of the CPP government in February 1966 by the [[National Liberation Council]] (NLC), Danquah was given a national funeral and his status was rehabilitated.

===Literary output===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5312">'''Jinnahpur''' refers to an alleged plot in [[Pakistan]] to form a breakaway autonomous state to serve as a homeland for the [[Karachi]] based [[Urdu]]-speaking [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajir]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pakistan-cracks-showing-as-Mohajir-leader-appeals-to-UN-US-India-for-rescue/articleshow/48333750.cms|title=Pakistan cracks showing as Mohajir leader appeals to UN, US, India for rescue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Mohajirs are [[immigrants]] who came to Pakistan from India in the wake of the violence that followed the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.  The alleged name to be given to the proposed breakaway state was "Jinnahpur", named after [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]]. In 1992, the Pakistani military claimed it had found maps of the proposed Jinnahpur state in the offices of the [[Mohajir Qaumi Movement]] (now renamed [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]]), despite the party's strong denial of the authenticity of the maps. Despite the party's strong commitment to the Pakistani state, at that time government of [[Nawaz Sharif]] chose to use it as the basis for the military operation against the MQM, known as [[Operation Clean-up]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dObxI9xahSYC&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=jinnahpur&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The MQM of Pakistan: Between Political Party and Ethnic Movement], Mohammad Waseem, in Political parties in South Asia, ed. Mitra, Enskat &amp; Spiess, pp185&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2009, two senior military officers at the time (one of them Brigadier [[Imtiaz Billa]]) of the operation claimed that the maps had been fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/849392/retired-army-officers-absolve-mqm-of-jinnahpur-plot-altaf-calls-for-truth-and-reconciliation-commission Retired army officers absolve MQM of Jinnahpur plot: Altaf calls for truth and reconciliation commission], [[Dawn.com]], 25 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to them the Jinnahpur maps were false allegations and an attempt to divide the nation. Their stance was immediately challenged by Major (R) Nadeem Dar, then an [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] officer, who claimed to have recovered maps and related documents personally after raiding MQM headquarter and sent them to Major Haroon and Major Nadeem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Archives|first=Aaj News|title=Ex-ISI official says he has recovered Jinnahpur maps|url=http://www.aaj.tv/2009/08/ex-isi-official-says-he-has-recovered-jinnahpur-maps/|accessdate=13 December 2012|newspaper=Aaj|date=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Muhajir Sooba==

The Muhajir Sooba (literally meaning 'Immigrant Province') is a political movement which seeks to represent the [[Muhajir people]] of [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Altaf for 'Sindh One' and 'Sindh Two'|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1078561|accessdate=26 September 2014|agency=Dawn.com|date=Jan 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Z|first1=Ali|title=New province: Altaf Hussain kicks up a firestorm|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/654672/new-province-altaf-hussain-kicks-up-a-firestorm/|accessdate=26 September 2014|agency=The Express Tribune|date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept floated as a political bargaining tool by the leader of [[Muttahida Qaumi Movement]], Altaf Hussain for the creation of a Muhajir province for the Muhajir-majority areas of Sindh, which would be independent from Sindh government. The political deprivations of MQM became the major causes leading towards the demand of a separate province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Altaf threatens separate province for Urdu speaking Sindhis|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1078153|accessdate=26 September 2014|publisher=Dawn|date=Jan 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other names have been suggested by Altaf Hussain to refer to proposed new province such as Sindh 1 and Sindh 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4947">[[File:Bessel Gottfried 3.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Gottfried Bessel]]
'''Johann Franz Bessel''' (in religion Gottfried) (b. 5 September 1672, at [[Buchen]], in the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]; d. at [[Göttweig Abbey|Göttweig]], 22 January 1749) was a German [[Benedictine]] abbot and historian.

==Life==

He made his course in the humanities at [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Würzburg]], and [[Bamberg]], and in 1690 entered the [[University of Salzburg]], conducted by the Benedictines, where he specialized in philosophy, also attending lectures on theology and jurisprudence. He entered the Benedictine Order at Göttweig on the [[Danube]], [[Lower Austria]], 15 June 1692. After making his vows (21 June 1693), he completed his theological course at [[Vienna]], was ordained (21 March 1696), and on 23 May was granted the degree of Doctor of Theology, being shortly afterwards appointed Lector in philosophy and theology in the [[monastery of Seligenstadt]] on the [[River Main]].

In 1699 he was summoned to the electoral court of [[Mainz]] by Archbishop [[Lothar Franz von Schonborn]], who immediately sent him to Rome to study the curial practice of the [[Rota Romana]]. Having completed a two years' course in law, he obtained the degree of [[Doctor Juris Utriusque]], and on his return to Mainz (1703) he was appointed [[vicar general]] and supreme judge of the [[ecclesiastical court]] of the [[archdiocese of Mainz]]. He was also employed on various diplomatic missions, as, for instance, to the court of [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] in connection with the conversion of [[Duke Anton Ulrich]] and his granddaughter, the [[Princess Elisabeth Christine]], later the wife of [[Emperor Charles VI]].

He made three journeys to Rome to settle differences between the pope and the emperor concerning the limits of the [[province of Commacchio]]. On 7 February 1714, he was elected [[Abbot of Göttweig]], and from that time forward was commissioned by the emperor to conduct diplomatic negotiations, in addition to being made imperial theologian and serving twice as honorary rector of the University of Vienna.

Abbot Bessel was the second founder of Göttweig, which became, under his rule of thirty-five years, a centre of learning. He added to the rare Hebrew, Greek, and Roman coins and [[bracteate]]s collections of [[copper-plate engraving]]s (over 20,000), minerals, shells, and paintings. By the expenditure of princely sums he enriched the library with thousands of volumes, chiefly on historical subjects, as well as incunabula and MSS. Himself a thorough scholar, he encouraged among his religious all undertakings of a scientific or artistic nature. When the abbey was almost totally destroyed by fire, he gathered, by judicious management, means sufficient to rebuild it on a more splendid scale.

Personally, Abbot Bessel was a retiring religious, presenting to all a shining example of monastic piety and virtue.

[[Image:Chronicon Gotwicense.jpg|thumb|right|''Chronicon Gotwicense'' (1732), title page]]

==Works==

Besides several comparatively unimportant works, such as "Mararita pretiosa", "Curiae Romanae praxis", and "Austriae ritus", he published (Vienna, 1732) two letters of [[Augustine of Hippo]] to [[Optatus]], [[Bishop of Mileve]], which had been until then unknown. He is erroneously credited with the authorship of "Quinquaginta Romano-catholicam fidem omnibus aliis praeferendi motiva" (Mainz, 1708), a controversial work written originally in Latin, but translated into almost every European tongue.

The work which brought him lasting renown and a place in the records of the science of history is entitled ''Chronicon Gottwicense, tomus prodromus'' (Tegernsee, 1732). Not, as might be thought, a history of the abbey, this single volume is a comprehensive work on German [[diplomatics]], treating of manuscripts found in registers and archives, original documentary evidence, diplomas of German emperors and kings, and inscriptions and seals, illustrated with maps and engravings on copper. The author also discusses medieval geography, as well as the royal palace-domains (Pfalzen) and the various districts of Germany. Great learning and clear critical acumen distinguish this work, which marked an epoch in the history of German diplomatics, and has served as the basis of all later works on the same subject.

'''José Mariano de la Cruz de la Riva Agüero y Sánchez Boquete''' Marquess De Montealegre de Aulestia (3 May 1783&amp;nbsp;– 21 May 1858) was a soldier, politician, and historian who served as the 1st [[President of Peru]] and 2nd President of [[North Peru]]. He was the first Head of State who had the title of President of the Republic.

He wanted to finish the Peruvian independence process only by Peruvians' own efforts organized by the Segunda Campaña de Intermedios, but failed. His disagreements with Congress and Bolivar's Arrival determined en end of his mandate and his deportation, first to [[Guayaquil]] and then to Europe, where he lived until he came back to America in 1828. He went first to Chile and then returned to Peru in 1833 and was elected deputy to a Convention that reincorporated him in the army with the title of Grand Marshal.

Supporter of President [[Luis José de Orbegoso]], he was plenipotentiary minister in Chile and President of the Nor Peruvian State in the [[Peru–Bolivian Confederation|Peru-Bolivian Confederation]]. After the end of that political entity, he went again to Ecuador in 1843.

== Early life and political career ==
Riva Agüero was son of José De la Riva Agüero y Basso della Rovere, a Spanish aristocrat of Italian origin, member of the [[Della Rovere]] family, and the criolla María Josefa Sánchez Boquete Román de Aulestia Marquess De Montealegre de Aulestia, and married the Belgian princess [[House of Looz-Corswarem|Caroline Arnoldine de Looz -Corswarem]]. He inherited from his mother's family the title of Marquess of Montealegre de Aulestia and was baptized in the parish of San Marcelo of Lima in 1784.

He spent his childhood and youth in Spain, where he was educated and later participated in the wars against the [[Napoleon]]ic invasion. He moved to France for a time and then, when he was back in Madrid, was awarded with La Orden of Carlos III (1807). Moved by the nationalist ardor caused by the Napoleonic invasion in 1808, he enlisted in the Spanish army and participated in some early actions against the French in Guipúzcoa, Burgos and Córdoba.

During his brief military experience, he was awarded and recognized by the Spanish Royal Crown because of the courage showed in a campaign where he saved the lives of 10 comrades after the mission's General was shot to death. In 1809, he returned to Lima and participated in the independence cause. [[José de San Martín]] named him prefect of Lima in 1822. Upon the departure of San Martín and the ensuing social instability in the country, [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]] revolted against the Peruvian Congress on February 26, 1823 and forced it to elect Riva Agüero as President. Riva Agüero proclaimed himself "President of Peru", the first to use such title.

During his short government, he suffered the entry of Spanish troops into the capital and the departure of the government towards a new installation at the port of [[Callao]]. Under this situation, Riva Agüero lost all support of the Peruvian Congress, which awaited anxiously the arrival of [[Simón Bolívar]]. He was later deposed by [[Antonio José de Sucre]]. Sucre was succeeded by [[José Bernardo de Torre Tagle]] until the arrival of Simón Bolívar. Congress had been waiting for the [[Venezuela]]n "Liberator" to come to Peru and help to consolidate the Independence of the country, and was more than willing to grant him all necessary powers.

Fearing the loss of leadership, Riva Agüero sought to conciliate with the [[Viceroy]] to prevent the arrival of Bolívar, only to be arrested and accused of high treason. He was subsequently exiled to [[Chile]]. There he wrote the ''Memorias y documentos para la Historia de la Independencia del Perú y causas del mal éxito que ha tenido ésta'' (Memories and documents for the history of the independence of Peru and causes for its failure so far), one of the most important sources for the period.

During the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] Riva Agüero supported Mariscal [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]], and became president of the Republic of [[North Peru]] in 1838. After its collapse, he retired from public life until his death in 1858.

He had five children with Caroline-Arnoldine de Looz-Corswarem. His eldest son was [[José de la Riva-Agüero y Looz-Corswarem]].

== Conspiracy in Lima ==
[[File:Portada de la Manifestación histórica y política de la revolución de América.jpg|thumb|Cover page of ''Manifestación histórica y política de la revolución de América''.]]
During his time in Spain, he joined an American lodge that worked for the independence of America. He came back to Peru after he was appointed as accountant and conservative judge in the area of luck and lotteries in the Tribunal Mayor de Cuentas de Lima (1810), returned to Peru, via [[Buenos Aires]], decided to support the independence movement. During his trip, he avoided harassment from the authorities: he was briefly arrested in [[Montevideo]] but; in Buenos Aires, he had to flee furtively after realizing that they were going to return him to Spain. Something similar happened in the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]].

Already established in [[Lima]], he was associated with various groups of patriots and maintained active correspondence with those of Chile and Buenos Aires, which had already been installed Governing Boards. He ran Lima's Lodge from home, located at Santa Teresa (now fifth block of Jirón Puno) or the house of the Count of Vega del Ren, in the street of Botica San Pedro (now fourth block of Jirón Miró Quesada). He was involved in almost all Lima conspiracies, which were closely monitored by the authorities and eventually persecuted. However,  the intervention of powerful friends and relatives saved him.

In 1816 he wrote a ''Manifestación histórica y política de la revolución de América'', published anonymously in Buenos Aires in 1818 in which he exposed twenty causes justifying the insurgency against the colonial regime.

== Contact with San Martín ==
Riva Agüero was then in intensive contacts with José de San Martín, who after securing the independence of Chile planned to go to Peru. He sent valuable data on the situation of the royalist forces and helped define the plan of operations of the Army of the Andes to attack the central coast of Peru to penetrate the Alto Peru. For all these reasons, the figure of Riva Agüero was instrumental in achieving the emancipation of Spanish America.

At that time, a messenger of San Martin  was captured with correspondence that was addressed to Riva Agüero and other Lima patriots in April 1819. The Viceroy [[Joaquín de la Pezuela, 1st Marquis of Viluma|Joaquín de la Pezuela]] then ordered the confinement of Riva Agüero in [[Tarma]] (central highlands of Peru) while preparing a boat to take him to Spain, but the legal appeal and the disruption caused by the arrival of San Martin during his [[Expedición Libertadora del Perú|Freedom Expedition]] led such a severe measure to be abandoned.

Even in such conflict, Riva Agüero continued laboring for the cause of independence, convincing many officers to desert the royal troops. Indeed, he was one of those who influenced over Numancia Battalion's celebrated change to the patriot ranks. Similarly, he promoted the guerrilla organization to sever accesses in Lima. He also helped to produce the schism and disagreement among the Spanish generals themselves and help to infiltrate the royal army with double agents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2856">'''Knut Einar Eriksen''' (born 31 July 1944) is a Norwegian historian.

He was born in [[Sarpsborg]], and took the [[cand.philol.]] degree in 1969. He was an [[associate professor]] at the [[University of Tromsø]] from 1975 to 1982, and a professor from 1982 to 1986. In 1989 he was appointed as a professor at the [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Knut Einar Eriksen|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|first=Tor Ragnar|last=Weidling|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Knut_Einar_Eriksen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26848/artikkel/vis.html?tid=27637|title=Gruppe 1: Historie|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1988 to 1990 he chaired the [[Norwegian Historical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|title=Historikk|publisher=[[Norwegian Historical Association]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his most important publications is ''DNA og NATO. Striden om norsk NATO-medlemskap innen regjeringspartiet 1948–49'', which was released in 1972 and explores objections to [[NATO]] membership within the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] (DNA). In 1987 he wrote ''Frigjøring'', volume eight of the [[World War II]] work ''Norge i krig'', with Terje Halvorsen. In 1998 he released a two-volume history on surveillance in Norway, ''Den hemmelige krigen: overvåking i Norge 1914–1997'', together with [[Trond Bergh]].&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

With the publication of the latter work he became involved in an unusual case. Former secretary of the [[Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs]] [[Haakon Bingen]] sued Eriksen and Bergh as well as the publishing house [[Cappelen Akademisk Forlag]], because the second volume of ''Den hemmelige krigen'' contained information that portrayed Bingen as a close friend of communist [[Peder Furubotn]]. In late 1999 the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] found that this was not true, and circulation of the book was forbidden, until the reference to Bingen had been amended. Bingen was also awarded {{NOK|146,975}} in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bingen vant mot forlag i Høyesterett|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=2 December 1999|page=6|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucas Bolsius''' (born 16 December 1958 in [[The Hague]], [[South Holland]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[historian]] and politician of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and since 31 August 2010 mayor of the city of [[Amersfoort]].

Bolsius studied [[social history]] at [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. He was a member of the [[States of South Holland]] for the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] between 1995 and 1998.

'''''My Soul Is Rested: Movement Days in the Deep South Remembered''''' is a book of [[oral history]] regarding the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] by journalist [[Howell Raines]]. It is based on interviews with people involved in — for and against — the struggle to end racial segregation in the [[American South]] from the time of the 1955 [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] to the 1968 assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

==Author's notes==

Raines began his research for this book while the political editor for the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]''. In February 1974, while looking at a statue of Georgian populist [[Thomas E. Watson]] from his office window, he pondered recent indications that Watson's dream of a Southern politics that did not pander to racial hatred might be at hand. He felt that the story of sacrifice and courage that had led to these changes needed to be more completely told by the people who lived it.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Raines 1977. "Introduction", pp 17-24&lt;/ref&gt;

As a journalist in Atlanta, Raines already had access to members of the movement who had since become prominent politicians in the South. As he conducted interviews he obtained from the interviewees names and contact information for others who should be included. His southern heritage also helped to obtain interviews with people who had fought racial desegregation.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

All but two of the interviews included were expressly conducted for this book between October 1974 and April 1976. The interview with [[Autherine Lucy]] was conducted by Culpepper Clark, a historian at the University of Alabama. The material from [[Martin Luther King, Sr.]] was excerpted from in interview conducted by the author for a television program on [[PBS]] station [[KETV]] in Atlanta.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

The book took nineteen months to complete. In the meantime Raines had left the ''Constitution'' to work on it.&lt;ref name="Cutler1978"&gt;Cutler 1978, "'My Soul is Rested' Stirs Unrest In Marketing"&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it was published he had become the political editor at the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''.

==Reception==

Columnist [[Anthony Lewis]] reviewed the book for the ''[[New York Times]]'' in October 1977. He summarized his personal reaction to the book as follows: "Every so often a book is so touching, so exhilarating that one laughs and murmurs and cries out while reading, wanting to tell others about it. ''My Soul Is Rested'' is like that." While discussing the impact of the book, he wrote: "Indeed, the power of ''My Soul Is Rested'' lies in part in its recalling for us what the South was like when the Movement started. Nowadays, when the problems of race relations are more complicated both morally and legally, too many people forget the cruelties that blacks have suffered in this country."&lt;ref name="nytreview"&gt;Lewis 1977, ''New York Times'' review "A Right to Have a Coke", 23 October 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the book was published Raines heard from friends in Atlanta and the American Southeast that they were having difficulties obtaining copies of the book. He later learned through Charles Haslam, president of the American Booksellers Association, that G.P. Putnam's regional salesman for the Southeast was making negative presentations of the book with racial overtones. Raines began to pursue the issue with [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]] department store, a major book distributor in Atlanta. Rich's chief book buyer, Faith Brunson, said that they would order only a few copies of the book because people were not interested in it except for Julian Bond and a few of ''those'' people. In a 1978 interview with Bill Cutler, Raines speculated that the buyers at Rich's may have held personal antipathy to the subject matter of the book, as one of the major sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement had occurred at Rich's, which was then defending segregation.&lt;ref name="Cutler1978" /&gt;

The '''Philip Taft Labor History Book Award''' is sponsored by the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] in cooperation with the [[Labor and Working-Class History Association]] for books relating to [[labor history of the United States]]. Labor history is considered "in a broad sense to include the history of workers (free and unfree, organized and unorganized), their institutions, and their workplaces, as well as the broader historical trends that have shaped working-class life, including but not limited to: immigration, slavery, community, the state, race, gender, and ethnicity." The award is named after the noted labor historian [[Philip Taft]] (1902–1976).

==Life==
Bizzarri was born at [[Sassoferrato]] in [[Umbria]]; or, according to some writers, at [[Perugia]], and so is sometimes called '''Petrus Perusius'''. When young he went to [[Venice]], but having become a [[Protestant]] he left for Germany, in 1545. After the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] (1547) he moved on to England, where he spent periods his life.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Bizari, Pietro|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 July 1549 Bizzarri was admitted a Fellow of [[St John's College, Cambridge]], by the royal commissioners for the visitation of the university, being incorporated there [[ad eundem]]; and [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford|Francis Russell]] became his patron. The accession of Queen Mary saw him leave England; he returned on the accession of Elizabeth I.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Bishop [[John Jewel]], prompted by Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]], gave Bizzari the prebend of Alton Pancras in [[Salisbury Cathedral]]. This followed the presentation to the queen of his ''De principe tractatus''.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Meanwhile Russell had become governor of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]]. Bizzarri went north with him. He presented [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] with a different treatise, and shortly went abroad.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;

Not receiving further church preferment, Bizzarri began to travel. He obtained, in 1570, a license from [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] to go abroad, to print his own works, and gather news of foreign affairs for the government. He passed some time at [[Genoa]]; in Germany he obtained, through the influence of [[Hubert Languet]], employment with the [[Elector of Saxony]]. On 20 October 1573 he addressed from Augsburg a letter in Italian to Cecil, now Lord Burghley. He went on to [[Antwerp]], where he met the scholarly circle around [[Christopher Plantin]]. In 1581 he asked [[Justus Lipsius]] in [[Leyden]] to find a publisher of his "Universal History" in eight volumes. He was back in Antwerp in December 1583; on 23 November 1586 he addressed a Latin letter from [[The Hague]] to Burghley.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Bizzari is thought to have died soon after November 1586.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;

==Works==
Bizzarri's works are:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''Varia Opuscula'', Venice (Aldus), 1565. Dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. This work is divided into two parts, the first of declamations in the manner of the ancient rhetoricians, the second of poems, some of which are reprinted in [[Gherus]]'s ''Delitiæ 200 Italorum Poetarum'', and in ''Carmina illustrium Poetarum Italicorum''. [[Jeremiah Holmes Wiffen]], in his memoirs of the house of Russell, gave English metrical versions of two short poems addressed to members of that family.
* ''Historia della guerra fatta in Ungheria dall' inuittissimo Imperatore de' Christiani, contra quello de' Turchi: con la Narratione di tutte quelle cose che sono auuenute in Europa, dall' anno 1564, insino all' anno 1568'', Lyon, 1568, and, with a slightly different title, 1569. A Latin translation by the author himself was printed as ''Pannonicum Bellum, sub Maximiliano II Rom. et Solymano Turcarum Imperatoribus gestum: cumque Arcis Sigethi expugnatione, iam pridem magna cura et studio descriptum. Vnà cum Epitome illarum rerum quæ in Europa insigniores gestae sunt: et præsertim de Belgarum motibus, ab anno LXIIII usque ad LXXIII'', Basle, 1573. The first treatise in this volume was included by [[Jacques Bongars]] in his ''Rerum Hungaricarum Scriptores varii'', Frankfort, 1600, and by Matthew Bell in his reprint, Vienna, 1746. 
* ''Cyprium Bellum inter Venetos et Selymum, Turcarum imperatorem, gestum'', Basle, 1573. A French translation appeared as ''Histoire de la Guerre qui s'est passée entre les Venitiens et la saincte Ligue contre les Turcs, pour l'Isle de Cypre, ès années 1570, 1571, &amp; 1572, mise en Francoys par F. de Belleforest'', Paris, 1573.
* ''Senatus Populiq. Geneuensis Rerum domi, forisque, gestarum Historiæ atque Annales: cum luculenta variarum rerum cognitione dignissimarum, quæ diversis temporibus, &amp; potissimùm hac nostra tempestate contigerunt, enarratione'', Antwerp, 1579. [[Grævius]] printed two pieces from this work in the first volume of his ''Thesaurus Antiquitat. Italicar.''
* ''Rerum Persicarum historia, initia gentis, resque gestas ad hæc usque tempora complectens: accedunt varia opuscula diversorum scriptorum ad historiam Persicam recentiorem spectantia'', Antwerp, 1583; Frankfort, 1601. The Frankfort edition contains some opuscula not to be found in the other. 
* "Universal History", manuscript in 8 vols. 
* ''De Principe tractatus; ad reginam Elizabetham'', [[Royal manuscripts, British Library]] 12 ''a'', 48. This differs slightly from the printed treatise "De optimo principe" in the ''Varia Opuscula''. The dedication of the manuscript is dated 5 December 1561.

Bizzarri also brought out a new edition of ''La Santa Comedia'' of [[Mario Cardoini]], Venice, 1566.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Roy Martin Haines''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|FRHistS|FSA}} (1924/5 – 1 February 2017) was a British historian.

==Early life==
Haines was the son of Evan George Martin Haines, who served in the [[Welsh Guards]] during [[World War I]] and died in 1929 aged 32 from an illness attributable to his military service.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''Archbishop John Stratford'', p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Sarah Hilda Haines, {{née}} Hall, for more than a quarter of a century the highly respected [[district nurse]] and midwife in [[Catshill]], near [[Bromsgrove]]: she received the [[Royal Maundy]] in 1980 at Worcester.

Between 1932 and 1938 Haines was a pupil at [[St Michael's Preparatory School, Otford]].&lt;ref&gt;Sally Maria Jones, ''St Michael's School, Otford: Recollections, Observations, and Celebrations: The Story of St Michael's School, Otford, since its Foundation in Hatcham, New Cross, in 1872'' (Sevenoaks: Amherst, 2004), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended [[Bromsgrove School]], which he entered in 1938 as a foundation scholar.

Haines was later educated at [[St Chad's College, Durham|St Chad's College]] in the [[University of Durham]] (Gisborne Scholar 1943), where he was admitted to the degrees of BA, [[Master of Arts|MA]], and MLitt (1954)&lt;ref&gt;Haines, 'Bishop Bransford' (University of Durham MLitt dissertation, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; (supervised by Professor H.S. Offler),&lt;ref&gt;Haines, 'Editor's Acknowledgements', ''A Calendar of the Register of Wolstan de Bransford''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''Ecclesia Anglicana'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and received a [[Qualified Teacher Status|Diploma in Education]]. While at Durham Haines came into contact with Professor Alexander Hamilton Thompson, whose scholarship was to remain an abiding influence.

==Career==
Haines returned to his former prep school, St Michael's, as a master from 1947 until 1954. He was responsible for establishing a termly newsletter and later became Chairman of the Old Michaelian Association. Kendall Carey, a pupil at St Michael's from 1949 until 1956, described Haines as "a superb teacher". In addition to the standard curriculum Haines taught heraldry, architecture, and medieval battles, and demonstrated [[motte-and-bailey]] castles with sand and matchsticks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sally Maria |last=Jones |title=St Michael's School, Otford: Recollections, Observations, and Celebrations: The Story of St Michael's School, Otford, since its Foundation in Hatcham, New Cross, in 1872 |place=Sevenoaks |publisher=Amherst |year=2004 |pages=182, 152–3, 156, 134 }}; cf. Haines, ''Ecclesia Anglicana'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently studied at [[Worcester College, Oxford]], with the help of a grant from the Chance Educational Trust, eventually gaining a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] (1959).&lt;ref&gt;Haines, "The Administration of the Diocese of Worcester in the First Half of the Fourteenth Century" (University of Oxford DPhil thesis, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his publications were successfully submitted in 2010 for the degree of [[Doctor of Letters|DLitt]] of the [[University of Oxford]].

Haines was a history master at [[Westminster School]],&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''The Administration of the Diocese of Worcester'', p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''A Calendar of the Register of Wolstan de Bransford'' (title page).&lt;/ref&gt; where he was later promoted to [[housemaster]] of [[Westminster School#Houses|Wren's]].&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''Ecclesia Anglicana'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also Assistant Editor of the ''[[Victoria County History|Victoria County History of Oxfordshire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''Ecclesia Anglicana'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haines moved to Canada in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;"Call to Canada", ''[[Evening Standard]]'' (15 June 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; first to Mount Allison University, New Brunswick, and then in 1967 to [[Dalhousie University]] .&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''Ecclesia Anglicana'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; He later became Professor of Medieval History at Dalhousie.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''Calendar of the Register of Simon de Montacute'', p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978–80 Haines was [[Canada Council]] [[The Killam Trusts|Killam]] Senior Research Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''Archbishop John Stratford'', p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.killamtrusts.ca/awardwinners.asp?keywords=Roy&amp;search=1 The Killam Trusts.]&lt;/ref&gt; He spent part of the time at the [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican Archives]]. In 1987/8 he was Visiting Fellow of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge]], and was appointed a life member of the college in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''King Edward II'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haines was a [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]] (elected 2 March 1967)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sal.org.uk/history/listoffellows/?letter=H List of Fellows, Society of Antiquaries of London.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003032229/http://www.sal.org.uk/history/listoffellows/?letter=H |date=3 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Royal Historical Society]]. In 1987 he delivered the Bertie Wilkinson Memorial Lecture at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''King Edward II'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After retiring from [[Dalhousie University|Dalhousie]] Haines returned to the United Kingdom, where he lived in [[Putney]] before moving to [[Curry Rivel]] in Somerset.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''King Edward II'', p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 1 February 2017, at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us6.campaign-archive1.com/?u=5557bc147d34993782f185bde&amp;id=a20b333bcb#mctoc11 |title=Fellows Remembered: Roy Martin Haines |work=Salon |publisher=Society of Archivists of London |date=4 April 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1957 Haines married Carol Pamela Mary {{née}} Dight, an Oxford M.A., and daughter of the late F. H. Dight O.B.E., a meteorologist.

He was the father-in-law of Alexander Jones, [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]], Professor of the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity at the [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]] and Professor of Mathematics at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]], both at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;Haines, ''King Edward II'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1803">The '''September 11th Fund''' was created by the New York Community Trust &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycommunitytrust.org HOME - New York Community Trust&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Way of New York City&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedwaynyc.org United Way of New York City&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the destruction of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] on [[September 11 attacks|9/11/2001]].

The Fund collected $534 million from more than two million donors and distributed a total of 559 grants totaling $528 million. Grants from the Fund provided cash assistance, counseling and other services to the families of those killed in the 9/11 attacks, the injured and those displaced from their homes or jobs. The Fund also provided grants to affected small businesses and community organizations.&lt;ref&gt;See the GAO's ''Report on Independent Response of Charities'' at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d021037.pdf, Ford Foundation report - ''Philanthropic Response to 9/11'' - at http://www.fordfound.org/publications/recent_articles/philanthropic_response.cfm, and the 9/11 United Services Group's ''Ongoing Needs Study'' - at http://www.9-11usg.org/index3.asp?page=REPSTUDIDX#critical&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Yohay|NineEleven CaseManagement]] was selected by the Fund to administer all of the behavioral, mental health, and substance abuse benefits that the Fund determined the victims and families of the 9-11 attacks were entitled to.

In December 2004, the Fund completed its distribution of funds and closed its doors.

This is a separate fund from the similarly named [[September 11th Victim Compensation Fund]].

&lt;!--THIS SECTION IS THE INTRODUCTION, AND NOT THE MAIN ARTICLE. BY WIKIPEDIA POLICIES, IT NEEDS TO BE "BRIEF AND INTRODUCTORY". PLEASE DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS FOR OR AGAINST A TOPIC IN THE INTRODUCTION, BUT ADD THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE SECTION BELOW. --&gt;

The '''Shroud of Turin''' or '''Turin Shroud''' ({{lang-it|Sindone di Torino}}, ''{{lang|it|Sacra Sindone}}'' {{IPA-it|ˈsaːkra ˈsindone|}} or ''{{lang|it|Santa Sindone}}'') is a length of [[linen]] cloth bearing the [[Negative (photography)|negative]] image of a man who is alleged to be [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. It is [[Conservation of the Shroud of Turin|kept]] in the royal chapel of the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Turin)|Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist]] in [[Turin]], [[Piedmont]], northern Italy. The cloth itself is believed by some to be the burial shroud that Jesus was wrapped in when he was buried after [[crucifixion]]. It is first securely attested in 1390, when a local bishop wrote that the shroud was a forgery and that an unnamed artist had confessed. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of a sample of the shroud material is consistent with this date.

The [[Catholic Church]] has neither formally endorsed nor rejected the shroud, but in 1958 [[Pope Pius XII]] approved of the image in association with the [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Joan Carroll Cruz, ''Saintly Men of Modern Times'', Our Sunday Visitor, 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] called the Shroud "a mirror of the Gospel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-francis-and-shroud-turin |title=Pope Francis and the Shroud of Turin - National Catholic Reporter |publisher= |accessdate=6 June 2016|date=April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pastoral Visit of His Holiness John Paul II to Vercelli and Turin, Italy, 23–24 May 1998 [http://shroudnm.com/docs/JPII05-24-1998.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Christian denominations]], such as Anglicans and Methodists, have also shown devotion to the Shroud of Turin.&lt;ref name="Dreisbach2001"/&gt;

Diverse arguments have been made in scientific and popular publications claiming to prove that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. In 1988, [[Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin|three radiocarbon dating]] tests dated a corner piece of the shroud from the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R.E. and Bar-Yosef, Ofer. ''Radiocarbon Dating, Second Edition: An Archaeological Perspective''. Left Coast Press, 2014, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; between the years 1260 and 1390.

The image on the shroud is much clearer in black-and-white [[Negative (photography)|negative]] than in its natural sepia color, and this negative image was first observed in 1898 on the reverse photographic plate of amateur photographer [[Secondo Pia]], who was allowed to photograph it while it was being exhibited. A variety of methods have been proposed for the formation of the image, but the actual method used has not yet been conclusively identified. Despite numerous investigations and tests, the status of the Shroud of Turin remains murky, and the nature of the image and how it was fixed on the cloth remain puzzling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=P. |title=Material witness: Shrouded in mystery |doi=10.1038/nmat2170 |journal=Nature Materials |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=349 |date=2008 |pmid=18432204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shroud continues to be both intensely studied and controversial.&lt;ref name="Meacham 1983"&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=William Meacham |first=William |last=Meacham |title=The Authentication of the Turin Shroud, An Issue in Archeological Epistemology |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=283–311 |date=1983 |doi=10.1086/202996|jstor=2742663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to LLoyd A.

==Description==

[[File:Secundo Pia Turinske platno 1898.jpg |thumb |180px |[[Secondo Pia]]'s 1898 negative of the image on the Shroud of Turin has an appearance suggesting a positive image. It is used as part of the devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]]. Image from [[Musée de l'Élysée]], [[Lausanne]].]]

The shroud is rectangular, measuring approximately {{convert|4.4|x|1.1|m|ftin}}. The cloth is woven in a three-to-one [[herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] [[twill]] composed of [[flax]] fibrils. Its most distinctive characteristic is the faint, brownish image of a front and back view of a naked man with his hands folded across his groin. The two views are aligned along the midplane of the body and point in opposite directions. The front and back views of the head nearly meet at the middle of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The orphaned manuscript: a gathering of publications on the Shroud of Turin |first=Alan D. |last=Adler |date=2002 |isbn=978-88-7402-003-4 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the "Man of the Shroud" has a beard, moustache, and shoulder-length hair parted in the middle. He is muscular and tall (various experts have measured him as from {{convert |1.70 |to |1.88 |m |ftin|disp=or |abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shroudofturin4journalists.com/Details/howtall.htm |title=How Tall is the Man on the Shroud? |website=ShroudOfTurnForJournalists.com |access-date=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddish-brown stains are found on the cloth, showing various wounds that, according to proponents, correlate with the yellowish image, the pathophysiology of crucifixion, and the Biblical description of the death of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name="heller"&gt;{{Cite book |first=John H. |last=Heller |title=Report on the Shroud of Turin |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |date=1983 |isbn=978-0-395-33967-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1898 Italian photographer [[Secondo Pia]] was allowed to photograph the shroud. He took the first photograph of the shroud on 28 May 1898.  In 1931, another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the shroud and obtained results similar to Pia's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin |first=John Beldon |last=Scott |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-226-74316-5 |page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[Ultraviolet photography|ultraviolet photograph]]s were taken of the shroud.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=V.

The shroud was damaged in a fire in 1532 in the chapel in [[Chambery]], France. There are some burn holes and scorched areas down both sides of the linen, caused by contact with molten silver during the fire that burned through it in places while it was folded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Joan Carroll |last=Cruz |title=Relics |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor |date=1984 |isbn=978-0-87973-701-6 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourteen large triangular patches and eight smaller ones were sewn onto the cloth by [[Poor Clare]] nuns to repair the damage.

{{Main |History of the Shroud of Turin}}

The historical records for the shroud can be separated into two time periods: before 1390 and from 1390 to the present. Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images.&lt;ref&gt;G.M.Rinaldi, "Il Codice Pray", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The text of the codex also fails to mention a miraculous image on the codex shroud.

It is often mentioned that the first certain historical record dates from 1353 or 1357.&lt;ref name="Meacham 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=31 January 2005 |title=Turin shroud 'older than thought' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4210369.stm |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the presence of the Turin Shroud in [[Lirey]], [[France]], is only undoubtedly attested in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a [[memorandum]] to [[Antipope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII]] (Avignon Obedience), stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed.&lt;ref name="Poulle 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulle |first1=Emmanuel |authorlink=Emmanuel Poulle |title=Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin. Revue critique |journal=Revue d'Histoire Ecclésiastique |date=December 2009 |volume=104 |issue=3–4 |pages=747–782 |doi=10.1484/J.RHE.3.215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Nickell, ''Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings'', Prometheus Books, 1998, {{ISBN|9781573922722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed in the small town of Lirey around the years 1353 to 1357 in the possession of a French Knight, [[Geoffroi de Charny]], who died at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356.&lt;ref name="Meacham 1983" /&gt; However the correspondence of this shroud in Lirey with the shroud in Turin, and its origin has been debated by scholars and lay authors, with statements of forgery attributed to artists born a century apart. Some contend that the Lirey shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Watson E. Mills et alii, ''Mercer dictionary of the Bible'', Mercer University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}}, p. 822&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no definite historical records concerning the particular shroud currently at [[Turin Cathedral]] prior to the 14th century. A burial cloth, which some historians maintain was the Shroud, was owned by the [[Byzantine]] emperors but disappeared during the [[Sack of Constantinople]] in 1204.&lt;ref name="Poulle 2009" /&gt; Although there are numerous reports of Jesus' burial shroud, or an image of his head, of unknown origin, being venerated in various locations before the 14th century, there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at [[Turin Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Humber, Thomas: ''The Sacred Shroud''. New York: Pocket Books, 1980. {{ISBN|0-671-41889-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shroud of Lirey Pilgrim Badge.jpg |thumb |upright |left |The pilgrim medallion of Lirey (before 1453),&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue of the [[Musée National du Moyen Age]], Paris, [http://www.sindonology.org/papers/clunySouvenir.shtml A souvenir from Lirey] by Mario Latendresse&lt;/ref&gt; drawing by Arthur Forgeais, 1865.]]

The history of the shroud from the 15th century is well recorded. In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]&lt;ref&gt;John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt;) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.

In 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chambéry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chambéry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.&lt;ref&gt;See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica). Componimenti poetici sulla Sindone. Bolla di papa Giulio II (1506). Pellegrinaggio di S. Carlo Borromeo a Torino (1578)''. Introduzione, traduzione, note e riproduzione del testo originale a cura di Riccardo Quaglia, nuova edizione riveduta (2015), Biella 2015, {{ISBN|978-1-4452-8258-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repairs were made to the shroud in 1694 by [[Sebastian Valfrè]] to improve the repairs of the Poor Clare nuns.&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'' by John Beldon Scott 2003 {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Further repairs were made in 1868 by [[Clotilde of Savoy]]. The shroud remained the property of the [[House of Savoy]] until 1983, when it was given to the [[Holy See]].

A fire, possibly caused by [[arson]], threatened the shroud on 11 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=The New York Times |date=12 April 1997 |title=Shroud of Turin Saved From Fire in Cathedral |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/12/world/shroud-of-turin-saved-from-fire-in-cathedral.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Holy See had the shroud restored. The cloth backing and thirty patches were removed, making it possible to photograph and scan the reverse side of the cloth, which had been hidden from view. A faint part-image of the body was found on the back of the shroud in 2004.

The Shroud was placed back on public display (the 18th time in its history) in Turin from 10 April to 23 May 2010; and according to Church officials, more than 2 million visitors came to see it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-29146 "To see the Shroud : 2M and counting"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927020556/http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-29146 |date=27 September 2012 }}. ''Zenit''. 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On Holy Saturday (30 March) 2013, images of the shroud were streamed on various websites as well as on television for the first time in 40 years.&lt;ref name="Povoledo_New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/world/europe/shroud-of-turin-going-on-tv-with-a-word-from-the-pope.html?_r=0 |date=29 March 2013 |title=Turin Shroud Going on TV, With Video From Pope |last=Povoledo |first=Elisabetta |work=New York Times |access-date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=30 March 2013 |title=Turin Shroud shown live on Italy TV |website=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21984018 |access-date=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Gottardo of the [[diocese of Turin]] stated that for the first time ever they had released high definition images of the shroud that can be used on [[tablet computer]]s and can be magnified to show details not visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Povoledo_New York Times" /&gt; As this rare exposition took place, [[Pope Francis]] issued a carefully worded statement which urged the faithful to contemplate the shroud with awe but, like his predecessors, he "stopped firmly short of asserting its authenticity".&lt;ref name="The Vatican Today" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Economist archive" /&gt;

The shroud was again placed on display in the cathedral in Turin from 19 April 2015 until 24 June 2015. There was no charge to view it, but an appointment was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turin Shroud goes back on display at city's cathedral |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32368134 |access-date=19 April 2015 |work=BBC News |date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
{{Main |Conservation of the Shroud of Turin}}

The Shroud has undergone several 
[[conservation-restoration|restorations]] and several steps have been taken to preserve it to avoid further damage and contamination. The shroud is kept under the [[laminated glass|laminated]] [[bulletproof glass]] of the airtight case. The temperature- and humidity-controlled case is filled with [[argon]] (99.5%) and [[oxygen]] (0.5%) to prevent chemical changes. The Shroud itself is kept on an [[aluminum]] support sliding on runners and stored flat within the case.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Religious beliefs about the burial cloths of Jesus have existed for centuries. The Gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]],{{Bibleref2c-nb |Matthew |27:59–60 |NIV}} [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]],{{Bibleref2c-nb |Mark |15:46 |NIV}} and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]{{Bibleref2c-nb |Luke |23:53 |NIV}} state that [[Joseph of Arimathea]] wrapped the body of Jesus in a piece of linen cloth and placed it in a new tomb. The [[Gospel of John]]{{Bibleref2c-nb |John |19:38–40 |NIV}} refers to strips of linen used by Joseph of Arimathea and states that [[Apostle Peter]] found multiple pieces of burial cloth after the tomb was found open, strips of linen cloth for the body and a separate cloth for the head.{{Bibleref2c-nb |John |20:6–7 |NIV}} The [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], a 2nd-century manuscript, states that Jesus gave the linen cloth to the servant of the priest.

Although pieces said to be of burial cloths of Jesus are held by at least four churches in France and three in Italy, none has gathered as much religious following as the Shroud of Turin.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Carrol Cruz, 1984 ''Relics'' {{ISBN|0-87973-701-8}}, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The religious beliefs and practices associated with the shroud predate historical and scientific discussions and have continued in the 21st century, although the Catholic Church has never passed judgment on its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'', Our Sunday Visitor, 2002 {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}}, p. 533&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Holy Face Medal]] bearing the image from the shroud, worn by some Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'', Our Sunday Visitor, 2002, {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}}, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Shroud of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians.&lt;ref name="Dreisbach2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=A theological basis for sindonology &amp; its ecumenical implications|last=Dreisbach|first=Albert R.|year=2001|publisher=Collegamento pro Sindone|language=English|quote=Some twenty years ago this ecumenical dimension of this sacred linen became very evident to me on the night of August 16, 1983, when local judicatory leaders offered their corporate blessing to the Turin Shroud Exhibit and participated in the ''Evening Office of the Holy Shroud''. The Greek Archbishop, the Roman Catholic Archbishop, the Episcopal Bishop and the Presiding Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church gathered before the world's first full size, backlit transparency of the Shroud and joined clergy representing the Assemblies of God, Baptists, Lutherans, Methodists and Presbyterians in an amazing witness to ecumenical unity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Lutheran parishes have hosted replicas of the Shroud of Turin, for didactic and devotional purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehour.com/norwalk/article/Shroud-of-Turin-replica-on-exhibit-at-St-Peter-s-8104096.php|title=Shroud of Turin replica on exhibit at St. Peter's Lutheran Church|last=Trautmann|first=Erik|date=7 October 2015|publisher=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]|language=English|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galenagazette.com/Content/Mobile-Home/Mobile/Article/Replica-Shroud-of-Turin-on-display-at-St-Matthew/-5/-5/24669|title=Replica Shroud of Turin on display at St. Matthew|last=Dickerson|first=Hillary|date=8 April 2014|publisher=Galena Gazette|language=English|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calvin===
In 1543 [[John Calvin]], in his ''Treatise on Relics'', wrote of the shroud, which was then at [[Nice]] (it was moved to Turin in 1578), "How is it possible that those sacred historians, who carefully related all the miracles that took place at Christ's death, should have omitted to mention one so remarkable as the likeness of the body of our Lord remaining on its wrapping sheet?" In an interpretation of the Gospel of John,{{Bibleref2c-nb |John |20:6–7 |NIV}} Calvin concluded that strips of linen were used to cover the body (excluding the head) and a separate cloth to cover the head.&lt;ref name="Calvin1"&gt;John Calvin, 1543, ''Treatise on Relics'', trans. by Count Valerian Krasinski, 1854; 2nd ed. Edinburgh: John Stone, Hunter, and Company, 1870; reprinted with an introduction by Joe Nickell; Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He then stated that "either St. John is a liar", or else anyone who promotes such a shroud is "convicted of falsehood and deceit".&lt;ref name="Calvin1" /&gt;

===Devotions===
Although the shroud image is currently associated with Catholic devotions to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]], the devotions themselves predate [[Secondo Pia]]'s 1898 photograph. Such devotions had been started in 1844 by the Carmelite nun [[Marie of St Peter]] (based on "pre-crucifixion" images associated with the [[Veil of Veronica]]) and promoted by [[Leo Dupont]], also called the [[Apostle of the Holy Face]]. In 1851 Dupont formed the "Archconfraternity of the Holy Face" in [[Tours]], France, well before Secondo Pia took the photograph of the shroud.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Scallan, ''The Holy Man of Tours'', TAN Books and Publishers, 2009, {{ISBN|0-89555-390-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miraculous image===
{{Further |Acheiropoieta |Veil of Veronica |Manoppello Image |Image of Edessa}}
[[File:Simon Ushakov. Spas. (Perm).jpg |thumb |200px |left |17th-century Russian icon of the [[Mandylion]] by [[Simon Ushakov]]]]

The religious concept of the miraculous ''acheiropoieton'' has a long history in Christianity, going back to at least the 6th century.  Among the most prominent portable early ''acheiropoieta'' are the [[Image of Camuliana]] and the [[Mandylion]] or Image of [[Edessa]], both painted icons of Christ held in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and now generally regarded as lost or destroyed, as is the [[Hodegetria]] image of the Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kitzinger |first1=Ernst |title=The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm |journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |date=1954 |volume=8 |pages=83 |doi=10.2307/1291064 |jstor=1291064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early images in Italy, all heavily and unfortunately restored, that have been revered as ''acheiropoieta'' now have relatively little following, as attention has focused on the Shroud.

Proponents for the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding the methods used for image formation on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Brown, ''Bible "Mysteries" Explained'', Crystal Publishing, 2007, {{ISBN|0-9582813-0-0}}, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rinaldi, ''The man in the Shroud'', Futura Publications Ltd, 1972, {{ISBN|0-86007-010-7}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents have argued that the image on the shroud can be explained with scientific evidence that supports the Gospel narrative. John Jackson (a member of [[Shroud of Turin Research Project|STURP]]) proposed that the image was formed by radiation methods beyond the understanding of current science, in particular via the "collapsing cloth" onto a body that was radiating energy at the moment of resurrection.&lt;ref name="Ruffin155"&gt;''The Shroud of Turin'' by Bernard Ruffin 1999 {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; However, STURP member Alan Adler has stated that Jackson's theory is not generally accepted as scientific, given that it runs counter to the laws of physics.&lt;ref name="Ruffin155" /&gt; In 1989 physicist Thomas Phillips speculated that the Shroud image was formed by [[neutron radiation]] due to a miraculous bodily resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Thomas J. |title=Shroud irradiated with neutrons? |journal=Nature |date=16 February 1989 |volume=337 |issue=6208 |pages=594 |doi=10.1038/337594a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vatican position===
[[Antipope Clement VII]] refrained from expressing his opinion on the shroud; however, subsequent popes from [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] on took its authenticity for granted.&lt;ref&gt;"Shroud of Turin (relic)". ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 28 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vatican newspaper ''[[Osservatore Romano]]'' covered the story of [[Secondo Pia]]'s photograph of 28 May 1898 in its edition of 15 June 1898, but it did so with no comment and thereafter Church officials generally refrained from officially commenting on the photograph for almost half a century.

The first official association between the image on the Shroud and the Catholic Church was made in 1940 based on the formal request by Sister [[Maria Pierina]] De Micheli to the [[Curia (religion)|curia]] in [[Milan]] to obtain authorization to produce a medal with the image. The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joan Carroll Cruz, "Saintly Men of Modern Times", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.

In 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].&lt;ref name="Michael Freze 1993, p. 57"&gt;Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity. As with other approved [[Catholic devotions]], the matter has been left to the personal decision of the faithful, as long as the Church does not issue a future notification to the contrary. In the Church's view, whether the cloth is authentic or not has no bearing whatsoever on the validity of what Jesus taught or on the saving power of his death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Bunson, ''OSV's encyclopedia of Catholic history'', revised edition, Our Sunday Visitor, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59276-026-0}}, p. 912&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] stated in 1998 that:&lt;ref&gt;Francis D'Emilio article on Pope John Paul II's visit to the Shroud of Turin, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 25 May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; "Since it is not a matter of faith, the Church has no specific competence to pronounce on these questions. She entrusts to scientists the task of continuing to investigate, so that satisfactory answers may be found to the questions connected with this Sheet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_24051998_sindone_en.html Address of John Paul II], 24 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope John Paul II showed himself to be deeply moved by the image of the Shroud and arranged for public showings in 1998 and 2000. In his address at the Turin Cathedral on Sunday 24 May 1998 (the occasion of the 100th year of Secondo Pia's 28 May 1898 photograph), he said: "The Shroud is an image of God's love as well as of human sin ... The imprint left by the tortured body of the Crucified One, which attests to the tremendous human capacity for causing pain and death to one's fellow man, stands as an icon of the suffering of the innocent in every age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |author=Pope John Paul II |date=24 May 1998 |title=Address in Turin Cathedral |location=Turin, Italy |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_24051998_sindone_en.html |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000511022036/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_24051998_sindone_en.html |archive-date=11 May 2000 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Cardinal Ratzinger, later to become [[Pope Benedict XVI]], wrote that the Shroud of Turin is "a truly mysterious image, which no human artistry was capable of producing. In some inexplicable way, it appeared imprinted upon cloth and claimed to show the true face of Christ, the crucified and risen Lord".&lt;ref&gt;In Joseph Ratzinger, ''The spirit of Liturgy'', Ignatius Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-89870-784-6}}, cf.

On 30 March 2013, as part of the Easter celebrations, there was an extraordinary exposition of the shroud in the Cathedral of Turin. [[Pope Francis]] recorded a video message for the occasion, in which he described the image on the shroud as "this [[Icon]] of a man", and stated that "the Man of the Shroud invites us to contemplate Jesus of Nazareth."&lt;ref name="The Vatican Today"&gt;Pope: "I join all of you gathered before the Holy Shroud".

'''Sindonology''' (from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] σινδών—sindon, the word used in the [[Gospel of Mark]]{{Bibleref2c-nb |Mark |15:46 |NIV}} to describe the type of the burial cloth of Jesus) is the formal study of the Shroud. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites the first use of this word in 1964: "The investigation&amp;nbsp;... assumed the stature of a separate discipline and was given a name, sindonology", but also identifies the use of "sindonological" in 1950 and "sindonologist" in 1953.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/180066 |accessdate=24 January 2017 |chapter=Sindonology, n. |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secondo Pia]]'s 1898 photographs of the shroud allowed the scientific community to begin to study it. A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: ''material analysis'' (both chemical and historical), ''biology and medical forensics'' and ''image analysis''.

The initial steps towards the scientific study of the shroud were taken soon after the first set of black and white photographs became available early in the 20th century. In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.&lt;ref name="Delage, Yves 1902" /&gt; Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.&lt;ref name="Meacham 1983" /&gt; However, these were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.

The first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969–1973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.&lt;ref name="Meacham 1983" /&gt;

In 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.

Also in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tamburelli |first1=Giovanni |title=Some Results in the Processing of the Holy Shroud of Turin |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=November 1981 |volume=PAMI-3 |issue=6 |pages=670–676 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radiocarbon dating====
{{Main |Radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin}}

After years of discussion, the [[Holy See]] permitted [[radiocarbon dating]] on portions of a swatch taken from a corner of the shroud. Independent tests in 1988 at the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Arizona]], and the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] concluded with 95% confidence that the shroud material dated to 1260–1390 AD.&lt;ref name="'Turin Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Damon |first1=P.

The dating does on the other hand match the first appearance of the shroud in church history.&lt;ref name="HST"&gt;{{CathEncy |wstitle=The Holy Shroud (of Turin)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150417-shroud-turin-relics-jesus-catholic-church-religion-science news.nationalgeographic.com Why Shroud of Turin's Secrets Continue to Elude Science]". ''National Geographic'', 17 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
This dating is also slightly more recent than that estimated by art historian W. S. A. Dale, who postulated on artistic grounds that the shroud is an 11th-century icon made for use in worship services.&lt;ref name="dale"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dale |first1=W.S.A. |year=1987 |title=The Shroud of Turin: Relic or Icon? |doi=10.1016/0168-583X(87)90233-3 |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research |volume=B29 |issue= |pages=187–192}} This paper is significant in that it was presented to the international radiocarbon community shortly before radiocarbon dating was performed on the shroud.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents for the authenticity of the shroud have attempted to discount the radiocarbon dating result by claiming that the sample may represent a medieval "invisible" repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth.&lt;ref name="Poulle 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Raymond Rogers |last1=Rogers |first1=Raymond N. |title=Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the shroud of turin |journal=Thermochimica Acta |date=20 January 2005 |volume=425 |issue=1–2 |pages=189–194 |doi=10.1016/j.tca.2004.09.029 |accessdate=31 July 2016 |url=http://www.shroud.it/ROGERS-3.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gove 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dating the Turin Shroud: An Assessment |first=H.

====Vibrational spectroscopy====
In 2013, Giulio Fanti performed new dating studies on fragments obtained from the shroud. He performed three different tests including [[Attenuated total reflectance|ATR]]–[[Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy|FTIR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] [[spectroscopy]] (absorption of light of different colors). The date range from these tests date the shroud between 300&amp;nbsp;BC and 400&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=Giulio |last2=Baraldi |first2=Pietro |last3=Basso |first3=Roberto |last4=Tinti |first4=Anna |title=Non-destructive dating of ancient flax textiles by means of vibrational spectroscopy |journal=Vibrational Spectroscopy |date=July 2013 |volume=67 |pages=61–70 |doi=10.1016/j.vibspec.2013.04.001 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924203113000490 |accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/9958678/Turin-Shroud-is-not-a-medieval-forgery.html |title=Turin Shroud 'is not a medieval forgery' |website=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=6 June 2016|date=2013-03-28 |last1=Squires |first1=Nick }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stanglin |first1=Doug |title=New test dates Shroud of Turin to era of Christ |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/03/30/shroud-turin-display/2038295/ |accessdate=31 July 2016 |work=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have been publicly disregarded by [[Cesare Nosiglia]], archbishop of Turin and custodian of the shroud.

====Tests for pigments====
In the 1970s a special eleven-member Turin Commission conducted several tests. Conventional and electron microscopic examination of the Shroud at that time revealed an absence of heterogeneous coloring material or pigment.&lt;ref name="Meacham 1983" /&gt; In 1979, [[Walter McCrone]], upon analyzing the samples he was given by STURP, concluded that the image is actually made up of billions of submicrometre pigment particles. The only [[fibril]]s that had been made available for testing of the stains were those that remained affixed to custom-designed adhesive tape applied to thirty-two different sections of the image.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone, W. C., Skirius, C., ''The Microscope'', 28, 1980, pp 1–13; McCrone, W. C., ''The Microscope'', 29, 1981, pp. 19–38. ''The Microscope'' 1980, 28, 105, 115; 1981, 29, 19; ''Wiener Berichte uber Naturwissenschaft in der Kunst'' 1987/1988, 4/5, 50 and ''Acc. Chem. Res.'' 1990, 23, 77–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Anderson, who was working for McCrone, analyzed the Shroud samples.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Materials evaluation (journal)|Materials evaluation]]'', Volume 40, Issues 1–5, 1982, Page 630&lt;/ref&gt; In his book Ray Rogers states that Anderson, who was McCrone's [[Raman microscope|Raman microscopy]] expert, concluded that the samples acted as organic material when he subjected them to the laser.&lt;ref name=Rogers2008/&gt;{{rp|61}}

John Heller and Alan Adler examined the same samples and agreed with McCrone's result that the cloth contains iron oxide. However, they concluded, the exceptional purity of the chemical and comparisons with other ancient textiles showed that, while [[Flax#Retting flax|retting flax]] absorbs iron selectively, the iron itself was not the source of the image on the shroud.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 2000, fragments of a burial shroud from the 1st century were discovered in a tomb near Jerusalem, believed to have belonged to a Jewish high priest or member of the aristocracy. The shroud was composed of a simple two-way weave, unlike the complex [[herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] [[twill]] of the Turin Shroud. Based on this discovery, the researchers stated that the Turin Shroud did not originate from Jesus-era Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DNA of Jesus-era shrouded man in Jerusalem reveals earliest case of leprosy |work=Physorg.com |url=http://www.physorg.com/news180165623.html |date=16 December 2009 |access-date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Jesus-era' burial shroud found |work=BBC News |first=Bethany |last=Bell |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8415377.stm |date=16 December 2009 |access-date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=National Geographic Daily News |title=Shroud of Turin Not Jesus', Tomb Discovery Suggests |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/12/091216-shroud-of-turin-jesus-jerusalem-leprosy.html |access-date=22 March 2010 |date=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to textile expert Mechthild Flury-Lemberg of Hamburg, a seam in the cloth corresponds to a fabric found at the fortress of [[Masada]] near the [[Dead Sea]], which dated to the 1st century. The weaving pattern, 3:1 twill, is consistent with first-century Syrian design, according to the appraisal of Gilbert Raes of the Ghent Institute of Textile Technology in Belgium. Flury-Lemberg stated: "The linen cloth of the Shroud of Turin does not display any weaving or sewing techniques which would speak against its origin as a high-quality product of the textile workers of the first century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_shroudchrist/interview.html |title=Secrets of the Dead: Shroud of Christ? |website=PBS.org |access-date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several reddish stains on the shroud suggesting blood, but it is uncertain whether these stains were produced at the same time as the image, or afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heller |first1=John H. |last2=Adler |first2=Alan D. |title=Blood on the Shroud of Turin |journal=Applied Optics |date=15 August 1980 |volume=19 |issue=16 |pages=2742–4 |doi=10.1364/AO.19.002742|pmid=20234501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McCrone (see [[#Painting|painting hypothesis]]) identified these as containing [[iron oxide]], theorizing that its presence was likely due to simple pigment materials used in medieval times.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone Research, [http://mcri.org/home/section/63-64/the-shroud-of-turin Initial Examination – 1979], retrieved 16 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers, including Alan Adler, identified the reddish stains as blood and interpreted the [[iron oxide]] as a natural residue of [[hemoglobin]].

Working independently, [[forensic pathologist]] Pier Luigi Baima Bollone concurred with Heller and Adler's findings and identified the blood as the AB blood group.&lt;ref&gt;P. L.

In 1997 Avinoam Danin, a botanist at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], reported that he had identified ''Chrysanthemum coronarium'' (now called ''[[Glebionis coronaria]]''), ''[[Cistus creticus]]'' and ''[[Zygophyllum]]'' whose pressed image on the shroud was first noticed by Alan Whanger in 1985 on the photographs of the shroud taken in 1931. He reported that the outlines of the flowering plants would point to March or April and the environs of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Avinoam |last=Danin |title=Where Did the Shroud of Turin Originate?

Evans and Company, Inc, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87131-963-2}}, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; However it was subsequently determined that Baruch's work was "scientifically unsafe", and Danin thereafter disowned the publication of this work.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wilson. ''The Shroud'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Danin stated in 2011, that: "In 2001 we brought most of the slides to Prof. Dr. Thomas Litt who is an expert palynologist and has very sophisticated microscopic equipment. Prof. Litt concluded that none of the pollen grains he saw could be named at a species level. Hence, all the conclusions drawn from previous palynological investigations of Dr. Frei's material should be suspended until a new collection of pollen grains can be carried out and the grains thus obtained can be studied with modern equipment and by an expert of pollen of this area." &lt;ref&gt;Avinoam Danin. ''[http://flora.org.il/en/books/plant-stories-2/chapter-o/useful_plants_06/ Flora of Israel]]'', 17 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics have argued that the flower images are too faint for Danin's determination to be definite, that an independent review of the pollen strands showed that one strand out of the 26 provided contained significantly more pollen than the others, perhaps pointing to deliberate contamination.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe: "Pollens on the 'shroud': A study in deception". ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Summer 1994, pp. 379–385&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics also argue that Max Frei had previously been duped in his examination of the [[Hitler Diaries]] and that he may have also been duped in this case, or may have introduced the pollens himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert T. ''The Skeptic Dictionary'', Hoboken, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, {{ISBN|0-471-27242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Beaulieau has stated that Frei was a self-taught amateur [[palynologist]], was not properly trained, and that his sample was too small.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ruffin, ''The Shroud of Turin'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Avinoam Danin reported analysis based on the [[ultraviolet photography|ultraviolet photograph]]s of Miller and Pellicori&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="opticsinfobase.org"/&gt; taken in 1978. Danin reported five new species of flower, which also bloom in March and April and stated that a comparison of the 1931 black and white photographs and the 1978 ultraviolet images indicate that the flower images are genuine and not the artifact of a specific method of photography.&lt;ref&gt;Avinoam Danin (2008).

A study published in 2011 by Lorusso and others subjected two photographs of the shroud to detailed modern digital image processing, one of them being a reproduction of the photographic negative taken by Giuseppe Enrie in 1931. They did not find any images of flowers or coins or anything else on either image, they noted that the faint images identified by the Whangers were "only visible by incrementing the photographic contrast", and they concluded that these signs may be linked to protuberances in the yarn, and possibly also to the alteration and influence of the texture of the Enrie photographic negative during its development in 1931.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;

In 2015, Italian researchers Barcaccia et al. published a new study in ''[[Scientific Reports]]''. They examined the human and non-human DNA found when the shroud and its backing cloth were vacuumed in 1977 and 1988. They found traces of 19 different plant [[Taxon|taxa]], including plants native to Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia (China) and the Americas. Of the human [[mtDNA]], sequences were found belonging to [[haplogroup]]s that are typical of various ethnicities and geographic regions, including Europe, North and East Africa, the Middle East and India. A few non-plant and non-human sequences were also detected, including various birds and one ascribable to a marine worm common in the Northern Pacific Ocean, next to Canada.&lt;ref name = "Barcaccia 2015"/&gt; After sequencing some DNA of pollen and dust found on the shroud, they confirmed that many people from many different places came in contact with the shroud. According to the scientists, "such diversity does not exclude a Medieval origin in Europe but it would be also compatible with the historic path followed by the Turin Shroud during its presumed journey from the Near East. Furthermore, the results raise the possibility of an Indian manufacture of the linen cloth."&lt;ref name = "Barcaccia 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barcaccia |first1=Gianni |last2=Galla |first2=Giulio |last3=Achilli |first3=Alessandro |last4=Olivieri |first4=Anna |last5=Torroni |first5=Antonio |title=Uncovering the sources of DNA found on the Turin Shroud |journal=Scientific Reports |date=5 October 2015 |volume=5 |pages=14484 |doi=10.1038/srep14484 |pmid=26434580 |pmc=4593049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a new examination claimed that "the most abundant pollen on the relic may be attribruted to the genus [[Helichrysum]]". According to the author, palynologist Marzia Boi, it "confirms and authenticates the theory that the corpse kept in the Shroud received a funeral and burial with all the honour and respect that would have been customary in the Hebrew tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boi|first=M.|date=2017-04-01|title=Pollen on the Shroud of Turin: The Probable Trace Left by Anointing and Embalming|journal=Archaeometry|volume=59|issue=2|pages=316–330|doi=10.1111/arcm.12269|issn=1475-4754}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Philip|date=May 2017|title=Material witness: Is this holy relic preserved?|journal=Nature Materials|volume=16|issue=5|pages=503|doi=10.1038/nmat4897|pmid=28439114|issn=1476-4660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anatomical forensics====
[[File:Full length negatives of the shroud of Turin.jpg |thumb|left |280px |Full length negatives of the shroud.]]
A number of studies on the anatomical consistency of the image on the shroud and the nature of the wounds on it have been performed, following the initial study by [[Yves Delage]] in 1902.&lt;ref name="Delage, Yves 1902" /&gt; While Delage declared the image anatomically flawless, others have presented arguments to support both authenticity and forgery.

In 1950 [[Pierre Barbet (physician)|Pierre Barbet]] wrote a long study called ''A Doctor at Calvary'' which was later published as a book.&lt;ref name="Barbet, Pierre 1963"&gt;Barbet, Pierre. 1963. A Doctor at Calvary. New York: Image Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Barbet stated that his experience as a battlefield surgeon during [[World War I]] led him to conclude that the image on the shroud was authentic, anatomically correct and consistent with crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ruffin, ''The Shroud of Turin'', Our Sunday Visitor, 1999 {{ISBN|0-87973-617-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

For over a decade, [[Frederick Zugibe]] performed a number of studies using himself and volunteers suspended from a cross, and presented his conclusions in a book in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Zugibe]], ''The Crucifixion of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry'', M.Evans Publ., 2005, {{ISBN|1-59077-070-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zugibe considered the shroud image and its proportions as authentic, but disagreed with Barbet and Bucklin on various details such as blood flow. Zugibe concluded that the image on the shroud is of the body of a man, but that the body had been washed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Zugibe]], "[http://www.crucifixion-shroud.com/Washed.htm The Man of the Shroud was Washed]", ''Sindon'', Quad. No. 1, June 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Pierluigi Baima Bollone, a professor of forensic medicine in Turin, stated that the forensic examination of the wounds and bloodstains on the Shroud indicate that the image was that of the dead body of a man who was whipped, wounded around the head by a pointed instrument and nailed at the extremities before dying.&lt;ref&gt;Pierluigi Baima Bollone, "Interpreting the Image on the Shroud", in Gian Maria Zaccone, ''Le due facce della Sindone. Pellegrini e scienziati alla ricerca di un volto'', Torino, ODPF, 2001, pp. 119–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical measurements, wrote that "apart from the hands afterward placed on the pubic area, the front and back images are compatible with the Shroud being used to wrap the body of a man {{convert |175 |+/- |2 |cm |ftin |0 |abbr=on}} tall, which, due to cadaveric rigidity, remained in the same position it would have assumed during crucifixion".&lt;ref name=Fanti2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Basso |first2=R. |last3=Bianchini |first3=G. |title=Turin Shroud: Compatibility Between a Digitized Body Image and a Computerized Anthropomorphous Manikin |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=2010 |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=050503 |doi=10.2352/J.ImagingSci.Technol.2010.54.5.050503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Artist Lillian Schwartz, who had previously claimed to have matched the face of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' to a self-portrait of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], stated in 2009 that the proportions of the face image on the shroud are correct, and that they match the dimensions of the face of da Vinci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/5706640/Turin-Shroud-is-face-of-Leonardo-da-Vinci.html |title=Was Turin Shroud faked by Leonardo da Vinci? |first=By Alastair |last=Jamieson |website=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
Nickell, in 1983, and [[Gregory S. Paul]] in 2010, separately state that the [[body proportions|proportions]] of the image are not realistic. Paul stated that the face and proportions of the shroud image are impossible, that the figure cannot represent that of an actual person and that the posture was inconsistent. They argued that the forehead on the shroud is too small; and that the arms are too long and of different lengths and that the distance from the eyebrows to the top of the head is non-representative. They concluded that the features can be explained if the shroud is a work of a [[Gothic art]]ist.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Nickell, Inquest on the Shroud of Turin, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paul gothic fraud"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infidels.org/kiosk/article/the-shroud-of-turin-the-great-gothic-art-fraud-because-if-its-real-the-brain-of-jesus-was-the-size-of-a-protohumans-815.html |title=The Shroud of Turin: The Great Gothic Art Fraud |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |date=6 May 2010 |website=Secular Web Kiosk |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |access-date=9 May 2010 |author-link=Gregory Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study analysed the wounds seemingly evident on the image in the shroud and compared them favorably to the wounds which the gospels state were inflicted on Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bevilacqua |first1=M. | display-authors = 1 |last2=et al |year=2013 |title=Do we really need new medical information about the Turin shroud? |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020138313004221 |journal=Injury |volume=45 |issue= 2|pages=460–464 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2013.09.013|pmid=24135252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the analysis of a crucified Roman, discovered near Venice in 2007, shows heel wounds consistent with those found on [[Jehohanan]] and are not consistent with wounds depicted on the shroud. Also, neither of the crucifixion victims known to archaeology show evidence of wrist wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |authorlink1=Joe Nickell |title=Crucifixion Evidence Debunks Turin 'Shroud' |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Image analysis====
Both art-historical, [[digital image processing]] and analog techniques have been applied to the shroud images.

In 1976 Pete Schumacher, John Jackson and Eric Jumper analysed a photograph of the shroud image using a [[VP8 Image Analyzer]], which was developed for NASA to create brightness maps of the moon. A brightness map (isometric display) interprets differences of brightness within an image as differences of elevation – brighter patches are seen as being closer to the camera, and darker patches further away. Our minds interpret these gradients as a "pseudo-three-dimensional image".&lt;ref&gt;Talk by Pete Schumacher presented on the website of the museum he created. http://shroudnm.com/library.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paper by Pete Schumacher http://shroudnm.com/docs/1999-05-Photogrammetric-Responses-from-the-Shroud-of-Turin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{complete citation needed|date=June 2016}} They found that, unlike any photograph they had analyzed, the shroud image has the property of decoding into a 3-dimensional image, when the darker parts of the image are interpreted to be those features of the man that were closest to the shroud and the lighter areas of the image those features that were farthest. The researchers could not replicate the effect when they attempted to transfer similar images using techniques of block print, engravings, a hot statue, and [[bas-relief]].&lt;ref&gt;Heller, John H. ''Report on the Shroud of Turin'', Houghton Mifflin, 1983. {{ISBN|0-395-33967-7}}, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

However optical physicist and former STURP member John Dee German has since noted that it is not difficult to make a photograph which has 3D qualities. If the object being photographed is lighted from the front, and a non-reflective "fog" of some sort exists between the camera and the object, then less light will reach and reflect back from the portions of the object that are farther from the lens, thus creating a contrast which is dependent on distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p22.pdf |title=On the Visibility of the Shroud Image |author=J. Dee German |publisher= |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Jackson, Jumper, and Stephenson report detecting the impressions of coins placed on both eyes after a digital study in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, John P., Eric J. Jumper, Bill Mottern, and Kenneth E. Stevenson. 1977. "The three-dimensional image of Jesus' burial cloth", ''Proceedings, 1977 United States Conference of Research on The Shroud of Turin'', Holy Shroud Guild, New York, 1977, pp. 74–94.&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed to have seen a two-[[Greek lepton|lepton]] coin on the right eyelid dating from 29–30,&lt;ref&gt;F. Filas, ''The dating of the Shroud from coins of Pontius Pilate'', Cogan, Youngtown (Arizona), 1982&lt;/ref&gt; and a one-lepton coin on the left eyebrow minted in 29.&lt;ref&gt;N. Balossino, ''L'immagine della Sindone, ricerca fotografica e informatica'', Editrice Elle Di Ci, 1997, {{ISBN|88-01-00798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the coin images is rejected by most scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Doubts Concerning the Coins Over the Eyes |first=Antonio |last=Lombatti |journal=British Society for the Turin Shroud Newsletter |issue=45 |date=1997  |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2011 by Lorusso and others subjected two photographs of the shroud to detailed modern digital image processing, one of them being a reproduction of the photographic negative taken by Giuseppe Enrie in 1931. They did not find any images of flowers or coins or anything else on either image, they noted that the faint images identified by the Whangers were "only visible by incrementing the photographic contrast", and they concluded that these signs may be linked to protuberances in the yarn, and possibly also to the alteration and influence of the texture of the Enrie photographic negative during its development in 1931.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; The use of coins to cover the eyes of the dead is not attested for 1st-century Palestine.

In 2004, in an article in ''[[Journal of Optics A]]'', Fanti and Maggiolo reported finding a faint second face on the backside of the cloth, after the 2002 restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=Giulio |last2=Maggiolo |first2=Roberto |title=The double superficiality of the frontal image of the Turin Shroud |journal=Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics |date=1 June 2004 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=491–503 |doi=10.1088/1464-4258/6/6/001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The front image of the Turin Shroud, 1.95&amp;nbsp;m long, is not directly compatible with the back image, 2.02&amp;nbsp;m long.&lt;ref name=Fanti2010/&gt;

If Jesus' dead body actually produced the images on the shroud, one would expect the bodily areas touching the ground to be more distinct. In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying prone. No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body. Furthermore, Jesus' physical appearance corresponds to Byzantine iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | entry=SHROUD OF TURIN | title=New Catholic Encyclopedia | edition=2nd | year=2003| title-link=New Catholic Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E.

In 1979 Greek and Latin letters were reported as written near the face. These were further studied by André Marion, a professor at the [[École supérieure d'optique]] and his student Anne Laure Courage, in 1997. Subsequently, after performing computerized analysis and [[wiktionary:microdensitometer|microdensitometer]] studies, they reported finding additional inscriptions, among them INNECEM (a shortened form of Latin "in necem ibis"—"you will go to death"), NNAZAPE(N)NUS (Nazarene), IHSOY (Jesus) and IC (Iesus Chrestus). The uncertain letters IBE(R?) have been conjectured as "[[Tiberius]]".&lt;ref&gt;A. Marion, A.-L. Courage, ''Nouvelles découvertes sur le suaire de Turin'', Paris, Albin Michel, 1998, {{ISBN|2-226-09231-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Mark Guscin disputed the reports of Marion and Courage. He stated that the inscriptions made little grammatical or historical sense and that they did not appear on the slides that Marion and Courage indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |title=The 'Inscriptions' on the Shroud |website=British Society for the Turin Shroud Newsletter |first=Mark |last=Guscin |date=|access-date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Barbara Frale]], a [[paleographer]] in the [[Vatican Secret Archives]], who had published two books on the Shroud of Turin reported further analysis of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Frale 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In her books Frale had stated that the shroud had been kept by the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] after 1204.&lt;ref name="FraleTimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Knights Templar hid the Shroud of Turin, says Vatican |first=Richard |last=Owen |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article6040521.ece |newspaper=The Times |date=26 April 2009 |access-date=24 October 2010 |quote=her study of the trial of the Knights Templar had brought to light a document in which Arnaut Sabbatier ... was shown 'a long linen cloth on which was impressed the figure of a man' and instructed to venerate the image by kissing its feet three times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Frale stated that it is possible to read on the image the burial certificate of Jesus the Nazarene, or Jesus of Nazareth, imprinted in fragments of Greek, Hebrew and Latin writing.&lt;ref name="TimesFrale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FraleTeleg" /&gt;

Frale stated the text on the Shroud reads: "In the year 16 of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius Jesus the Nazarene, taken down in the early evening after having been condemned to death by a Roman judge because he was found guilty by a Hebrew authority, is hereby sent for burial with the obligation of being consigned to his family only after one full year."&lt;ref name="TimesFrale"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death certificate is imprinted on the Shroud of Turin, says Vatican scholar |first=Richard |last=Owen |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article6925371.ece |newspaper=The Times |date=21 November 2009 |access-date=24 October 2010 |quote=''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintanthonyofpadua.net/messaggero/pagina_stampa.asp?R=&amp;ID=485 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930060509/http://www.saintanthonyofpadua.net/messaggero/pagina_stampa.asp?R=&amp;ID=485 |archivedate=30 September 2011 |title=New Light on the Shroud |publisher= |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Tiberius became emperor after the death of [[Octavian Augustus]] in AD 14, the 16th year of his reign would be within the span of the years AD 30 to 31.&lt;ref name="TimesFrale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FraleTeleg"&gt;Daily Telegraph: "Jesus Christ's 'death certificate' found on Turin Shroud" [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6617018/Jesus-Christs-death-certificate-found-on-Turin-Shroud.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Frale's methodology has been criticized, partly based on the objection that the writings are too faint to see.&lt;ref name="Poulle 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Jesus Inquest: The Case for and Against the Resurrection of the Christ'' by Charles Foster 2011 {{ISBN|0-8499-4811-8}} ''Appendix 2: The Turin Shroud''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vallerani, Massimo, "I templari e la Sindone: l'"ipotetica della falsità" e l'invenzione della storia", Historia Magistra, 2, 2009, [http://www.francoangeli.it/Riviste/Scheda_Riviste.asp?IDarticolo=37645 abstract]. {{Retrieved |access-date=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Antonio Lombatti, an Italian historian, rejected the idea that the authorities would have bothered to tag the body of a crucified man.

A study by Lorusso ''et al''. subjected two photographs of the shroud to digital image processing, one of them being a reproduction of the photographic negative taken by Giuseppe Enrie in 1931. They did not find any signs, symbols or writing on either image, and noted that these signs may be linked to protuberances in the yarn, as well possibly as to the alteration and influence of the texture of the Enrie photographic negative during its development in 1931.&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt;

Many hypotheses have been formulated and tested to explain the image on the Shroud. According to pro-authenticity authors Baldacchini and Fanti, "the body image of the Turin Shroud has not yet been explained by traditional science; so a great interest in a possible mechanism of image formation still exists", a conclusion also supported by Philip Ball.&lt;ref name=Baldacchini2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fanti2010Corona/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=Philip |title=To know a veil |journal=Nature News |date=28 January 2005 |doi=10.1038/news050124-17 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050128/full/news050124-17.html |accessdate=1 August 2016 |issn=1744-7933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique used for producing the image is, according to Walter McCrone, described in a book about medieval painting published in 1847 by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] (''Methods and Materials of Painting of the Great Schools and Masters''). Eastlake describes in the chapter "Practice of Painting Generally During the XIVth Century" a special technique of painting on linen using tempera paint, which produces images with unusual transparent features—which McCrone compares to the image on the shroud.&lt;ref&gt;Walter C. McCrone, ''Judgment day for the Shroud of Turin'', Amherst, N.Y., Prometheus Books, (1999) {{ISBN|1-57392-679-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-authenticity journals have declared this hypothesis to be unsound, stating that [[X-ray fluorescence]] examination, as well as [[infrared thermography]], did not reveal any pigment.&lt;ref&gt;G. Imbalzano, "Il linguaggio della Sindone", Sindon journal of the ''Centro Internazionale di Sindonologia'' of Turin, n.29, December 1980, pp. 13–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris et al., "X-Ray fluorescence investigation of the Shroud of Turin", ''X-Ray Spectrometry'', vol. 9, n. 2, April 1980, pp. 40–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Adler, "Aspetti fisico-chimici delle immagini sindoniche", ''Sindone, cento anni di ricerca'', Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato, Libreria dello Stato, Roma 1998, pp. 165–184&lt;/ref&gt; The non-paint origin has been further examined by [[Fourier transform]] of the image: common paintings show a directionality that is absent from the Turin Shroud.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Lynn, "Digital enhancement of images of the Shroud of Turin", in: ''Proceedings of the 1977 United States Conference of research on the Shroud of Turin'', Albuquerque 1977, Holy Shroud Guild, New York 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Acid pigmentation=====
In 2009, Luigi Garlaschelli, professor of [[organic chemistry]] at the [[University of Pavia]], announced that he had made a full size reproduction of the Shroud of Turin using only medieval technologies. Garlaschelli placed a linen sheet over a volunteer and then rubbed it with an acidic pigment. The shroud was then aged in an oven before being washed to remove the pigment. He then added blood stains, scorches and water stains to replicate the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garlaschelli |first1=L. |title=Life-size Reproduction of the Shroud of Turin and its Image |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=2010 |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=040301 |doi=10.2352/J.ImagingSci.Technol.2010.54.4.040301}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermic measurements at the [[University of Padua]], "the technique itself seems unable to produce an image having the most critical Turin Shroud image characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;Heimburger T., Fanti G., "[http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/HeimburgerWeb.pdf Scientific Comparison between the Turin Shroud and the First Handmade Whole Copy]", International Workshop on the Scientific Approach to the Acheiropoietos Images, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Heimburger |first2=T. |date=2011 |title=Letter to the Editor Comments on 'Life-Size Reproduction of the Shroud of Turin and Its Image' by L.

Garlaschelli's reproduction was featured in a 2010 National Geographic documentary.  The technique used by Garlaschelli included the bas relief approach (described below) but only for the image of the face. The resultant image was visibly similar to the Turin Shroud, though lacking the uniformity and detail of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/videos/remaking-the-shroud/ |title=Remaking the Shroud |date=22 January 2015 |website=Channel.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the art historian Nicholas Allen, the image on the shroud was formed by a photographic technique in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=7268 Nicholas P L Allen, ''Verification of the Nature and Causes of the Photo-negative Images on the Shroud of Lirey-Chambéry-Turin]''&lt;/ref&gt; Allen maintains that techniques already available before the 14th century—e.g., as described in the [[Book of Optics]], which was at just that time translated from Arabic to Latin—were sufficient to produce primitive photographs, and that people familiar with these techniques would have been able to produce an image as found on the shroud. To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Nicholas P. L. (1993) ''[https://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10413/8589/Allen_Nicholas_P_L_1993.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y The methods and techniques employed in the manufacture of the Shroud of Turin].''&lt;/ref&gt; in papers published in several science journals,&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Nicholas P. L. (1993) ''Is the Shroud of Turin the first recorded photograph? The South African Journal of Art History, 11 November, 23–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Nicholas P. L.

Scientists Emily Craig and Randall Bresee have attempted to recreate the likenesses of the shroud through the dust-transfer technique, which could have been done by medieval arts. They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, "Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.&lt;ref name=Fanti2002/&gt;

Another hypothesis suggests that the Shroud may have been formed using a [[bas-relief]] sculpture. Researcher Jacques di Costanzo, noting that the Shroud image seems to have a three-dimensional quality, suggested that perhaps the image was formed using a three-dimensional object, such as a sculpture. While wrapping a cloth around a life-sized statue would result in a distorted image, placing a cloth over a bas-relief would result in an image like the one seen on the shroud. To demonstrate the plausibility of his hypothesis, Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over the bas-relief. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.&lt;ref name="'Ingham"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results have been obtained by Nickell.

Instead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object – thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |publisher= |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).&lt;ref name=Fanti2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142–154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The [[cellulose]] fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin [[carbohydrate]] layer of [[starch]] fractions, various [[sugars]], and other impurities. In a paper entitled "The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction may explain the image formation,"&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, R.N. and Arnoldi, A.: "The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction (Maillard reaction) may explain the image formation", ''Melanoidins in Food and Health'', Volume 4, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 2003, pp. 106–113, {{ISBN|92-894-5724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond N. Rogers|Raymond Rogers]] and Anna Arnoldi propose that [[amine]]s from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid [[decomposition]] products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]]. However the potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body,&lt;ref name=Rogers2008/&gt;{{rp|100}} and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shroudcentersocal.com/ |format= |title=Features of the Center |publisher=Shroud Center of Southern California |access-date=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas.&lt;ref name=Rogers2008/&gt;{{rp|38}} Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Botella |first2=J.

Alan A. Mills argued that the image was formed by the chemical reaction [[auto-oxidation]]. He noted that the image corresponds to what would have been produced by a volatile chemical if the intensity of the color change were inversely proportional to the distance from the body of a loosely draped cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Alan A. Mills, "Image formation on the Shroud of Turin", in ''Interdisciplinary Science Reviews'', 1995, vol. 20 No. 4, pp. 319–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy source====
Since 1930&lt;ref&gt;N. Noguier de Malijay, ''La Santa Sindone di Torino'', Libreria del S. Cuore, Torino, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; several researchers (J. Jackson, G. Fanti, T. Trenn, T. Phillips, J.-B. Rinaudo and others) endorsed the flash-like irradiation hypothesis. It was suggested that the relatively high definition of the image details can be obtained through the energy source (specifically, [[proton]]ic) acting from inside.&lt;ref name="Jacksonet"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=John P. |last2=Jumper |first2=Eric J. |last3=Ercoline |first3=William R. |title=Correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with the 3-D structure of a human body shape |journal=Applied Optics |date=15 July 1984 |volume=23 |issue=14 |pages=2244 |doi=10.1364/AO.23.002244|pmid=18212985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian researcher Alexander Belyakov proposed an intense, but short flashlight source, which lasted some hundredths of a second.&lt;ref&gt;A. Belyakov, "Prospettive di ricerca in Russia sulla Sindone di Torino", ''Atti del convegno di San Felice Circeo (LT)'' 24–25 agosto 1996, pp. 19–24&lt;/ref&gt; Some other authors suggest the X-radiation&lt;ref&gt;G. Carter, "Formation of the Image on the Shroud of Turin", ''[[American Chemical Society]] Volume on Archaeological Chemistry'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; or a burst of directional [[ultraviolet radiation]] may have played a role in the formation of the Shroud image.&lt;ref name=Baldacchini2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldacchini |first1=G. |last2=Lazzaro |first2=P.

These theories do not include the scientific discussion of a method by which the energy could have been produced.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=====Corona discharge=====
During restoration in 2002, the back of the cloth was photographed and scanned for the first time. Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.&lt;ref&gt;G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, "[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}", 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.

Raymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: "It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin. Corona discharges and/or plasmas made no contribution to image formation."&lt;ref name=Rogers2008&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Raymond N. |title=A Chemist's Perspective On The Shroud of Turin |date=July 2008 |publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu Press, Inc.]] |isbn=9780615239286 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-n84sc4ayYC&amp;pg=PA83}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}}

In December 2011, Fanti published a critical compendium of the major hypotheses regarding the formation of the body image on the shroud. He stated that "none of them can completely explain the mysterious image". Fanti then considered corona discharge as the most probable hypothesis regarding the formation of the body image.&lt;ref name="Fanti1211"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |date=2011 |title=Hypotheses Regarding the Formation of the Body Image: A Critical Compendium [Abstract] |doi=10.2352/J.ImagingSci.Technol.2011.55.6.060507 |journal=[[The Journal of Imaging Science and Technology]] |volume=55 |issue=6 |page=060507}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that it would be impossible to reproduce all the characteristics of the image in a laboratory because the energy source required would be too high.&lt;ref name=Fanti2010Corona&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |date=2010 |title=Can a Corona Discharge Explain the Body Image of the Turin Shroud? |url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JIMTE6000054000002020508000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes&amp;ref=no |journal=J.

=====Ultraviolet radiation=====
In December 2011 scientists at Italy's National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Development [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] deduced from the STURP results that the color of the Shroud image is the result of an accelerated aging process of the linen, similar to the yellowing of the paper of ancient books. They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=2013-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL–SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that "...&amp;nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.&lt;ref name="lazzaro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash? Italian researchers resurrect claim |last=Boyle |first=Alan |website=Cosmic Log |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=23 December 2011 |access-date=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional skeptic [[Joe Nickell]] states that the latest findings are nothing new despite being "dressed up in high-tech tests", and that they don't prove much of anything.&lt;ref name="lazzaro" /&gt;

=====Burial ointments=====
In November 2011, F. Curciarello ''et al.'' published a paper that analyzed the abrupt changes in the yellowed [[fibril]] density values on the Shroud image. They concluded that the rapid changes in the body image intensity are not anomalies in the manufacturing process of the linen but that they can be explained with the presence of aromas or burial ointments.&lt;ref name="Fazio11"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curciarello |first1=F. |last2=De Leo |first2=V. |last3=Fazio |first3=G. |last4=Mandaglio |first4=G. |title=The abrupt changes in the yellowed fibril density in the Linen of Turin |journal=Radiation Effects and Defects in Solids |date=March 2012 |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=224–228 |doi=10.1080/10420150.2011.629320}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their work leaves the existence of an energy source for the image an open question.&lt;ref name="Fazio11" /&gt;

====Minimal Facts approach====
A 2013 study published in a theological journal followed a "Minimal Facts approach" to determine which hypothesis relating to the image formation process "is the most likely". The study concluded "that the probability of the Shroud of Turin being the real shroud of Jesus of Nazareth is very high".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casabianca |first1=Tristan |title=The Shroud of Turin: A Historiographical Approach |journal=The Heythrop Journal |date=May 2013 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=414–423 |doi=10.1111/heyj.12014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Sugusaka Site'''|直坂遺跡|}} is an [[archaeological site]] in the city of [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama]] in the [[Hokuriku region]] of [[Japan]] containing the ruins of a settlement from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period to the [[Jōmon period]]. It has been protected by the central government as a [[Historic Sites of Japan|National Historic Site]] since 1981.&lt;ref name= "Bunka"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bunka.nii.ac.jp/heritages/detail/138387 |title=直坂遺跡|work=Cultural Heritage Online|publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
The site is location on the right bank of the [[Jinzu River]] in what is now part of the Sarukurayama ski resort on the outskirts of the city of Toyama. In this vicinity there are a number of archaeological sites from the Japanese Palaeolithic to the Jōmon era, including the Nozawa site, Yagiyama Ono site, Naosaka Ⅱ site, Naosaka Ⅲ site, Naosaka IV site, indicating that this area has been densely populated since the earliest times. The Sugusaka site was discovered in 1971 during construction work for the establishment of a ranch, when a stone furnace dating from the middle of the Jōmon period was discovered. In response, in 1972 the Toyama Board of Education conducted excavation surveys of the area.

From the Japanese Paleolithic period, some 1200 stone blades were found. These blades were dated to about 25,000 to 30,000 years ago, and are thus the oldest thus found in the Hokuriku region. Apart from this, local polished stone axes and cusp heads of the age following this have been excavated. The site also contained thousands of fist-sized stones which had burn marks. These stones were used for cooking purposes.

Early examples of pottery were also found, including pottery with patterns created by a rolling die, and embossed pottery. These pottery shards were from the [[Hida Province|Hida]], [[Shinano Province|Shinano]], [[Kinki region|Kinki]] and [[Tōkai region]]s indicating long range trade routes from a very early period in Japanese history.

[[Image:tephrochronology iceland.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Geologist explaining the importance of tephochronology to students on field in [[Iceland]].]]
'''Tephrochronology''' is a [[Geochronology|geochronological]] technique that uses discrete layers of [[tephra]]&amp;mdash;volcanic ash from a single eruption&amp;mdash;to create a chronological framework in which [[Paleoenviroment|paleoenvironmental]] or [[Archaeology|archaeological]] records can be placed. Such an established event provides a "tephra horizon". The premise of the technique is that each volcanic event produces ash with a unique chemical "fingerprint" that allows the deposit to be identified across the area affected by fallout. Thus, once the volcanic event has been independently dated, the tephra horizon will act as time marker.

The main advantages of the technique are that the [[volcanic ash]] layers can be relatively easily identified in many sediments and that the [[tephra layer]]s are deposited relatively instantaneously over a wide spatial area. This means they provide accurate temporal marker layers which can be used to verify or corroborate other dating techniques, linking sequences widely separated by location into a unified chronology that correlates climatic sequences and events.

Tephrochronology requires accurate geochemical fingerprinting (usually via an [[electron microprobe]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Westgate (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  An important recent advance is the use of LA-ICP-MS (i.e. [[laser ablation]] [[ICP-MS]]) to measure trace-element abundances in individual tephra shards.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  One problem in tephrochronology is that tephra chemistry can become altered over time, at least for basaltic tephras.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard et al. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early tephra horizons were identified with the [[Saksunarvatn tephra]] (Icelandic origin, {{circa|10.2}} [[Calibration of radiocarbon dates|cal.]] [[Year#SI prefix multipliers|ka]] BP), forming a horizon in the late [[Boreal (period)|Pre-Boreal]] of Northern Europe, the Vedde ash (also Icelandic in origin, c. 12.0 cal. ka BP) and the [[Laacher See]] tephra (in the [[Eifel]] volcanic field, c. 12.9 cal. ka BP). Major volcanoes which have been used in tephrochronological studies include [[Vesuvius]], [[Hekla]] and [[Santorini]]. Minor volcanic events may also leave their fingerprint in the geological record:   [[Hayes Volcano]] is responsible for a series of six major [[tephra layer]]s in the Cook Inlet region of Alaska. Tephra horizons provide a synchronous check against which to correlate the palaeoclimatic reconstructions that are obtained from terrestrial records, like fossil pollen studies ([[palynology]]), from [[varve]]s in lake sediments or from marine deposits and [[Ice core|ice-core records]], and to extend the limits of [[carbon-14 dating]].

A pioneer in the use of tephra layers as [[marker horizon]]s to establish chronology was [[Sigurdur Thorarinsson]], who began by studying the layers he found in his native Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;Alloway et al. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, techniques developed by Chris S. M. Turney ([[QUB]], Belfast; now [[University of Exeter]]) and others for extracting tephra horizons invisible to the naked eye ("cryptotephra")&lt;ref name="Turneyet"&gt;Turney et al. (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; have revolutionised the application of tephrochronology. This technique relies upon the difference between the specific gravity of the microtephra shards and the host sediment matrix. It has led to the first discovery of the Vedde ash on the mainland of Britain, in Sweden, in the [[Netherlands]], in the Swiss Lake [[Soppensee]] and in two sites on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] of Baltic Russia.
It has also revealed previously undetected ash layers, such as the Borrobol Tephra first discovered in northern [[Scotland]], dated to c. 14.4 cal. ka BP,&lt;ref name="Turneyet" /&gt; the microtephra horizons of equivalent geochemistry from southern [[Sweden]], dated at 13,900 Cariaco varve yrs BP&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and from northwest Scotland, dated at 13.6 cal. ka BP.&lt;ref&gt;Ranner et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Urasoe'''|浦添市|Urasoe-shi|[[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]: ''Urashii''}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]].  The neighboring municipalities are [[Naha]] to the south, [[Ginowan]] to the north, and [[Nishihara, Okinawa|Nishihara]] to the east.

As of November 2012, the city has an estimated [[population]] of 113,718 and a [[population density]] of 5,956.9 persons per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The total area is 19.09&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;

[[United States Marine Corps]] base [[Camp Kinser]] is located on the city's coast.

==Etymology==
The name "Urasoe" is made up of two [[kanji]] characters. The first, {{linktext|浦}}, means "a coastal area", and the second, {{linktext|添}}, means "ruling" or "uniting". The name is a reference to "ruling over many areas".&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="n" /&gt;

Urasoe sits to the south of [[Okinawa Island]]. Urasoe is rugged and hilly to the east, and the city slopes gently to the [[East China Sea]] in the west.&lt;ref name="n" /&gt; Urasoe, while formerly agricultural, has become heavily urbanized due to its proximity to the prefectural capital of [[Naha]].&lt;ref name="guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="n" /&gt;

Urasoe was the original capital of the Okinawan kingdom of [[Chūzan]] for several centuries until it was supplanted by [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] in the late 14th or early 15th century. [[Shunten]] (1166 &amp;ndash; 1237), the first known king of the Chuzan Kingdom, located in the central region of the island of Okinawa, ruled from Urasoe, as did his son and grandson.&lt;ref name="d"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; For much of the 14th century, [[Urasoe Castle]] was the largest on the island of Okinawa. The castle now contains the remains of several kings of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pearson"/&gt;

Urasoe was completely razed during the [[Battle of Okinawa]] in 1945 at the end of [[World War II]]. 45% of the population, 4,117 residents, died during the battle. The village office of Urasoe was re-established in 1946 to conduct basic administrative functions, settle refugees returning to the village, and restore agricultural land.&lt;ref name="n" /&gt; The village saw a significant increase in U.S. military presence in 1950 in the western coast of the village, which eventually became [[Camp Kinser]]. The population of Urasoe rapidly from 1956, and the city became a bedroom community of Naha in this period.&lt;ref name="guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="n"/&gt;&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; Urasoe was elevated to city status on July 1, 1970.&lt;ref name="guide"/&gt;

==Economy==
The beer company [[Orion Breweries]] has its headquarters in Urasoe.&lt;ref name="orion"/&gt;
