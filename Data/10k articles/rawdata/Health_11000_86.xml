'''Anatoli Nikolaevich Boukreev''' ({{lang-ru|Анато́лий Никола́евич Букре́ев}}; January 16, 1958 – December 25, 1997) was a [[Russians in Kazakhstan|Russian Kazakhstani]] mountaineer who made ascents of 10 of the 14 [[eight-thousander]] peaks, i.e., peaks above {{convert|8000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, without supplemental [[oxygen]]. From 1989 through 1997, he made 18 successful ascents of peaks above 8000 m.

Boukreev had a reputation as an elite mountaineer in international climbing circles for summiting [[K2]] in 1993 and [[Mount Everest]] via the North Ridge route in 1995. He became even more widely known for his role in saving climbers during the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]].

In 1997, Boukreev was killed in an avalanche during a winter ascent of [[Annapurna]] in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="GammelgaardSeal2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lene Gammelgaard|author2=Press Seal|title=Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyYET6wHSacC&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=25 September 2012|date=20 June 2000|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-095361-4|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boukreev's companion, Linda Wylie, edited his memoirs and published them in 2002 under the title, ''Above the Clouds: The Diaries of a High-Altitude Mountaineer''.

==Biography==
Boukreev was born in [[Korkino, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Korkino]], within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] [[Soviet Union]] (in the present [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]]). He came from the ''narod'', the common people, and his parents were both poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Above the Clouds|author1=Boukreev, Anatoli |author2=Wylie, Linda |page= 7|isbn=0312269706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After completing high school in 1975, he attended Chelyabinsk University for [[Pedagogy]], where he majored in [[physics]] and earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 1979. At the same time, he also completed a coaching program for [[cross-country skiing]].

After graduation, the 21-year-old dreamed of mountain climbing. Boukreev moved to [[Alma-Ata]], the capital of the neighbouring [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] (present day [[Kazakhstan]]) located in the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range. From 1985 he was part of a Kazakhstani mountaineering team, and he became a citizen of Kazakhstan in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Boukreev worked as a commercial guide in the 1990s, and was working with [[Scott Fischer]]'s adventure company [[Mountain Madness]] during the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/11/sports/as-climbers-die-the-allure-of-everest-keeps-on-growing.html?pagewanted=all The New York Times - As Climbers Die, The Allure of Everest Keeps on Growing - By Tim Egan -  Published: March 11, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to survive and was also instrumental in saving the lives of others, including New York socialite [[Sandy Hill (mountaineer)|Sandy Hill Pittman]].&lt;ref name= vogue&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/09/sandy-hill-pittman-mount-everest The Real Story of Sandy Hill Pittman, Everest’s Socialite Climber July 31, 1996 8:00 pm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denali===
In May 1990, Boukreev was invited by an American climber to guide several clients to the summit of Denali in Alaska. Denali, previously known as [[Mount McKinley]], has challenges such as hidden crevasses and unpredictably cold weather due to its proximity to the [[Arctic Circle]] and the ocean.

The expedition was a success and the team reached the summit and returned without incident.  During the climb there had been somewhat of a language barrier and Boukreev felt the sting of needing to borrow equipment due to his economic circumstances.  After the team had returned home, Boukreev decided to attempt a solo speed ascent of Denali before returning to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Boukreev, Anatoli |author2=Wylie, Linda (ed.) |title=Above the Clouds: The Diaries of a High-Altitude Mountaineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0VctgUB2tIC&amp;pg=PA38-43|accessdate=23 September 2012|date=December 2002|publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |isbn=978-0-312-29137-2|pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boukreev's solo speed ascent of Denali in 1990 was completed in 10½ hours from the base to the summit.&lt;ref name= Denali &gt;{{cite book|author1=Anatoli Boukreev|author2=Linda Wylie|title=Above the Clouds: The Diaries of a High-Altitude Mountaineer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0VctgUB2tIC&amp;pg=PA47|date=20 December 2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-29137-2|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That season acclimated climbers were normally taking three to four days and five camps to summit — Boukreev's feat was noted by ''[[Climbing (magazine)|Climbing]]'' magazine in a 1990 issue, and commented on by [[Denali Park]] rangers who described it as "unreal".&lt;ref name= Denali /&gt;

===K2===
In 1993, Boukreev reached the summit of [[K2]] via the [[Abruzzi Spur]], where he shared the peak with team members Peter Metzger of Germany and Andy Locke of Australia. The other team members were German climbers Reinmar Joswig (the team leader) and Ernst Eberhardt.  With a peak elevation of 8,611 metres (28,251&amp;nbsp;ft), K2 is the [[List of highest mountains|second-highest]] mountain on Earth after [[Mount Everest]].

[[File:K2 2006b.jpg|thumb|[[K2]]]]
As part of the [[Karakoram]] [[mountain range|range]], K2 is located on the border between [[Pakistan]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]]. K2 is referred to as the "Savage Mountain" — notable for its steep pyramidal relief, dropping quickly in almost all directions, and the inherent danger in climbing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-big-question-what-makes-k2-the-most-perilous-challenge-a-mountaineer-can-face-885220.html  |title=The Big Question: What makes K2 the most perilous challenge a mountaineer can face? |accessdate=2008-08-07 |author=Jerome Taylor |date=2008-08-05 |work=The Independent |publisher= | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080818214211/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-big-question-what-makes-k2-the-most-perilous-challenge-a-mountaineer-can-face-885220.html| archivedate= 18 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The danger facing Boukreev on K2 was that the summit felt like the finish line. Boukreev would later write that he did not feel the emotions of victory in that moment on top of K2's peak because he was physically and emotionally spent.  Boukreev found himself in a dangerous position.  He had expended too much energy placing fixed lines along a narrow, steep portion earlier that day.  But since the team wanted to push on to the summit that same afternoon, rather than return to their tents to sleep and make a summit bid the next morning, Boukreev acquiesced.&lt;ref&gt;Boukreev; Wylie; ''Above the Clouds'' pp. 92–95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boukreev would later write:

{{Blockquote|During my years of training as a ski racer, and then as a mountaineer, I had learned how to wring out the last of my energy for a finish.  But this is dangerous in mountaineering, because the summit is not the finish of your competition with a great mountain.  To survive you must be able to get down from the forbidden zone.&lt;ref name="Boukreev p. 96"&gt;Boukreev; Wylie; ''Above the Clouds'' p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}}
Boukreev later described feeling like a "squeezed lemon".&lt;ref name="Boukreev p. 96"/&gt;  When Boukreev and the other two climbers began their descent just after sundown they met Reinmar Joswig ascending and near the peak.  Relying heavily on intuition and his previous mountaineering experiences, Boukreev slowly made his way down the steep rock and ice of the mountain.  A [[crampon]] kept coming off of his boot, and at one point he had to use his [[ice axe]] to arrest a fall, keeping himself from sliding into the abyss. Eventually he made his way to the tents at the highest elevation camp.  However, teammates Peter Metzger and Reinmar Joswig never returned from the summit, each having fallen to their death during the descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/adventure/2009/12/andrew-lock-life-in-the-death-zone/|title=Andrew Lock: life in the death zone|work=Australian Geographic|date=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everest===
{{main|1996 Mount Everest disaster}}
Boukreev became widely known as the lead climbing [[guide]] for the [[Mountain Madness]] expedition headed by [[Scott Fischer]] in May 1996. The expedition was one of several attempting to summit Everest on the same day (May 10). Soon after summiting on May 10 a disastrous blizzard struck, stranding many climbers above the [[South Col]] overnight, and by May 11, eight climbers from three different expeditions had perished. Boukreev rescued three climbers stranded in the disaster above 8000 m, and all six of the climbing clients on the Mountain Madness expedition survived the ordeal.[[File:Mount Everest from Rongbuk may 2005.JPG|thumb|View of [[Mount Everest]] from [[Rongbuk Glacier]]]]

[[Galen Rowell]] described Boukreev's rescue efforts in the ''Wall Street Journal'' as:
{{cquote|One of the most amazing rescues in mountaineering history performed single-handedly a few hours after climbing Everest without oxygen...&lt;ref&gt;Galen Rowell, ''Wall Street Journal'', May 29, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, author [[Jon Krakauer]] was generally critical of Boukreev in his book, ''[[Into Thin Air]].''  Subsequently, Boukreev was contacted by various media for a response, and also wrote his own account of the events on Everest in ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]'', a book co-written with Gary Weston DeWalt.

The core of the controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:b1Hxfe1aPSYJ:www.pauldeegan.com/expeditions/the_climb_review.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESixpTIBjGVvvO0PAsq8Fw9UxEshbEhmPAAA42XHvC9F0givAsva_zdiQBLvM4gQtlGkO8LKeFbkPvNoh7BerDF6DCQ9jBRhQk-Zs8f67GYWCsNFe4YXA_UU_7rJazwoq0_2MnX2&amp;sig=AHIEtbRpgC9jscLCSegMctg4alp6SQFJtw|title=''Review of The Climb''|author=Deegan, Paul|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Boukreev's decision to attempt the summit without supplementary oxygen and to descend to the camp ahead of his clients in the face of approaching darkness and blizzard. He was one of the first to reach the summit on the day of the disaster and stayed at or near the summit for nearly 1.5 hours helping others with their summit efforts, before returning to his tent by 5 pm on May 10, well ahead of the later summiters on his team.

Boukreev's supporters point to the fact that his return to camp allowed him enough rest that, when the blizzard had subsided around midnight, he was able to mount a rescue attempt and to lead several climbers still stranded on the mountain back to the safety of the camp. Boukreev's detractors say that had he simply stayed with the clients, he would have been in better position to assist them down the mountain, though it should be noted that every one of Boukreev's clients survived, including the three (Pittman, Fox, Madsen) that he rescued on May 11 after he had rested and overcome hypoxia. The only client deaths that day were suffered by the [[Adventure Consultants]] expedition, led by guide [[Rob Hall]], who lost his own life when he chose to stay and help a client complete a late summit rather than helping the client descend.&lt;ref name=Lopsang&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outsideonline.com/outside/destinations/199609/199609_everest_clarification_4.html |title=Lopsang Jangbu Sherpa's response to Krakauer's article |publisher=Outsideonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919000319/http://outsideonline.com/outside/destinations/199609/199609_everest_clarification_4.html |archivedate=September 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |quoted=true |quote= Mountaineer [[Ed Viesturs]] commented on Boukreev in a 2011 interview: "Anatoli was just an amazing person," Viesturs recalled. "I’d met him long before the Everest tragedy, in the early '80s when I was guiding in the Pamirs. He was one of the coaches in the Soviet sports federations back then, when I traded him gear for badly needed ice screws. One thing I gave him in return was this old fleece-lined JanSport bomber hat, he wore that thing on almost all his climbs after that. Anatoli spoke English very poorly, and for that reason a lot of people did not appreciate his skill as a climber and did not realize how thoughtful, introspective and poetic he was.&lt;ref name= Potterfield&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatoutdoors.com/published/the-will-to-climb|title=The Will to Climb: Ed Viesturs, America's best known high altitude climber, recounts his epic adventures on Annapurna with a new book|author=Potterfield, Peter|date=2011-11-10|publisher=greatoutdoors.com|accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before returning to the U.S. after the events on Everest in 1996, Boukreev climbed the 8,516 metres (27,940&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Lhotse]], which is in proximity to Everest. He decided on a solo ascent because he hoped that in the process of climbing it he might find some inner clarity to what had just transpired on Everest.&lt;ref name= Boukreev &gt;{{cite book|title=Above the Clouds|author1=Boukreev, Anatoli |author2=Wylie, Linda |pages=165–169|isbn=0312269706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Anatoli Boukreev was awarded the [[David A. Sowles Memorial Award]] by the [[American Alpine Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanalpineclub.org/p/sowles-award |title=David A. Sowles Memorial Award -  American Alpine Club |work=americanalpineclub.org |accessdate=27 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927000946/http://www.americanalpineclub.org/p/sowles-award |archivedate=27 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award recognizes people "who have distinguished themselves, with unselfish devotion at personal risk or sacrifice of a major objective, in going to the assistance of fellow climbers imperiled in the mountains. It is dedicated to the memory of David A. Sowles." It was presented to him by [[Jim Wickwire]], the first American to summit K2. The award is the American Alpine Club's highest award for valor in recognition of his role in rescuing climbers in the 1996 Everest disaster.&lt;ref name=Sowles&gt;{{cite web|title=David A.

==Death==
Three weeks after receiving the David A. Sowles Memorial Award, Boukreev began his attempt to climb the south face of [[Annapurna|Annapurna I]] ({{convert|8091|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) along with [[Simone Moro]], an accomplished [[Italy|Italian]] mountaineer. They were accompanied by Dimitri Sobolev, a [[cinematographer]] from [[Kazakhstan]] who was documenting the attempt. On December 25 around noon, Boukreev and Moro were fixing [[rope]]s in a [[couloir]] at around the {{convert|5700|m|ft|abbr=on}} level.&lt;ref&gt;Boukreev; Wylie; ''Above the Clouds'' pp. 226–227.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddenly, an enormous [[cornice (climbing)|cornice]] broke loose from the heights of Annapurna's Western Wall and rumbled down the {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} long couloir. The [[avalanche]] knocked Moro down the mountain where he landed just above their tent at Camp I {{convert|5200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Fortuitously, Moro had somehow stayed near the top of the avalanche debris and managed to dig himself out after a few minutes. Unable to see or hear any signs of Boukreev or Sobolev (whom Moro had witnessed disappearing beneath "car-sized blocks of ice"),&lt;ref&gt;Boukreev; Wylie; ''Above the Clouds'' p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Moro descended to Annapurna base camp where he was flown by helicopter back to [[Kathmandu]] for surgery on his hands, which had been ripped down to the [[tendon]]s during the fall.[[File:Anatoli Boukreev Memorial at Annapurna Base Camp.jpg|thumb|Anatoli Boukreev memorial at [[Annapurna]] base camp]]

News of the accident reached [[New Mexico]] on December 26. Linda Wylie, Boukreev's girlfriend, left for [[Nepal]] on December 28. Several attempts were made to reach the avalanche site by helicopter but inclement weather in late December prevented search teams from reaching Camp I. On January 3, 1998, searchers were finally able to reach Camp I and an empty tent.  Linda Wylie subsequently issued a somber statement from Kathmandu:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the end... there are no hopes of finding him alive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boukreev had dreamt in detail of dying in an avalanche nine months before his death.  The only thing missing was the name of the mountain. When Boukreev's companion tried to convince him to take a different path in life to avoid a fate that Boukreev was convinced of, he responded, "Mountains are my life...my work.  It is too late for me to take up another road."&lt;ref&gt;Boukreev; Wylie; ''Above the Clouds'' p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial===
At the site of [[Annapurna]] base-camp there is a memorial [[chorten]] to Boukreev including a quotation of his:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion."&lt;!-- hiding part not on the memorial  ..I go to them as humans go to worship. From their lofty summits I view my past, dream of the future and, with an unusual acuity, am allowed to experience the present moment...my vision cleared, my strength renewed. In the mountains I celebrate creation. On each journey I am reborn. --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
Icelandic actor [[Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson]] portrays Boukreev in the [[Baltasar Kormákur]] film, ''[[Everest (2015 film)|Everest]]'',  about the 1996 Everest disaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">The '''Artificial Limb &amp; Appliance Service''' (ALAS) is an NHS Wales organisation providing support, equipment and rehabilitation to people with permanent or long-term impairment. It is commissioned by Health Commission Wales (an executive agency of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]]), and is provided through a consortium arrangement between three [[NHS Wales]] trusts, each hosting one centre (ALAC). The centres are situated in:
*[[Cardiff]] at [[Rookwood Hospital]] (part of the [[Cardiff and Vale University Health Board]])
*[[Swansea]] at [[Morriston Hospital]] (part of the [[Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board]])
*[[Wrexham]] at Maelor Hospital (part of the [[Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board]])

==History==
The Artificial Limb &amp; Appliance Service originated during the [[First World War]]. The [[War Office]] (precursor to the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) set up a service in [[Roehampton]] to deal with the needs of military [[amputee]]s. 

From the 1960s, the service had expanded and was operated by the UK Government's [[Department of Health and Social Security]] for a largely civilian population.  By then, [[wheelchair]] supply and other related disablement services had been added to the remit. The majority of service users were elderly individuals who often had disabilities due to systemic medical conditions.

In 1984 the British government set up the McColl working party to review and report on the quality and management of disablement services in England. In 1986 it recommended a new management board should be set up to manage their efficiency and cost effectiveness.  As a result, the Disablement Services Authority (DSA) was set up in England to manage the 49 Artificial Limb &amp; Appliance Centres (ALACs) through regional and district health authorities by 1991.  ALAC services were transferred to the [[National Health Service]] in England in July 1991.

After a period of consultation, it was agreed the Welsh Health Common Services Authority (WHCSA) should assume operational management responsibility for the services in April 1988.  The Artificial Eye Service in Wales remained under [[Welsh Office]] management until it too was transferred to the WHCSA in 1993.  At the time, it was agreed that the transfer should be for an interim period - April 1988 to April 1991.  There would then be further consultation with the wider NHS in Wales. 

In 1995 the [[Secretary of State]] decided that the management of ALAS should transfer to the [[University Hospital of Wales]], [[Morriston]] and [[Wrexham]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3730">The '''Australian Veterinary Association''' ('''AVA''') is a not-for-profit association representing more than 6000 Australian [[veterinarians]] working in private practice, government, industry, and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Australian Veterinary Association|url=http://www.ava.com.au|accessdate=28 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723052420/http://www.ava.com.au/| archivedate= 23 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AVA was mooted before the First World War but not founded until 1921.  The nineteenth century predecessor organisation was the Australasian Veterinary Medical Association &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8511382 |title=Australasian Veterinary Medical Association. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne  |date=14 April 1883 |accessdate=19 May 2012 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/animal/a-veterinary-awakening-the-history-of-government-veterinarians-in-australia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511084806/http://daff.gov.au/animal-plant-health/animal/a-veterinary-awakening-the-history-of-government-veterinarians-in-australia |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent veterinarians who have been members of the Australian Veterinary Association include Professor J.D. Stewart (who was the first AVA President), [[Ian Clunies Ross]] (former head of the CSIRO), and parasitologist [[Hugh Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Veterinary History Society | title=Eminent Australian veterinarians | publication-date=2002 | publisher=Australian Veterinary History Society | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34369669 | accessdate=19 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AVA provides information resources, continuing education opportunities, publications, public education programs, and professional support. The AVA also lobbies government on a number of fronts. Special interest groups have existed within the AVA since the early 1960s. These include groups dedicated to equine medicine, cattle, practice management, avian health, sheep, conservation and animal welfare. Some of the special interest groups publish their own peer reviewed journals. The Australian Veterinary History Society is a division of the association &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Veterinary History Society | title=Milestones in Australian veterinary history | publication-date=2002 | publisher=Australian Veterinary History Society | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34369819 | accessdate=19 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent lobbying efforts include  [[Live Export|live cattle export]] and research into the deadly [[Henipavirus|Hendra Virus]].

The AVA has published the ''Australian Veterinary Journal'' since 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58257144 |title=VETERINARY JOURNAL. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Perth  |date=26 April 1925 |accessdate=19 May 2012 |page=26 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Australian Veterinary Association | author2=Blackwell Publishing | title=Australian veterinary journal | publication-date=1927 | publisher=Australian Veterinary Association | issn=0005-0423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11399">'''Baseball law in the United States''' refers to the various civil statutes, local ordinances, and court decisions pertaining to the game of [[baseball]] and its institutions, as distinguished from the [[Baseball rules|Rules of Baseball]], which are a private codification of rules governing the internal workings of baseball games.

==Nineteenth-century baseball law==

Both the early rules (which act as the laws of the game) and the legal cases surrounding the sport impact the way baseball is played to this day. Documentation of early baseball law exists but has been rarely studied. Nonetheless its presence in legal disputes and records indicate that it was an important part of life prior to the year 1900. In fact, references to baseball are present in 168 legal cases decided before the turn of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, R. M. and Coleman, P. ''Early Baseball Law,'' 45 American Journal of Legal History 117 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Blue law|"Blue" laws]]==

In America’s past, “blue” laws prohibited business from taking place on the [[Sabbath]]. This was an issue for baseball teams who were playing for spectators on Sundays. On April 30, 1891, Tim O’Rourk and 19 others were the subject of a criminal complaint that pertained to them playing baseball for an audience of about 3,000 in Lincoln Park the previous Sunday. The case of ''State v. O’Rourk'' ensued.

It was illegal at the time for anyone over age 14 “engage in sporting” on a Sunday. The penalty for which was “a fine of $20, incarceration for 20 days, or both.” The accused argued that baseball didn’t fall under the category of “sport” and that they were remotely located enough so as not to have offended those observing the Sabbath. The presiding judge dismissed the case on those grounds. However, Chief Justice Maxwell of the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, R. M. and Coleman, P. ''Early Baseball Law,'' 45 American Journal of Legal History 117, 123-24 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

This case showed that there was a growing class of people willing to depart from tradition and attend a baseball game on a Sunday. It also indicates that there were those who adamantly resisted such change.

==Star players==
[[File:John Montgomery Ward.jpg|upright|thumb|right|John Montgomery Ward]]
“[[Free agency (sports)|Free agency]]” did not exist as it does today in baseball until the 1970s. Instead, players were bound to their teams by something called the “[[reserve clause]]. John “Monte” Ward was the first to oppose this in November 1889. He was a star player for the National League’s New York Giants, but was also an author and lawyer.

The “reserve” clause did not specify terms of contract, salary or agreements between player and teams. A judge ultimately ruled that with such fundamental questions left unanswered, the clause could not reasonably be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, R. M. and Coleman, P. ''Early Baseball Law,'' 45 American Journal of Legal History 117, 123-24 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first case of many that ruled in favor of the individual player rather than the team. It allowed star players more choices and the ability to use competition to increase their value.

=="[[Jim Crow]]” ball==

Hispanic, black and white Americans have all played baseball since the sport began. In the early days of the sport, [[Racial integration|integrated]] teams were not uncommon, with players of color able to play alongside their white counterparts.

However, dating back to as early as 1867, the [[racism]] of the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era crept into the national pastime.&lt;ref&gt;George Kirsch, “Blacks, Baseball and the Civil War,” The New York Times (New York, NY), Sept. 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Crow laws were present from [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] into the 1960s and in some instances applied directly to baseball.  However, segregation in Major League baseball began to end with the signing and participation of [[Jackie Robinson]] with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1947.

==Lawlessness==

It cannot be denied that early baseball law was lax compared to the standards of today. As with so many other examples, the development of baseball law mirrors the arc of America’s history at large. Despite the many cases and legal examples, historians Robert M. Jarvis and Phyllis Coleman have suggested that “early baseball was a lawless place, just like America itself.”&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, R.M. and Coleman, P. ''Early Baseball Law,'' 45 American Journal of Legal History 117, 130 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball and the legal profession==

Innumerable American lawyers and judges have played baseball &amp;ndash; amateur or professional &amp;ndash; since the game coalesced in the 19th century.  Perhaps the iconic legal publication regarding baseball is the article "[[The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule]]", written by [[Philadelphia]] attorney [[William S. Stevens]] and published in the [[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5322&amp;context=penn_law_review''Aside.  The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule,''] 123 U. Penn. L. Rev. 1474 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Five of the ten [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioners of Baseball]] have been lawyers:

In [[Iceland]], '''Beer Day''' ({{lang-is|Bjórdagurinn}} or ''{{lang|is|Bjórdagur}}''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/19505 8 Things You Might Not Know About Iceland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106142333/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/19505 |date=2008-11-06 }} from mentalfloss.com&lt;/ref&gt;) is celebrated every year on March 1, honoring the elimination of the 74-year [[prohibition in Iceland|prohibition of beer]].  Prohibition lasted from January 1, 1915 to March 1, 1989.

==Origin==
{{main|Prohibition in Iceland}}
In a 1908 referendum, Icelanders voted in favor of a ban on all alcoholic drinks, going into effect Jan. 1, 1915. In 1921, the ban was partially lifted after [[Spain]] refused to buy Iceland's [[Economy of Iceland#Imports and exports|main export]], fish, unless Iceland bought Spanish wines; then lifted further after a national referendum in 1935 came out in favor of legalizing [[Distilled beverage|spirits]]. Strong beer (with an [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] of 2.25% or more&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/11/world/beer-soon-for-icelanders.html "Beer (Soon) for Icelanders"] the New York Times, May 11, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;), however, was not included in the 1935 vote in order to please the [[Temperance movement|temperance lobby]]—which argued that because beer is cheaper than spirits, it would lead to more depravity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4-puvJH_lykC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=beer+day+in+iceland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aRNI6LHEL0&amp;sig=d-9r7_dW1XcQ6sAKtOFIM2d4Gds&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA63,M1] Insight Guides, Jane Simmonds, Tom Le Bas, Brian Bell, ''Iceland'', p.63, 1999 ({{ISBN|0-88729-176-7}}, 9780887291760)&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Tourism|international travel]] brought Icelanders back in touch with beer, bills to legalize it were regularly moved in [[parliament]], but inevitably were shot down on technical grounds. Prohibition lost more support in 1985, when the [[Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (Iceland)|Minister of Justice]] (himself a [[teetotaler]]) prohibited pubs from adding legal spirits to legal non-alcoholic beer (called "[[pilsner]]" by Icelanders&lt;ref&gt;[http://env-sci.blogspot.com/2007/01/beer-like-bjrlki.html "Beer-like = Bjórlíki?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708034341/http://env-sci.blogspot.com/2007/01/beer-like-bjrlki.html |date=2011-07-08 }} föstudagur, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) to make a potent imitation of strong beer. Soon after, beer approached legalization in parliament—a full turnout of the upper house of Iceland's Parliament voted 13 to 8 to permit the sales, ending prohibition on the island.

==Celebration==

The first Beer Day, Ölstofan bar owner Kormákur Geirharðsson recalls:

{{Quote|I remember a lot of drinking and a lot of pissing all night long and the next days, and it [was] not stopping. This was the day Icelanders took the step to try to become civilized.  Ölstofan was not open then, but the idea of owning a bar started there.|''The Reykjavik Grapevine''|&lt;ref name="Iceland Gets the Beer Back"&gt;[http://www.grapevine.is/Art/ReadArticle/Iceland-gets-the-beer-back "Iceland Gets the Beer Back"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081129041957/http://www.grapevine.is/Art/ReadArticle/Iceland-gets-the-beer-back |date=2008-11-29 }} from the Reykjavik Grapevine&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the end of prohibition, Icelanders have celebrated every Beer Day by imbibing the drink in various bars, restaurants, and clubs. Those located in [[Reykjavík]], the capital and largest city in Iceland, are especially wild on Beer Day.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goscandinavia.about.com/b/2008/02/25/iceland-beer-day.htm "March 1 is Beer Day!"] from goscandinavia.about.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goiceland.org/dateline_17.html "Yet another reason to love Iceland"] from the Iceland Tourist Board&lt;/ref&gt; A ''{{lang|is|Rúntur}}'' ([[pub crawl]]) is a popular way of getting to know the various bars and beers in this city, many being open until 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldeventsguide.com/event/191/Reykjav-k-Iceland/Beer-Day.html Beer Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201150548/http://www.worldeventsguide.com/event/191/Reykjav-k-Iceland/Beer-Day.html |date=2009-02-01 }} from worldeventsguide.com&lt;/ref&gt; The legalization of beer remains a cultural milestone in Iceland, and a major seismic shift in the nation’s alcoholic beverage preference. Beer has today become the most popular alcoholic beverage of choice.&lt;ref name="Iceland Gets the Beer Back" /&gt;

The celebration of Beer Day in Iceland has inspired a similar event in the U.S., known as Iceland Beer Day, or IBD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icelandbeerdayusa.com/ Iceland Beer Day USA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303180933/http://icelandbeerdayusa.com/ |date=2011-03-03 }} official site&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benign hypertension''' or '''benign essential hypertension''' are historical terms that are considered misleading&lt;ref name="pmid14175874"&gt;{{cite journal |author=McIver C |title=Blood pressure; a consideration of terminology |journal=Can Med Assoc J |volume=91 |issue= |pages=578–80 |date=September 1964 |pmid=14175874 |pmc=1927435}}&lt;/ref&gt; as hypertension is never benign, and consequently they have fallen out of use (see [[history of hypertension]]).

The '''Beverton–Holt model''' is a classic [[Discrete time and continuous time|discrete-time]] [[population modeling|population model]] which gives the [[expected value|expected]] number ''n''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''+1&lt;/sub&gt; (or [[population density|density]]) of individuals in generation ''t''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 as a function of the number of individuals in the previous generation,

: &lt;math&gt;n_{t+1} = \frac{R_0 n_t}{1+ n_t/M}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is interpreted as the proliferation rate per generation and ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;''M'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the environment. The Beverton–Holt model was introduced in the context of [[fisheries management|fisheries]] by [[Ray Beverton|Beverton]] &amp; [[Sidney Holt|Holt]] (1957). Subsequent work has derived the model under other assumptions such as [[competition (biology)|contest competition]] (Brännström &amp; Sumpter 2005), within-year resource limited competition (Geritz &amp; Kisdi 2004)  or even as the outcome of a source-sink Malthusian patches linked by density-dependent dispersal (Bravo de la Parra et al. 2013). The Beverton–Holt model can be generalized to include [[scramble competition]] (see the [[Ricker model]], the [[Hassell model]] and the [[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith]]–Slatkin model). It is also possible to include a parameter reflecting the spatial clustering of individuals (see Brännström &amp; Sumpter 2005).

Despite being [[nonlinear]], the model can be solved explicitly, since it is in fact an inhomogeneous linear equation in 1/''n''.
The solution is
{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}


: &lt;math&gt;
n_t = \frac{K n_0}{n_0 + (K - n_0) R_0^{-t}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Because of this structure, the model can be considered as the discrete-time analogue of the continuous-time [[Logistic function#Logistic differential equation|logistic equation]] for [[population growth]] introduced by [[Pierre Verhulst|Verhulst]]; for comparison, the logistic equation is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right),&lt;/math&gt;

and its solution is

: &lt;math&gt;
N(t) = \frac{K N(0)}{N(0) + (K - N(0)) e^{-rt}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

A '''biorepository''' is a [[biotic material|biological materials]] repository that collects, processes, stores, and distributes [[biological specimens|biospecimen]]s to support future scientific investigation&lt;ref&gt;ISBER Newsletter Volume No.1, Issue No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Biorepositories can contain or manage specimens from animals, including humans, and many other living organisms. [[Vertebrate]]s, [[invertebrate]]s, [[arthropod]]s, and other life forms are just a few of the many classes of living organisms which can be studied by preserving and storing samples taken.

==Purpose==
The purpose of a biorepository is to maintain biological specimens, and associated information, for future use in research.  The biorepository assures the quality, and manages the accessibility and distribution/disposition of the biospecimens in its collection.

==Operations==
The four main operations of a biorepository are; (i) collection  (ii) processing, (iii) storage or inventory, and (iv) distribution of biological specimens.

(i) Collection or accession is the first operation, whereby samples are recorded as having arrived. Today this is typically performed by scanning the sample barcode with a barcode scanning device. Information about the sample is transferred into the laboratory information management system ("LIMS"). Typical data captured would be the origin of the sample and arrival data / time recording in the LIMS.

(ii) Processing of samples is normally a quality tested process that is performed the same way to each of the samples to minimize variation due to sample handling and prepare the sample for storage. The process is usually one that facilitates long-term storage of a particular sample type - for example DNA samples are processed into a salt buffer (aqueous solution) of proper pH to stabilize the DNA for storage.

(iii) Storage and inventory are where all samples are held prior to being requested via a distribution request. The inventory system is composed of sample holding boxes and the boxes are stored in freezers of various types depending on the sample storage requirements.

(iv) Distribution is the process of retrieving one or more samples from the biorepository inventory system.

== Standard Operating Procedures ==
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) play a crucial role in the biorepository industry. There are a number of reasons why they are important: 
* SOPs reduce incidences of problematic variables appearing within the samples and storage processes by providing standardized guidelines for proper storage and care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/biobanking/genomic-medicine-biobanking-sops/|title=Genomic Medicine: Biobanking Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)|date=2015-12-08|work=Inside Biobanking|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biospecimen samples should closely resemble biospecimens in their natural state. SOPs help ensure that.
* SOPs provide a standardized framework of how to conduct operations within a biorepository. They ensure seamless and reliable processes be implemented throughout operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.geneticistinc.com/blog/the-importance-of-standard-operating-procedures-sops-in-biobanking|title=The Importance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPS) in Biobanking|work=Biorepository|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angel of Mercy, Carney Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Relief of the [[Miraculous Medal]] on the facade of Carney Hospital (2006)]]
Carney Hospital was established in 1863 in [[South Boston]] by [[Andrew Carney]] with a $75,000 donation and with Sister Ann Alexis Shorb, Carney's choice for its first administrator and a member of the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul]]. It was located on the former Hall Jackson Howe estate on Old Harbor Street on [[South Boston|Telegraph Hill]]. The hospital was designed by Boston City Architect Charles Bateman.&lt;ref name="SAMMARCO2000"&gt;Sammarco, Anthony Mitchell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_JriOswcNEQC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''South Boston, Volume 2''], Arcadia Publishing, 2000.

'''The Coaching Club'''  or casually: The Coaching Club of New York or New York Coaching Club or Coaching Club of America, was formed in New York in 1875 to encourage four-in-hand driving in America.  It was intended to attract members from all parts of the United States.

Initiated by Colonels [[DeLancey Astor Kane|DeLancey Kane]] and [[William Jay (Colonel)|William Jay]] who both died in 1915 its first official meeting was at the [[Knickerbocker Club]] on Fifth Avenue on December 3, 1875.  The Knickerbocker Club became its headquarters. Later some activities were moved nearer Central Park to the [[Metropolitan Club]], nine members of which were founders of the Coaching Club. 

The Coaching Club's annual parade was replaced about 1917 by [[Belmont Park]]'s [[Coaching Club American Oaks]], a race for three-year-old mares.

[[File:Coaching – Four in Hand – A Swell Turn-out MET DP818681.jpg|thumb]]
==Activities==
There were regular events, dinners and annual parades through [[Central Park]].

==Membership==
Qualification for membership: "the ability to drive four horses with grace and skill". Driving four-in-hand requires the coachman to hold the reins of all four horses in one fist. 

Coaching was a very expensive pursuit and membership, at first restricted to fifty then thirty people at any one time, was limited to those owners and drivers of coaches drawn by four horses that had no involvement in racing, hunting or polo. It became difficult to keep a full membership and from 1925 members were allowed those associations.

===''Pioneer''===
The club owned its own coach, ''Pioneer''. The general public could buy seats in members' coaches and be driven about by the club members. When it was pointed out the result was New York's aristocracy carried common citizens members responded that some of the English aristocracy had driven scheduled public services for some time.

===''Tally-ho''===
One of the original Coaching Club coaches belonging to Kane was called ''Tally-ho''. It became so well known any coach-and-four was called a ''[[tally-ho#United States|tally-ho]]'' by the general public. Kane's ''Tally-ho'' was donated to the [[Museum of the City of New York]] in 1933 and now may be seen at the [[Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages]] in Stony Brook, N.Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">"'''Cogito and the History of Madness'''" is a paper by [[Jacques Derrida]] that critically responds to [[Michel Foucault|Michel Foucault's]] book the [[Madness and Civilization|''History of Madness'']].&lt;ref name=Derrida1963&gt;Derrida, Jacques, 1978. "Cogito and the History of Madness" from ''Writing and Difference'' trans. Alan Bass. London &amp; New York: Routledge. pp. 36–76.&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, Derrida questions the intentions and feasibility of Foucault's book, particularly in relation to the historical importance attributed by Foucault to the treatment of madness by [[Descartes]] in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Derrida's paper began a high-profile exchange between Derrida and Foucault as well as a considerable amount of attention from scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, R., 1990. Foucault and Derrida: The other side of reason. London: Unwin Hyman. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault responded directly to Derrida in an appendix added to the 1972 edition of the ''History of Madness'' titled "My body, this paper, this fire." Derrida again considered Foucault's 1961 text on madness with "To do Justice to Freud: The History of madness in the age of psychoanalysis" in 1991. The exchange between Derrida and Foucault was sometimes acrimonious and it is said that "the two writers stopped communicating for ten years."&lt;ref&gt;Khalfa, J., 2006. "Introduction" from M. Foucault ''History of Madness''. Translated by J. Murphy and J. Khalfa. Edited by J. Khalfa. London and New York: Routledge. p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators on the exchange include [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[Geoffrey Bennington]], [[Slavoj Žižek]], [[Edward Saïd]], [[Rémi Brague]], [[Manfred Frank]], and [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

It had been stated that Derrida first used the neologism ''[[différance]]'' in "Cogito and the History of Madness",&lt;ref&gt;"Schultz, W.R. &amp; Fried, L.B., 1992. Jacques Derrida: An Annotated Primary and Secondary Bibliography. London &amp; New York: Garland."&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent research has called this into question.&lt;ref&gt;James, Seferin. 2011. "Derrida, Foucault and 'Madness, the absence of an œurvre'" in ''Meta: Research in Hermeneutics, Phenomenology and Practical Philosophy'' Vol. 3(2). pp. 380-381.&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__

==Presentation and publication==

Derrida presented the paper “Cogito and the History of Madness” at the ''Collège Philosophique'' in 1963. Derrida sent a letter inviting Foucault to attend this presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M., 1994. Dits et Écrits 1954–1988, vol. I: 1954–1969. Edited by D. Defert, F. Ewald, J. Lagrange. Paris: Gallimard. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was subsequently published in the ''Revue de métaphysique et de morale'' in 1963 with the addition of a short passage inserted between brackets. Additional notes to the paper were published in the next issue of the ''Revue de métaphysique et de morale'' in 1964. The paper was subject to a further revision for its inclusion in the 1967 collection ''L'écriture et la différence''. The paper was translated into English by Alan Bass in 1978 as part of ''[[Writing and Difference]]''.

==Structure of the paper==
===Epigraphs===

Derrida prefaces the paper with two quotations. The first quotation is [[Søren Kierkegaard]] stating that "The instant of decision is madness".&lt;ref name=Derrida1963p36&gt;Derrida, Jacques, 1978. "Cogito and the History of Madness" from ''Writing and Difference'' trans. Alan Bass. London &amp; New York: Routledge. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard characterises the instant of decision as madness because it is only when one choice is not clearly superior to another {{mdash}} when reason fails to indicate which option is better {{mdash}} that a choice really needs to be made. The second quotation is [[James Joyce]] stating of [[Ulysses (novel)|''Ulysses'']] that "In any event this book was terribly daring. A transparent sheet separates it from madness."&lt;ref name=Derrida1963p36 /&gt;

===Point of departure===

Derrida states that his point of departure for "Cogito and the History of Madness" is Foucault's 1961 book [[Madness and Civilization|''Folie et déraison'']].&lt;ref name=Derrida1963p36 /&gt; Derrida's paper primarily relies on two sections of Foucault's work, the original 1961 preface in which Foucault makes a number of general comments about the book, setting forth his intentions and methodology, and two and a half pages at the start of the second chapter where Foucault links [[Descartes]] to an historical event that silenced madness at the end of the classical age. Foucault's 1961 text was heavily abridged for a popular edition in 1964 that formed the basis for Richard Howard's translation of the text into English as ''[[Madness and Civilization]]''. The abridged 1964 edition removed the pages concerning Descartes on which Derrida had explicitly based his argument in "Cogito and the History of Madness." These pages on Descartes were only made available in English with Jean Khalfa's 2006 translation of Foucault's work on madness.

===Allusion to Hegel===

Derrida makes an allusion to the [[master–slave dialectic]] in [[Hegel|Hegel's]] ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' in the opening pages of "Cogito and the History of Madness."

===Argument concerning Descartes===

Foucault writes at the start of the second chapter of the ''[[History of Madness]]'' of a strange violent event that silenced madness at the end of the [[renaissance]] and the beginning of the classical age. He then discusses the treatment of madness by [[Descartes]] in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Foucault argues that Descartes refuses to recognise a commonality between himself and people who are mad and uses this dissociation as an excuse not to take madness seriously as a grounds for doubt. For Foucault this exclusion of madness by Descartes leads to a [[Cogito ergo sum|cogito]] that is more or less arbitrarily self-assured of its own rationality.

Derrida argues that Descartes might appear to dismiss madness at the point of the meditation to which Foucault refers but shortly after this takes madness seriously as a ground for doubt when he considers the possibility of there being an [[evil demon]] controlling his thoughts. Derrida argues that Descartes includes the possibility of his own madness when he hypothesises that an evil demon could corrupt even the most assured and reasonable judgements he can make, such as those of basic arithmetic. Derrida argues that madness is not subject to an arbitrary exclusion by Descartes but that once Descartes earnestly but momentarily enters into the hypothesis of the evil demon he must be reassured by the ordered operative norms of his language and project of [[Human self-reflection|self-reflection]].

'''Contraceptive rights in New Zealand''' are extensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smyth|first1=Helen|title=Rocking the cradle : contraception, sex, and politics in New Zealand|date=2000|publisher=Steele Roberts Ltd|location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=1-877228-16-8|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many options available to women seeking [[contraception]]. There are also options for men. Government funding keeps the cost of most types of contraception low in most cases. [[Family planning]] options in New Zealand are generally in keeping with the United Nations stance towards [[sexual and reproductive rights]] although the country has received criticism in some aspects.

== Contraception as a human right ==
The [[United Nations]] believes that access to family planning services, including contraception, is a [[human right]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Family planning {{!}} UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|url=http://www.unfpa.org/family-planning|website=www.unfpa.org|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] states that 'to maintain one's sexual and reproductive health, people need access to accurate information and the safe, effective, affordable and acceptable contraception method of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual &amp; reproductive health {{!}} UNFPA – United Nations Population Fund|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sexual-reproductive-health|website=www.unfpa.org|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] was [[Ratification|ratified]] by [[New Zealand]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW {{!}} National Council of Women of New Zealand|url=http://www.ncwnz.org.nz/what-we-do/cedaw/|website=www.ncwnz.org.nz|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 12 of the convention states that 'States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, access to health care services, including those related to family planning.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article12|website=www.un.org|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand, as a State which has ratified the Convention, is required to give periodic reports to a convention monitoring committee. The Committee then replies with its concluding observations. New Zealand's most recent report was given to the committee at its 52nd session in July 2012.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; The Committee stated in its concluding observations that it 'commends the State party for its advocacy on the protection of women's sexual and reproductive health rights'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW Concluding Observations|url=http://www.ncwnz.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CEDAW-Concluding-Observations.pdf|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of contraception in New Zealand ==
In the earlier part of the 20th century, 'New Zealand did not have laws against the use of contraception, but there were regulations that stopped people finding out about birth control methods – and sex in general.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taonga|first1=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|title=5.  – Contraception and sterilisation – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/contraception-and-sterilisation/page-5|website=www.teara.govt.nz|accessdate=30 April 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first birth control clinic was opened in [[Auckland]] in 1953 by the New Zealand Family Planning Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smyth|first1=Helen|title=Rocking the cradle : contraception, sex, and politics in New Zealand|date=2000|publisher=Steele Roberts Ltd|location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=1-877228-16-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pill became available in New Zealand in 1961, although its [[Prescription drug|prescription]] was regulated to married women only.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pill – Family Planning|url=http://www.familyplanning.org.nz/news/2013/the-pill|website=www.familyplanning.org.nz|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teenage girls were unlikely to be taking the pill, and did not seek doctors' prescriptions for it. This was because they knew doctors would be unlikely to provide them with it as it was against the policy of the [[New Zealand Medical Association]] to do so, and because it was expensive for young women likely to be earning a low wage, or even none at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smyth|first1=Helen|title=Rocking the cradle : contraception, sex, and politics in New Zealand|date=2000|publisher=Steele Roberts Ltd|location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=1-877228-16-8|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s the Family Planning Association criticised the governments' refusal to give them funding, pointing out that the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] had signed the 1967 United Nations World Leaders Declaration on Population, which advocated for contraception. In December 1971 the New Zealand cabinet approved its first grant to the Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smyth|first1=Helen|title=Rocking the cradle : contraception, sex, and politics in New Zealand|date=2000|publisher=Steele Roberts Ltd|location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=1-877228-16-8|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A national survey in 1979 revealed that over 66% of fertile women were using contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smyth|first1=Helen|title=Rocking the cradle : contraception, sex, and politics in New Zealand|date=2000|publisher=Steele Roberts Ltd|location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=1-877228-16-8|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s a study showed 87% of women surveyed in New Zealand were using some form of contraception, a higher percentage of women than many other countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pool|first1=Ian|title=New Zealand's contraceptive revolutions|date=1999|publisher=Population Studies Centre, Univ. of Waikato|location=Hamilton|isbn=1-877149-99-3|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding and subsidies==
The United Nations has stated that family planning is an essential component in reducing poverty.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; This is also recognised in New Zealand. For women on various [[Ministry of Social Development (New Zealand)|social security benefits]], including girls who are dependent on a parent who receives a benefit, there is a contraceptive grant available which covers the cost of [[long-acting reversible contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Needs Grant Long Acting Reversible Contraception – Work and Income|url=http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/a-z-benefits/sng-contraception.html|website=www.workandincome.govt.nz|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pharmac|Pharmaceutical Management Agency (Pharmac)]] maintains the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule, which lists all medication subsidised by the government in New Zealand. Fully subsidised medication listed on the schedule cost $5 every three months to cover dispensing costs.

== The pill ==
The [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is a common method of contraception in New Zealand alongside the [[progestogen-only pill]] (mini pill). In 2009 approximately 202,000 women in New Zealand were taking the pill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taonga|first1=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|title=3.  – Contraception and sterilisation – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/contraception-and-sterilisation/page-3|website=www.teara.govt.nz|accessdate=30 April 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pill is not available over the counter in New Zealand. It is available by prescription by a health professional such as a [[general practitioner]] or a nurse. Nevertheless, the New Zealand Family Planning website states that 'the pill is easily accessible to all women in New Zealand'.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

Although the [[age of consent]] is 16 in New Zealand, those under 16 can still be given contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contraception For Young Women – Family Planning|url=http://www.familyplanning.org.nz/news/2014/contraception-for-young-women|website=www.familyplanning.org.nz|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental consent for the provision of contraceptives to their children is not required. Section 3 of the [[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]] regulating the provision of contraception to children was repealed in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977 No 112 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act 3 Sale or disposal, etc, of contraceptives to children [Repealed] – New Zealand Legislation|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1977/0112/latest/DLM18145.html|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsidisation ===
As of February 2017, the government subsidised three formulations of the combined oral contraceptive pill ([[ethinyloestradiol]] with [[norethisterone]], ethinyloestradiol with [[desogestrel]], and ethinyloestradiol with [[levonorgestrel]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pharmac.govt.nz/healthpros/PharmaceuticalSchedule/Schedule?code=A130802 |title= Combined Oral Contraceptives – Pharmaceutical Schedule Online |publisher= Pharmaceutical Management Agency |accessdate= 29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two formulations of the progestogen-only pill (levonorgestrel and norethisterone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pharmac.govt.nz/healthpros/PharmaceuticalSchedule/Schedule?code=A130804 |title= Progestogen-only Contraceptives – Pharmaceutical Schedule Online |publisher= Pharmaceutical Management Agency |accessdate= 29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A non-subsidised six-month supply could cost up to $100, depending on its type.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparing The Cost of Contraception – Family Planning|url=http://www.familyplanning.org.nz/news/2014/comparing-the-cost-of-contraception|website=www.familyplanning.org.nz|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointment costs at Family planning clinics may also be subsidised: appointments are free for women under 22 years of age. For women 22 and older, appointments are five dollars for a community services card holder and $27 for those without a community services card.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

=== Issues ===
The Pill is currently classified as a prescription medicine in New Zealand. However, there is debate over whether it should be reclassified as restricted medicine, which would allow it to be sold over the counter in [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]] throughout the country. The company [[Green Cross Health]] Ltd has lobbied to the Medicine Classifications Committee for reclassification since 2014.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pill may go over-the-counter|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/76280880/Contraceptive-pill-may-soon-be-available-over-the-pharmacy-counter|accessdate=30 April 2016|work=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Classifications Committee has stated that it is concerned that sidelining the role of doctors in prescribing contraception may result in inadequate [[counselling]] and advice on sexual health. Green Cross has stated that pharmacists are 'well equipped to consult with women about their contraceptive needs'&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt; and also claims that women would find it more convenient.

== Other forms of contraception available ==
=== Condoms ===

Another common form of contraception in New Zealand is the [[condom]]. These are commonly available at supermarkets and pharmacies in New Zealand. There is no age restriction on buying condoms. These are also available on prescription from a doctor or family planning nurse. When purchased on prescription, they are subsidised for up to 144 condoms. This is significantly cheaper than buying condoms from a store, where the price can be up to $20 for one pack of 12 condoms.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

==Implants==
[[Levonorgestrel implant]]s (Jadelle) are available in New Zealand. These implants are subsidised, although there is a $22 charge for dressing and prescription at family planning clinics.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

[[Etonogestrel contraceptive implant]]s (Implanon) cost around $270 for New Zealand residents from a family planning clinic. They are not government subsidised.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

=== IUDs ===
The [[IUD with copper|copper IUD]] has been available in New Zealand since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smyth|first1=Helen|title=Rocking the cradle : contraception, sex, and politics in New Zealand|date=2000|publisher=Steele Roberts Ltd|location=Wellington, N.Z.|isbn=1-877228-16-8|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand Family Planning website lists it as being available at no cost to New Zealand residents.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

The [[IUD with progestogen|mirena]] device is available in New Zealand for a fee of $333. In some circumstances, the device may be fully subsidised on application to Pharmac.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

=== Sterilisation ===

[[Sterilisation (medicine)|Sterilization]] is a popular method of contraception in New Zealand. It has been claimed by academics that 'sterilization has become the preferred method of fertility regulation among women of older reproductive ages.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pool|first1=Ian|title=New Zealand's contraceptive revolutions|date=1999|publisher=Population Studies Centre, Univ. of Waikato|location=Hamilton|isbn=1-877149-99-3|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often one or the other partner in a relationship undergoes sterilization. Women undergo [[tubal ligation]] and men undergo a [[vasectomy]]. New Zealand Family Planning reports that the country has 'one of the highest rates of vasectomy in the world' with 18% of men and 25% of married men having undergone the procedure. Doctors may object to performing sterilisations on [[conscience]] grounds but must refer the patient to another practitioner.&lt;ref name="Health Law"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skegg|first1=Peter|last2=Paterson|first2=Ron|title=Health Law in New Zealand|date=2015|publisher=Thompson Reuters|location=Wellington|isbn=978-0-86472-943-9|page=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The emergency contraceptive pill ==
The [[Emergency contraception|emergency contraceptive pill]] is available in New Zealand. It is able to be purchased over the counter at pharmacies without a prescription for around $40–$80. Alternatively, they can be obtained for free from a family planning clinic, or at a cost of $5 for a three-pill prescription.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

== Abortion ==

=== The United Nations stance on abortion ===
The [[Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights]] states on its online information series on sexual and reproductive health rights that for women, safe access to abortion is a 'human right'. it further states that 'criminalization of health services that only women require, including abortion, is a form of criminalization against women'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OHCHR Sexual health info|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/SexualHealth/INFO_Abortion_WEB.pdf|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 57th session of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Woman in February 2014, it was stated that abortion should be available in cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape or [[incest]], where there is a threat to the life and/or health of the mother, and where the [[fetus]] is seriously impaired as a minimum standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN CEDAW Statements Feb 2014.|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CEDAW/Statements/SRHR26Feb2014.pdf|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations criticisms of New Zealand ===
In the concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women following New Zealand's report in 2012, the Committee criticised New Zealand's abortion laws.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW Concluding Observations|url=http://www.ncwnz.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/CEDAW-Concluding-Observations.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was concerned that as abortion is still criminalized, women with unwanted pregnancies were at risk of seeking unsafe illegal abortions. It also pointed out that as the law stands, most women seeking abortion are [[Reliant|relying]] on the 'benevolent interpretation of a rule which nullifies their [[autonomy]]'.&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt;
The Committee urged New Zealand to review its abortion law.

=== Abortion legislation ===
In New Zealand abortion is criminalised by the [[Crimes Act 1961]]. Section 183 of the Act states that anyone performing an abortion illegally 'is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years'.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 07 November 2015), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/whole.html|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are exceptions to this listed in section 187A of the Act. An abortion is not illegal if the pregnancy is the result of incest or where the fetus is severely [[handicapped]], or when the continuation of the pregnancy would result in serious danger to the life, [[physical health]] or [[mental health]] of the woman. Rape and extremes of age may also be taken into account.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; The Contraception, Sterilization and Abortion Act 1977 regulates the procedure for granting abortions. Two separate medical consultants must [[certify]] that they believe one of the exempting grounds is applicable to the woman. They are not required to give reasons as to why they believe this.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skegg|first1=Peter|last2=Patterson|first2=Ron|title=Health Law in New Zealand|date=2015|publisher=Thomson Reuters|location=Wellington|isbn=978-0-86472-943-9|page=605}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no age restrictions on abortion and they are performed free of charge to New Zealand residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abortion Services in New Zealand|url=http://abortion.org.nz/|website=Abortion Services in New Zealand|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpretation ===
Legal experts have claimed that the mental health exception has been widely interpreted, with between 97–98% of abortions in New Zealand performed to avoid serious danger to the mental health of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt; In 2014 it was reported that an estimated 15,000 women in New Zealand have an abortion each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is abortion law due for a shakeup?|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/10155612/Is-abortion-law-due-for-a-shakeup|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=1 May 2016|language=English|date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-abortion movements|Anti-abortionists]] have criticised the application of the abortions laws, even taking the Abortion Supervisory Committee to court several times. An example of this is the 2008 case of ''Right to Life New Zealand Inc v Abortion Supervisory Committee''. Miller J of the [[High Court of New Zealand]] stated in his judgment in this case that 99% of women who apply for abortion are granted one and it seemed to him that abortion law was being interpreted in a much more liberal way than the legislation intended.&lt;ref name="Right to Life New Zealand Inc v Abortion Supervisory Committee [2008] 2 NZLR 825 (HC)"&gt;Right to Life New Zealand Inc v Abortion Supervisory Committee [2008] 2 NZLR 825 (HC)|&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Department of Children and Family Services''' ('''DCFS''') is an agency of the [[government of Los Angeles County]]. DCFS's operations involve investigating child welfare and abuse allegations, foster care, and adoption.

DCFS files child welfare allegations in [[Edmund D. Edelman Children's Court]], located in [[Monterey Park, California]], and  the Alfred J. McCourtney Juvenile Justice Center in [[Lancaster, California]]. DCFS is represented by [[Los Angeles County Counsel]]. [[Los Angeles Dependency Lawyers]] represents the parents and Children's Law Center represents the children.

==History==
Los Angeles County Social Services began their origin in the Office of Superintendent of Children's and Women's Work, formed in 1891, to care for destitute women and their children under the guidelines of the 1851 Poor Law.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; The Department of Charities was formed in 1913 and included five Divisions: County Hospital, County Farm, Outdoor Relief, Olive View Sanatorium, and Cemetery Divisions.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013-2014 DCFS Biennial Report|url=http://lacdcfs.org/aboutus/documents/Biennial_Report_LA_Kids.pdf|publisher=DCFS|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By statute enacted in 1903, California's first juvenile court had jurisdiction over dependent, neglected and delinquent children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juvenile Justice in California Part II: Dependency System|url=http://archive.lwvc.org/jjds/chap1.html|publisher=League of Women Voters of California|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Division of Outdoor Relief was expanded and renamed in 1938, the Bureau of Indigent Relief, and in 1943 changed again to the Bureau of Public Assistance. In 1966, the Bureau of Public Assistance became the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPSS History |url=https://dpss.lacounty.gov/about/history.cfm |website=dpss.lacounty.gov |publisher=LA County |accessdate=18 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031131156/http://dpss.lacounty.gov/about/history.cfm |archivedate=31 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, after public discussion and hearings, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors created both the Department of Children Services and the Commission for Children's Services.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Robert|title=Opinion A 30-year time warp for L.A. County child welfare?|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-child-welfare-los-angeles-county-20140502-story.html|website=latimes.com|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Board changed the name to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

==Notable investigations==
According to reports DCFS had investigated [[Michael Jackson]] beginning in 1993 with a sexual abuse allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Jim |last= Newton |first2= Sonia |last2= Nazario |date= August 27, 1993 |title= Police Say Seized Tapes Do Not Incriminate Jackson : Investigation: Officials continue to interview children in connection with molestation allegations. |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-27/news/mn-28516_1_jackson-case |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Chick |last= Philips |first2= David |last2= Ferrell |date= August 31, 1993 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-31/news/mn-39718_1_michael-jackson |title= Tapes Used to Allege Plot to Extort Jackson Released Inquiry: Singer's aides provide purported comments by boy's father, who has told friends allegations are untrue. |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |accessdate= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13224">'''Diogenes syndrome''', also known as '''senile squalor syndrome''', is a disorder characterized by extreme [[self-neglect]], domestic squalor, social withdrawal, [[apathy]], [[compulsive hoarding]] of garbage or [[Animal hoarding|animals]], and lack of shame.  Sufferers may also display symptoms of [[catatonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cybulska | first1 = E | last2 = Rucinski | first2 = J | year = 1986 | title = Gross Self-neglect in Old Age | url = | journal = Br J Hosp Med. | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 21–23 |pmid = 3535960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenthal | first1 = M | last2 = Stelian | first2 = J | last3 = Wagner | first3 = J | last4 = Berkman | first4 = P | title = Diogenes syndrome and hoarding in the elderly: case reports | journal = The Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–34 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10389361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition was first recognized in 1966&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.5521.1032 | last1 = Macmillan | first1 = D | last2 = Shaw | first2 = P. | year = 1966 | title = Senile breakdown in standards of personal and environmental cleanliness | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 2 | issue = 5521| pages = 1032–7 | pmid = 5919035 | pmc = 1944569 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and designated Diogenes syndrome by Clark et al.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |pmid=46514 |first1=AN |year=1975 |last2=Mankikar |first2=GD |last3=Gray |first3=I |title=Diogenes syndrome A clinical study of gross neglect in old age |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=7903 |pages=366–368 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(75)91280-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from [[Diogenes of Sinope]], an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher, a [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] and an ultimate [[Simple living|minimalist]], who allegedly lived in a large jar in Athens.

==Characteristics and causes==
Diogenes syndrome is a disorder that involves hoarding of rubbish and severe self-neglect. In addition, the syndrome is characterized by domestic squalor, [[syllogomania]], [[social alienation]], and refusal of help. It has been shown that the syndrome is caused as a reaction to [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] that was experienced by the patient. The time span in which the syndrome develops is undefined, though it is most accurately distinguished as a reaction to stress that occurs late in life.&lt;ref&gt;Hanon C, P. C. (2004). Diogenes Syndrome: A Transnosographic Approach. Encephale, 30 (4), 315-322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ortiz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12019-996-0005-6 |last1=Reyes-Ortiz |first1=C |title=Diogenes syndrome:  The self-neglect elderly |journal=Comprehensive Therapy |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=117–121 |year=2001 |pmid=11430258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most instances, patients were observed to have an abnormal possessiveness and patterns of compilation in a disordered manner. These symptoms suggest damage to the [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] areas of the brain, due to its relation to [[decision making]]. In contrast, there have also been cases where the hoarded objects were arranged in a methodical manner, which may suggest a cause other than brain damage.

Although most patients have been observed to come from homes with poor conditions, and many had been faced with [[poverty]] for a long period of time, these similarities are not considered a definite cause to the syndrome. Research showed that some of the participants with the condition had solid family backgrounds as well as successful professional lives. Half of the patients were of higher intelligence level.&lt;ref name="Clark study"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=AN|author2=Mannikar|title=Diogenes syndrome. A clinical study of gross neglect in old age.|journal=The Lancet|date=February 15, 1975|pmid=46514|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(75)91280-5|volume=1|issue=7903|pages=366–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates the ''Diogenes syndrome'' does not exclusively affect those experiencing poverty or those who had traumatic childhood experiences.

The severe neglect that they bring on themselves usually results in physical collapse or mental breakdown. Most individuals who suffer from the syndrome do not get identified until they face this stage of collapse, due to their predilection to refuse help from others.&lt;ref name = "Clark" /&gt;

The patients are generally highly intelligent, and the personality traits that can be seen frequently in patients diagnosed with Diogenes syndrome are aggressiveness, stubbornness, suspicion of others, unpredictable mood swings, emotional instability and deformed perception of reality.&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ortiz"/&gt;  Secondary DS is related to mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ortiz"/&gt;  The direct relation of the patients' personalities to the syndrome is unclear, though the similarities in character suggest potential avenues for investigation.&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ortiz"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Individuals suffering from Diogenes syndrome generally display signs of collectionism, [[hoarding]], or compulsive disorder. Individuals who have suffered damage to the brain, particularly the [[frontal lobe]], may be at more risk to developing the syndrome. The frontal lobes are of particular interest, because they are known to be involved in higher order [[cognitive processes]], such as [[reasoning]], [[decision-making]] and conflict monitoring.
Diogenes Syndrome tends to occur among the elderly. The behavioural patterns that is usually reflected by those living with this disorder are suffering from significant functional problem that is correlated with morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cipriani|first=Gabriele|author2=Claudio Lucetti |author3=Marcella Vedovello |author4=Angelo Nuti |title=Diogenes syndrome in patients suffering from dementia|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=14 December 2012|volume=14|issue=4|pages=455–460|pmc=3553571 |pmid=23393422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{section refimprove|date=September 2018}}
It is ethically difficult when it comes to dealing with diagnosed patients, for many of them deny their poor conditions and refuse to accept treatment. The main objectives of the doctors are to help improve the patient’s lifestyle and wellbeing, so health care professionals must decide whether or not to force treatment onto their patient.

In some cases, especially those including the inability to move, patients have to consent to help, since they cannot manage to look after themselves. Hospitals or nursing homes are often considered the best treatment under those conditions.

When under care, patients must be treated in a way in which they can learn to trust the health care professionals. In order to do this, the patients should be restricted in the number of visitors they are allowed&lt;!--[meaning unclear, raises ethical implications]--&gt;, and be limited to 1 nurse or social worker. Some patients respond better to psychotherapy, while others to behavioral treatment or terminal care.&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ortiz" /&gt;

Results after hospitalization tend to be poor. Research on the mortality rate during hospitalization has shown that approximately half the patients die while in the hospital. A quarter of the patients are sent back home, while the other quarter are placed in long-term residential care. Patients under care in hospitals and nursing homes often slide back into relapse or face death.

There are other approaches to improve the patient’s condition. Day care facilities have often been successful with maturing the patient’s physical and emotional state, as well as helping them with socialization. Other methods include services inside the patient’s home, such as the delivery of food.&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ortiz" /&gt;

==History==
The origin of the syndrome is unknown, although the term “Diogenes” was coined by A.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Clarke et al. in the mid‑1970s and has been commonly used since then.  Diogenes syndrome was acknowledged more prominently as a media phenomenon in popular media rather than medical literature. The primary description of this syndrome has only been mentioned recently by geriatricians and psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

'''Floyd Henry Allport''' (August 22, 1890 – October 15, 1979) was an American [[psychologist]] who is often considered "the father of experimental [[social psychology]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=D.|title=Floyd H. Allport (1890-1978)|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|pages=351–353|doi=10.1037/h0078276}}&lt;/ref&gt; having played a key role in the creation of social psychology as a legitimate field of [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral science]]. His book ''Social Psychology'' (1924) impacted all future writings in the field.&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt;{{rp|127}} He was particularly interested in [[public opinion]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], morale, [[Rumor|rumors]], and [[behavior]]. He focused on exploration of these topics through laboratory experimentation and survey research.

==Biography==
Allport was born on August 22, 1890, in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] to John Edward and Nellie Allport. Allport was the second of four sons. His three brothers were Fayette W., Harold E., and [[Gordon W. Allport]], also a psychologist. During Allport's childhood, the family moved from Jupiter to Ohio and it was there that he graduated from Glenville High. After high school, Allport moved to Cambridge to attend [[Harvard University]]. In 1913, Allport received his A.B. in psychology and in 1919 his Ph.D. at Harvard, he studied under [[Edwin B. Holt]] (a student of [[William James]]) and [[Hugo Munsterberg]].&lt;ref name =Henry/&gt;{{rp|123}} In between degrees, from October 1917 until June 1918, he served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Expeditionary Forces during World War I. Allport's first marriage was to Ethel Margaret Hudson on October 5, 1917. His second marriage to Helene Willey Hartley was on September 5, 1938. Allport had three children: Edward Herbert, Dorothy Fay, and Floyd Henry, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allport|first=F.H.|title=A History of Psychology in Autobiography. Volume VI.|year=1974|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=3–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1919 to 1922, Allport was an instructor in psychology at Harvard and Radcliffe, and then until 1924 he was an associate professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Allport became one of the original faculty members at [[Syracuse University]]'s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs in 1924.&lt;ref name =Henry/&gt;{{rp|124}} He was a full professor of Social and Political Psychology until 1956. After 32 years at Syracuse University, Allport became visiting professor at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1957. He retired from teaching in that year in [[Los Altos, California]]. He died in California on October 15, 1979.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Katz, D., Johnson, B.T., Nichols, D.R., (1998). Portraits of pioneers in Psychology Volume III, First Edition, American Psychological Association, Washington DC, 121-142&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}}

Allport published numerous books and articles in the field of psychology. Three of his most influential books are ''Social Psychology'',&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt;{{rp|127}} ''Institutional Behavior'',&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt;{{rp|138}} and ''Theories of Perception and the Concept of Structure''.&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt;{{rp|139}}

==Professional life==
Allport remained at Harvard as an instructor for three years after he received his Ph.D., and in 1922 he moved to the University of North Carolina where he accepted an Associate Professorship. There his primary colleague was John F. Dashiell. In 1924, after only two years, Allport left North Carolina and became a Professor of Social and Political Psychology in the brand new Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. The new school at Syracuse recruited Allport specifically in an effort to integrate [[Social science|social scientists]] to the program. He was immediately appointed Chair of the program, and his efforts at creating the first doctoral program in Social Psychology were supported. Popularity of the Maxwell school rose rapidly after Allport's appointment to Chair. He remained at Syracuse University until he retired in 1957 at the age of 67.&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt;{{rp|124}} While working as a professor, Allport reportedly had very strong relationships with his students. They admired him, he respected their intellectual differences, and he remained in contact with many after their graduations, even occasionally visiting some of their homes.&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt;{{rp|126}}

==Editorial positions==
Beginning the year after he completed his Ph.D. (1920), Allport worked in editorial positions for numerous academic journals. In 1921, he worked on what was then titled the ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology''.

Between 1925 and 1938, he became Associate Editor and continued to work on the publication until 1945.

In 1931, President [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]] appointed him to serve on the research subcommittee of a conference on Home Building and Home Ownership.

==Social psychology==
Allport is most notably recognized as the founder of the modern field of social psychology. He was the first{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} to write a dissertation in the US on social psychology (called "The social influence: An experimental study of the effect of the group upon individual mental processes"). He challenged much of the way of thinking of his day by focusing on behavioral interpretations of social themes and stressing individuals rather than groups as the agents of social behavior,&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt;{{rp|127}} in which context he coined the terms [[social facilitation]] and producing tendency. His work includes research on [[social influence]], convergence and [[conformity]], [[Personality psychology|personality theory]], and measurements of attitudes.  

His textbook ''Social Psychology'' (1924) was the means by which social psychology began to take hold as an experimental science. Instead of stressing [[Sociology|sociological]] issues and themes, which is what had exclusively been done up to this point, ''Social Psychology'' emphasized individual behaviors and measurements of attitudes. In this textbook, he called for much stricter research design, after which he developed the methodology that added a greater focus on experimental and objective reactions of individuals. He examined convergence of individual judgment in group settings, reference groups, and group [[Norm (social)|norms]] through laboratory research. This empirical examination helped to solidify social psychology as a legitimate field of study. Allport also showed how easy it was to transform certain psychoanalytical accounts into more behavior oriented language to explain how we develop certain habits. 

Allport also extensively studied attitude. He was unhappy with existing means of attitude measurement so he created an original technique. It provided lists of items that subjects may hold different attitudes on which got ranked from one extreme to another, and then the average rankings on each position were scored.&lt;ref name="Henry" /&gt;{{rp|134}} This was one of the first solid efforts of quantifying attitudes, another way that social psychology worked to verify itself within the field of psychological research.

==Research==

==="The influence of the group upon association and thought"===
In this 1920 study, Allport described what we know as social facilitation. He completed six separate experiments that looked at how individuals performed in socially isolated conditions, and compared results to how those individuals completed the same task when in a group.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, F. H. (1920). The influence of the group upon association and thought. Journal of Experimental Psychology , 3 (3), 159-182.&lt;/ref&gt; Allport found that individuals actually perform better when in a group setting as opposed to completing the same/similar task when they were alone.

==="Personality Traits: Their Classification and Measurement"===
Floyd Allport and his brother Gordon Allport collaborated on this 1921 paper which outlined the dimensions of the [[personality]] assessments that they used while studying personality.&lt;ref name="personality"&gt;Allport, F. H., &amp; Allport, G. W. (1921). Personality Traits: Their Classification and Measurement. The Journal of Abnormal Psychology and Social Psychology, 16 (1), 6-40.&lt;/ref&gt; They also provided information of how they arrived at these classifications, and brief examples of what the manifestations of the traits will be in the actual person. The traits were: [[intelligence]], [[temperament]] (emotional breadth and strength), self-expression ([[Extraversion and introversion|extro-introversion]],  ascendance-submission, expansion-reclusion, compensation, insight and self-evaluation), and [[sociality]].&lt;ref name="personality" /&gt; The two brothers worked for years to couple personality and social psychology.

==="The Structuring of Events: Outline of a General Theory With Applications to Psychology"===
{{Clarification needed|text=Allport starts this paper off by reviewing how was use quanititative statements while trying to understand behavior, he uses a more mechanistic description of an event.|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Allport, F. H. (1954). The structuring of events: outline of a general theory with applications to psychology. Psychological Review, 61 (5), 281-303.&lt;/ref&gt; Allport then shows how, when you add something other than a qualititaive statement, it is much more clear as to what the circumstance is. {{Clarification needed|text=In the end, Allport stresses that looking at the structure of the behavior coupled with nonquantitative concepts.|date=July 2016}} Allport came up with an equation that combined both structural [[kinematics]]/[[geometry]] (nonquantitative) and structural energics (quantitative).

==="The Observation of Societal Behaviors of Individuals"===
Allport focuses on the methodology of involving specific social stimulus that may or may not be presented. Allport described 3 ways in which societal behaviors may be analyzed 1) co-acting 2) reciprocal 3) co-reciprocal.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, F. H. (1937). The observations of societal behaviors of individuals. Social Forces , 15, 484-487.&lt;/ref&gt; He questions the definition of time, space, degrees of qualities because they represent large-scale behaviors and not individual traits or differences. Allport believes this method and the results will offer promise of a contribution of practical as well as theoretical value in human relationships.

==="Social Forces"===
"Social Forces" was published December 1927. In the nature of institutions section, Allport questions the term "institutions". There are two different examples he gives. Institutions can be given a group entitativity and a figure, or they can be simply human behavior broken down into sections. The institutions have three factions. A system is brought from the past, watching and sorting the system, and then the accumulated tools used to sort and or observe the system. He makes the point that institutions are not valid to blame or say they can cause things. They may be used as a description, but he wants it pointed out that they can be a hindrance to the sociological method.

==="Behavior and Experiment in Social Psychology"===
Social stimuli are the main factors in any experimental social psychological setting.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, F. H. (1919). Behavior and experiment in social psychology. The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 14 (15), 297-306.&lt;/ref&gt; The point is to identify the difference in the types of stimuli. The social stimuli lead to the recognition and proof of "social intelligence". A social group's effect on an individual attitude can be notable. Social stimuli then lead to competition, specific attention, quickness, worse quality, and physical movement.  The final conclusion leads to the focus of the individual as the key component towards learning anything about the group.

===''Journal of Abnormal Psychology and Social Psychology''===
The ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' was renamed the ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology and Social Psychology'' in 1921,&lt;ref name="The Online Books Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=japsych|title=The Online Books Page|last=|first=|date=January 10, 2013|website=|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|access-date=|accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with reasons given for the combination of abnormal and social psychology. New concepts and behavior terminology led to a separate unique classification. Different specific commonalities were becoming apparent and being tied in relation. The concepts were even being taught but had not been merged to detailed organizational identities. {{Clarification needed|text=A section of psychology that studies the deepest forms primary human behavior. Social insufficiency was another combination interest. Allport and Prince wanted more factions paired with abnormal psychology and science.|date=July 2016}} The inclusion of social psychology was defined and supported.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The '''German Agency for Quality in Medicine (AEZQ)''' - in German "Ärztliches Zentrum für Qualität in der Medizin (ÄZQ)", established in 1995 and located in [[Berlin]], co-ordinates [[healthcare]] quality programmes with special focus on [[evidence-based medicine]], [[medical guideline]]s, [[patient empowerment]], [[patient safety]] programs, and [[quality management]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization - Europe.

AEZQ is a non-profit organization owned by the [[German Medical Association]] and the [[National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Helena |last1=Legido-Quigley |first2=Martin |last2=McKee |first3=Ellen |last3=Nolte |first4=Irene A |last4=Glinos |year=2008 |chapter=Germany |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VUB3zSEm4DcC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=Assuring the quality of health care in the European Union: A case for action |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/98233/E91397.pdf |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=978-92-890-7193-2 |pages=116–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
AEZQ initiated several quality programs for the German healthcare system:

It established the German Program for [[evidence-based medicine|evidence based]] [[medical guideline]]s in the late 90s. Based upon guideline standards from the [[Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network]] and referring to experiences from the [[National Guideline Clearinghouse]] in the US, the agency founded a German Guideline [[wikt:clearing house|Clearinghouse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Ollenschläger |first2=H. |last2=Kirchner |first3=U. |last3=Oesingmann |first4=F.

In 1998 AEZQ was co-founder of the [[German Network for Evidence Based Medicine]].

The organization established the German Clearinghouse for [[patient information leaflets|Patient Information]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=391–7 |doi=10.1055/s-2002-32812 |title=Gut informiert über Gesundheitsfragen, aber wie? - Das Deutsche Clearingverfahren für Patienteninformationen - Zielsetzung, Hintergrund und Arbeitsweise |trans-title=Well-informed on health matters--how well?

In 2002, the agency set up the National Program for Disease Management Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=383–7 |doi=10.1007/s00063-007-1052-1 |title=Nationale VersorgungsLeitlinien von BÄK, AWMF und KBV |trans-title=The German program for disease management guidelines.

The development of reliable and consumer information is integral part of this guideline program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=578–84 |doi=10.1016/j.zefq.2010.09.001 |title=Gut informiert entscheiden: Patienten- und Verbraucherinformationen am ÄZQ |trans-title=Informed decisions: patient and consumer information at the German Agency for Quality in Medicine (ÄZQ) |language=German |year=2010 |last1=Schaefer |first1=Corinna |last2=Kirschning |first2=Silke |journal=Zeitschrift für Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualität im Gesundheitswesen |volume=104 |issue=7 |pmid=21095611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEZQ was co-founder of the [[Guidelines International Network]] in 2002 - under the leadership of [[Günter Ollenschläger]], collaborating with other national healthcare quality agencies like the US [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], the UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]], the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=455–60 |doi=10.1136/qhc.13.6.455 |title=Improving the quality of health care: using international collaboration to inform guideline programmes by founding the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) |year=2004 |last1=Ollenschlager |first1=G |journal=Quality and Safety in Health Care |volume=13 |issue=6 |pmid=15576708 |last2=Marshall |first2=C |last3=Qureshi |first3=S |last4=Rosenbrand |first4=K |last5=Burgers |first5=J |last6=Mäkelä |first6=M |last7=Slutsky |first7=J |author8=Board of Trustees 2002, Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) |pmc=1743909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[patient safety]] AEZQ was one of the first German organisations calling for effective patient safety programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ollenschläger |first=G. |year=2001 |title=Medizinische Risiken, Fehler und Patientensicherheit.

AEZQ established a national network of [[patient safety|Critical Incident Reporting Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=92–9 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2010.0092 |title=Patient Safety and Error Management—What Causes Adverse Events and How Can They Be Prevented? |journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt International |first1=Barbara |last1=Hoffmann |first2=Julia |last2=Rohe |pmid=20204120 |year=2010 |volume=107 |issue=6 |pmc=2832110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=563–71 |doi=10.1016/j.zefq.2010.08.002 |title=15 Jahre ÄZQ – 10 Jahre Patientensicherheit am ÄZQ |trans-title=After 15 years of ÄZQ: 10 years of safety for patients |year=2010 |last1=Rohe |first1=Julia |last2=Heinrich |first2=Andrea Sanguino |last3=Fishman |first3=Liat |last4=Renner |first4=Daniela |last5=Thomeczek |first5=Christian |journal=Zeitschrift für Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualität im Gesundheitswesen |volume=104 |issue=7 |pmid=21095609 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution is partner of the international [[High 5 Project]].

In 2010 the agency set up a [[Digital Library]] for physicians and other interested health professionals and lays - the German Medical eLibrary (www.arztbibliothek.de) - for reinforcement of reliable and unbiased [[knowledge management]] in healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=585–90 |doi=10.1016/j.zefq.2010.07.005 |title=Die Arztbibliothek |trans-title=The German Medical eLibrary |language=German |year=2010 |last1=Rütters |first1=Dana |last2=Schwencke |first2=Silja |last3=Bunk |first3=Thomas |last4=Nothacker |first4=Monika |journal=Zeitschrift für Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualität im Gesundheitswesen |volume=104 |issue=7 |pmid=21095612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AEZQ entertained the administrative offices of the [[Guidelines International Network]], and of the [[German Network for Evidence Based Medicine]] until 2013. It hosts the editorial office of the [[German Journal for Evidence and Quality in Healthcare ZEFQ]].

Dr. '''Hilda Molina''' (born '''Hilda Molina y Morejon''' in 1942 in [[Ciego de Avila]], [[Cuba]]) is the former [[neurosurgery|chief neurosurgeon]] of Cuba. Molina was also a deputy in the [[Cuban National Assembly]] but has been a critic of the Cuban government since the early 1990s. Her criticisms focus primarily on Cuba's state-governed [[Healthcare in Cuba|healthcare]] system.

In 1987, Molina founded the neurosurgery center in [[Havana]]. By 1991, her center had become one of the most important scientific centers in Cuba. The same year, Molina claims she was informed by the then Minister of Health, [[Julio Teja Perez]], that her center was henceforth to treat foreigners paying in U.S. dollars. Previously, the center had treated only Cuban patients. Molina subsequently resigned her position at the center and her seat at the National Assembly. Molina claims that she and her son were subjected to [[Human rights in cuba#Acts of repudiation|mob retaliation]] in what are termed "acts of repudiation". She had continuously been denied a visa to travel for personal as well as professional reasons until June, 2009 when permission was granted to visit family in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2009/06/090612_2229_molina_autorizada_argentina_gm.shtml Después de 15 años, Cuba dijo sí]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requests for travel==
Molina has made many requests to visit family members residing in [[Argentina]]. In 2004, after Molina was again denied a visa by the Cuban government. This letter from Molina was forwarded to the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] and other international human rights groups. In the letter Molina stated: "The Cuban government impeded me from temporarily visiting Argentina for a reunion, after 11 years of forcible separation, with my son, who is a naturalized Argentine, and with his wife who is an Argentine citizen". She also listed numerous examples where she believed her rights had been violated by the Cuban authorities going on to state that "the arbitrary state organs that delay or deny, provoking the tearing apart of thousands of innocent families, that submerges them in paralyzing fear, so they are incapacitated to reclaim the respect for their rights most elemental."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradynet.com/bbs/argentina/100105-0.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, a week before [[Fidel Castro]]'s illness led to the [[2006 Cuban transfer of presidential duties|Cuban transfer of presidential duties]] to brother [[Raúl Castro]], the [[President of Cuba|Cuban President]] was questioned by international leaders and journalists on the issue whilst attending a conference in Argentina. [[President of Argentina|Argentine President]] [[Néstor Kirchner]] took the opportunity to press the Cuban leader to allow surgeon Hilda Molina, a one-time Castro ally, to leave Cuba to be with her children and grandchildren already in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/15114410.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; At an improvised press conference, [[Miami]]'s Channel 41 reporter [[Juan Manuel Cao]] asked Castro about Molina, a reportedly infuriated Castro asked the reporter, "Who is paying you?" and later accused him of being "a mercenary" for [[George W. Bush|President Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/139729]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/09/09/washington/09cuba.html 10 Miami journalists take U.S. pay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618163352/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/09/09/washington/09cuba.html |date=2009-06-18 }} ''[[Miami Herald]]'', September 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, it was reported that the Cuban government reversed its position and would allow Molina to visit Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/12/cuba-allowing-government-critic-to-visit-family-in-argentina/ Cuba allowing government critic to visit family in Argentina], CNN.com, June 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molina's story was inspirational to [[Marcos Aguinis]] best selling Novel ''La Pasion Segun Carmela''.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">'''Incarnation Children's Center''' (ICC) is a nursing facility for children living with [[HIV]] in [[New York City]]. From 1989 until 2000 the center operated as a foster care boarding home; since then it has concentrated on providing medical care. The ICC is a [[non-profit corporation]] affiliated with the [[Archdiocese of New York]] and [[Columbia University]]. From the late 1980s through 2005, foster children at the Center with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] were enrolled on clinical trials of [[antiretroviral|antiretroviral medication]], which was successful in reducing the death rate from AIDS.&lt;ref name="belated"/&gt; In 2005, the Center was the focus of "Guinea Pig Kids", a [[BBC]] documentary alleging ethical violations in these clinical trials.&lt;ref name="belated"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | date = July 17, 2005 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E0D71F3DF934A25754C0A9639C8B63 | title = Belated Charge Ignites Furor Over AIDS Drug Trial | first = Janny | last = Scott |author2=Leslie Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations prompted an investigation by the [[Vera Project]], which concluded that no children had died as a result of the trials, but that the Center had kept poor records and sometimes failed to follow its own enrollment policies.&lt;ref name="refutes"&gt;{{Cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Study Refutes Claims on AIDS Drug Trials | first = Lisa | last = Foderaro | date = January 27, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/nyregion/28foster.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the BBC apologized for "very serious issues" in "Guinea Pig Kids", and conceded that the documentary made misleading allegations and was biased toward the views of [[HIV/AIDS denialism|AIDS denialists]].&lt;ref name="concern"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The Guardian]] | title = 'Serious concern' at BBC over flawed HIV film | first = Leigh | last = Holmwood	| date = October 23, 2007 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/23/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecu"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = BBC Editorial Complaints Unit | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/pdf/ecu_julsept07.pdf | format = PDF | title = Summaries of upheld complaints | accessdate = March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Whisk(e)y Day''' was first announced in 2008 and falls on 27 March each year.&lt;ref name="internationalwhiskyday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalwhiskyday.org/ |title=International Whisk(e)y Day &amp;#124; #WhiskyDay2015 - the 7th annual official day celebrating whisk(e)y |publisher=Internationalwhiskyday.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is used with the parenthesis to indicate support of Scottish, Canadian, and Japanese whiskies (no e) as well as Irish and American whiskeys (with an e).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thekitchn.com/whiskey-vs-whisky-whats-the-di-100476 |title=Whiskey vs. Whisky: What's the Difference? — Straight Up Cocktails and Spirits |publisher=Thekitchn.com |date=2009-11-06 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day publicly supports [[Parkinsons Disease]] research in addition to enjoying Whiskey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.justgiving.com/internationalwhiskyday/ |title=Mark Connelly is fundraising for Parkinson’s UK |publisher=Justgiving.com |date=2013-03-27 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
International Whiskey Day was launched in 2009 at the Whiskey Day Festival in the northern Netherlands in the presence of several whiskey writers. The event was created in honor of British writer [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] and is celebrated on Jackson's birthday.&lt;ref name="internationalwhiskyday1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver Klimek |url=http://www.dramming.com/2014/03/27/international-whisky-day-special-a-bunch-of-dusty-scotch-blends/ |title=International Whisky Day Special – A Bunch Of Dusty Scotch Blends — Dramming |publisher=Dramming.com |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation==
Participants are encouraged to raise one up on the day and drink whiskey for the love of the drink as well as to celebrate Michael's life. Others participate via social media using the #whiskyday2015 hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/hashtag/worldwhiskyday |title=Tweets about #worldwhiskyday hashtag on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2015-03-19 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various bars may have specials on 27 March to celebrate the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/international-whiskey-day/Event?oid=12932383 |title=International Whisk(e)y Day &amp;#124; Untitled &amp;#124; Drink Events |publisher=Chicagoreader.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken from the International Whisk(e)y day's website, "International Whisk(e)y Day is a non-profit celebration of whiskey which receives no funding and is run entirely by the passion of whiskey fans from around the world. So if you love whisk(e)y and want to help spread the word, then go ahead and tell someone about it."&lt;ref name="internationalwhiskyday1"/&gt;

==Other Whiskey Days==
International Whisk(e)y Day is not to be confused with [[World Whisky Day]] or [[National Bourbon Day]] which fall in May and June respectively. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwhiskyday.com/ |title=World Whisky Day |publisher=Worldwhiskyday.com |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbourbonday.com/ |title=National Bourbon Day |publisher=Nationalbourbonday.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some conflict with World Whiskey Day where International Whisk(e)y day claims to be the original. This conflict only really exists because WWD is the more well known date in the United States and IWD organizers do not want to be seen as the copycat since they were founded four years earlier. There is also a conflict because each group uses similar hashtags which is not obvious to most people which is which.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalwhiskyday.org/ |title=International Whisk(e)y Day &amp;#124; #WhiskyDay2015 - the 7th annual official day celebrating whisk(e)y |publisher=Internationalwhiskyday.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dates of each event are on separate days in separate months.

There is not as much of a conflict with National Bourbon Day because it specifically celebrates America's "Native Spirit" and not, generically, all whiskeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbourbonday.com/ |title=National Bourbon Day |publisher=National Bourbon Day |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor '''John Hope''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms= [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|PRCPE]]}} (10 May 1725 – 10 November 1786) was a Scottish physician and botanist. Although he did enormous work on plant classification and [[plant physiology]], due to an absence of publications, he is now best known as an early supporter of [[Carl Linnaeus]]'s system of classification.

In 1783 he was a joint founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

In 1784 Hope was elected as president of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] (1784-6).

==Early life==
Born in Edinburgh on 10 May 1725, John Hope was the son of surgeon Robert Hope and Marion Glas, and a grandson of [[Archibald Hope, Lord Rankeillor]], a [[Senator of the College of Justice]] who was in turn the son of [[Sir John Hope, 2nd Baronet]].  He was the great-grandson of [[Sir Thomas Hope, 1st Baronet]]. 

He was educated at [[Dalkeith Grammar School]], then studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He took leave to study botany under [[Bernard de Jussieu]] at the [[University of Paris]], but returned to his studies in Scotland, graduating MD from the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1750.&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt;

For the next decade he practiced medicine, indulging in botany in his spare time. With the death of [[Charles Alston (botanist)|Charles Alston]] in 1760, he succeeded him as the 4th [[Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]] and [[King's Botanist]] and as Professor of Botany and Materia Medica at the University of Edinburgh. However Hope saw his responsibility for [[materia medica]] as a threat to his work in botany, and therefore arranged for the chair to be split: Hope became Professor of Medicine and Botany, and a separate chair of Materia Medica are created.&lt;ref name="Balfour 1913"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Isaac Bayley Balfour|Balfour, Isaac Bayley]] | year = 1913 | chapter = A sketch of the Professors of Botany in Edinburgh from 1670 until 1887 | editor = [[Francis Wall Oliver|Oliver, Francis Wall]] (ed.) | title = ''Makers of British Botany'' | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1763, Hope succeeding in combining the gardens and collections at [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity Hospital]] and [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]] to a new, combined site on the road to Leith. He also succeeded in obtaining a permanent endowment for the garden, thus establishing arguably the first ever "Royal Botanic Garden". Though he published only a few papers, and is therefore little remembered as a botanist, he made many early physiological experiments. These informed his teaching, but were not published, and were only discovered in his unpublished manuscripts many years after his death.&lt;ref name="Balfour 1913"/&gt; He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in February 1767.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=5&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27hope%27%29|title = Library and Archive Cataloue| publisher = Royal Society|accessdate = 20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed Physician in Ordinary to the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] in 1768.

In later life he lived at High School Yards on the southern edge of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1773-74&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Koestler Foundation''' (originally the KIB) was a British organisation founded in 1980 to promote research in fields that fall outside of established science, specifically parapsychology and alternative medicine. The trustees were [[Arthur Koestler]], Brian Inglis, Tony Bloomfield, Michael Fullerlove, and Sir William Wood. The foundation's original name derived from the initials of Koestler, Inglis and Bloomfield. The name was changed following the suicide death of Arthur Koestler in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/04/world/arthur-koestler-and-wife-suicides-in-london.html|title=ARTHUR KOESTLER AND WIFE SUICIDES IN LONDON|last=Pace|first=Eric|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a nation of islands and narrow, steep valleys, dams play a vital role in Japanese society as they are constructed primarily to [[flood control|control floods]], [[water supply|supply water]] and generate [[hydroelectric]] power. The tallest dam in Japan is the {{convert|186|m|ft|abbr=on}} high [[Kurobe Dam]]. The largest dam by structural volume in the country is the [[Tokuyama Dam]] with {{Convert|13700000|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}} of rock-fill.

The '''maxillary central incisor''' is a human [[tooth]] in the front upper jaw, or [[maxilla]], and is usually the most visible of all teeth in the mouth.  It is located [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|mesial]] (closer to the midline of the face) to the [[maxillary lateral incisor]]. As with all [[incisor]]s, their function is for [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] or cutting food during [[mastication]] (chewing). There is typically a single [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]] on each tooth, called an [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|incisal]] ridge or incisal edge.  Formation of these teeth begins at 14 weeks in utero for the [[deciduous teeth|deciduous]] (baby) set and 3–4 months of age for the [[permanent teeth|permanent]] set.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=45}}{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=54}}

There are some minor differences between the deciduous maxillary central incisor and that of the permanent maxillary central incisor.  The deciduous tooth appears in the mouth at 8–12 months of age and shed at 6-7 years, and is replaced by the permanent tooth around 7–8 years of age.  The permanent tooth is larger and is  [[length|longer]] than it is wide.  The maxillary central incisors contact each other at the midline of the face.  The [[mandibular central incisor]]s are the only other type of teeth to do so.  The position of these teeth may determine the existence of an open bite or [[Diastema (dentistry)|diastema]].  As with all teeth, variations of size, shape, and color exist among people. Systemic disease, such as [[syphilis]], may affect the appearance of teeth.

==Notation==

Dentistry has several systems of [[dental notation|notation]] to identify teeth. In the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal system of notation]], the deciduous maxillary central incisors are designated by a letter written in uppercase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ada.org/public/topics/tooth_number.asp ADA.org: Oral Health Topics: Tooth Numbering Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102074427/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/tooth_number.asp |date=2006-11-02 }}, hosted on the [http://www.ada.org American Dental association] website.  Page accessed April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The right deciduous maxillary central incisor is known as "E", and the left one is known as "F".  The permanent maxillary central incisors are designated by a number. The right permanent maxillary central incisor is known as "8", and the left one is known as "9".{{sfn|Scheid|2012}}{{pn|date=July 2018}}

In the [[Palmer notation]], a letter is used in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Huszár G | title = The role of the life and works of Adolf Zsigmondy and Ottó Zsigmondy in the history of dentistry | journal = Fogorv Sz | volume = 82 | issue = 12 | pages = 357–63 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2689240}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the deciduous teeth, the left and right central incisor would have the same letter, "A", but the right one would have the symbol, "┘", underneath it, while the left one would have, "└".

==Development==

{{For|more information on general tooth development|Tooth development}}

The aggregate of [[cell (biology)|cells]] which eventually form a tooth are derived from the [[germ layer|ectoderm]] of the [[first branchial arch]] and the [[ectomesenchyme]] of the [[neural crest]].&lt;ref name="cate102"&gt;Cate, A. R. Ten, ''Oral Histology: Development, Structure, and Function'', 5th ed. (Saint Louis: Mosby-Year Book, 1998), p. 102. {{ISBN|0-8151-2952-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As in all cases of tooth development, the first hard tissue to begin forming is [[dentin]], with [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] appearing immediately afterwards.{{sfn|Nanci|2013}}{{pn|date=July 2018}}

The deciduous maxillary central incisor begins to undergo mineralization 14 weeks in utero, and at birth 5/6ths of the enamel is formed.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=54}}  The [[crown (tooth)|crown]] of the tooth is completed 1.5 months after birth and [[tooth eruption|erupts]] into the mouth at around 10 months of age, making these teeth usually the second type of teeth to appear.  The root completes its formation when the child is 1.5 years old..{{sfn|Nanci|2013}}{{pn|date=July 2018}}

The permanent maxillary central incisor begins to undergo mineralization when a child is 3–4 months of age.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=45}}  The crown of the tooth is completed at around 4–5 years of age and erupts into the mouth at 7–8 years of age.  The root completes its formation when the child is 10 years old..{{sfn|Nanci|2013}}{{pn|date=July 2018}}

== Deciduous dentition ==

The overall length of the deciduous maxillary central incisor is 16&amp;nbsp;mm on average, with the crown being 6&amp;nbsp;mm and the root being 10&amp;nbsp;mm.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=75}} In comparison to the permanent maxillary central incisor, the ratio of the root length to the crown length is greater in the deciduous tooth. The diameter of the crown [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|mesiodistally]] is greater than the length [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|cervicoincisally]], which makes the tooth appear wider rather than taller from a [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|labial]] viewpoint.

The marginal ridges and the cingulum of the tooth are well-developed.  The cingulum reaches [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|incisally]] a great length and is large enough to create small fossa on either side of it.  Depicted by the [[cementoenamel junction]], the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|cervical]] line is the border between the root and crown of a tooth.  On the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|mesial]] and [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|distal]] surfaces, the cervical line curves incisally, which is also seen in the permanent maxillary central incisor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The root of this tooth is cone-shaped with a rounded apex.  Most of the surfaces are smooth, but the mesial surface of the root may have a developmental groove or a concavity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Permanent dentition==

The permanent maxillary central incisor is the widest tooth mesiodistally in comparison to any other anterior tooth. It is larger than the neighboring lateral incisor and is usually not as convex on its labial surface. As a result, the central incisor appears to be more rectangular or square in shape. The mesial incisal angle is sharper than the distal incisal angle. When this tooth is newly erupted into the mouth, the incisal edges have three rounded features called [[mammelon]]s.&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/classes/orla/orla312/INCISORS.htm The Permanent Incisor Teeth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125105910/http://www.uic.edu/classes/orla/orla312/INCISORS.htm |date=2007-01-25 }}, hosted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), accessed on June 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Mammelons disappear with time as the enamel wears away by friction.

Generally, there are gender differences in the appearance of this tooth. In males, the size of the maxillary central incisor is larger usually than in females. Gender differences in enamel thickness and dentin width are low. Age differences in the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|gingival-incisal]] length of maxillary central incisors are seen and are attributed to normal [[attrition (dental)|attrition]] occurring throughout life. Thus, younger individuals have a greater gingival incisal length of the teeth than older individuals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

[[File:Centralincisorfacial06-06-06b.jpg|75px|left|thumb|Labial view.]]
===Labial view===

The labial view of this tooth considers the portion of the tooth visible from the side where the lips would be. The mesial outline of the tooth is straight or slightly convex, whereas the distal outline is much more convex.&lt;ref name="ouhsc"&gt;[http://dentistry.ouhsc.edu/intranet-web/Courses/OCC8401/occ8401.7.html Maxillary Incisors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520021347/http://dentistry.ouhsc.edu/intranet-web/Courses/OCC8401/occ8401.7.html |date=2006-05-20 }}, hosted by the University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry, accessed on June 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the [[height of curvature]] (the point furthest away from the central axis of the tooth) is closer to the mesioincisal angle on the mesial side while more apical on the distal side.
The distal outline of the crown is more convex than the mesial outline, and the distoincisal angle is not as sharp as the mesoincisal angle.
After the mammelons are worn away, the incisal edge of the maxillary central incisor is straight mesiodistally. The center of the incisal edge curves slightly downward in the center of the tooth. The cervical line, which is seen as the border between the crown and the root of the tooth, is closer to the apex of the root in the center of the tooth. This makes the cervical line appear as a semicircle in shape.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

From this view, the root is blunt and cone-shaped. Although there is a large amount of variation between people, the length of the root is usually 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm longer than the length of the crown.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=156}} Large curvatures of the root are usually not seen in this tooth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

[[File:Centralincisorlingual06-06-06b.jpg|75px|right|thumb|[[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|Lingual]] view.]]

===Palatal view===

The palatal view of this tooth considers the portion of the tooth visible from the side where the tongue would be. The palatal side of the maxillary central incisor has a small convexity, called a [[cingulum (tooth)|cingulum]] near the cervical line and has a large concavity, called the lingual fossa. Along the mesial and distal sides are slightly raised portions called marginal ridges. The lingual incisal edge is also raised slightly to the level of the marginal ridges. The lingual fossa is bordered incisally by the lingual incisal edge, mesially by the mesial marginal ridge, distally by the distal marginal ridge, and cervically by the cingulum.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=158}} Developmental grooves are found on the cingulum and lying into the lingual fossa.

This side of the tooth tapers in size from the labial side of the tooth. As a result, the mesial and distal sides of the tooth are further away on the labial side than on the lingual side. Furthermore, a cross-section of the tooth at the cervical line would show a general triangle appearance. One of the triangle's sides would be the facial surface, and the other two sides would be the mesial side and the slightly shorter distal side.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

[[File:Centralincisormesial06-06-06b.jpg|75px|left|thumb|[[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|Mesial]] view.]]

===Mesial view===

The mesial view of this tooth considers the portion of the tooth visible from the side closest to where the middle line of the face would be.the mesial exis should be parallel to the midline. The mesial side of the maxillary central incisor shows the crown of the tooth as a triangle with the point at the incisal edge and the base at the cervix.&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt; The root appears cone shaped with a blunt apex. Unlike most other teeth, a line drawn through the center of the incisal edge will also cross through the center of the root apex.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=159}} This also occurs in maxillary lateral incisors.

The crest of curvature for the palatal and labial surfaces is located directly incisally to the cervical line. The labial surface of the crown is convex from the crest of curvature to the incisal edge. The lingual surface of the crown is convex near the cingulum and near the incisal edge, but for the most part is concave along the surface between those two areas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

More than any other tooth in the mouth, the cervical line from this view curves tremendously toward the incisal. In an average crown length of 10.5 to 11&amp;nbsp;mm, the curvature of the cervical line in a maxillary central incisor is 3 to 4&amp;nbsp;mm.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=159}}

[[File:Centralincisordistal06-06-06b.jpg|75px|right|thumb|[[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|Distal]] view.]]

===Distal view===

The distal view of this tooth considers the portion of the tooth visible from the side furthest from where the middle line of the face would be.  This side of the tooth is very similar to the mesial side.  A greater portion of the tooth surface facing the lips is visible from this view compared to the mesial view because the labial surface tilts distally and lingually.  Also, the cervical line curves less in comparison to the mesial view.&lt;ref name="ouhsc"/&gt;

===Incisal view===

The incisal view of this tooth considers the portion of the tooth visible from the side where the incisal edge is located.  From this angle, only the crown of the tooth is visible, and overall the tooth looks bilateral.  The labial surface appears broad and flat.  The lingual surface tapers toward the cingulum.  The distance between the mesioincisal angle to the cingulum is slightly longer than the distance between the distoincisal angle to the cingulum.{{sfn|Ash|Nelson|2003|p=161}}

===Pulp anatomy===

The [[pulp (tooth)|pulp]] is the location of the nerve and blood supply of a tooth.  In the deciduous maxillary central incisor, [[Endodontics|endodontic]] treatment is less frequent.  In the permanent maxillary central incisor, [[root canal]] treatment can be effective.  There frequently are three pulp horns in this tooth.&lt;ref name="ouhsc"/&gt; In nearly all maxillary central incisors, there is one canal with one apex.&lt;ref name="walton562"&gt;Walton, Richard E. and Mahmoud Torabinejad. ''Principles and Practice of Endodontics''. 3rd edition. 2002. p. 562. {{ISBN|0-7216-9160-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During root canal therapy, access into the pulp is frequently located centrally on the lingual surface between the incisal edge and the cingulum.  At the level of the cervical line, the shape of the canal is triangular but becomes circular at the middle level of the root.&lt;ref name="walton562"/&gt; Although the root is generally straight, the most common points of curvature is near the apex, and their direction is more common toward the distal and lingual.

==Surrounding teeth==
===Interproximal contacts===

[[File:06-10-06centralincisors.jpg|thumb|right]]

Contact with adjacent teeth in the same arch is referred to as interproximal contacts.  The maxillary central incisors are one of only two types of teeth which has an interproximal contact with itself.  The other type of teeth is the [[mandibular central incisor]]s.  In usually preferred and healthy states, the central incisors touch in the incisal third of the teeth.&lt;ref name="summit62"&gt;Summit, James B., J. William Robbins, and Richard S. Schwartz. "Fundamentals of Operative Dentistry: A Contemporary Approach." 2nd edition. Carol Stream, Illinois, Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc, 2001. P. 62. {{ISBN|0-86715-382-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the contact between the central incisor and the lateral incisor is nearer the gingiva at the location between the incisal and middle thirds of the tooth's crown.

=== Occlusion===

As with all max anterior teeth, the central incisors are usually located facially to the mandibular teeth when the mouth is closed.{{sfn|Okeson|2003|p=83}} In instances when the maxillary anterior teeth are lingual to the mandibular teeth, the condition is referred to as an anterior crossbite.  In some cases, this arrangement of teeth may indicate a displacement of the mandible relative to the maxilla and is called Class III or Pseudo-Class III [[malocclusion]].  Normal occlusion is Class I occlusion.

When the teeth are biting down, the maxillary central incisors occlude with the mandibular central and lateral incisors. The contact point of the mandibular teeth is in the lingual fossa of the maxillary central incisor about 4&amp;nbsp;mm gingivally from the incisal edge.{{sfn|Okeson|2003|p=83}} In this position, the maxillary incisors cover nearly half of the mandibular incisors' crowns. When the maxillary and mandibular incisors do not contact even when the mouth is fully closed, an anterior open bite occurs.  This misalignment of teeth may result from some habits, such as [[thumb-sucking]]. On the other hand, when the contact of the mandibular incisors to the maxillary incisors is near or completely on the gingiva, a deep bite occurs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Variation==
[[File:The 5 different lingual views of maxillary central incisor.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The five different lingual views of maxillary central incisor.]]
[[Sinodonty]], a genetic variation occurring in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and some [[Asian people|East Asian]] populations, is possibly a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] retained from an indigenous [[East Asian]] archaic human ancestor [[Peking Man|Homo Erectus Pekinensis]]. Among its features are [[shovel-shaped incisors]] that derive their name from the deeper-than-normal lingual fossa and prominent marginal ridges of the teeth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} When seen from lingual view, the tooth is said to resemble a [[shovel]] and are rotated slightly inward. It is also common to see signs of attrition, which is wear over time from other tooth contact. The lingual of maxillary incisors and the facial of mandibular incisors are the most common places for attrition to occur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

When space exists between the contacts of the maxillary central incisors, the condition is referred to as a [[Diastema (dentistry)|diastema]] or "gap tooth." One frequent cause of the space is the presence of a large labial [[Frenulum|frenum]] from the upper lip extending near the teeth. Treatment depends upon the cause and extent of the gap.  Periodontal surgery may be required to reduce the frenum.  A small space may be corrected with a [[Dental restoration|filling]], [[Veneer (dentistry)|veneer]], or [[Crown (dentistry)|crown]]. Larger spaces may require [[orthodontic]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The maxillary incisors, both the central and lateral, are the most likely teeth to have a [[talon cusp]], which is an extra cusp on the lingual surface. Talon cusps range from less than 1% to 6% of the  population, and 33% of cases occur on the permanent maxillary central incisor.{{sfn|Neville|2002|p=78}}  Deciduous teeth are unlikely to have talon cusps. Also, the permanent maxillary incisors are the most likely teeth to have a [[dilaceration]], which is a sharp curve on a tooth.{{sfn|Neville|2002|p=86}}

All incisors have the potential to be affected by a case of congentital [[syphilis]], which can cause a notch to form on the incisal edges of these teeth. These teeth, sometimes described as screwdriver-shaped, are called "[[Hutchinson's teeth|Hutchinson's incisors]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/syphilis/DS00374/DSECTION=6 Syphilis: Complications], hosted on the Mayo Clinic website. Page accessed January 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  They serve as part of [[Hutchinson's triad]], which also includes interstitial [[keratitis]] and [[vestibulocochlear nerve|eighth]] [[nerve]] [[deafness]].

==Organizations==
In the UK, the [[Men's Health Forum]] was founded in 1994. It was established originally by the [[Royal College of Nursing]] but became completely independent of the RCN when it was established as a charity in 2001. The first National Men’s Health Week was held in the USA in 1994. The first UK week took place in 2002, and the event went international the following year. In 2005, the world’s first professor of men’s health, Alan White, was appointed at [[Leeds Metropolitan University]] in north-east England.

In Australia, the Men's Health Information and Resource Centre advocates a [[salutogenic]] approach to male health which focuses on the causal factors behind health.  The Centre is led by John Macdonald and was established in 1999.  The Centre leads and executes [[Men's Health Week]] in Australia with core funding from the NSW Ministry of Health.

In 2000, the [[Toronto]] Men's Health Network was founded by Joe Jacobs, who helped bring attention to the importance of men's health in Canada's largest city. The organization has held Men's Health Forums annually, including 2005 where the guest speaker, Canadian Senator [[Wilbert Keon]], spoke of the importance of men's cardiovascular health. The organization has since been chaired by Ted Kaiser, Elaine Sequeira, Don McCreary and Donald Blair. Presently, the organization is being led by James Hodgins. It remains the oldest and most recognized Men's Health advocacy organization in Canada, with other organizations starting to appear in [[British Columbia]] and the [[Maritime provinces]].

In the United States, men's health issues are raised by, among others, [[Men's Health Network]] (MHN). Established, in 1992, MHN is a non-profit educational organization comprising physicians, researchers, public health workers, other health professionals, and individuals. Through a network of chapters affiliates, and health partners, MHN has a presence in every state and over 30 countries. MHN is committed to improving the health and wellness of men, boys, and their families through education campaigns, data collection, surveys, toll-free hotlines, and work with health care providers. MHN conducts screenings in the workplace and at public venues, sponsors conferences and symposia, and promotes awareness periods such as Men's Health Month and Men's Health Week.

The '''National Defence Medical Centre''' (NDMC) was the national and largest hospital of the [[Canadian Forces]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It served the needs of the members of the military. Constructed in 1961, it was closed in the 1990s due to budget cutbacks in National Defence and Veterans' Affairs Canada. The building now houses Canadian Forces Health Services Group Headquarters, the CF Health Services Centre Ottawa and other military units.

All in-patient and surgical services for the [[Canadian Forces]] in the Ottawa region are done at the Civic Campus of [[The Ottawa Hospital]] where they have a 4 bed unit, and their own [[Operating Theater]].

It was announced in [[2003 in Canada|2003]] that they will be moving to 2 floors of the new [[Montfort Hospital]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1154">'''[[Obesity]] in Saudi Arabia''' is a growing health concern with health officials stating that it is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in [[Saudi Arabia]]. According to ''[[Forbes]]'', Saudi Arabia ranks 29 on a 2007 list of the fattest countries with a percentage of 68.3% of its citizens being overweight (BMI&gt;25).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/07/worlds-fattest-countries-forbeslife-cx_ls_0208worldfat_2.html |title=World's Fattest Countries|accessdate=2016-07-15|author=Lauren Streib|date=February 8, 2007|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding the problem, according to a presentation at the 3rd International Obesity Conference in February 2014, is that obesity-related surgeries are not covered under Saudi healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Fouzia|title=70% of Saudis are obese, says study|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/527031|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=Arab News|date=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Occupational health psychology''' ('''OHP''') is an interdisciplinary area of psychology that is concerned with the health and safety of workers.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"&gt;Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Chang, C.-H. (2017). ''Occupational health psychology: Work, stress, and health''. New York, NY: Springer Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houdmont"&gt;Houdmont, J., &amp; Leka, S. (2010).

John Wiley: Hoboken, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''Occupational Health Psychology (OHP)''. [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohp/]&lt;/ref&gt; OHP addresses a number of major topic areas including the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health, the impact of [[involuntary unemployment]] on physical and mental health, work-family balance, workplace violence and other forms of mistreatment, accidents and safety, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker health.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Houdmont"/&gt; OHP emerged from two distinct disciplines within [[applied psychology]], namely, [[health psychology]] and [[industrial and organizational psychology]], as well as [[occupational medicine]].&lt;ref name="Everly 1986"&gt;Everly, G.S., Jr. (1986). An introduction to occupational health psychology. In P.A. Keller &amp; L.G. Ritt (Eds.), ''Innovations in clinical practice: A source book'' (Vol. 5, pp. 331–338).

== Historical overview ==

===Origins===
The [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted thinkers, such as [[Karl Marx]] with his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. (1967/1845). The German ideology. In L.D. Easton &amp; K.H.L. Guddat (Eds. and Trans.), ''Writings of the young Marx on philosophy and society''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; to concern themselves with the nature of work and its impact on workers.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Taylor's]] (1911) ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management|Principles of Scientific Management]]''&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, F.W. (1911). ''The principles of scientific management''. Norwood, MA: The Plimpton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Christie"&gt;Christie, A., &amp; Barling, J. (2011). A short history of occupational health psychology: A biographical approach. In C. Cooper &amp; A. Antoniou  (Eds.), ''New directions in organizational psychology and behavioural medicine'' (pp. 7–24). Washington, DC: Gower Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Elton Mayo|Mayo’s]] research in the late 1920s and early 1930s on workers at the [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne Western Electric plant]]&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, E. (1933) ''The human problems of an industrial civilization''. New York: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to inject the impact of work on workers into the subject matter psychology addresses. About the time Taylorism arose, [[James Hartness|Hartness]] reconsidered worker-machine interaction and its impact on worker psychology.&lt;ref name=Hartness1912&gt;{{Citation |last=Hartness |first=James |title=The human factor in works management |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1912 |location=New York and London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB41AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |oclc=1065709 |postscript=. Republished by Hive Publishing Company as Hive management history series no. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-87960-047-1}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation in 1948 of the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research|Institute for Social Research]] (ISR) at the [[History of the University of Michigan#Later 20th century .E2.80.94 Increasing student activism|University of Michigan]] was important because of its research on [[occupational stress]] and employee health.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, R.P. et al. (1971). ''Survey of working conditions: Final report on univariate and bivariate tables, Document No. 2916-0001''. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House, J.S.

Relationships of cessation of smoking with job stress, personality, and social support. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 60'', 211–219. doi:10.1037/h0076471&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in the U.K. by [[Eric Trist|Trist]] and Bamforth (1951) suggested the reduction in autonomy that accompanied organizational changes in English coal mining operations adversely affected worker morale.&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E.L., &amp; Bamforth, K.W. (1951). Some social and psychological consequences of the longwall method of coal getting. ''Human Relations, 14'', 3–38. doi:10.1177/001872675100400101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Kornhauser]]’s work in the early 1960s on the mental health of automobile workers in Michigan&lt;ref&gt;Kornhauser, A. (1965). ''Mental health of the industrial worker.'' New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; also contributed to the development of the field.&lt;ref name="Christie, A. 2011 pp. 7-24"&gt;Christie, A. &amp; Barling, J. (2011). A short history of occupational health psychology: A biographical approach. In C. Cooper &amp; A. Antoniou (Eds.), ''New directions in organizational psychology and behavioral medicine'' (pp. 7–24).

''Journal of Applied Psychology, 88'', 363–369. doi: 10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.363&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 1971 study by Gardell examined the impact of work organization on mental health in Swedish pulp and paper mill workers and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Gardell, B. (1971). Alienation and mental health in the modern industrial environment. In L. Levi (Ed.), ''Society, stress and disease'' (Vol. 1, pp. 148–180). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the impact of unemployment on mental health was conducted at the University of Sheffield’s Institute of Work Psychology.&lt;ref name = "Christie"/&gt; In 1970 Kasl and Cobb documented the impact of unemployment on blood pressure in U.S. factory workers.&lt;ref name="Kasl and Cobb"&gt;Kasl, S.V., &amp; Cobb, S. (1970). Blood pressure changes in men undergoing job loss: A preliminary report. ''Psychosomatic Medicine, 32''(1), 19–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition as a field of study===
A number of individuals are associated with the creation of the term “occupational health psychology” or "occupational health psychologist."&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2018). Occupational health psychology. In D.S. Dunn (Ed.), ''Oxford Bibliographies in Psychology''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They include Ferguson (1977),&lt;ref name = "Ferguson 1977"&gt;Ferguson, D. (1977). The psychologist and occupational health. ''Proceedings of the Annual Conference, Ergonomics Society of Australia and New Zealand'' (pp. 41–50). Adelaide, South Australia, Australia: Department of Psychology, University of Adelaide.&lt;/ref&gt; Feldman (1985),&lt;ref name = "Feldman 1985"&gt;Feldman, R.H.L. (1985). Promoting occupational safety and health. G. Everly &amp; R.H.L. Feldman (Eds.), ''Occupational health promotion: Health behavior in the workplace'' (pp. 188–207). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Everly (1986),&lt;ref name="Everly 1986"/&gt; and Raymond, Wood, and Patrick (1990).&lt;ref name="Raymond, J. 1990"&gt;Raymond, J.S., Wood, D., &amp; Patrick, W.K. (1990). Psychology doctoral training in work and health. ''American Psychologist, 45'', 1159–1161. doi:10.1037/0003-066X.45.10.1159&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, in response to a dramatic increase in the number of stress-related worker compensation claims in the U.S., the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) "recognized stress-related psychological disorders as a leading occupational health risk" (p.&amp;nbsp;201).&lt;ref name="sauter1999"&gt;Sauter, S.L., Hurrell, J.J., Jr., Fox, H.R., Tetrick, L.E., &amp; Barling, J. (1999). Occupational health psychology: An emerging discipline. ''Industrial Health, 37''(2), 199–211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apatimeline"&gt;"Milestones in the history of occupational health psychology", (February 2002). ''Monitor on Psychology'', [[American Psychological Association]]. 33(2). [http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/milestones.aspx] Retrieved July 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; When this change was coupled with an increased recognition of the impact of stress on a range of problems in the workplace, NIOSH found that their stress-related programs were significantly increasing in  prominence.&lt;ref name="sauter1999" /&gt; In 1990, Raymond et al.&lt;ref name="Raymond, J. 1990"/&gt; argued that the time has come for doctoral-level psychologists to get interdisciplinary OHP training, integrating [[health psychology]] with [[public health]], because creating healthy workplaces should be a goal for the field.

===Emergence as a discipline===
Established in 1987, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' is the first and "longest established journal in the fast developing discipline that is occupational health psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"&gt;Cox, T., &amp; Tisserand, M. (2006). Editorial: Work &amp; Stress comes of age: Twenty years of occupational health psychology. ''Work &amp; Stress, 20'', 1–5. doi:10.1080/02678370600739795&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) and NIOSH jointly organized the first international Work, Stress, and Health conference in Washington, DC. The conference has since become a biannual OHP meeting.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"&gt;Barling, J., &amp; Griffiths, A. (2011). A history of occupational health psychology. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 21–34). Washington, D.C., American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the first issue of the ''[[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]]'' was published by APA. That same year, the [[International Commission on Occupational Health]] created the Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS) scientific committee,&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Occupational Health-Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors [http://www.icohweb.org/site/scientific-committee-detail.asp?sc=33]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icohweb.org/site_new/ico_scientific_committees.asp International Commission on Occupational Health]&lt;/ref&gt; which focused primarily on OHP.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; In 1999, the [[European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology]] (EA-OHP) was established at the first European Workshop on Occupational Health Psychology in Lund, Sweden.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"&gt;Houdmont, J. (2009). Across the pond: A history of the European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology. ''Newsletter of the Society of Occupational Health Psychology, 7'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV7October2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; That workshop is considered to be the first EA-OHP conference, the first of a continuing series of conferences EA-OHP organizes and devotes to OHP research and practice.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"/&gt;

In 2000 the informal International Coordinating Group for Occupational Health Psychology (ICGOHP) was founded for the purpose of facilitating OHP-related research, education, and practice as well as coordinating international conference scheduling.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; Also in 2000, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' became associated with the EA-OHP.&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"/&gt; In 2005, the [[Society for Occupational Health Psychology]] (SOHP) was established in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schonfeld, I.S. (2007). The historical development of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology (SOHP). ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 2. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, SOHP joined with APA and NIOSH in co-sponsoring the Work, Stress, and Health conferences.&lt;ref name = "Hammer"&gt;Hammer, L.B., Sauter, S., &amp; Limanowski, J. (2008) Work, stress, and health 2008. ''Society for Occupational Health Psychology Newsletter, 2'', 2. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV2January2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, EA-OHP and SOHP began to coordinate biennial conferences schedules such that the organizations' conferences would take place on alternate years, minimizing scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name = "Hammer"/&gt; In 2017, SOHP and Springer began to publish an OHP-related journal ''Occupational Health Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/psychology/arbeits-+organisations-+%26+wirtschaftspsychologie/journal/41542 ''Occupational Health Science.'' Accessed January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research methods ==
{{main|List of psychological research methods}}
The main purpose of OHP research is to understand how working conditions affect worker health,&lt;ref name="KaslJones2011"&gt;Kasl, S.V., &amp; Jones, B.A. (2011). An epidemiological perspective on research design, measurement, and surveillance strategies. In J. C. Quick &amp; L. E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 375–394). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; use that knowledge to design interventions to protect and improve worker health, and evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, J.A., Kelley, S.D., Bickman, L., &amp; Weiss, H.M. (2011). Program evaluation: The bottom line in organizational health. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 395–415). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The research methods used in OHP are similar to those used in other branches of psychology.

=== Standard research designs ===

=== Quantitative methods ===

[[Statistical methods]] commonly used in other areas of psychology are also used in OHP-related research. Statistical methods used include [[structural equation modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;Hayduk, L.A. (1987). ''Structural equations modeling with lisrel.''

''Hierarchical linear models: Applications and data analysis methods'' (2nd ed.). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; (HLM; also known as [[multilevel modeling]]). HLM can better adjust for similarities between employees&lt;ref name="Raudenbush 2001" /&gt; and is especially well suited to evaluating the lagged impact of work stressors on health outcomes; in this research context HLM can help minimize [[Censoring (statistics)|censoring]] and is well-suited to experience sampling studies.&lt;ref name = "S and R"&gt;Schonfeld, I.S., &amp; Rindskopf, D. (2007). Hierarchical linear modeling in organizational research: Longitudinal data outside the context of growth modeling. ''Organizational Research Methods, 18'', 417–429. doi:10.1177/1094428107300229&lt;/ref&gt; [[meta-analysis|Meta-analyses]] have been used to aggregate data (modern approaches to meta-analyses rely on HLM), and draw conclusions across multiple studies.&lt;ref name="Stansfeld 2006"/&gt;

=== Qualitative research methods ===

[[qualitative methods|Qualitative research methods]] include [[interviews]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Driscoll, M.P., &amp; Cooper, C.L. (1994).

===Important theoretical models in OHP research===

Three influential theoretical models in OHP research are the demand-control-support, demand-resources, and effort-reward imbalance models.

The most influential model in OHP research has been the original demand-control model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; According to the model, the combination of low levels of work-related decision latitude (i.e., [[job control (workplace)|autonomy and control over the job]]) combined with high workloads (high levels of work demands) can be particularly harmful to workers (they can lead to "job strain," a term representing the combination of low decision latitude and high workload leading to poorer mental or physical health).&lt;ref name = "karasek 1979"&gt;Karasek, R.A. (1979). Job demands, job decision latitude, and mental strain: Implications for job redesign. ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 24''(2), 285–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests not only that these two job factors are related to poorer health but that high levels of decision latitude on the job will buffer or reduce the adverse health impact of high levels of demands. Research has clearly supported the idea that decision latitude and demands relate to strains, but research findings about buffering have been mixed with only some studies providing support.&lt;ref&gt;de Lange, A.H., Taris, T.W., Kompier, M.A., Houtman, I.L., &amp; Bongers, P.M. (2003). "The very best of the millennium": Longitudinal research and the demand-control-(support) model. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 8'', 282–305. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.8.4.282&lt;/ref&gt; The demand-control model asserts that job control can come in two broad forms: ‘skill discretion’ and ‘decision authority’.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"&gt;Bean, C.G., Winefield, H.R., Sargent, C., &amp; Hutchinson, A.D. (2015). Differential associations of job control components with both waist circumference and body mass index. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 143'', 1–8. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.034&lt;/ref&gt; Skill discretion refers to the level of skill and creativity required on the job and the flexibility an employee is permitted in deciding what skills to use (e.g. opportunity to use skills, similar to job variety).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"&gt;de Araújo, T.M., Karasek. R. (2008) Validity and reliability of the job content questionnaire in formal and informal jobs in Brazil. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 6'', Suppl. 52–59&lt;/ref&gt; Decision authority refers to employees being able to make decisions about their work (e.g., having autonomy).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"/&gt; These two forms of job control are traditionally assessed together in a composite measure of decision latitude; there is, however, some evidence that the two types of job control may not be similarly related to health outcomes.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joensuu, M. et al. et al. (2012). Differential associations of job control components with mortality: A cohort study, 1986–2005. ''American Journal of Epidemiology, 175'', 609–619. doi:10.1093/aje/kws028&lt;/ref&gt;

About a decade after Karasek first introduced the demand-control model, Johnson, Hall, and Theorell (1989),&lt;ref name="Johnson, 1989"&gt;Johnson, J. V., Hall, E. M., &amp; Theorell, T. (1989). Combined effects of job strain and social isolation on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in a random sample of the Swedish male working population. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 15'', 271–279. doi:10.5271/sjweh.1852&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of research on heart disease, extended the model to include social isolation. Johnson et al. labeled the combination of high levels of demands, low levels of control, and low levels of coworker support “iso-strain.” The resulting expanded model has been labeled the demand–control–support (DCS) model. Research that followed the development of this model has suggested that one or more of the components of the DCS model (high psychological workload, low control, and lack of social support), if not the exact combination represented by iso-strain, have adverse effects of physical and mental health.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Job demands-resources model ====

An alternative model, the [[job demands-resources model|job demands-resources (JD-R) model]],&lt;ref&gt;Demerouti, E., Bakker, A.B., Nachreiner, F., &amp; Schaufeli, W.B. (2001). The job demands-resources model of burnout. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 86'', 499–512. doi:10.1037//0021-9010.86.3.499&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains more or less the same as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Effort-reward imbalance model====
After the DCS model, the, perhaps, second most influential model in OHP research has been the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model. It links job demands to the rewards employees receive for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J., &amp; Peter, R. (1994). Job stressors and coping characteristics in work-related disease: Issues of validity. ''Work &amp; Stress, 8'', 130–140. doi: 10.1080/02678379408259985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J. (1996). Adverse health effects of high-effort/low-reward conditions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 27–41. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.1.1.27&lt;/ref&gt; That model holds that high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related intrinsic (e.g., recognition) and extrinsic (e.g., pay) rewards triggers high levels of activation in neurohormonal pathways that, cumulatively, are thought to exert adverse effects on mental and physical health.

=== Occupational stress and physical health ===
A number of work-related, psychosocial factors have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD).

====Cardiovascular disease====
{{Main|Occupational stress|Cardiovascular disease}}
Research has identified health-behavioral and biological factors that are related to increased risk for CVD. These risk factors include smoking, obesity, low density lipoprotein (the "bad" cholesterol), lack of exercise, and blood pressure. Psychosocial working conditions are also risk factors for CVD.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; In a case-control study involving two large U.S. data sets, Murphy (1991) found that hazardous work situations, jobs that required vigilance and responsibility for others, and work that required  attention to devices were related to increased risk for cardiovascular disability.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, L.R. (1991). Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease. ''Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 44''(2), 155–166.&lt;/ref&gt; These included jobs in transportation (e.g., air traffic controllers, airline pilots, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), preschool teachers, and craftsmen.

Fredikson, Sundin, and Frankenhaeuser (1985) found that reactions to psychological stressors include increased activity in the brain axes which play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure,&lt;ref&gt;Fredrikson M., Sundin O., &amp; Frankenhaeuser M.

(1998). Is the effect of job strain on myocardial infarction risk due to interaction between high psychological demands and low decision latitude?

Job strain, workplace social support, and cardiovascular disease: A cross-sectional study of a random sample of the Swedish working population. ''American Journal of Public Health, 78''(10), 1336–1342.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 17 [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] having reasonably high [[internal validity]] found that 8 showed a significant relation between the combination of low levels of decision latitude and high workload (the job strain condition) and CVD and 3 more showed a nonsignificant relation.&lt;ref&gt;Belkic, K.L., Landsbergis, P.A., Schnall, P.L., &amp; Baker, D. (2004). Is job strain a source of major cardiovascular risk? ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment, and Health, 30''(2), 85–128.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings, however, were clearer for men than for women, on whom data were more sparse.

''International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 88'',997–1014. doi:10.1007/s00420-015-1019-0.&lt;/ref&gt; review-of-reviews also links work-related psychosocial stress to elevated risk of CVD in men. In a massive (''n'' &gt; 197,000) longitudinal study that combined data from 13 independent studies, Kivimäki et al. (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Kivimäki, M., Nyberg, S., Batty, G., Fransson, E., Heikkilä, K., Alfredsson, L., . . . Theorell, T. (2012). Job strain as a risk factor for coronary heart disease: A collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data. ''The Lancet, 380'', 1491–1497. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60994-5&lt;/ref&gt; found that, controlling for other risk factors, the combination of high levels of demands and low control at baseline increased the risk of CVD in initially healthy workers by between 20 and 30% over a follow-up period that averaged 7.5 years. In this study the effects were similar for men and women. Meta-analytic research also links job strain (the combination of high demands and low control) to stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Y., Xu, S., Hua, J. et al. (2015).

There is evidence that, consistent with the ERI model, high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related rewards adversely affects cardiovascular health. At least five studies of men have linked effort-reward imbalance with CVD.&lt;ref&gt;Landsbergis, P., et al. (2003).

==== Job-related burnout and cardiovascular health ====
{{Main|Occupational burnout}}
There is evidence from a prospective study that job-related burnout, controlling for traditional risk factors, such as smoking and [[hypertension]], increases the risk of coronary heart disease over the course of the next three and a half years in workers who were initially disease-free.&lt;ref&gt;Toker, S., Melamed, S., Berliner, S., Zeltser, D., &amp; Shapira, I.

{{Main|Workplace aggression|Workplace violence}}

There are many forms of workplace mistreatment ranging from relatively minor discourtesies to serious cases of bullying and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, L., Caughlin, D.E., Gazica, M.W., Truxillo, D.M., &amp; Spector, P.E.

====Workplace incivility====
{{Main|Incivility}}
[[Workplace incivility]] has been defined as "low-intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the target....Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and discourteous, displaying a lack of regard for others" (p.&amp;nbsp;457).&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, L. M., &amp; Pearson, C. M. (1999). Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace. ''Academy of Management Review, 24'', 452–471. doi:10.5465/AMR.1999.2202131&lt;/ref&gt;  Incivility is distinct from violence. Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, social isolation, etc. A summary of research conducted in Europe suggests that workplace incivility is common there.&lt;ref name="cortina magley"&gt;Cortina, L.M., Magley, V., Williams, J.H., &amp; Langhout, R.D.

==== Workplace violence ====
{{Main|Workplace violence}}
Workplace violence is a significant health hazard for employees, both physically and psychologically.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

::-Nonfatal assault-
Most workplace assaults are nonfatal, with an annual physical assault rate of 6% in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., Frone, M.R., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Prevalence of workplace aggression in the U.S. workforce. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J.  Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 47–89). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Assaultive behavior in the workplace often produces injury, psychological distress, and economic loss. One study of California workers found a rate of 72.9 non-fatal, officially documented [[assault]]s per 100,000 workers per year, with workers in the education, retail, and health care sectors subject to excess risk.&lt;ref&gt;Peek Asa, C., Howard, J., Vargas, L., Kraus, J.F. (1997). Incidence of non-fatal workplace assault injuries determined from employer's reports in California. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 39''(1), 44–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Minnesota workers' compensation study found that women workers had a twofold higher risk of being injured in an assault than men, and health and social service workers, transit workers, and members of the education sector were at high risk for injury compared to workers in other economic sectors.&lt;ref name="LaMar, 1998"/&gt; A West Virginia workers' compensation study found that workers in the [[health care]] sector and, to a lesser extent, the education sector were at elevated risk for assault-related injury.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, S.S., Edla, S.R., Mujuru, P., Doyle, E.J., &amp; Ducatman, A.M. (2003). Risk factors for physical assault. State managed workers' compensation experience.

''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 40'', 561–567. doi:10.1016/S0749-3797(03)00095-3&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the physical injury that results from being a victim of workplace violence, individuals who witness such violence without being directly [[victimized]] are at increased risk for experiencing adverse psychological effects, including high levels of distress and arousal, as found in a study of Los Angeles teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, A.M. (1978). Combat neurosis in inner-city schools. ''American Journal of Psychiatry, 135''(10), 1189–1192.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental disorder ===
{{Main|Mental disorder}}
Research has found that psychosocial workplace factors are among the risk factors for a number of categories of mental disorder.

==== Alcohol abuse ====
{{Main|Alcohol abuse}}
Workplace factors can contribute to alcohol abuse and dependence of employees. Rates of abuse can vary by occupation, with high rates in the construction and transportation industries as well as among waiters and waitresses.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell W., Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., &amp; Garrison, R. (1992). Alcoholism and occupations: A review and analysis of 104 occupations.  ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 16'', 734–746. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1992.tb00670.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the transportation sector, heavy truck drivers and material movers were shown to be at especially high risk.  A prospective study of ECA subjects who were followed one year after the initial interviews provided data on newly [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incident]] cases of alcohol abuse and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, R.M., Muntaner. C., Eaton. W.W., &amp; Anthony. J.C. (1995). Occupational stress and the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence. ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 19'', 647–655. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1995.tb01562.x&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that workers in jobs that combined low control with high physical demands were at increased risk of developing alcohol problems although the findings were confined to men.

==== Depression ====
{{Main|Major depressive disorder}}
Using data from the ECA study, Eaton, Anthony, Mandel, and Garrison (1990) found that members of three occupational groups, lawyers, secretaries, and special education teachers (but not other types of teachers) showed elevated rates of [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''DSM-III'']] major depression, adjusting for social demographic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., Mandel, W., &amp; Garrison, R. (1990). Occupations and the prevalence of major depressive disorder. ''Journal of Occupational Medicine, 32''(11), 1079–1087.&lt;/ref&gt; The ECA study involved representative samples of American adults from five geographical areas, providing relatively unbiased estimates of the risk of mental disorder by occupation; however, because the data were [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]], no conclusions bearing on cause-and-effect relations are warranted.   Evidence from a Canadian prospective study indicated that individuals in the highest quartile of occupational stress (high-strain jobs as per the demand-control model) are at increased risk of experiencing an episode of major depression.&lt;ref&gt;Wang J. (2005). Work stress as a risk factor for major depressive episode(s). ''Psychological Medicine, 35'', 865–871. doi:10.1017/S0033291704003241&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review and [[meta-analysis]] links high demands, low control, and low support to clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, I.H., Nyberg, S.T.,  Magnusson Hanson, L.L., et al. (2017). Job strain as a risk factor for clinical depression: Systematic review and meta-analysis with additional individual participant data. ''Psychological Medicine, 47'', 1342–135. doi:10.1017/S003329171600355X&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis that pooled the results of 11 well-designed longitudinal studies indicated that a number of facets of the psychosocial work environment (e.g., low decision latitude, high psychological workload, lack of social support at work, effort-reward imbalance, and job insecurity) increase the risk of common mental disorders such as depression.&lt;ref name="Stansfeld 2006"/&gt;

==== Personality disorders ====
{{Main|Personality disorder}}
Depending on the diagnosis, severity and individual, and the job itself, personality disorders can be associated with difficulty coping with work or the workplace, potentially leading to problems with others by interfering with [[interpersonal relationships]]. Indirect effects also play a role; for example, impaired educational progress or complications outside of work, such as [[substance abuse]] and co-morbid mental disorders, can plague sufferers. However, personality disorders can also bring about above-average work abilities by increasing competitive drive or causing the sufferer to exploit his or her co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L. (2011). Personality disorders and Work. In Schultz &amp; Rogers (Eds.), ''Work accommodation and retention in mental health'' (pp. 163–188). New York: Springer. doi:10.1007978-1-4419-0428-9_9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L., Maclean, J.C., &amp; French, M.T. (2011). Does having a dysfunctional personality hurt your career? Axis II personality disorders and labor market outcomes. ''Industrial Relations, 50'', 149–173. doi:10.1111/j.1468-232X.2010.00629.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Schizophrenia ====
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
In a case-control study, Link, Dohrenwend, and Skodol found that, compared to depressed and well control subjects, schizophrenic patients were more likely to have had jobs, prior to their first episode of the disorder, that exposed them to “noisesome” work characteristics (e.g., noise, humidity, heat, cold, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Link, B.G., Dohrenwend, B.P., &amp; Skodol, A.E. (1986). Socio-economic status and schizophrenia: Noisome occupational characteristics as a risk factor. ''American Sociological Review, 51'', 242–258. doi:10.2307/2095519&lt;/ref&gt; The jobs tended to be of higher status than other blue collar jobs, suggesting that downward drift in already-affected individuals does not account for the finding. One explanation involving a [[diathesis-stress model]] suggests that the job-related stressors helped precipitate the first episode in already-vulnerable individuals. There is some supporting evidence from the [[Psychiatric epidemiology#Example: The Epidemiological Catchment Area Project|Epidemiologic Catchment Area]] (ECA) study.&lt;ref&gt;Muntaner, C., Tien, A.Y., Eaton, W.W., &amp; Garrison R. (1991). Occupational characteristics and the occurrence of psychotic disorders. ''Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 26'', 273–280. doi:10.1007/BF00789219&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological distress ===
{{Main|Psychological distress}}
[[longitudinal study|Longitudinal studies]] have suggested adverse working conditions can contribute to the development of psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, M.T., Matthews, R.A., Wooldridge, J.D., Mishra, V., Kakar, U.M., &amp; Strahan, S.R. (2014). How do occupational stressor-strain effects vary with time? A review and meta-analysis of the relevance of time lags in longitudinal studies. Work &amp; Stress, 28, 9–30. doi: 10.1080/02678373.2013.877096&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress refers to [[negative affect]], without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Dohrenwend, B.P., Shrout, P.E., Egri, G., &amp; Mendelsohn, F.S. (1980). Nonspecific psychological distress and other dimensions of psychopathology: Measures for use in the general population. ''Archives of General Psychiatry, 37'', 1229–1236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, J.D. (1973). ''Persuasion and healing''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and [[anxiety]] symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research. [[Job satisfaction]] is also related to negative health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, E.S., &amp; Grunberg, L. (1995). Work alienation and problem alcohol behavior. ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 36'', 83–102. doi:10.2307/2137289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House, J.S. (1974). Occupational stress and coronary heart disease: A review and theoretical integration. ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 15'', 12–27. doi:10.2307/2136922&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review&lt;ref&gt;Häusser, J. A., Mojzisch, A., Niesel, M. &amp; Schulz-Hardt, S. (2010).

''BMC Public Health, 15'', 738. doi:10.1186/s12889-015-1954-4&lt;/ref&gt; of high-quality longitudinal studies link high demands, low control, and low support to psychological symptoms.

==== Psychosocial working conditions====
Parkes (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, K.R. (1982). Occupational stress among student nurses: A natural experiment. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 67'', 784–796. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.67.6.784&lt;/ref&gt; studied the relation of working conditions to psychological distress in British student nurses. She found that in this "[[natural experiment]]," student nurses experienced higher levels of distress and lower levels of job satisfaction in medical wards than in surgical wards; compared to surgical wards, medical wards make greater affective demands on the nurses. In another study, Frese (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Frese, M. (1985). Stress at work and psychosomatic complaints: A causal interpretation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 70'', 314–328. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.70.2.314&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that objective working conditions (e.g., noise, ambiguities, conflicts) give rise to subjective stress and psychosomatic symptoms in blue collar German workers. In addition to the above studies, a number of other well-controlled longitudinal studies have implicated work stressors in the development of psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Carayon, P. (1992).  A longitudinal study of job design and worker strain: Preliminary results. In J.C. Quick, L.R. Murphy, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), ''Work and well-being:  Assessments and instruments for occupational mental health'' (pp. 19–32). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. doi:10.1037/10116-002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dormann, C., &amp; Zapf, D. (2002). Social stressors at work, irritation, and depressive symptoms: Accounting for unmeasured third variables in a multi-wave study. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 75'', 33–58. doi:10.1348/096317902167630&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unemployment ====
A comprehensive meta-analysis involving 86 studies indicated that involuntary job loss is linked to increased psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul, K. I., &amp; Moser, K. (2009). Unemployment impairs mental health: Meta-analyses. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 74'', 264–282. doi:10.1016/j.jvb.2009.01.001&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of involuntary unemployment was comparatively weaker in countries that had greater income equality and better social safety nets.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt; The research evidence also indicates that poorer mental health slightly, but significantly, increases the risk of later job loss.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

==== Economic insecurity ====
Some OHP research is concerned with (a) understanding the impact of economic crises on individuals' physical and mental health and well-being and (b) calling attention to personal and organizational means for ameliorating the impact of the crisis.&lt;ref name="probst sears"&gt;Probst, T.M., &amp; Sears, L.E. (2009). Stress during the financial crisis. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 5'', 3–4. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV5January2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic insecurity contributes, at least partly, to psychological distress and work-family conflict.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"&gt;Sinclair, R.R., Probst, T., Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schaffer, M.M. (2013). Low income families and occupational health: Implications of economic stress for work-family conflict research and practice. In A.G. Antoniou &amp; C.L. Cooper (Eds.), ''The psychology of the recession on the workplace'' (pp. 308–323). Northampton, MA, US: Edward Elgar Publishing. doi:10.4337/9780857933843.00030&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing job insecurity, even in the absence of job loss, is related to higher levels of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and worse overall health.&lt;ref name="Burgard"&gt;Burgard, S.A., Brand, J.E., &amp; House, J.S. (2009). Perceived job insecurity and worker health in the United States. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 69'', 777–785. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.06.029.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Work-family balance ====
{{Main|Work–family conflict|Double burden|Work–life balance}}

Employees must balance their working lives with their home lives. Work–family conflict is a situation in which the demands of work conflict with the demands of family or vice versa, making it difficult to adequately do both, giving rise to distress.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"&gt;Greenhaus, J.G., &amp; Allen, T. (2011). Work-family balance: A review and extension. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 165–183). Washington DC, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more research has been conducted on work-family conflict, there is also the phenomenon of work-family enhancement, which occurs when positive effects carry over from one domain into the other.&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"/&gt;

=== Workplace interventions ===
A number of stress management interventions have emerged that have shown demonstrable effects in reducing job stress.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Richardson, K. M., &amp; Rothstein, H. R. (2008). Effects of occupational stress management intervention programs: A meta-analysis. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 13'', 69–93. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.13.1.69&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive behavioral interventions have tended to have greatest impact on stress reduction.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

====Industrial organizations====
OHP interventions often concern both the health of the individual and the health of the organization. Adkins (1999) described the development of one such intervention,  an organizational health center (OHC) at a California industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, J.A. (1999). Promoting organizational health: The evolving practice of occupational health psychology. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 30''(2), 129 137. doi:10.1037/0735-7028.30.2.129&lt;/ref&gt; The OHC helped to improve both organizational and individual health as well as help workers manage job stress. Innovations included labor-management partnerships, suicide risk reduction, conflict mediation, and occupational mental health support. OHC practitioners also coordinated their services with previously underutilized local community services in the same city, thus reducing redundancy in service delivery.

Hugentobler, Israel, and Schurman (1992) detailed a different, multi-layered intervention in a mid-sized Michigan manufacturing plant.&lt;ref&gt;Hugentobler, M.K., Israel, B.A., &amp; Schurman, S.J. (1992). An action research approach to workplace health: Integrating methods. ''Health Education Quarterly, 19''(1), 55–76. doi:10.1177/109019819201900105&lt;/ref&gt; The hub of the intervention was the Stress and Wellness Committee (SWC) which solicited ideas from workers on ways to improve both their well-being and [[productivity]]. Innovations the SWC developed included improvements that ensured two-way communication between workers and management and reduction in stress resulting from diminished conflict over issues of quantity versus quality. Both the interventions described by Adkins and Hugentobler et al. had a positive impact on productivity.

==== OHP research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ====
{{Main|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}
Currently there are efforts under way at NIOSH to help reduce the incidence of preventable disorders (e.g., [[sleep apnea]]) among heavy-truck and tractor-trailer drivers and, concomitantly, the life-threatening accidents to which the disorders lead,&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock, E. (2008). NIOSH OHP activities. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 3'', 10. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV3May2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; improve the health and safety of workers who are assigned to shift work or who work long hours,&lt;ref&gt;Caruso, C.

[http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV9October2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military and first responders====
The Mental Health Advisory Teams of the United States Army employ OHP-related interventions with combat troops.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J.L. (2008). OHP Research and Practice in the US Army: Mental Health Advisory Teams. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 4'', 4–5.

''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 7'', 6–7.[http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV7October2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modestly scaled interventions====
Schmitt (2007) described three different modestly scaled OHP-related interventions that helped workers abstain from smoking, exercise more frequently, and shed weight.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2007). OHP interventions: Wellness programs. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other OHP interventions include a campaign to improve the rates of hand washing, an effort to get workers to walk more often, and a drive to get employees to be more compliant with regard to taking prescribed medicines.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2008). OHP interventions: Wellness programs (Part 2). ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2'', 6–7. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV2January2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The interventions tended reduce organization health-care costs.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"/&gt;

==== Health promotion ====

Organizations can play a role in the health behavior of employees by providing resources to encourage healthy behavior in areas of exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, J.B., Cook, R.F., &amp; Pelletier, K.R. (2011). An integral framework for organizational wellness: Core technology, practice models, and case studies In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 95–118). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====
Although the dimensions of the problem of workplace violence vary by economic sector, one sector, [[school violence#Prevention and intervention|education]], has had some limited success in introducing programmatic, psychologically-based efforts to reduce the level of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2006). School violence. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 169–229). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED494566.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that there continue to be difficulties in successfully "screening out applicants [for jobs] who may be prone to engaging in aggressive behavior,"&lt;ref&gt;Day, A.L, &amp; Catano, V.M. (2006) Screening and selecting out violent employees. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 549–577). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that aggression-prevention training of existing employees may be an alternative to screening. Only a small number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of training programs to reduce workplace violence currently exist.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Training as a workplace aggression intervention strategy. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 579–605). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Total Worker Health™====
{{Main|Total Worker Health}}

Because many companies have implemented worker safety and health measures in a fragmented way,&lt;ref name = "Schill"&gt;Schill, A. L., &amp; Chosewood, L. C. (2013). The NIOSH Total Worker Health™ program: An overview. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 55''(12 Suppl.), S8–S11. doi:10.1097/JOM.0000000000000037&lt;/ref&gt; a new approach to worker safety and health has emerged in response, driven by efforts advanced by [[NIOSH]]. NIOSH trademarked that approach, naming it Total Worker Health. Total Worker Health involves the coordination of evidence-based (a) health promotion practices at the level of the individual worker and (b) umbrella-like health and safety practices at the level of the organizational unit.&lt;ref name = "Schill"/&gt; Research findings indicate that this two-pronged approach is effective in preventing work-related illness and injury.&lt;ref&gt;Anger, W. K., Elliot, D. L., Bodner, T., Olson, R., Rohlman, D. S., Truxillo, D. M., &amp; ... Montgomery, D. (2015). Effectiveness of Total Worker Health interventions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 20'', 226–247. doi:10.1037/a0038340&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents and safety===
{{Main|Work accident}}

Psychological factors are an important factor in [[occupational accident]]s that can lead to injury and death of employees. An important influence on the incidence of accidents is the organization's [[safety climate]] that is employees' shared beliefs about how supervisors reward and support safety behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, D. (2010). Thirty years of safety climate research: Reflections and future directions. ''Accident Analysis and Prevention, 42'', 1517–1522. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2009.12.019.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ONR reports to the [[Department for Work and Pensions]], although it also works closely with the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onr.org.uk/workwith.htm |title=Who we work with |publisher=ONR |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The establishment of the ONR followed a 2008 review conducted on behalf of the Government into the regulation of the UK civil nuclear industry, recommending the creation of a single industry specific regulator.&lt;ref name=hse-proposals /&gt;

It was initially created on 1 April 2011 as a non-statutory [[executive agency|agency]] of the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE), with the Government intending to put the ONR on a statutory basis at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/news/2011/feb-statement.htm Creation of the Office for Nuclear Regulation – Written ministerial statement from the Department for Work and Pensions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430134523/http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/news/2011/feb-statement.htm |date=30 April 2011 }} published 2011-02-08, accessed 3 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hse-proposals /&gt;

The ONR was formed from the merger of the HSE's Nuclear Directorate (the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the Office for Civil Nuclear Security and the UK Safeguards Office) and from 1 June 2011, the [[Department for Transport]]'s Radioactive Materials Transport Team.&lt;ref name=hse-proposals&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/ndchanges.htm Proposed changes to the way we work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430134717/http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/ndchanges.htm |date=30 April 2011 }} [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]], accessed 3 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Nick Baldwin]], former chief executive of [[Powergen]] (now [[E.ON UK]]) was appointed part-time interim chair of the ONR on its formation,&lt;ref name=baldwin-11-04-01 /&gt; resigning as a [[non-executive director]] of [[Scottish and Southern Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/business/corporate-sme/baldwin-leaves-sse-board-1.1094203 Baldwin leaves SSE board] [[Herald Scotland]], published 2011-04-02, accessed 3 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; John Jenkins was appointed as Chief Executive of ONR from 1 June 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hse.gov.uk/onr/2013/06/john-jenkins-formally-appointed-as-chief-executive-of-onr/ John Jenkins formally appointed as Chief Executive of ONR], published 2013-06-07, accessed 9 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; having previously been chief operating officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hse.gov.uk/onr/2012/05/appointment-of-chief-operating-officer/ Appointment of Chief Operating Officer], published 2012-05-31, accessed 9 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation to establish the ONR was included in the [[Energy Act 2013]], and it was formally launched as an independent [[statutory corporation]] on 1 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.onr.org.uk/2014/03/onr-becomes-independent-public-corporation/ |title=ONR becomes Public Corporation |publisher=ONR |date=1 April 2014 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ONR is governed by a ten member board, and is accountable to Parliament through the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] (DWP) in matters of finance, governance and non-nuclear health and safety.&lt;ref name=wnn-20170707&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-UK-regulator-outlines-plan-to-remain-fit-for-future-07071701.html |title=UK regulator outlines plan to 'remain fit for future' |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=7 July 2017 |accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Jenkins resigned from his post on 28 February 2015 and was replaced by Les Philpott on 1 March 2015 as the Interim Chief Executive. Adriènne Kelbie was appointed Chief Executive and took up the appointment on 18 January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.onr.org.uk/2015/10/onr-announces-new-chief-executive/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017 it had about 600 staff and a budget of £70.7 million which was largely cost-recovered from users with a 4% grant from the DWP.&lt;ref name=wnn-20170707/&gt;
In October 2017 Mark Foy was appointed Chief Nuclear Inspector; he was previously the Deputy Chief Nuclear Inspector.&lt;ref name=nei-20171030&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsuk-gets-new-chief-nuclear-inspector-5960128 |title=UK gets new chief nuclear inspector |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=30 October 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic Design Assessment process==
Following the 2006 Energy review the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate developed the Generic Design Assessment process (GDA), now operated by ONR, to assess new nuclear reactor designs ahead of site-specific proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/newreactors/background.htm |title=Background – assessment of new nuclear power stations |publisher=Health and Safety Executive |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GDA started assessing four designs:

*Westinghouse [[AP1000]]
*Areva [[European Pressurized Reactor|EPR]]
*CANDU [[ACR-1000]]
*GE-Hitachi [[ESBWR]]

However the ACR-1000 and ESBWR were subsequently withdrawn from the assessment for commercial reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/04/04/aecl-britain.html |title=AECL bows out of British reactor development to focus on Canadian projects |date=4 April 2008 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2054130 |title=Interview: "We will be back" in Europe, says GE |date=15 September 2009 |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |accessdate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505200417/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2054130 |archivedate=5 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the EPR and AP1000 as contenders for British new nuclear builds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/newreactors/progress.htm |title=New Nuclear Power Stations – Progress so far |publisher=Health and Safety Executive |accessdate=15 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601205003/http://www.hse.gov.uk/newreactors/progress.htm |archivedate=1 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/newreactors/gda-japan.htm |title=News – Taking GDA work forward in the light of the unprecedented events in Japan |publisher=Health and Safety Executive |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228221748/http://www.hse.gov.uk/newreactors/gda-japan.htm |archivedate=28 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment of the AP1000 was suspended at Westinghouse's request, awaiting a firm UK customer before addressing issues raised by the assessment.&lt;ref name=wnn-20130410/&gt;

In 2012 [[Hitachi]] purchased [[Horizon Nuclear Power]], announcing intent to build two to three 1,350&amp;nbsp;MWe [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]]s (ABWR) on both of Horizon's sites.&lt;ref name=bbc-20121030&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20134735 |title=Hitachi buys UK nuclear project from E.On and RWE |publisher=BBC |date=30 October 2012 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABWR will first require a UK GDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2063605 |title=ABWR set for UK design assessment |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=16 January 2013 |accessdate=26 January 2013 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment was agreed in April 2013.&lt;ref name=wnn-20130410&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-UK_starts_ABWR_design_assessment-1004137.html |title=UK starts ABWR design assessment |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=10 April 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] resumed the AP1000 assessment, after [[Toshiba]] and [[ENGIE]] purchased [[NuGeneration]] and announced plans to develop [[Moorside Nuclear Power Station]] with 3 AP1000s. The GDA was initially planned to finish in March 2017.  However as of November 2016 the ONR noted there was a "very large amount of assessment to complete with issues still emerging". Slippage of the completion date is likely,&lt;ref name=wnn-20160108&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-UK-regulator-reports-slippage-in-assessment-of-AP1000-design-08011501.html |title=UK regulator reports 'slippage' in assessment of AP1000 design |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wnn-20161128&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-UK-regulators-may-move-GDA-target-date-for-AP1000-28111601.html |title=UK regulators question Westinghouse's target date for AP1000 GDA |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though good progress was made early in 2017.&lt;ref name=nei-20170323/&gt;

On 21 September 2015 Energy Secretary [[Amber Rudd]] announced that a Chinese designed nuclear power station was expected to be built at [[Bradwell nuclear power station]].  The reactor chosen will first require a UK GDA,&lt;ref name=ft-20150921&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/52462048-5f8b-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html |title=UK paves path for west's first China-designed nuclear reactor |author=George Parker |newspaper=Financial Times |date=21 September 2015 |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ec-20150921&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.essexchronicle.co.uk/China-ready-build-new-nuclear-plant-Bradwell/story-27810381-detail/story.html |title=China ready to build new nuclear plant at Bradwell-on-Sea |newspaper=Essex Chronicle |date=21 September 2015 |accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is likely to start in 2017 assessing the [[Hualong One]].&lt;ref name=wnn-20170110&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-UK-to-start-regulatory-assessment-of-Chinese-design-10011701.html |title=UK to start regulatory assessment of Chinese design |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=10 January 2017 |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 19 January 2017 the GDA process for the Hualong One started, expected to be completed in 2021, in advance of possible deployment at the [[Bradwell nuclear power station]] site.&lt;ref name=nei-20170323&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsuk-gda-reports-good-progress-for-ap1000-and-uk-abwr-5770316 |title=UK GDA reports good progress for AP1000 and UK ABWR |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=23 March 2017 |accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2017 the [[AP1000]] successfully completed the GDA process,&lt;ref name=nei-20170403&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newswestinghouse-ap1000-completes-gda-process-in-the-uk-5777517 |title=Westinghouse AP1000 completes GDA process in the UK |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=3 April 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ironically the day after the designer, Westinghouse, filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] because of $9 billion of losses from its nuclear reactor construction projects, mostly the construction of four AP1000 reactors in the U.S.&lt;ref name=nei-20170329&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newswestinghouse-files-for-bankruptcy-5773901 |title=Westinghouse files for bankruptcy |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=29 March 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor|ABWR]] GDA process completed successfully in December 2017.&lt;ref name=wnn-20171214&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Hitachi-GE-ABWR-design-cleared-for-use-in-UK-1412174.html |title=Hitachi-GE ABWR design cleared for use in UK |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=14 December 2017 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Okinawa Airakuen Sanatorium''', (National Sanatorium Okinawa Airakuen) is a sanatorium for [[leprosy]] patients or ex-leprosy patients at Sumuide, [[Nago, Okinawa]], Japan that was established in 1938. 

==History==

===History before the sanatorium===
*{{main|Keisai Aoki}}

===Major changes===
*Nov 10, 1938: Okinawa Prefectural Kunigami Airakuen Sanatorium opened.
*Apr 1, 1941: National Kunigami Airakuen Sanatorium.
*Apr 25, 1946: Under American Military Government.
*Apr 1, 1952: Ryukyu Government Kungami Airakuen.
*Aug 26, 1961: Hansen's disease prevention law of Okinawa promulgated.
*May 15, 1972: Okinawa returned to Japan. "National Sanatorium Okinawa Airakuen"
*Apr 1, 1996: The previous leprosy prevention law was abandoned.

===Sanatorium and the war===
*In Sept 1944, they dug many air-raid shelters, which were later named Hayata Goh (air-raid shelter).
*400 new leprosy patients were hospitalized by the Japanese army in September 1944, for a total of 913 patients. Food and housing conditions were miserable.
*April 1, 1945, the American army landed at Chatan.
*April 10, 1945, Director Hiroshi Hayata allowed patients to leave the sanatorium.
*April 21, the Sanatorium was occupied after hand-to-hand fighting.
*May 4, the Sanatorium was formally occupied.

===After the war===
*August 1945, the director of the army hospital visited the Sanatorium.
*March 8, 1946, the "Yagaji Sanatorium", meaning the sanatorium on the Yagaji Island,  became the restricted area.
*In 1949, Dr.V.Scorebrand visited the Sanatorium, and tried to use promin.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}
*In July, 1953, Dr.Doull visited Okinawa for two months and reported various recommendations concerning leprosy.
*In March 1951, Okinawa "Save-Leprosy Patient" Association started.
*In Feb 1954, the Jichi-kai(Patients' association) of the Airakuen started "Tomonokai", an association for those who were discharged from the Airakuen and Miyako Nanseien.
*In Feb 1960, an outpatient clinic started in Naha City. Similar clinics were built later in [[Ishigaki Island|Ishigaki]] -jima and [[Miyako Island|Miyako]] -jima.
*In March 1957, the Japanese Government started to send leprosy specialists to two Okinawan sanatoriums.
*In 1967, Okinawan schoolchildren surveys were started.
*Apr 1996:The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law was abolished.
*Jul 1998: The trial for compensation started.
*May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous Leprosy Prevention was unconstitutional.
*May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was confirmed. The compensation of 8,000,000 yen to 14,000,000 yen was given to patients depending on the duration of unconstitutional periods.

'''Oogenesis''', '''ovogenesis''', or '''oögenesis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|oʊ|.|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|s|ɪ|s}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Oogenesis Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary Definition: Oogenesis]&lt;/ref&gt; is the differentiation of the [[ovum]] (egg cell) into a cell competent to further development when fertilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|date=2000-01-01|title=Oogenesis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10008/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is developed from the primary oocyte by maturation. Oogenesis is initiated in the embryonic stage.  

==Oogenesis in mammals==

In [[mammal]]s, the first part of oogenesis starts in the [[germinal epithelium (female)|germinal epithelium]], which gives rise to the development of [[ovarian follicles]], the functional unit of the [[ovary]].

Oogenesis consists of several sub-processes: oocytogenesis, [[ootidogenesis]], and finally maturation to form an ovum (oogenesis proper). [[Folliculogenesis]] is a separate sub-process that accompanies and supports all three oogenetic sub-processes.

Reprod. | pages=2–13 | vauthors=Manandhar G, Schatten H, Sutovsky P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The creation of oogonia===
The creation of [[oogonia]] traditionally doesn't belong to oogenesis proper, but, instead, to the [[Gametogenesis#Common path|common process]] of gametogenesis, which, in the female human, begins with the processes of [[folliculogenesis]], oocytogenesis, and [[ootidogenesis]].

==Human oogenesis==

===Oogenesis===
Oogenesis starts with the process of developing primary oocytes, which occurs via the transformation of [[oogonium|oogonia]] into primary [[oocyte]]s, a process called oocytogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.section.4695 NCBI - The saga of the germ line]&lt;/ref&gt; Oocytogenesis is complete either before or shortly after birth.

====Number of primary oocytes====
It is commonly believed that, when oocytogenesis is complete, no additional primary oocytes are created, in contrast to the male process of spermatogenesis, where gametocytes are continuously created. In other words, primary oocytes reach their maximum development at ~20&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lobo RA |title=Early ovarian ageing: a hypothesis. What is early ovarian ageing? |journal=Hum. Reprod. |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=1762–4 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12923124 |doi= 10.1093/humrep/deg377|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12923124}}&lt;/ref&gt; weeks of gestational age, when approximately seven million primary oocytes have been created; however, at birth, this number has already been reduced to approximately 1-2 million.

Recently, however, two publications have challenged the belief that a finite number of oocytes are set around the time of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Johnson J, Bagley J, Skaznik-Wikiel M, etal |title=Oocyte generation in adult mammalian ovaries by putative germ cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood |journal=Cell |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages=303–15 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16051153 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.06.031 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson J, Canning J, Kaneko T, Pru J, Tilly J | title = Germline stem cells and follicular renewal in the postnatal mammalian ovary | journal = Nature | volume = 428 | issue = 6979 | pages = 145–50 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15014492 | doi = 10.1038/nature02316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renewal of ovarian follicles from germline stem cells (originating from bone marrow and peripheral blood) has been reported in the postnatal mouse ovary. In contrast, DNA clock measurements do not indicate ongoing oogenesis during human females' lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster P, Hohoff C, Dunkelmann B, Schürenkamp M, Pfeiffer H, Neuhuber F, Brinkmann B |title=Elevated germline mutation rate in teenage fathers |journal=Proc R Soc B |volume=282 |issue= |pages=20142898 |year=2015 |pmid=25694621 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.2898 |pmc=4345458}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, further experiments are required to determine the true dynamics of small follicle formation.

===Ootidogenesis===
The succeeding phase of ootidogenesis occurs when the [[primary oocyte]] develops into an ootid. This is achieved by the process of meiosis. In fact, a primary oocyte is, by its biological definition, a cell whose primary function is to divide by the process of meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-P/primary_oocyte.html Biochem]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although this process begins at prenatal age, it stops at [[prophase I]]. In late fetal life, all oocytes, still primary oocytes, have halted at this stage of development, called the [[dictyate]]. After [[menarche]], these cells then continue to develop, although only a few do so every [[menstrual cycle]].

====Meiosis I====
[[Meiosis I]] of ootidogenesis begins during embryonic development, but halts in the [[diplotene]] stage of prophase I until puberty. The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage actively repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair is not detectable in the pre-dictyate ([[Leptotene stage|leptotene]], [[Meiosis#Zygotene|zygotene]] and [[Meiosis#Pacytene|pachytene]]) stages of meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guli CL, Smyth DR | year = 1988 | title = UV-induced DNA repair is not detectable in pre-dictyate oocytes of the mouse | url = | journal = Mutat Res | volume = 208 | issue = 2| pages = 115–119 | pmid = 3380109 | doi=10.1016/s0165-7992(98)90010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those primary oocytes that continue to develop in each menstrual cycle, however, [[synapsis]] occurs and [[Meiosis#Meiosis I|tetrads]] form, enabling [[chromosomal crossover]] to occur. As a result of meiosis I, the primary oocyte has now developed into the [[secondary oocyte]] and the first [[polar body]].

====Meiosis II====
Immediately after meiosis I, the [[haploid]] secondary oocyte initiates [[meiosis II]]. However, this process is also halted at the [[metaphase II]] stage until [[fertilization]], if such should ever occur. When meiosis II has completed, an ootid and another polar body have now been created.

====Folliculogenesis====
{{Main article|Folliculogenesis}}
Synchronously with ootidogenesis, the [[ovarian follicle]] surrounding the ootid has developed from a primordial follicle to a preovulatory one.

===Maturation into ovum===
Both polar bodies disintegrate at the end of Meiosis II, leaving only the ootid, which then eventually undergoes maturation into a mature ovum.

The function of forming polar bodies is to discard the extra haploid sets of chromosomes that have resulted as a consequence of meiosis.

===In vitro maturation===
{{Main article|In vitro maturation}}
''In vitro maturation'' (''IVM'') is the technique of letting [[ovarian follicle]]s mature [[in vitro]]. It can potentially be performed before an [[IVF]]. In such cases, [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] isn't essential. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body prior to IVF. Hence, no (or at least a lower dose of) gonadotropins have to be injected in the body.&lt;ref name=vejledning&gt;[http://www.sst.dk/publ/Publ2006/KOT/kunstig_befrugtning/Vejl_ivf_oa_dec06.pdf Vejledning om kunstig befrugtning 2006 (Danish)]&lt;/ref&gt; Immature eggs have been grown until maturation ''in vitro'' at a 10% survival rate, but the technique is not yet clinically available.&lt;ref name="McLaughlinAlbertini2018"&gt;

==Oogenesis in non-mammals==
[[File:Parasite160001-fig6 - Oogenesis in Crepidostomum metoecus (Digenea) (diagram).png|thumb|Diagram of oogenesis in a [[digenea]]n ([[Platyhelminthes]])]]
{{Main article|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}

Some [[algae]] and the [[oomycete]]s produce eggs in [[oogonia]]. In the brown alga ''[[Fucus]]'', all four egg cells survive oogenesis, which is an exception to the rule that generally only one product of female meiosis survives to maturity.

In [[plant]]s, oogenesis occurs inside the female [[gametophyte]] via [[mitosis]]. In many plants such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, and [[gymnosperm]]s, egg cells are formed in [[archegonia]]. In [[flowering plant]]s, the female gametophyte has been reduced to an eight-celled [[embryo sac]] within the [[ovule]] inside the [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] of the flower. Oogenesis occurs within the embryo sac and leads to the formation of a single egg cell per ovule.

In ''[[ascaris]]'', the oocyte does not even begin meiosis until the [[sperm]] touches it, in contrast to mammals, where meiosis is completed in the [[estrus]] cycle.

In [[epidemiology]], an '''outbreak''' is a sudden increase in occurrences of a [[disease]] in a particular time and place. It may affect a small and localized group or impact upon thousands of people across an entire continent.  Two linked cases of a rare [[infectious disease]] may be sufficient to constitute an outbreak. Outbreaks include [[epidemic]]s, which term is normally only used for [[infectious disease]]s, as well as diseases with an environmental origin, such as a water or [[Foodborne illness|foodborne disease]].  They may affect a region in a country or a group of countries. [[Pandemic]]s are near-global disease outbreaks.

==Outbreak investigation== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Epidemiology]] --&gt;
When investigating disease outbreaks, the epidemiology profession has developed a number of widely accepted steps. As described by the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], these include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/excite/classroom/outbreak/steps.htm Steps of an Outbreak Investigation], EXCITE | Epidemiology in the Classroom | Outbreak Steps&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify the existence of the outbreak (Is the group of ill persons normal for the time of year, geographic area, etc.?)
* Verify the diagnosis related to the outbreak
* Create a [[case definition]] to define who/what is included as a case
* Map the spread of the outbreak using [[Information technology]] as diagnosis is reported to insurance
* Develop a hypothesis (What appears to be causing the outbreak?)
* Study hypotheses (collect data and perform analysis)
* Refine hypothesis and carry out further study
* Develop and implement control and prevention systems
* Release findings to greater communities

The order of the above steps and relative amount of effort and resources used in each varies from outbreak to outbreak. For example, prevention and control measures are usually implemented very early in the investigation, often before the causative agent is known. In many situations, promoting good hygiene and hand-washing is one of the first things recommended. Other interventions may be added as the investigation moves forward and more information is obtained.  Waiting until the end of an investigation to implement prevention and control measures is a sure way to lose ones job. In outbreaks identified through notifiable disease surveillance, reports are often linked to laboratory results and verifying the diagnosis is straight forward.  In outbreaks of unknown etiology, determining and verifying the diagnosis can be a significant part of the investigation with respect to time and resources. Several steps are usually going on at any point in time during the investigation. Steps may be repeated. For example, initial case definitions are often established to be intentionally broad but later refined as more is learned about the outbreak. The above list has 9 steps, others have more. Implementing active surveillance to identify additional cases is often added.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/ss1978/ss1978.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=CDC|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
        
Outbreak debriefing and review has also been recognized as an additional final step and iterative process by the Public Health Agency of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Public Health Agency of Canada|title=Canada’s Food-borne Illness Outbreak Response Protocol (FIORP) 2010: To guide a multi-jurisdictional response|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/zoono/fiorp-mitioa/index-eng.php#toc7_11|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Epidemic curves.jpg|thumb]]
There are several outbreak patterns, which can be useful in identifying the transmission method or source, and predicting the future rate of infection.  Each has a distinctive '''epidemic curve''', or [[histogram]] of case infections and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/epiville/study5d.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319161341/http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/epiville/study5d.html |date=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common source – All victims acquire the infection from the same source (e.g. a contaminated water supply).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/excite/library/glossary.htm#outbreakcommonsource Glossary of Epidemiology Terms], Cdc.gov (2007-04-25). Retrieved on 2010-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Continuous source – Common source outbreak where the exposure occurs over multiple incubation periods
** Point source – Common source outbreak where the exposure occurs in less than one incubation period&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/excite/library/glossary.htm#outbreakpointsource Glossary of Epidemiology Terms]. Cdc.gov (2007-04-25). Retrieved on 2010-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Propagated – Transmission occurs from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/excite/library/glossary.htm#outbreakpropagated Glossary of Epidemiology Terms]. Cdc.gov (2007-04-25). Retrieved on 2010-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outbreaks can also be:

* Behavioral risk related (e.g., [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, increased risk due to [[malnutrition]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/doc.do/id/0900f3ec802272e6 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928223616/http://www.cdc.gov/doc.do/id/0900f3ec802272e6 |date=September 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zoonotic]] – The infectious agent is endemic to an animal population.

Patterns of occurrence are:

* [[Endemic (epidemiology)|Endemic]] – a communicable disease, such as influenza, measles, mumps, pneumonia, colds, smallpox, which is characteristic of a particular place, or among a particular group, or area of interest or activity.
* [[Epidemic]] – when this disease is found to infect a significantly larger number of people at the same time than is common at that time, and among that population, and may spread through one or several communities.
* [[Pandemic]] – occurs when an epidemic spreads worldwide.

==Outbreak legislation==
Outbreak legislation is still in its infancy and not many countries have had a direct and complete set of the provisions.&lt;ref name=ol&gt;{{cite web

However, some countries do manage the outbreaks using relevant acts, such as [[public health law]].&lt;ref name=lpe&gt;{{cite web

[[File:ICS Lima.svg|thumb|[[International maritime signal flags|Signal flag]] "Lima" called the "Yellow Jack" which when flown in harbor means ship is under quarantine. A simple [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] (also called the "Yellow Jack") had historically been used to signal quarantine (it stands for '''Q'''  among signal flags), but now indicates the opposite, as a signal of a ship free of disease that requests boarding and inspection.]]

A '''quarantine''' is used to separate and restrict the movement of people; it is 'a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests', for a certain period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster definition | http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quarantine&lt;/ref&gt; This is often used in connection to disease and illness, such as those who may possibly have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]].&lt;ref&gt;(Cited from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/)&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often erroneously used to mean medical [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]], which is "to separate ill persons who have a communicable disease from those who are healthy".&lt;ref&gt;Cited from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from an Italian variant (seventeenth-century Venetian) of 'quaranta giorni', meaning forty days, the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the [[Black Death]] plague [[epidemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Ronald Eccles, Olaf Weber|title=Common cold|year=2009|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1|pages=210|edition=Online-Ausg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quarantine can be applied to humans, but also to animals of various kinds, and both as part of [[border control]] as well as within a country.

==In practice==
The quarantining of people often raises questions of [[civil rights]], especially in cases of long confinement or segregation from society, such as that of [[Mary Mallon]] (aka Typhoid Mary), a [[typhoid fever]] [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] who spent the last 24 years and 7 months her life under quarantine.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Quarantine periods can be very short, such as in the case of a suspected [[anthrax]] attack, in which persons are allowed to leave as soon as they shed their potentially contaminated garments and undergo a [[decontamination]] shower. For example, an article entitled "Daily News workers quarantined" describes a brief quarantine that lasted until people could be showered in a decontamination tent. (Kelly Nankervis, Daily News).

The February/March 2003 issue of ''HazMat Magazine'' suggests that people be "locked in a room until proper decon could be performed", in the event of "suspect anthrax".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' senior correspondent Steve Urbon (14 February 2003) describes such temporary quarantine powers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Civil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have "certain powers to quarantine people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tognotti|first1=E.|title=Lessons from the history of quarantine, from plague to influenza A.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=2013 Feb|doi=10.3201/eid1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qureshi|first1=Adnan|title=Ebola Virus Disease: From Origin to Outbreak|date=2016|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=0128042303|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The purpose of such quarantine-for-decontamination is to prevent the spread of contamination, and to contain the contamination such that others are not put at risk from a person fleeing a scene where contamination is suspect. It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].

The first astronauts to visit the Moon were quarantined upon their return at the specially built [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]].

New developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the [[ambulance bus]], mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility that's under lockdown.

==History==
[[File:Quarantine guardship Rhin 1830.jpg|thumb|right|The quarantine ship Rhin, at large in [[Sheerness]]. Source: [[National Maritime Museum|National Maritime Museum of Greenwich, London]]]]
&lt;!-- Infected people were separated to prevent spread of disease among the ancient Israelites under the Mosaic Law, as recorded in the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;"If the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days. On the seventh day the priest is to examine them, and if he sees that the sore is unchanged and has not spread in the skin, he is to isolate them for another seven days." Lev. 15/4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

According to the records of many Historians, the earliest known incidents of quarantine occurred throughout the Muslim world, with evidence of voluntary community quarantine in some of these reported incidents. The first documented involuntary community quarantine was established by the Ottoman quarantine reform in 1838. The involuntary hospital quarantine of special groups of patients such as lepers started earlier in Islamic history. In 1307 the sixth Umayyad caliph built the first hospital in Damascus and issued an order to isolate lepers from other patients in the hospital. The practice of involuntary quarantine of lepers in general hospitals continued until the year 1431 when the Ottomans built a leprosy hospital in Edirne, where only lepers were admitted and treated.&lt;ref&gt;Quarantine Oxford Islamic Studies Online| http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t343/e0255?_hi=1&amp;_pos=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "quarantine" originates from the Venetian dialect form of the Italian ''quaranta giorni'', meaning 'forty days'. This is due to the 40-day isolation of ships and people before entering the city-state of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia).&lt;ref name="origin"/&gt; This was practiced as a measure of disease prevention related to the [[Black Death]]. Between 1348 and 1359, the Black Death wiped out an estimated 30% of Europe's population, and a significant percentage of Asia's population. The original document from 1377, which is kept in the Archives of Dubrovnik, states that before entering the city, newcomers had to spend 30 days (a ''trentine'') in a restricted place (originally nearby islands) waiting to see whether the symptoms of Black Death would develop. Later, isolation was prolonged to 40 days and was called quarantine.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sehdev, Paul S. |year=2002 |title=The Origin of Quarantine |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=1071–1072 |doi=10.1086/344062 |pmid=12398064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other diseases lent themselves to the practice of quarantine before and after the devastation of the plague. Those afflicted with [[leprosy]] were historically isolated from society, as were the attempts to check the invasion of [[syphilis]] in northern Europe in about 1490, the advent of [[yellow fever]] in Spain at the beginning of the 19th century, and the arrival of Asiatic [[cholera]] in 1831.

[[Republic of Venice|Venice]] took the lead in measures to check the spread of plague, having appointed three guardians of public health in the first years of the Black Death (1348). The next record of preventive measures comes from [[Reggio Emilia|Reggio]] in [[Modena]] in 1374. The first [[lazaret]] was founded by Venice in 1403, on a small island adjoining the city. In 1467, Genoa followed the example of Venice, and in 1476 the old leper hospital of [[Marseille]] was converted into a plague hospital. The great lazaret of Marseilles, perhaps the most complete of its kind, was founded in 1526 on the island of [[Frioul archipelago|Pomègues]]. The practice at all the Mediterranean lazarets was not different from the English procedure in the Levantine and North African trade. On the approach of cholera in 1831 some new lazarets were set up at western ports, notably a very extensive establishment near [[Bordeaux]], afterwards turned to another use.

==International conventions==
Since 1852 several conferences were held involving European powers, with a view to uniform action in keeping out infection from the East and preventing its spread within Europe. All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.

The Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 Text of the 1903 convention, from the website of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926134555/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 |date=26 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 4, pp. 282–413.&lt;/ref&gt; This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter. It was signed by 40 countries, and consisted of 160 articles. Ratifications by 16 of the signatories were exchanged in Paris on 7 October 1920. Another multilateral convention was signed in Paris on 21 June 1926, to replace that of 1912. It was signed by 58 countries worldwide, and consisted of 172 articles.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 78, pp. 230–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America, a series of regional sanitary conventions were concluded. Such a convention was concluded in Rio de Janeiro on 12 June 1904. A sanitary convention between the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay was concluded in Montevideo on 21 April 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 5, pp. 394–441.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention covers cases of [[Asiatic cholera]], [[Third plague pandemic|oriental plague]] and [[yellow fever]]. It was ratified by the Uruguayan government on 13 October 1914, by the Paraguayan government on 27 September 1917 and by the Brazilian government on 18 January 1921.

Sanitary conventions were also concluded between European states. A Soviet-Latvian sanitary convention was signed on 24 June 1922, for which ratifications were exchanged on 18 October 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 38, pp. 10–55.&lt;/ref&gt; A bilateral sanitary convention was concluded between the governments of Latvia and Poland on 7 July 1922, for which ratifications were exchanged on 7 April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 37, pp. 318–339.&lt;/ref&gt; Another was concluded between the governments of Germany and Poland in Dresden on 18 December 1922, and entered into effect on 15 February 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vo. 34, pp. 302–313.&lt;/ref&gt; Another one was signed between the governments of Poland and Romania on 20 December 1922. Ratifications were exchanged on 11 July 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 18, pp. 104–119.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish government also concluded such a convention with the Soviet government on 7 February 1923, for which ratifications were exchanged on 8 January 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 49, pp. 286–314.&lt;/ref&gt; A sanitary convention was also concluded between the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia on 5 September 1925, for which ratifications were exchanged on 22 October 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 58, pp. 144–177.&lt;/ref&gt; A convention was signed between the governments of Germany and Latvia on 9 July 1926, for which ratifications were exchanged on 6 July 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 63, pp. 322–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first points to be dealt with in 1897 was to settle the [[incubation period]] for this disease, and the period to be adopted for administrative purposes. It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.

== Signals and flags ==
[[Image:ICS Quebec.svg|thumb|[[International maritime signal flags|Signal flag]] "Quebec, " also called the "Yellow Jack" is a simple yellow flag that was historically used to signal quarantine (it stands for '''Q'''), but in modern use indicates the opposite, as a signal of a ship free of disease that requests boarding and inspection.]]
Plain yellow, green, and even black flags have been used to symbolize disease in both ships and ports, with the color yellow having a longer historical precedent, as a color of marking for houses of infection, previous to its use as a maritime marking color for disease. The present flag used for the purpose is the "Lima" ('''L''') flag, which is a mixture of yellow and black flags previously used. It is sometimes called the "yellow jack" but this was also a name for [[yellow fever]], which probably derives its common name from the flag, not the color of the victims (cholera ships also used a yellow flag).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sehdev PS|title=The origin of quarantine|journal=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]]|date=1 November 2002|volume=35|issue=9|pages=1071–2|doi=10.1086/344062|pmid=12398064}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plain [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] ("Quebec" or '''Q''' in [[international maritime signal flags]]) probably derives its letter symbol for its initial use in ''quarantine'', but this flag in modern times indicates the opposite—a ship that declares itself free of quarantinable disease, and requests boarding and routine port inspection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/xf~q.html quarantine mark history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Australia has perhaps the world's strictest quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is important because of its proximity to South-east Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia. For this reason, the region from Cairns to Broome—including the [[Torres Strait]]—is the focus for many important quarantine activities that protect all Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405091101/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |archivedate=5 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Australia has been geographically isolated from other major continents for millions of years, there is an endemically unique ecosystem free of several severe pests and diseases that are present in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="daff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|title=Quarantine in Australia - Department of Agriculture|publisher=daff.gov.au|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If other products are brought inside along with pests and diseases, it would damage the ecosystem seriously and add millions of costs in the local agricultural businesses.&lt;ref name="australia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Quarantine a shared responsibility: The Government response|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity/australia/reports-pubs/nairn/govt-response|website=Australian Government|publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Energy|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] is responsible for border-inspection of any products which are brought into Australia, and assess the potential risks the products might harm Australian environment. Visitors are required to fill in the information card truthfully before arriving in Australia, and declare what food and any products made of wood and other natural materials they have processed. If the visitor fails to do so, usually a quarantine fine of 220 Australian dollars are to be paid as quarantine infringement notice, and if not, the visitor may face criminal convictions of fining 100,000 Australian dollars and 10 years imprisonment.

==Canada==
There are three quarantine [[Acts of Parliament]] in Canada: ''Quarantine Act'' (humans) and ''Health of Animals Act'' (animals) and ''Plant Protection Act'' (vegetations). The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.

Under the ''Quarantine Act'', all travellers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.

A QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveller, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveller who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.

Under the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.

Each province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.

==Hong Kong==
Under the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles he/she believes to be infectious or contains infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.

The law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.

Under the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, members of the [[Civil Aid Service]] or [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escape from detention.

==United Kingdom==
To reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].

===British quarantine rules after 1711===
The plague had disappeared from England, never to return, for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for, owing to an alarm, lest plague should be imported from Poland and the Baltics; the second act of 1721 was due to the disastrous prevalence of plague at Marseille and other places in Provence, France; it was renewed in 1733 owing to a fresh outbreak of the malady on the continent of Europe, and again in 1743, owing to the disastrous epidemic at Messina. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating the Levantine trade; and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltics. Although no plague cases ever came to England all those years, the restrictions on traffic became more and more stringent (following the movements of medical dogma), and in 1788 a very oppressive Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The first year of the nineteenth century marked the turning-point in quarantine legislation; a parliamentary committee sat on the practice, and a more reasonable act arose on their report. In 1805 there was another new act, and in 1823–24 again an elaborate inquiry followed by an act making the quarantine only at discretion of the privy council, and at the same time recognizing yellow fever or other highly infectious disorder as calling for quarantine measures along with plague. The steady approach of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of a thoroughgoing resort to quarantine restrictions. The pestilence invaded every country of Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. In England the experiment of hermetically sealing the ports was not seriously tried when cholera returned in 1849, 1853 and 1865–66. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with clean bills from the Black Sea and the Levant to be admitted to free pratique, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage; and therewith the last remnant of the once formidable quarantine practice against plague may be said to have disappeared.

For a number of years after the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were of the most haphazard and arbitrary kind. In 1721 two vessels laden with cotton goods from Cyprus, then a seat of plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving  as indemnity. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752 vessels for the United Kingdom with a foul bill (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to repair to the lazarets of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to perform their quarantine or to have their cargoes sufficiently opened and aired. Since 1741 Stangate Creek (on the Medway) had been made the quarantine station at home; but it would appear from the above clause that it was available only for vessels with clean bills. In 1755 lazarets in the form of floating hulks were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to dews) having been done previously on the ship's deck. There was no medical inspection employed, but the whole routine left to the officers of customs and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to lie forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air the sacks; but owing to remonstrances, which came chiefly from Edinburgh and Leith, grain was from that date declared to be a non-susceptible article. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or within four leagues of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland, to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, under a penalty of{{clarify|date=March 2017}}  After 1800, ships from plague-countries (or with foul bills) were enabled to perform their quarantine on arrival in the [[Medway]] instead of taking a Mediterranean port on the way for that purpose; and about the same time an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near Chatham at an expense of which was almost at once condemned owing to its marshy foundations, and the materials sold for{{clarify|date=March 2017}}  The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before.

The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. The expenses may be estimated from one or two examples. In 1820 the ''Asia'', 763 tons, arrived in the Medway with a foul bill from Alexandria, laden with linseed; her freight was{{clarify|date=March 2017}}  and her quarantine dues{{clarify|date=March 2017}}  The same year the ''Pilato'', 495 tons, making the same voyage, paid quarantine dues on a freight of{{clarify|date=March 2017}} In 1823 the expenses of the quarantine service (at various ports) were{{clarify|date=March 2017}} and the dues paid by shipping (nearly all with clean bills){{clarify|date=March 2017}} A return for the United Kingdom and colonies in 1849 showed, among other details, that the expenses of the lazaret at Malta for ten years from 1839 to 1848 had been{{clarify|date=March 2017}} From 1846 onwards the establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act 1896]], which repealed the Quarantine Act 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the Local Government Board the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague, the powers to deal with cholera ships having been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The British regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the [[Customs|Royal Customs]], as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposed infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the port sanitary authority. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was certified of the fact, removed to a hospital provided (if his condition allow), and kept under the orders of the medical officer. If the sick could be removed, the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected (owing to his or her immediate attendance on the sick) could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land on giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and bilge-water and water-ballast (subject to exceptions) pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly at the main mast a yellow and black flag borne quarterly from sunrise to sunset.

==United States==
The United States puts immediate quarantines on imported products if the disease can be traced back to a certain shipment or product. All imports will also be quarantined if the diseases breakout in other countries.  
According to Title [http://www.publichealthlaw.net/Resources/ResourcesPDFs/4quarantine.pdf 42 U.S.C. §§264 and 266], these statutes provide the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services ("the Secretary") peacetime and wartime authority, respectively, to control the movement of persons into and within the United States to prevent the spread of [[communicable disease]].

Besides the port of entry where it is located, each station is also responsible for quarantining potentially infected travelers entering through any ports of entry in its assigned region. These facilities are fairly small; each one is operated by a few staff members and capable of accommodating 1-2 travelers for a short observation period.&lt;ref name=acrp2008/&gt; Cost estimates for setting up a temporary larger facility, capable of accommodating 100 to 200 travelers for several weeks, have been published by the Airport Cooperative Research Program in 2008.&lt;ref name=acrp2008/&gt;

===United States{{snd}}history===
Quarantine law began in Colonial America in 1663, when in an attempt to curb an outbreak of [[smallpox]], the city of New York established a quarantine. In the 1730s, the city built a quarantine station on the [[Bedloe's Island]].&lt;ref name="Lazaretto"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ushistory.org/laz/history/index.htm |title=Lazaretto Quarantine Station, Tinicum Township, Delaware County, PA: History |accessdate=24 April 2008 |publisher= [[ushistory.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philadelphia Lazaretto]] was the first quarantine hospital in the United States, built in 1799, in &lt;!-- [[Essington, Pennsylvania|Essington]], --&gt; [[Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Tinicum Township]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="City"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phila.gov/Health/Commissioner/History/ContagiousDiseaseControl.html

During the [[1918 flu pandemic]], people were also quarantined. Most commonly suspect cases of infectious diseases are requested to voluntarily quarantine themselves, and Federal and local quarantine statutes only have been uncommonly invoked since then, including for a suspected [[smallpox]] case in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Get In That Bubble, Boy!

U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] euphemistically referred to the U.S. Navy's interdiction of shipping en route to Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] as a "quarantine" rather than a [[blockade]], because a quarantine is a legal act in peacetime, whereas a blockade is defined as an act of aggression under the [[U.N. Charter]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In computer science, "quarantining" describes putting files infected by [[computer virus]]es into a special directory, so as to eliminate the threat they pose, without irreversibly deleting them.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Spanish term for quaratine, ''la cuarantina'', refers also to the period of [[postpartum confinement]] in which a new mother and her baby are sheltered from the outside world.

* [[Eyam]] was a village in Britain that chose to isolate itself to stop the spread of the plague northward in 1665. They were hindered in this by the limited knowledge of the disease at the time: what caused it, what forms infection took, what animal [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s carried it, how it spread.
* On 28 July 1814, the convict ship ''[[Surry (1811 ship)|Surry]]'' arrived in Sydney Harbour from England. Over 40 persons had died of [[typhoid]] during the voyage, including 36 convicts, and the ship was placed in quarantine on the North Shore. Convicts were landed, and a camp was established in the immediate vicinity of what is now [[Jeffrey Street]] in [[Kirribilli]]. This was the first site in Australia to be used for quarantine purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* During the [[1918 flu pandemic]], the then [[List of governors of American Samoa|Governor of]] [[American Samoa]], [[John Martin Poyer]], imposed a full quarantine of the islands from all incoming ships, successfully achieving zero deaths within the territory. In contrast, the neighboring [[Occupation of German Samoa|New Zealand-controlled]] [[Western Samoa Trust Territory|Western Samoa]] was among the hardest hit, with a 90% infection rate and over 20% of its adults dying from the disease. This failure by the New Zealand government to prevent and contain the Spanish Flu subsequently rekindled [[Mau movement|Samoan anti-colonial sentiments]] that led to its eventual independence.
* In 1942, during [[World War II]], British forces tested out their biological weapons programme on [[Gruinard Island]] and infected it with [[anthrax]]. The quarantine was lifted in 1990, when the island was declared safe, and a flock of sheep was released onto the island.
* In 1969, the astronauts of [[Apollo 11]] and lunar samples were quarantined for a couple of weeks in the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]], to prevent [[interplanetary contamination]] by back contamination from the [[Moon]].
* The [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia]] was the final outbreak of [[smallpox]] in Europe. The [[WHO]] fought the outbreak with extensive quarantine, and the government instituted [[martial law]].
* In 2014, [[Kaci Hickox]], a [[Doctors Without Borders]] nurse from Maine, legally battled 21-day quarantines imposed by the states of New Jersey and Maine after returning home from treating [[Ebola]] patients in [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/08/kacii-hickox-leaving-maine_n_6127146.html|author=Reuters|title=Kaci Hickox, Nurse Who Fought Ebola Quarantine, To Leave Maine: Report|date=November 8, 2014
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hickox was sequestered in a medical tent for days because New Jersey announced new Ebola regulations the day she arrived. She eventually was allowed to travel to Maine, where the state sought to impose a 'voluntary quarantine' before trying and failing to create a buffer between her and others. A state judge rejected attempts to restrict her movements, saying she posed no threat as long as she wasn't demonstrating any symptoms of Ebola. Hickox said health care professionals like those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - not politicians like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Maine Gov. Paul LePage - should be in charge of making decisions that are grounded in science, not fear."&lt;ref&gt;CBSNews&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7658">The '''''Revierwasserlaufanstalt Freiberg''''' ("Freiberg Mines Water Management System") or RWA Freiberg, was a historical water management system that delivered driving water to the [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] mines in the German state of Saxony. Today the system is used to supply drinking and industrial water and is operated by the Saxony State Reservoir Office (''Landestalsperrenverwaltung Sachsen'').

The ''Revierwasseranstalt Freiberg'' has been selected as a candidate for the future [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] of the [[Ore Mountain Mining Region]] (''Montanregion Erzgebirge'').

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The beginnings of the ''Revierwasserlaufanstalt'' coincide with the start of mining in the Freiberg region in 1168. The term "water management" in this case embraces the many facilities laid out and expanded time and again to handle water for the mining industry, such as ditches (''[[Kunstgraben|Kunstgräben]]''), water tunnels (''[[Rösche]]n'') and ponds or reservoirs (''[[Kunstteich]]e''), that supplied water to the [[mining|pit]]s, [[stamp mill]]s and [[smelteries]].

=== 1557–1853 ===
About 1557, Martin Planer began the systematic upgrade of the water management facilities that had hitherto been laid out. This is the starting point for the facilities of the ''Revierwasserlaufanstalt'', a system that is still in operation today.&lt;ref name="Wagenbreth"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Otfried Wagenbreth|EditorSurname1=Eberhard Wächtler|Title=Der Freiberger Bergbau : Technische Denkmale und Geschichte|Edition=2.|Publisher=Deutscher Verlag für Grundstoffindustrie|PublicationPlace=Leipzig|Year=1988|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;62-72|ISBN=3-342-00117-8|Date=  1988|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for this concept at the time was ''Wasserversorgung'' ("water supply"); but from about 1846 the term ''Revierwasserversorgung'' ("mining area water supply") was used. From about 1684 the Electoral Tunnel and Adit Administration of Freiburg (''Kurfürstliche Stolln- und Röschen-Administration zu Freiberg''), established by [[John George III of Saxony|Prince-Elector John George III]], was made responsible for water supply facilities, overseen by the [[Saxon Mining Office]] (''Sächsisches Oberbergamt'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smul.sachsen.de/ltv/download/LTV_RWA_fertig.pdf | title=Revierwasserlaufanstalt Freiberg | access-date=2011-07-14 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during that time that facilities such as the ''Kuhschachter Teich'', the ''[[Zethauer Kunstgraben]]'', the ''[[Unterer Großhartmannsdorfer Teich|Große Großhartmannsdorfer Teich]]'', the ''[[Müdisdorfer Kunstgraben und Rösche]]'', the ''[[Erzengler Teich]]'' and the ''[[Hohbirker Kunstgraben]]'' were built. Because the demand for driving water grew rapidly, when this could be provided by the ever-growing system of ditches the division of water available was optimised. In order to make this comprehensible, the amount of water allocated to individual consumers had to be measured. This led, in the 18th century, to the introduction of a new unit of measurement, the "wheel of water" (''Rad Wasser'') whereby 100 [[Old weights and measures (Saxony)#Volume measurement|cubic foot]]/min = 37.85 l/s).&lt;ref name="Wagenbreth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kalender für den Sächsischen Berg- und Hütten-Mann auf das Jahr 1850.'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Another control mechanism was the water tax (''Wassersteuer'') where, in 1853, one ''[[Lachter]]rad'' (37.85l/s at 2 m drop in height for one year =1.194 Mio. m³/year) cost 20 [[Thaler|taler]].&lt;ref name="Wagenbreth"/&gt;

=== 1853–1913 ===
Under §283 of the [[Mining law|law covering the mining by royal assent in the Kingdom of Saxony dated 22 May 1851]] the ''Kurfürst-Johann-Georg-Stolln'', the ''Tiefe Fürstenstolln'', the ''Thelersberger Stolln'', the ''Alte tiefe Fürstenstolln'', the ''Dörnthaler Wasserleitung'', the ''Junger Fürst zu Sachsen Müdisdorfer Rösche'', the ''Martelbacher Rösche'' the ''Muldenwasser-Versorgung'' "with all their fixtures of smelteries, mills, water tunnels, ponds, adits and galleries, whose rights and responsibilities (''Rutzungen'') and even their entire assets" were transferred to the ''"Gesammteigenthum des Freiberger Reviers"'' which had the title of ''"Revierwasserlaufsanstalt"''.&lt;ref&gt;''Regulativ für die Verwaltung der Revierwasserlaufs-Anstalt zu Freiberg'', in: Jahrbuch für den Berg- und Hütten-Mann auf das Jahr 1854., p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The ponds or ''[[Kunstteich]]e'' used to provide water for the mining industry in the [[Freiberg Mining Field]], in order to drive [[water wheel]]s and [[stamp mill]]s and to wash the ore. They are connected to one another by around 50&amp;nbsp;km of ditches (''[[Kunstgraben|Kunstgräben]]'') and tunnels (''[[Rösche]]n'').
The Upper RWA supplies [[drinking water]], the Lower RWA [[industrial water]]. The RWA system also transfers water from the  [[Rauschenbach Reservoir]] to the [[Saidenbach Reservoir]] in order to supply the [[Chemnitz]] area. In addition, water is transferred from the [[Oberer Großhartmannsdorfer Teich]] via the [[Lichtenberg Reservoir]] and from there to the [[Klingenberg Reservoir]] and into the [[Dresden]] area.

== Construction ==
The [[dam]]s of the RWA are [[earth-fill dam]]s or homogeneous dams with impervious clay cores or clay blankets on the upstream side. The dams are very wide and have steep faces. The downstream, grass-covered faces are sometimes supported by stone arches. On the upstream face the dams have a stone wall (a so-called ''Tarrasmauer'') to guard against waves. To release the water there is a valve (''Striegel'') operated from the valve house (''Striegelhaus'') by a winch and spindle.

== RWA reservoirs ==
Today the RWA has 10 ponds or reservoirs that are operated by the Saxony State Reservoir Agency (''Landestalsperrenverwaltung Sachsen'').

== Neighbouring reservoirs ==
There are other reservoirs in the neighbourhood, most of which are also very old:
* Oberer und Unterer Pochwerkteich [[Langenau (Brand-Erbisdorf)]] (1570)
* Landteich
* [[Lotterteich]] (also Lother Teich, Lothener Teich or Mühlteich) (around 1600)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7947">'''Sivand Dam''' is a [[dam]] built in 2007 in [[Fars Province]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="tehrantimes.com"&gt;[http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=174771 Cyrus the Great tomb needs constant monitoring of moisture] Tehran Times, 6 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Named after the nearby town of [[Sivand]] located northwest of [[Shiraz]], it was the center of worldwide concern because of the flooding it would cause in historical and [[archaeology|archaeologically]] rich areas of [[Ancient Persia]] and possible harm it may cause to the nearby [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] of [[Persepolis]] and [[Pasargadae]].&lt;ref name="minervamag"&gt;http://www.minervamagazine.com/news.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning and history==
The Iranian government planned Sivand Dam for over 10 years, with a location on the Polvar River in the [[Tangeh Bolaghi]] (Bolaghi Gorge) in between the ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae. Intended to allow [[irrigation]] in the arid region, the planning and initial site construction began in 1992, then was stopped for further planning and was reactivated in 2003.

For the first decade, much of the planning was not made public; Iran's own [[Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran|Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization]] (ICHO) was not aware of total area of flooding until 2003.  When the intentions for the dam were made public, international concern was raised regarding damage to any archaeological sites, particularly the two World Heritage Sites.  Rumors spread that the dam would place the two ruins under water, spurring outcry and petitions of concerned experts and individuals.  Scientists with the dam project dismissed the rumors outright, and Iranian officials pointed some blame for the rumors on the political opposition parties from outside Iran.  Iranian Ministry of Energy studies have placed the furthest reaches of the lake approximately 7 kilometers to south of the plain of Murqab; that is 9 kilometers from Pasargadae and more than 70 kilometers from Persepolis.

However, Iranian officials from the Ministry of Energy and ICHO did acknowledge that the lake will flood 130 Persian archeological sites and invited international teams to help excavate the area before construction commenced.  In 2004, the [[United Nations]] issued an urgent international appeal for archaeologists to join the domestic effort to unearth and record what they could before the flooding.  Teams from [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]], and the [[United States]] responded to the request for help.&lt;ref name="minervamag" /&gt;

One consequence of the dam's construction was an opportunity for extensive archaeological work in a historically rich area in a short amount of time.  The oldest sites the international teams found were caves inhabited about 7,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The archaeologists uncovered a narrow 9-mile dirt road believed to be the Royal Passage of the [[Achaemenids]], connecting the two ancient cities, that was in use until the 18th century.

The archaeological work caused the construction schedule of Sivand Dam to be pushed back.  The area was originally supposed to be flooded by end of February 2006, but the discovery of an Achaemenid-era village and cemetery caused it to be delayed.  

==Potential effects on Pasargadae==
Besides the certain flooding of 130 archaeological sites, larger concern has been levied at the dam's effect on nearby World Heritage Sites, particularly Pasargadae, an ancient capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] built by [[Cyrus the Great]] and the site of his tomb.

Experts involved with planning the dam deny this claim, noting that the site is well above and away from the eventual waterline.  However, it is unknown how the dampness caused by the dam will affect the ruins.  Archaeologists and scientists agree that the rise in humidity from the new lake will speed up the destruction of Pasargadae to some degree.&lt;ref name="minervamag" /&gt; Although no preliminary environmental research has been carried out to assess the effects of humidity upon the constructions at Pasargadae, the Ministry of Energy believes it could be compensated by controlling the water level of the dam reservoir.

In 2010, studies of the Pasargadae showed that [[groundwater]] levels in the area had risen as a result of the dam and lake.  The higher groundwater levels and increased humidity were said to be directly affecting foundation failures and the forming of newer cracks in walls and platforms throughout the ruins. &lt;ref&gt;[https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2010/12/experts-claim-persepolis-will-collapse.html#M6pAU1KXLMpxeEbs.97 Archaeology News Network, December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion==
Sivand Dam was completed in 2007,&lt;ref name="tehrantimes.com"/&gt; but the height of the lake behind it was delimited so that it would not harm the site of Cyrus the Great Mausoleum. Dr. Shahriar Adl was active in preserving the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldculturalheritagevoices.org/lamentable-loss/ Lamentable Loss: Dr. Shahriar Adl died on June 21 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transmission-based precautions''' are additional [[infection control]] precautions in health care, and the latest routine infection prevention and control practices applied for patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with infectious agents, including certain [[Epidemiology|epidemiologically]] important [[pathogen]]s. The latter require additional control measures to effectively prevent transmission.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Siegel JD, Rhinehart E, Jackson M, Chiarello L, and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Infection prevention and control of epidemic- and pandemic-prone acute respiratory diseases in health care, WHO Interim Guidelines.2007 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for use in healthcare setting==
Communicable diseases occur as a result of the interaction between:
* a source (or reservoir) of infectious agents,
* a mode of transmission for the agent,
* a susceptible host with a portal of entry receptive to the agent,
* the environment.
The control of communicable diseases may involve changing one or more of these components, the first three of which are influenced by the environment. These diseases can have a wide range of effects, varying from silent infection – with no signs or symptoms – to severe illness and death. According to its nature, a certain infectious agent may demonstrate one or more following modes of transmission:
* direct and indirect contact transmission,
* droplet transmission and
* airborne transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Bonita, Ruth et al.. Basic epidemiology. 2nd edition. World Health Organization. 226 p., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
Transmission-based precautions are used when the route(s) of transmission is (are) not completely interrupted using Standard Precautions alone.
Three categories of transmission-based precautions are designed with respect to the modes of transmission:
* Contact precautions,
* Droplet precautions, and
* Airborne precautions.
For some diseases that have multiple routes of transmission (e.g., SARS), more than one transmission-based precautions category may be used. When used either singly or in combination, they are always used in addition to Standard Precautions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

When transmission-based precautions are indicated, efforts must be made to counteract possible adverse effects on patients (i.e., anxiety, depression and other mood disturbances,&lt;ref&gt;Catalano G, Houston SH, Catalano MC, et al. Anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients in resistant organism isolation. South Med J 2003;96(2):141-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarzi S, Kennedy P, Stone S, Evans M.

JAMA 2003;290(14):1899-905.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to improve acceptance by the patients and adherence by health care workers.

===Contact precautions===
Contact precautions are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents, including epidemiologically important [[microorganism]]s, which are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient’s environment. The specific agents and circumstance for which contact precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A 
of the Guidance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; The application of contact precautions for patients infected or colonized with MDROs is described in the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms In Healthcare Settings, 2006. 2006. www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Contact precautions also apply where the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased potential for extensive environmental contamination and risk of transmission. A single-patient room is preferred for patients who require contact precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). In multi-patient rooms, &gt;3&amp;nbsp;feet spatial separation between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on contact precautions wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient's environment. Donning PPE upon room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to contain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through environmental contamination (e.g., VRE, C. difficile, noroviruses and other intestinal tract pathogens; RSV)&lt;ref&gt;Donskey CJ.

Recommendations of the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC). MMWR Recomm Rep 1995;44 (RR12):1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Droplet precautions===
Droplet precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a healthcare facility, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission. Infectious agents for which droplet precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A and include ''[[Bordetella pertussis|B. pertussis]]'', [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]], [[adenovirus]], [[rhinovirus]], ''[[Neisseria meningitidis|N. meningitides]]'', and [[Streptococcus pyogenes|group A streptococcus]] (for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy). A single patient room is preferred for patients who require droplet precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). Spatial separation of &gt; 3&amp;nbsp;feet and drawing the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in multi-bed rooms with infections transmitted by the droplet route. Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patient; the mask is generally donned upon room entry. Patients on droplet precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette.

===Airborne precautions===
Airborne precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chickenpox], ''M. tuberculosis'', and possibly SARS-CoV). The preferred placement for patients who require airborne precautions is in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). An AIIR is a single-patient room that is equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Institute (AIA/FGI) standards for AIIRs (i.e., monitored negative pressure relative to the surrounding area,&lt;ref&gt;CDC. Guidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health-care settings, 2005. MMWR Recomm Rep 2005;54(17):1-141.&lt;/ref&gt; air exchanges per hour for new construction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilities, air exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return).&lt;ref&gt;AIA. Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Health Care Facilities. In: American Institute of Architects. Washington, DC: American Institute of Architects Press; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states require the availability of such rooms in hospitals, emergency departments, and nursing homes that care for patients with ''M. tuberculosis''. A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, [[Respirator fit test|fit-testing]], and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where airborne precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (e.g., physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (e.g., office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for healthcare personnel will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on airborne precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations (Appendix A),&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; that is donned prior to room entry. Whenever possible, non-immune HCWs should not care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (e.g., measles, chickenpox, and smallpox).

==Syndromic and empirical use&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; ==
Since the infecting agent often is not known at the time of admission to a healthcare facility, transmission-based precautions are used empirically, according to the clinical syndrome and the likely etiologic agents at the time, and then modified when the pathogen is identified or a transmissible infectious etiology is ruled out.
Diagnosis of many infections requires laboratory confirmation. Since laboratory tests, especially those that depend on culture techniques, often require two or more days for completion, transmission-based precautions must be implemented while test results are pending based on the clinical presentation and likely pathogens. Use of appropriate transmission-based precautions at the time a patient develops symptoms or signs of transmissible infection, or arrives at a healthcare facility for care, reduces transmission opportunities. While it is not possible to identify prospectively all patients needing transmission-based precautions, certain clinical syndromes and conditions carry a sufficiently high risk to warrant their use empirically while confirmatory tests are pending.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Discontinuation ==
Transmission-based precautions remain in effect for limited periods of time (i.e., while the risk for transmission of the infectious agent persists or for the duration of the illness (Appendix A).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; For most infectious diseases, this duration reflects known patterns of persistence and shedding of infectious agents associated with the natural history of the infectious process and its treatment. For some diseases (e.g., pharyngeal or cutaneous diphtheria, RSV), transmission-based precautions remain in effect until culture or antigen-detection test results document eradication of the pathogen and, for RSV, symptomatic disease is resolved. For other diseases, (e.g., ''M. tuberculosis'') state laws and regulations, and healthcare facility policies, may dictate the duration of precautions 12). In immunocompromised patients, viral shedding can persist for prolonged periods of time (many weeks to months) and transmission to others may occur during that time; therefore, the duration of contact and/or droplet precautions may be prolonged for many weeks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zambon M, Bull T, Sadler CJ, Goldman JM, Ward KN.

Duration of colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after hospital discharge and risk factors for prolonged carriage. Clin Infect Dis 2001;32(10):1393-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly MDR-GNB, can persist for many months, especially in the presence of severe underlying disease, invasive devices, and recurrent courses of antimicrobial agents. It may be prudent to assume that MDRO carriers are colonized permanently and manage them accordingly. Alternatively, an interval free of hospitalizations, antimicrobial therapy, and invasive devices (e.g., 6 or 12 months) before reculturing patients to document clearance of carriage may be used. Determination of the best strategy awaits the results of additional studies. See the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; for discussion of possible criteria to discontinue contact precautions for patients colonized or infected with MDROs.

==Application in ambulatory and home care settings==
Although transmission-based precautions generally apply in all healthcare settings, exceptions exist. For example, in home care, AIIRs are not available. Furthermore, family members already exposed to diseases such as varicella and tuberculosis would not use masks or respiratory protection, but visiting HCWs would need to use such protection. Similarly, management of patients colonized or infected with MDROs may necessitate contact precautions in acute care hospitals and in some LTCFs when there is continued transmission, but the risk of transmission in ambulatory care and home care, has not been defined. Consistent use of Standard Precautions may suffice in these settings, but more information is needed.

An '''Underground Hospital''' is a building with facilities that can be moved into in order to protect its patients and medical personnel, primarily from attack during times of war. They were often used during [[World War II]] but very few now remain operational.

==History==

===Medieval===

====Ceppo Hospital of Pistoia in Italy====

The Ceppo Hospital of Pistoia was founded in 1277 in a labyrinth of tunnels under the city and is one of the oldest continuously operating hospitals in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turismo.intoscana.it/site/en/highlights/The-Museum-of-Pistoia-Underground/ |title=The Museum of Pistoia Underground |publisher=turismo.intoscana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
====Carriere Suzanne in France====

“Carriere Suzanne“ was an underground hospital built during the First World War in a limestone quarry the “Carrieres de Montigny”, north of [[Compiègne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://argunners.com/carrieres-de-montigny-abandoned-ww1-underground-hospital/ |title=Carrieres de Montigny: Abandoned WW1 Underground Hospital |publisher=Argunners |date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carrière Wellington in France====

A hospital was built inside tunnels under Arras, named Carrière Wellington, with facilities for 700 beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatwar.co.uk/french-flanders-artois/museum-wellington-quarry.htm |title=Wellington Quarry — la Carrière Wellington, Arras |publisher=The Great War 1914-1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
====Hohlgangsanlage 8 in Jersey====

[[Hohlgangsanlage 8]] was an artillery storage tunnel build by [[Organisation Todt]] workers for the Germans during [[World War II]] in [[St. Lawrence]], [[Jersey]], which was converted to a hospital to deal with casualties after the [[Normandy landings]] on 6 June 1944. The tunnel complex is open to the public during the summer months.

====Hohlgangsanlage 7/40 in Guernsey====

''Hohlgangsanlage 7/40'' (Ho.7/40) two interconnected cave passage installations of 7,000m²,&lt;ref name="FGGT"&gt;{{cite book |title=German Tunnels in Guernsey, Alderney and Sark |publisher=Festung Guernsey |ISBN=978-0-9549334-4-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}} were built in 1942-43 by German Fortress Engineer and [[Organisation Todt]] workers to store vehicles, ammunition, food, fuel and equipment. Part of Ho. 7/40 was equipped and used for a short while in 1944 as a hospital, as the planned hospital tunnel had not been built, however patients underground did not recuperate very well.&lt;ref name="GVG"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gilbert |last=Van Grieken |title= Destination Gustav |publisher=Guernsey Press 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} The tunnel complex is open to the public during the summer months.

====Mtarfa Hospital in Malta====

During the Second World War, the Mtarfa Hospital was reorganized as the 90th General Hospital and expanded to accommodate a maximum of 1200 beds. An underground hospital was excavated under the military hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vassallohistory.wordpress.com/military-hospitals-in-malta/ |title=MILITARY HOSPITALS IN MALTA |publisher=vassallohistory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Era===

====RAF Little Rissington in England====

[[RAF Little Rissington]] was believed by locals to have a nuclear-proof underground hospital built by the [[United States Air Force]]. This rumour was, however, never verified. Little Rissington became the largest military contingency hospital in Europe. The aerodrome was cleared for [[C-130 Hercules]] and [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxies]]. During the [[Gulf War]], Little Rissington was held on its highest readiness state for several decades as it prepared for casualties. The USAF left Little Rissington in 1993 and it was handed back to the [[Royal Air Force]].

==Current==
===Israel===
[[Israel]] currently has five hospitals dedicated with underground facilities. 2 of the hospitals have underground car parks which can be converted into hospital wards complete with [[operating rooms]] and [[Emergency Room]]s at short notice. Two others have dedicated underground bunkers.

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], [[Northern Israel]] was heavily bombarded by rockets in civilian populated areas as well as rockets landing within close proximity to hospitals in the area, during which the [[Emergency Room]]s in [[Rambam Health Care Campus]], [[Haifa]], continued treating over 7000 routine-emergency patients and war casualties while under fire. It was decided then that Israel was in need of hospitals capable of withstanding attack against their facilities, while continuing with [[Patient Care]].

====Sourasky Medical Center====
[[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]] is the main [[hospital]] serving [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. It is the third-largest hospital complex in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/16/ART1/578/331.html|accessdate=2007-09-14|author=Ayala Hurwicz|date=2007-05-07|language=Hebrew|title=Sheba - Largest Hospital in Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a 700-1,000 bed bombproof emergency facility was opened. The building, with 13 stories above ground and four stories underground, provides protection against conventional, chemical and biological attack. Construction began in 2008. The cost of the building was $110 million, with a donation of $45 million from Israeli billionaire [[Sammy Ofer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/tel-aviv-hospital-unveils-largest-bombproof-medical-facility-in-israel-1.348229 Tel Aviv hospital unveils largest bombproof medical facility in Israel ]&lt;/ref&gt; The architect was [[Arad Sharon]], grandson of [[Arieh Sharon]] who designed the original facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/head-to-head-ichilov-head-gabriel-barbash-why-is-it-that-only-hospitals-in-central-israel-get-donations-1.348252 Interview with Ichilov head Gabriel Barbash, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rambam Hospital====
[[Rambam Health Care Campus]] the largest medical center in [[northern Israel]] and fifth largest in [[Israel]], began in October 2010 work on a protected emergency underground hospital designed to withstand conventional, chemical, and biological attacks. The project included a three-floor parking lot that could be transformed at short notice into a 2,000-bed hospital. The hospital can generate its own power and store enough oxygen, drinking water and medical supplies for up to three days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rambam.org.il/NR/exeres/3ECBA18C-AAA0-4ABD-8FBC-22881D68CC50,frameless.htm?NRMODE=Published&lt;/ref&gt;

At the dedication, RHCC Director General Prof. [[Rafael Beyar]] said "The ER was filled with badly wounded. I looked at the physicians and nurses ignoring the [exploding] missiles. The need for a modern, protected building was obvious, and we at Rambam took it upon ourselves as a national mission."

====Beilinson Hospital====

The 90 million shekel fortified emergency room at [[Beilinson Hospital]] in [[Petach Tikvah]] has gone operational, becoming Israel’s largest ER. The 5,000 square meter (58,000 square feet) facility is capable of treating 200,000 patients annually.

The new facility is underground and bomb proof and offers the best medicine has to offer. Each patient has his or her own room, unlike standard ERs in which patients are separated by a curtain which adds a measure of patient privacy.

There is also a trauma center capable of addressing numerous patients simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/253474/beilinson-hospital-opens-israels-largest-er-which-is-fortified.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Included in the facility is dedicated imaging facilities, including [[X-ray]], [[CT scan]], and [[Ultrasound]].

====Shaare Zedek Medical Center====

[[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]] has a three-story underground facility that can be activated in times of war.

====Hadassah Medical Center====
[[Hadassah Medical Center]] Ein Kerem campus has a five-floor underground facility.

=== Sweden ===
==== Södersjukhuset ====
[[File:Tunnel Södersjukhuset 1940-tal.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The rail entrance to the complex at Södersjukhuset, 1940s.]]
The hospital [[Södersjukhuset]] in [[Stockholm]] has an underground complex measuring 4,700 square meters (50,600 square feet) called DEMC (Disaster Emergency Center), which was completed and inaugurated on 25 November 1994. In peacetime the complex is used for training and scientific research. In case of disaster or war the complex is fully operational as a normal hospital, it has 270 beds in peacetime and 160 in wartime. &lt;ref&gt;Glömd historia: [http://glomdhistoria.se/project/det-underjordiska-sjukhuset/ Det underjordiska sjukhuset] Article about the Disaster Emergency Center at Södersjukhuset Retrieved 2016-08-29 {{swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
Doctors and international N.G.O.s have created an elaborate network of underground hospitals throughout Syria. Installing cameras in intensive-care units, so that doctors abroad can monitor patients by Skype and direct technicians to administer proper treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/syrias-war-on-doctors |title=The Shadow Doctors |publisher=The New Yorker |date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aleppo====
In 2016, because of the number of hospitals that have been damaged or destroyed in the city, hospitals have moved underground. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/inside-the-underground-hospital-built-to-treat-aleppos-children/vp-BBvGpGu |title=Inside the underground hospital built to treat Aleppo's children |publisher=msn |date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban Metcalf''' (1775- c1820s) was a clothes salesman and asylum patient who was arrested for allegedly attempting to assassinate [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. Metcalf went in and out of various asylums for his entire adult life before eventually being permanently committed to [[Bootham Park Hospital|York asylum]] in 1822.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://fixatedthreat.com/pdfs/Attacks%20on%20the%20British%20Royal%20Family.pdf|format=PDF|title=Attacks on the British Royal Family: The Role of Psychotic Illness|first1=David V. |last1=James |first2=Paul E. |last2=Mullen |first3=Michele T. |last3=Pathé |first4=J.

Dr. '''Wacław Olszak''' (29 May 1868 – 11 September 1939) was a [[Polish minority in Zaolzie|Polish]] physician, activist and politician from the region of [[Zaolzie]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. He was a mayor of the town of [[Karviná]] for seven years. Ten days after outbreak of [[World War II]] he was murdered by [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].

Olszak was born in [[Šenov]] as a tenth child of a peasant. After elementary school he attended the German [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (high school) in [[Cieszyn]], from which he graduated in 1889. He went to Vienna to study medicine at the [[University of Vienna]]. He graduated in 1895. After returning to his region, Olszak started to work as a doctor in Karviná, becoming the first Polish doctor for [[coal miner]]s in that town. He also worked as a doctor at the château in [[Fryštát]] for count Larisch-Mönnich, and as a family doctor for many local German engineers and administration workers. Olszak however, working mostly with poor coal miners and their families, helped to organize a social help for them.

Olszak was a member and co-founder of various Polish organizations in Zaolzie. He was a member of the general committee of ''Związek Polaków w Czechosłowacji'' (Association of Poles in Czechoslovakia) and ''Związek Śląskich Katolików w Czechosłowacji'' (Association of Silesian Catholics in Czechoslovakia). After [[World War I]], as a member of the Association of Silesian Catholics, he took active part in the work of the National Council of the Duchy of Cieszyn, provisional Polish political body working for joining [[Cieszyn Silesia]] to independent Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak 2008, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Olszak was regularly elected to the city council of Karviná and in 1929 became a mayor, beating in the elections Czech candidate Oskar Kučera. On 6 July 1930 he hosted in the town the Czechoslovak president [[Tomáš G. Masaryk]] and welcomed him in [[Polish language|Polish]]. President Masaryk later made a speech in both Polish and Czech languages.&lt;ref&gt;Słowik 1999, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July 1936 Olszak contested in next mayoral elections but lost to Czech candidate Antonín Krůta.&lt;ref name="PTM22"&gt;Słowik 1999, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; After the elections Olszak worked again as a general doctor for coal miners, he maintained this position after Poland annexed Zaolzie in October 1938.

On 1 September 1939 [[World War II]] started and [[Wehrmacht]] entered also Zaolzie region. Dr Olszak was arrested by Nazi authorities on 2 September. On 7 September he was called out to one of local coal mines to a reputed accident. Upon arrival he was seriously beaten by [[Gestapo]] and local German coal mining administration. He was transferred to the hospital, where he died on 11 September. [[Cerebral hemorrhage|Bleeding to the brain]] was given as a cause of death in the official documents.&lt;ref name="PTM22"/&gt; His funeral was highly restricted by Nazi German authorities who were aware of Olszak's popularity. Although crowds of locals followed the funeral procession, only four people were allowed to enter the cemetery - wife, two sons and priest. He is buried at a cemetery in the [[Doly (Karviná)|Doly]] (Kopalnie) district of Karviná.

Streets in [[Cieszyn]] and [[Karviná]] are named after him. His son Wacław became an internationally acclaimed engineer and construction theorist; his son Feliks became a metallurgical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Olszak | encyclopedia = Nowa Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN | volume = IV | page = 638 | publisher = [[Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN|PWN]] | location= Warszawa | year = 1997 | isbn = 83-01-11967-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
