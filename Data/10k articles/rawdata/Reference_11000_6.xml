'''3D Topicscape''', a software application, is a [[Personal Information Manager]] that provides a template loosely based on [[mind map|mind-mapping]]  or [[concept map]]ping.  It presents the [[mind map]] as a 3D scene&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topicscape.com/Topicscape-3D-mindmap-structure-explained.php 3D scene]&lt;/ref&gt; where each [[Node (computer science)|node]] is a cone (or pyramid, or variation on such a shape).  It can also display in a 2D format.  Nodes are arranged in a way that indicates how they are related in much the same way as a [[mind map]].  In addition to its use for [[information management]] it is claimed to be suitable as a [[task manager]], and for use in [[project management]].   

A Topicscape is created by importing folders (by [[Drag-and-drop]] or menus), importing from other mind mapping software including [[FreeMind]], PersonalBrain and [[MindManager]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topicscape.com/topicscape-and-mindmanager.php Importing from other software]&lt;/ref&gt; or by hand with mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts.  Import sources may be converted to a new Topicscape or added as a portion of an existing one.   

The number of levels that can be stored is not limited, but up to seven levels of the hierarchy may be viewed at once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topicscape.com/unlimitedlevels.php Seven levels visible]&lt;/ref&gt;  Any node may be chosen as the centre of the 3D scene and choosing one at the edge will cause more to come into view. 

Topicscape's most obvious difference from 2D mind mapping software is that it provides a [[Zooming User Interface|zooming interface]]&lt;ref&gt;On-line manual: [http://www.topicscape.com/topicscape-wiki/index.php?title=QuickZoom Quickzoom description]&lt;/ref&gt; and simulates flying as noted by [[Wall Street Journal]] columnist Jeremy Wagstaff in his column "Fly through your computer."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Wagstaff ([[Wall Street Journal]], June 23, 2006)  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115099462942087665 "Fly through your computer"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[BBC World Service]]&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC World Service]], Business Daily, June 2006 - audio only&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] &lt;ref&gt;Laura Blackwell [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] (print edition), April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; have also reviewed 3D Topicscape.

==File Format==

Uses an embedded [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird]] relational database to store user-provided and operational metadata.  Files attached to nodes ('''topics''') may be linked to in their original location or be held in a folder (directory) associated with a given Topicscape.  Links to files in a Topicscape's folder are relative.  Topicscape folders may therefore be moved without breaking such links.   

'''Import''' file formats supported include [[FreeMind]], [[OML]], [[MindManager]] versions 5-8, PersonalBrain, and text (outline-numbered);  

'''Export''' file formats can be those for [[FreeMind]], [[OPML]], [[HTML]] and text structured for re-import, or text for reading.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="750">In [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' (late fourth or early fifth century CE), '''Alpos''' is a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Gigantes|giant]] who terrorized [[Punta del Faro]] and he was killed by [[Dionysus]] with his [[thyrsus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'', ''s.v.'' "Alpos": "Like every giant he was a son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Hecatonchires|Hundred-Handed Ones]] he had many arms, and his head was covered with [[Viperidae|viper]]s, like [[Medusa]]. Alpos, who does not appear elsewhere in [[Greek mythology]], and received no [[Cult (religion)|cult]], may be considered an invention of the fertile imagination of Nonnus.

The '''Antenor Kore''' is a Late Archaic statue of a girl ([[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]]) made of [[Parian marble]], which was created around 530/20 BC.

The statue was found in several fragments during excavations on the [[Athenian Acropolis]] in the so-called [[Perserschutt]]. The lower part and the left arm were dug up east of the [[Parthenon]] in 1882 and the upper part was discovered west of the [[Erechtheion]] in 1886. Parts of the calf followed. The face is damaged, especially the nose, and the lower right arm is missing, as is the front of the feet on the plinth. The kore was originally located in the Athena sanctuary on the acropolis and is now kept in the [[Acropolis Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;Inventory number 681.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is 201&amp;nbsp;cm high, excluding the plinth.

The Kore has chest-length hair, which only partially survives. The hair at the front is gathered into tight curls, while the rest of the hair falls in locks, fanning out over the shoulders and back. She wears a crown in her hair. Like all archaic korai, the sculpture has a clear axis and stares directly at the viewer. She wears a [[chiton]] and [[himation]]. The latter seems to be tied over the left arm, pinned at the top with a [[fibula]] and falling below in omega-folds. With the left hand the image gathers the chiton, causing the characteristic drapery. The conspicuously empty eye-holes must have been inlaid with another material, likely glass - a rather rare feature in marble statues of this period.

Fragments of a [[Pentelic marble]] statue base in the form of a capital were found in the Perserschutt in the same excavation as the statue fragments. This base was first connected with the statue by [[Franz Studniczka]],&lt;ref&gt;Franz Studniczka, "Antenor der Sohn des Eumares und die Geschichte der archaischen Malerei." ''Jahrbuch des Kaiserlich Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts.'' Vol. 2, 1887: 135‚Äì168, here p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; a conclusion which has been largely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Kansteiner, Lauri Lehmann, Bernd Seidensticker, Klaus Stemmer (Ed.). ''Text und Skulptur. Ber√ºhmte Bildhauer und Bronzegiesser der Antike in Wort und Bild.'' De Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2009, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; though some still doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Arthur Gardner ''[[The Journal of Hellenic Studies|Journal of Hellenic Studies]].'' Vol. 10, 1889, p. 278; Guy Dickins: ''Catalogue of the Acropolis Museum.'' Vol. 1: ''Archaic sculpture.'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1912, pp. 228‚Äì232; Humfry Payne, Gerard Mackworth Young: ''Archaic marble sculpture from the Acropolis.'' Cresset Press, London 1950, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription on the base name the donor Nearchos and the sculptor [[Antenor]] son of Eumares. It reads:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' (IG) [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=708&amp;bookid=4&amp;region=1&amp;subregion=71 I¬≥ 628].&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving {{lang-grc|Œ•Œ£}} at the beginning of the second line is generally restored as {{lang-grc|Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±ŒºŒµœçœÇ}} and the donor identified with the attested potter [[Nearchos (painter)|Nearchos]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Bettina Kreuzer]], "Nearchos (I)." ''[[K√ºnstlerlexikon der Antike]].'' Vol. 2, Saur, M√ºnchen, Leipzig 2004, p. 113‚Äì114 (here also viewed as the donor of the statue).&lt;/ref&gt; from the second quarter of the sixth century BC or with an unknown potter of the same name,&lt;ref&gt;Thus Jeffrey M. Hurwit. ''The Art and Culture of Early Greece, 1100-480 B.C.'' Cornell University Press, Ithaca 1985, p. 250 considers the restoration of {{lang-grc|Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±ŒºŒµœçœÇ}} to be correct and the identification of the donor with the known potter possible but unlikely.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps a son or uncle of the known Nearchos.&lt;ref&gt;Thus [[John Beazley]], ''Potter and Painter in Ancient Athens.'' (= ''Proceedings of the British Academy.'' Vol. 30.) Cumberledge, Oxford 1944, p. 21; Thomas B. L. Webster: ''Potter and Patron in Classical Athens.'' Methuen, London 1972. p. 10; Catherine M. Keesling: ''The Votive Statues of the Athenian Acropolis.'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2003, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; It has sometimes been doubted that a simple artesan could be the donor of such a votive statue and alternative restorations of the inscription have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Johnston, "Amasis and the Vase Trade." ''Papers on the Amasis Painter and His World.'' The J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu 1987, 135: {{lang-grc|œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ¥Œµ·øñŒΩŒ± ·Ωë]œçœÇ}} ("son of xyz); as a [[deme|demotic]] by [[Michael Vickers]], "Artful Crafts. The Influence of Metal Work on Athenian Painted Pottery." ''Journal of Hellenic Studies.'' Vol. 105, 1985, p.125 n.162: {{lang-grc|·ºòŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅŒµ]œçœÇ}} ("from [[Eleutherae]]") and David Gill, Michael Vickers, "Pottery and Precious Metal in Classical Greece." ''[[Jahrbuch des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts]].'' Vol. 105, 1990, p. 7‚Äì8: {{lang-grc|ŒöŒµœÅŒ±ŒºŒµœçœÇ}} or {{lang-grc|ŒúŒµŒªŒπœÑŒµœçœÇ}} (" from Kerameis" or "from [[Melite (deme)|Melite]]"); but the inclusion of demotics on dedication inscriptions is extremely uncommon before the late 5th century BC, as noted by Catherine M. Keesling, "Name Forms on Athenian Dedications of the Fifth and Fourth Centuries B.C." in √Ångel Mart√≠nez Fern√°ndez (Ed.): ''Estudios de Epigraf√≠a Griega. Serie investigaci√≥n 1.'' Servicio de Publicaciones, Universidad de la Laguna, La Laguna 2009, pp. 349‚Äì356.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand it was quite possible in the 6th century to gain a significant fortune through craftworks and other donations are known from potters and [[Greek vase painting|vase painters]] on the Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Ingeborg Scheibler, "Griechische K√ºnstlervotive der archaischen Zeit." In ''M√ºnchner Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst.'' Vol. 30, 1979, pp. 7‚Äì29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bronislau''' "'''Bronko'''" '''Nagurski''' (November 3, 1908 ‚Äì January 7, 1990) was a Canadian-born [[American football]] player in the [[National Football League]] (NFL), renowned for his strength and size. Nagurski was also a successful [[professional wrestler]],&lt;ref name=tankwolf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZWoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5032%2C953430 |work=Milwaukee Journal |last=Wolf |first=Bob |title=A tank! Bronko Nagurski hit like one, ran like one |date=February 2, 1984 |page=3, part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized as a multiple-time World Heavyweight Champion.

Nagurski became a standout playing both tackle on defense and fullback on offense at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]] from [[1927 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1927]] to [[1929 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1929]], selected a consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] in [[1929 College Football All-America Team|1929]] and inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in its inaugural year of 1951. His professional career with the [[Chicago Bears]] also made him an inaugural inductee into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1963.

==Youth and collegiate career==
Nagurski was born in [[Rainy River, Ontario]], Canada, of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Poles|Polish]] descent, and his family moved to [[International Falls, Minnesota]], when he was age five. His parents, "Mike" and Michelina Nagurski, were immigrants, from Western Ukraine (region called kresy where many ethnicities lived together  (Halychyna/[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]). Young Bronislau grew up working on his parents' farm and sawmill, delivering groceries for his father's grocery store and in his teens laboring at nearby timbering operations, growing into a powerfully muscular six-footer.

Nagurski was discovered and signed by University of Minnesota head coach [[Clarence Spears]], who drove to International Falls to meet another player. On the outside of town, he watched Nagurski out plowing a field without assistance. According to legend, Spears asked directions and Bronko lifted his plow and used it to point.&lt;ref name=tankwolf/&gt; He was signed on the spot to play for the Golden Gophers. Spears admitted he concocted the story on his long drive back to the university in Minneapolis.

Legends aside, on his first day of practice Spears decided to test Nagurski in the "Nutcracker" drill, where a defensive player had to take on two blockers and try to tackle a following ball carrier. On the first drill two All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] linemen and [[Herb Joesting]] charged at Bronko, who promptly split the blockers and drove the big fullback into a blocking dummy. Spears sent in three more players, blew his whistle and watched Bronko produce the same explosive results and after a third try with the same conclusion realized what a super player he had recruited.

Nagurski became a standout playing both tackle on defense and fullback on offense at Minnesota from [[1927 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1927]] to [[1929 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1929]]. In 1929, after posting 737 rushing yards, he was a consensus [[1929 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] at fullback, and despite playing fewer games at the position also made some All-American teams at tackle. The pre-eminent sportswriter of the day, [[Grantland Rice]], listed him at the two positions in picking his 1929 All-America team. Rice later wrote, "Who would you pick to win a football game - 11 [[Jim Thorpe]]s - 11 [[Glenn Davis (halfback)|Glen Davises]] - 11 [[Red Grange]]s - or 11 Bronko Nagurskis?  The 11 Nagurskis would be a mop-up. It would be something close to murder and massacre. For the Bronk could star at any position on the field, with {{convert|216|lb}} of authority to back him up."

His greatest collegiate game was against [[1928 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] in the season finale in [[1928 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1928]]. Wearing a corset to protect cracked vertebrae, he recovered a Badger fumble deep in their territory, then ran the ball six straight times to score the go-ahead touchdown. Later in the same game, he intercepted a pass to seal the victory.&lt;ref name=gcbho&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4mJQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FA8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7234%2C4739638 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Downer |first=George F. |title=Gophers crush Badger hopes, 6 to 0 |date=November 25, 1928 |page=1, part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his three varsity seasons at Minnesota, the Gophers went {{winning percentage|18|4|2|record=y}} and won the [[Big Ten Conference]] championship in 1927. Nagurski was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1951.

==Professional career==
===Football===
Nagurski turned professional to play for the [[Chicago Bears]] from [[1930 Chicago Bears season|1930]] to [[1937 Chicago Bears season|1937]]. At {{height|ft=6|in=2}} and {{convert|235|lb}}, he was a formidable presence, and in his day he was a dominant force, helping the Bears win several division titles and two NFL championships.

Nagurski has the largest recorded NFL Championship ring size at 19¬Ω and wore a size-8 helmet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/features/1997/photogallery/phatbacks/drz.html  Dr. Z's Top 10 Big Backs - Bronkosaurus - ''Bronko Nagurski was, literally, a monster of the Midway'']. Sports Illustrated. Paul Zimmerman (Dr. Z). November 24, 1997  ''[Q]uarterback Sid Luckman, about Nagurski. "A monster," Luckman said. "The neck, the hands. They measured him for a championship ring in 1943, when he made his comeback, and his ring size was 19&amp;nbsp;1/2."''&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably the largest running back of his time, bigger than most linemen of the day,{{refn|group="n"|A forerunner to large fullbacks like [[Marion Motley]], [[John Henry Johnson]] and [[Jim Brown]]}} often dragging multiple tacklers with him. In a time when players were expected to play on [[one-platoon system|both sides of the ball]], he was a standout defensive lineman as well playing a ranging tackle or "The Monster." After an injury, instead of sitting on the bench, he would sometimes be put in as an [[offensive tackle]]. In a 1984 interview with ''Sports Illustrated'' writer [[Paul Lionel Zimmerman|Paul "Dr. Z" Zimmerman]], when asked what position he would play if he were coming up in the present day, he said, "I would probably be a [[linebacker]] today. I wouldn't be carrying the ball 30 or 35 times a game."

A time-honored and perhaps [[apocryphal]] story about Nagurski is a scoring gallop that he made against the [[Washington Redskins]], knocking two linebackers in opposite directions, stomping a [[defensive back]] and crushing a [[Safety (American football position)|safety]], then bouncing off the [[goalposts]] and cracking [[Wrigley Field]]'s brick wall. On returning to the [[huddle]] for the [[extra point]] try, he reportedly said: "That last guy hit me awfully hard."&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD7103BF93AA35752C0A966958260 Bronko Nagurski Is Dead at 81; Star Runner for Chicago Bears] Paul Rodgers, The New York Times, January 11, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in a game against the Packers, the Bears prepared to punt, and Green Bay's [[Cal Hubbard]] went to [[Red Grange]] and said: "I promise not to try to block the kick, Red, but get out of the way so I can get a shot at that [[Polack]]." Grange, glad not to try to block Hubbard for once, obliged. Cal tore through the line, slammed into Nagurski and bounced off. Rising slowly, he turned to Grange and said: "Hey, Red, don't do me any more favors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5339533/cal_hubbard_obituary/|page=16|title=Cal Hubbard: 'Big Umpire' Was A Man For All Sports|author=Bob Broeg|date=October 23, 1977|accessdate=May 21, 2016|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[1932 NFL season|1932 season]], the [[Chicago Bears]] and the [[Detroit Lions|Portsmouth Spartans]] were tied with the best regular-season records. To determine the champion, the league voted to hold its first [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|playoff game]]. Because of cold weather, the game was held indoors at [[Chicago Stadium]], which forced some temporary rule changes. Chicago won, 9‚Äì0. In the fourth quarter of the 1932 game, the Bears scored on a controversial [[touchdown]]: [[Carl Brumbaugh]] handed the ball off to fullback Nagurski, who pulled up and threw to [[Red Grange]] in the end zone for the score.&lt;ref name=chpc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LrZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y2kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3265%2C2405018 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |title=Chicago Bears pro champions |agency=''(Chicago Tribune)'' |date=December 19, 1932 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans argued that Nagurski did not drop back five yards before passing to Grange, but the touchdown stood. The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the [[1933 NFL season|1933 season]], with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, every play started from between the [[hash marks]], and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the [[line of scrimmage]] (instead of the previous five yards behind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History 1931‚Äì1940 |work=NFL.com |publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC |year=2007 |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timelline.aspx?csid1=46 |accessdate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183348/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/timelline.aspx?csid1=46 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hick32&gt;{{cite web|last=Hickok |first=Ralph |title=The 1932 NFL Championship Game |publisher=HickokSports.com |year=2004 |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/histbit1.shtml |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603010641/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/histbit1.shtml |archivedate=June 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett (1976), pp 32‚Äì33&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], professional football teams were short of players and in 1943 Bronko Nagurski returned to the Bears for one season. He scored a touchdown in the Bears' championship victory against the Washington Redskins, served one season as backfield coach for [[UCLA]] in 1944 and finally returned to wrestling until his retirement in 1960.

===Wrestling===
During his football career, he built a second athletic career as a professional wrestler and became a major box-office attraction. Tony Stecher, brother of former world champion [[Joe Stecher]], introduced Nagurski to wrestling in 1933 and became his manager. Nagurski defeated Tag Tagerson in his ring debut. Hitting his peak in the late 1930s, Nagurski won a limited version of the world championship by defeating [[Dean Detton]] on June 29, 1937. But he finally achieved full recognition with his first [[National Wrestling Association]] world title by defeating [[Lou Thesz]] on June 23, 1939. Losing the title to [[Peter Sauer|Ray Steele]] on March 7, 1940, he regained it from Steele one year later on March 11, 1941, but lost it three months later to [[Sandor Szabo (wrestler)|Sandor Szabo]] on June 5, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;OnLine World of Wrestling &lt;http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bronko-nagurski.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nagurski married his childhood sweetheart Eileen Kane on December 28, 1936. The couple had a child Christmas Day 1937, whom they named after his father. Nagurski's son, [[Bronko Nagurski Jr.]], played football at the [[University of Notre Dame]] and become an all-star with the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the [[Canadian Football League]].

==Later life and legacy==
===Later life===
After his retirement from wrestling, he returned home to International Falls and opened a [[filling station|service station]].&lt;ref name=tankwolf/&gt; A local legend claims that Nagurski had the best repeat business in town because he would screw customers' gas caps down so tight after filling their tanks that no one else in town could unscrew them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.windycitygridiron.com/2010/1/29/1272417/taking-a-look-in-the-bears-history |title=Taking a Look in the Bears History Book: Bronko Nagurski |date=January 29, 2010 |first=Ashley |last=Czuba |work=Windy City Gridiron}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from that in 1978, at the age of seventy, and lived out a quiet life on the shores of [[Rainy Lake]] on the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border. In January 1984, Nagurski performed the coin toss at [[Super Bowl XVIII]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], with [[1983 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] quarterback and co-captain [[Joe Theismann]] calling the toss on behalf of his team's co-captains and the captains of the opposing [[1983 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]].

In 1990, he died in International Falls and is buried at its Saint Thomas Cemetery.

===Legacy===

Nagurski was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] as a charter member on September 7, 1963. At the [[University of Minnesota-Twin Cities]] house of his fraternity, [[Sigma Chi]], Nagurski's jersey and Significant Sig recognition certificate are on display. After his death, the town of International Falls honored him by opening the Bronko Nagurski Museum in Smokey Bear Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rainylake.org/thingstodo.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131090915/http://rainylake.org/thingstodo.html |archivedate=2009-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named Nagurski one of the four greatest athletes in Minnesota state history; the other three were [[Dave Winfield]], [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], and [[Joe Mauer]]. In 1993, the [[Football Writers Association of America]] created the [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]], awarded annually to the best defensive player in college football. Notable winners include [[Warren Sapp]], [[Charles Woodson]], [[Terrell Suggs]], [[Champ Bailey]] and [[Derrick Johnson]]. In 1999 Nagurski was selected by ''Sports Illustrated'' as a starting defensive tackle for their "NCAA Football All-Century Team". The other starting defensive tackle on that list was [[Rich Glover]]. In 2007, Nagurski was ranked No. 17 on ESPN's Top 25 Players In College Football History list.

In 1999, he was ranked No. 35 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the highest-ranking foreign-born player. In 2000, he was voted the second-greatest Minnesotan sportsman of the 20th century by the sportswriters of the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', coming in behind only [[Minnesota Twins]] [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Kirby Puckett]].

A fictionalized eyewitness account of Nagurski's 1943 comeback is the subject of a dramatic monologue in the 2001 film version of ''[[Hearts in Atlantis (film)|Hearts in Atlantis]].'' The film's screenwriter, [[William Goldman]], repeated much of this rendition from his earlier account of the same story in his novel ''Magic.''

In 2009, Nagurski was an honorary team captain, represented by his son, [[Bronko Nagurski Jr.]], at the opening game of [[TCF Bank Stadium]]. His home town International Falls high school nickname is the Broncos in his honor.

A legendary tale of Nagurski's physical toughness says that he charged through a group of defenders and ended up hitting the wall at Wrigley Field. On returning to the bench, he told Coach Halas, "That last guy gave me quite a lick!"&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-11-20/sports/ct-spt-1121-around-town--20101120_1_wall-wrigley-field-harlon-hill&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''C.A. Thayer''''' is a [[schooner]] built in 1895 near [[Eureka, California]]. The schooner is now preserved at the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park|Maritime National Historical Park]]. She is one of the last survivors of the sailing schooners in the [[West coast lumber trade]] to San Francisco from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[Northern California]].  She was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 13 November 1966.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

This ship is used for many class field trips.

==History==
===As a lumber schooner===
''C.A. Thayer'' was built by [[Denmark|Danish-born]] [[Hans Ditlev Bendixsen]] in his shipyard, located across the narrows of [[Humboldt Bay (United States)|Humboldt Bay]] from the city of Eureka in Northern California. Bendixsen also built the ''[[Wawona (schooner)|Wawona]]'' (1897) which was dismantled in 2009. The ''C.A. Thayer'' was named for Clarence A. Thayer, a partner in the San Francisco-based E.K. Wood Lumber Company.

Between 1895 and 1912, ''C.A. Thayer'' usually sailed from E.K. Wood's [[Sawmill|mill]] in [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor]], Washington, to San Francisco. But she also carried lumber as far south as [[Mexico]], and occasionally even ventured offshore to [[Hawaii]] and [[Fiji]].

''C.A. Thayer'' is typical of the sort of three-masted schooners often used in the west coast lumber trade. She is {{convert|219|ft}} in length and has a cargo capacity of {{convert|575000|bdft|cuft m3}}. She carried about half of her load below deck, with the remaining lumber stacked {{convert|10|ft}} high on deck. In port, her small crew of eight or nine men were also responsible for loading and unloading the ship. Unloading {{convert|75000|to|80000|bdft|cuft m3}} was an average day's work.

With the increase in the use of [[Steam engine|steam power]] for the lumber trade, and after sustaining serious damage during a [[gale]], ''C.A. Thayer'' was retired from the lumber trade in 1912, and converted for use in the [[Alaska]]n [[salmon]] fishery.

===In the Alaskan salmon fishery===
Early each April from 1912 to 1924, ''C.A. Thayer'' sailed from San Francisco for Western Alaska. On board she carried {{convert|28|ft|adj=on}} [[gillnet]] boats, bundles of barrel staves, tons of salt, and a crew of fishermen and cannery workers. She then spent the summer anchored at a fishery camp such as [[Squaw Creek, Alaska|Squaw Creek]] or [[Koggiung]]. While there, the fishermen worked their nets and the cannery workers packed the catch on shore. ''C.A. Thayer'' returned to San Francisco each September, carrying barrels of salted [[salmon]].

Vessels in the salt-salmon trade usually laid up during the winter months, but when [[World War I]] inflated freight rates, ''C.A. Thayer'' carried Northwest fir and [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino]] redwood to [[Australia]]. These off-season voyages took about two months each way. Her return cargo was usually [[coal]], but sometimes [[hardwood]] or [[copra]].

===As a cod fisherman===
Between 1925 and 1930, ''C.A. Thayer'' made yearly voyages from [[Poulsbo, Washington|Poulsbo]], Washington, to Alaska's [[Bering Sea]] [[cod]]-fishing waters. In addition to supplies, she carried upwards of thirty men north, including fourteen fishermen and twelve "dressers" (the men who cleaned and cured the catch). At about 4:30am each day, the fishermen launched their Grand Banks [[dory|dories]] over the rails, and then fished standing up, with [[handline]]s dropped over both sides of their small boats. When the fishing was good, a man might catch 300-350 cod in a five-hour period.

After a decade-long, [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era lay-up in [[Lake Union]], the [[U.S. Army]] purchased ''C.A. Thayer'' from J.E. Shields for use in the [[war effort]]. In 1942, the Army removed her masts and used ''Thayer'' as an ammunition barge in [[British Columbia]]. After [[World War II]], Shields bought his ship back from the Army, fitted her with masts once again, and returned her to codfishing. Her final voyage was in 1950.

===Restoration===
[[File:C A Thayer.JPG||frame|right|''C.A. Thayer''|alt=A sailing ship at a pier, starboard bow quarter view]]
The State of California purchased ''C.A. Thayer'' in 1957. After preliminary restoration in [[Seattle]], Washington, a volunteer crew sailed her down the coast to San Francisco. The San Francisco Maritime Museum performed more extensive repairs and refitting, and opened ''C.A. Thayer'' to the public in 1963. The vessel was transferred to the [[National Park Service]] in 1978, and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1984.

After 40 years as a [[museum ship]], ''C.A. Thayer'' has again been restored, a restoration which took  three years from 2004, and which resulted in her temporary removal from her berth at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. Approximately 80% of the ship's timbers were replaced with new timbers matching the original wood. The ship sailed back to the [[Hyde Street Pier]] on 12 April 2007.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In Nov. 2016 she was moved to Alameda to be painted, get new booms and gaffs, and have three masts and a bowsprit installed by the Bay Ship and Yacht Company. She returned to the Hyde Street Pier in Feb. 2017.&lt;ref name="nbc2-2017"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joe Rosato Jr.|title=Historic San Francisco Schooner Returns to Glory|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Historic-San-Francisco-Schooner-Returns-to-Glory-370191681.html|publisher=NBC - Bay Area|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 she will be rigged with a new set of sails.&lt;ref name="spillman"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rick Spilman|title=New Masts for the 1895 Lumber Schooner C.A.Thayer|url=http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2016/02/new-masts-1895-lumber-schooner-c-thayer/|website=The Old Salt Blog|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Piotr Dusburg chronicle.png|thumb|283px|Cover of a copy of ''Chronicon terrae Prussiae'' from 1679]]

'''''Chronicon terrae Prussiae''''' ([[Latin]] for "The Chronicle of the Prussian Land") is a [[chronicle]] of the [[Teutonic Knights]], by [[Peter of Dusburg]], finished in 1326. The manuscript is the first major chronicle of the [[Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], completed some 100 years after the [[Prussian Crusade|conquest of the crusaders]] into the [[Baltic region]]. It is a major source for information on the Order's battles with [[Old Prussians]] and [[Lithuanians]].

The chronicle is written in [[Latin]] and consists of four volumes. The first volume gives the background of the Order and its crusades in [[Outremer]]. The second volume narrates how the Order arrived to the Prussian land, while the third volume details wars with Old Prussians and other [[Baltic tribes]].&lt;ref name=zi&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Ivinskis | first=Zenonas | editor=Vaclovas Bir≈æi≈°ka | encyclopedia=Lietuvi≈°koji enciklopedija | title=Dusburg, Petras | year=1939 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=VII | location=Kaunas | pages=251‚Äì254|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth volume provides a historical context of other contemporary events in the world. The chronicle has an addendum of another 20 chapters dealing with events of 1326-1330. It might also have been written by Peter of Dusburg.&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; The chronicle is based on local monastery annals, chronicles, reports and narrations which Peter "considered reliable". Peter had access to the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Grand Masters']] archive in [[Malbork Castle|Marienburg]]&lt;ref name=rowell&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowell | first=S. C. | title=Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-Central Europe, 1295-1345 | pages=38‚Äì40 | year=2004 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-45011-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and witnessed some events himself.

The chronicle contains some ethnographic data about the Old Prussians, the indigenous people conquered by the Order. It provides numerous chapters in the styles of religious visions, miracles, and [[hagiography]], aimed at the glorification of the mission of the Order. The war against pagans is sacred and all knights who perish go to heaven. Peter takes no interest in domestic policy of the Order; he does not describe cities, trade, or colonization.&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; Rather the chronicle describes minor raids and clashes with great detail. While narratives of events and battles are considered to be reliable, ethnographic data is ideologically charged. As a priest Peter tried to teach the reader. Pagan Prussians and Lithuanians are presented as a moral example. They are pious in their own way, and Christians should be ashamed of their disobedient and sinful ways.&lt;ref name=rowell/&gt;

'''''Deadpool''''' is a 2016 American &lt;!-- Please do not add "comedy" or any other genres here. We use the most general category for the lead.--&gt;[[superhero film]]&lt;!-- Please do not add "comedy" or any other genres here. We use the most general category for the lead. --&gt; based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Deadpool|of the same name]], distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the eighth installment of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the first standalone ''Deadpool'' film. Directed by [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] from a screenplay by [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]], the film stars [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Wade Wilson / Deadpool alongside [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Ed Skrein]], [[T. J. Miller]], [[Gina Carano]] and [[Brianna Hildebrand]]. In the film, Wilson‚Äîas the [[antihero]] Deadpool‚Äîhunts down the man who gave him [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities and caused his scarred physical appearance.

Development of a Deadpool film starring Reynolds began in February 2004, before he went on to play the character in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' in 2009. Reese and Wernick were hired for a spinoff in 2010. They worked with Reynolds to adapt the character more faithfully  (including his [[fourth wall]] breaking) after the portrayal in ''Wolverine'' was criticized for not doing so. Miller was hired in 2011 marking his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. An enthusiastic response to leaked test footage he created with Reynolds led to a green-light from Fox in 2014. Additional casting began in early 2015, and filming took place in [[Vancouver]], Canada, from March to May of that year. Several vendors provided visual effects for the film, ranging from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] character [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].

''Deadpool'' was released in the United States on February 12, 2016, after an [[Marketing for Deadpool (film)|unconventional marketing campaign]]. The film achieved both financial and critical success. It earned over $783&amp;nbsp;million against a $58&amp;nbsp;million budget, breaking numerous records: it became the highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film, the highest-grossing ''X-Men'' film, and the [[2016 in film|ninth-highest-grossing 2016 film]]. Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style and faithfulness to the comics, and its action sequences. Some detractors criticized the plot as formulaic as well as the sheer number of jokes in the film. It also [[List of accolades received by Deadpool (film)|received many awards and nominations]], including two [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Awards]] and two [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations. A sequel, ''[[Deadpool 2]]'', was released in May 2018.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
[[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]] is a dishonorably discharged [[special forces]] operative working as a mercenary when he meets [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]], a prostitute. They become romantically involved, and a year later she accepts his marriage proposal. Wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and leaves Vanessa without warning so she will not have to watch him die.

A mysterious recruiter approaches Wilson, offering an experimental cure for his cancer. He is taken to [[Ajax (Francis Fanny)|Ajax]] and [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]], who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant genes]]. They subject Wilson to days of torture to induce stress and trigger any mutation he may have, without success. When Wilson discovers Ajax's real name is Francis and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wilson in a [[hyperbaric chamber]] that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over a weekend. This finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures the cancer but leaves Wilson severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the now-burning laboratory.

Wilson survives and seeks out Vanessa. He does not reveal to her he is alive fearing her reaction to his new appearance. After consulting with his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]], Wilson decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a masked vigilante, adopting the name "Deadpool" (from Weasel picking him in a [[dead pool]]), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named [[Blind Al|Al]]. He questions and murders many of Ajax's men until one, the recruiter, reveals his whereabouts. Deadpool intercepts Ajax and a convoy of armed men on an expressway. He kills everyone but Ajax, and demands the cure from him but the X-Man [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and his trainee [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] interrupt him. Colossus wants Deadpool to mend his ways and join the [[X-Men]]. Taking advantage of this distraction, Ajax escapes. He goes to Weasel's bar where he learns of Vanessa.

Ajax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned [[helicarrier]] in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him. They battle Angel Dust and several soldiers while Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the collapsing ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again but is overpowered. He reveals there is no cure and, despite Colossus's pleading, Deadpool kills him. He promises to try to be more heroic moving forward. Though Vanessa is angry with Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him.

* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson / Deadpool]]: &lt;br /&gt;A wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but [[disfigurement|severe scarring]] over his body after undergoing an experimental mutation.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsConfirmed" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bios" /&gt; The writers described Deadpool as "fun to hang out with ... in short doses".&lt;ref name="CSRealHeroes" /&gt; Reynolds promised a more "authentic" and comic-faithful version of the character than the one he portrayed in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name="ReynoldsEWJul2015" /&gt; The character becomes aware he is in a film after becoming Deadpool, though before this Wilson does make a joke about Reynolds's role in ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt;
* [[Morena Baccarin]] as [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]]: &lt;br /&gt;An escort and Wilson's fianc√©e.&lt;ref name="BaccarinCast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bios" /&gt; Baccarin described Vanessa as "scrappy" and not a [[damsel in distress]]. The character was initially designed as a "typical prostitute", but Baccarin worked with the costume and makeup teams to make her appearance more layered.&lt;ref name="BaccarinColliderNov2015" /&gt; The film does not explore the character's comic alter-ego "Copycat", as the writers wanted to focus on Deadpool.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016" /&gt; Makeup designer [[Bill Corso]], however, included some references to Copycat's blue appearance in the comics.&lt;ref name="CorsoColliderMar2016" /&gt;
* [[Ed Skrein]] as [[Ajax (comics)|Francis Freeman / Ajax]]: &lt;br /&gt;An artificially-mutated member of the program that creates Deadpool.&lt;ref name="SkreinComicCon2015" /&gt; He feels no pain and has enhanced strength.&lt;ref name="Bios" /&gt; Director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] praised Skrein's dedication to the role, saying "he worked really, really hard" for the fight sequences and completed around 80 percent of his own stunts in the film.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; Skrein was influenced by [[Rutger Hauer]]'s [[List of Blade Runner characters#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]] from ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), and serial killer [[Harold Shipman]].&lt;ref name="YahooNov2015" /&gt;
* [[T. J. Miller]] as [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]: &lt;br /&gt;Wilson's best friend.&lt;ref name="Weasel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MillerCaranoCast" /&gt; Miller felt he was cast as the character because he "looks like his superhero power is spilling mustard on his shirt". Producer [[Simon Kinberg]] added that an actor was needed "who could keep up with" Reynolds comedically. Miller attempted to give the character a facial tic, but director Tim Miller rejected the idea.&lt;ref name="TJMillerUSA" /&gt;
* [[Gina Carano]] as [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]]: &lt;br /&gt;An artificially-mutated member of the program that creates Deadpool.&lt;ref name="CaranoSRNov2015"/&gt; She has superhuman strength and speed.&lt;ref name="Bios" /&gt; Director Miller personally called Carano and asked her to take the part. Carano felt the character's rage and "extreme adrenaline issues" made comparisons to the drug "[[Phencyclidine|angel dust]]" fitting.&lt;ref name="CaranoSRNov2015" /&gt; She had wanted to wear yellow contact lenses to match the character's look in the comics, but Corso turned the idea down, comparing it to something from the ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films.&lt;ref name="CorsoColliderMar2016" /&gt;
* [[Brianna Hildebrand]] as [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]]: &lt;br /&gt;A teenage [[X-Men]] trainee, who possesses the mutant power to detonate atomic bursts from her body.&lt;ref name="Hildebrand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bios" /&gt; The filmmakers wanted to use the character based on her name and looked to change her comic abilities from telepathic and precognitive powers to "a literal warhead". They required permission from [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] to do this, which Tim Miller obtained after talking with [[Marvel Studios]] president [[Kevin Feige]].&lt;ref name="NegasonicDeal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; A deal was reached allowing the change in exchange for [[20th Century Fox]] giving Marvel Studios the film rights to the character [[Ego the Living Planet]] for use in their film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017).&lt;ref name="EgoRights" /&gt;

[[Stefan Kapiƒçiƒá]] provides the voice of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], an X-Man with the mutant ability to transform his entire body into organic steel.&lt;ref name="Kapicic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bios" /&gt; Writer [[Rhett Reese]] called him "a great foil to Deadpool because he's very self-serious and goody-two-shoes".&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016" /&gt; Director Miller changed the character drastically from his previous film appearances, where he was portrayed by [[Daniel Cudmore]]. Miller felt the Cudmore version, which he described as "[t]hat dude with the shiny skin", was "not fucking Colossus." He wanted the character to be seven-and-a-half feet tall.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; [[Andre Tricoteux]] stood in for a CG version of Colossus on set,&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; and Kapiƒçiƒá was cast to give the character an "authentic Russian accent" like he has in the comics.&lt;ref name="Kapicic" /&gt;

[[Leslie Uggams]] portrays [[Blind Al]], an elderly blind woman and Deadpool's roommate.&lt;ref name="Uggams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UggamsFC" /&gt; Uggams said that Al has "been through British Intelligence, she's done all kinds of wild and crazy things ... she's old, but she's feisty." Uggams added that Al has a "love/hate" relationship with Deadpool.&lt;ref name="UggamsFC" /&gt; [[Karan Soni]] appears as [[Dopinder]], a taxi driver who befriends Deadpool,&lt;ref name="Soni" /&gt; and [[Jed Rees]] portrays a recruiter for Ajax.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; X-Men co-creator [[Stan Lee]] and Deadpool co-creator [[Rob Liefeld]] make cameo appearances as a strip club [[Master of ceremonies|emcee]] and a patron of Weasel's bar, respectively.&lt;ref name="LeeCameo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SREasterEggs" /&gt; Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as [[Bob, Agent of Hydra]], a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool.&lt;ref name="SREasterEggs" /&gt; The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios. They did not give permission for him to be used in the film, so his comic history and connections to the [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] organization are not referenced in the film. He is explained instead as a former special forces operative like Wilson.&lt;ref name="Bob" /&gt; [[Hugh Jackman]], who portrayed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], was very supportive of ''Deadpool'' and it making fun of himself and his character. He is seen in the film on a [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] [[People (magazine)#Sexiest Man Alive|Sexiest Man Alive]] cover.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016" /&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
[[Artisan Entertainment]] announced a deal with [[Marvel Entertainment]] in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute several films based on [[Marvel Comics]]' characters, including [[Deadpool]].&lt;ref name="ArtisanDeal" /&gt; By February 2004, writer and director [[David S. Goyer]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] were working on a Deadpool film at [[New Line Cinema]]. They had worked together on the Marvel film ''[[Blade: Trinity]]''.&lt;ref name="GoyerConfirms" /&gt; Reynolds was interested in the part of Deadpool after learning that in the comics the character refers to his appearance as "Ryan Reynolds crossed with a [[Shar Pei|Shar-Pei]]".&lt;ref name="ReynoldsSRMar2009" /&gt; New Line executive [[Jeff Katz]], who thought Reynolds was the only actor suitable for the role, championed the idea. However, there were rights issues with [[20th Century Fox]] and their [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]], and the project did not move forward.&lt;ref name="DevelopmentBegins" /&gt;

By March 2005, Reynolds learned that Fox had expressed interest in a film featuring Deadpool.&lt;ref name="FoxInterest" /&gt; The character was set to make a cameo appearance in the 2009 film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', with Reynolds cast in the part. His role was expanded during the film's production.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsColliderMar2009" /&gt; Katz was an executive at Fox at that point, and said that ''Deadpool'' was "nicely set up to be explored in his own way" in a future film.&lt;ref name="DevelopmentBegins" /&gt; The film's portrayal deviates from the original comic character, "imbuing him with several superpowers and sewing his mouth shut". Deadpool apparently dies in the film, though a [[post-credits scene]] showing him still alive was added to the film shortly before its release. After the successful opening weekend of ''Wolverine'', Fox officially began development on ''Deadpool'', with Reynolds attached to star and ''X-Men'' producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] involved. The spinoff was set to ignore the ''Wolverine'' version of Deadpool and return to the character's roots with a slapstick tone and a "propensity to break the [[fourth wall]]".&lt;ref name="FoxSpinoff" /&gt;

[[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]] were hired to write the script in January 2010.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernick" /&gt; Reynolds, who worked closely with them, said they were chosen because, "Tonally, they got it. They just [understood ''Deadpool''] right off the bat."&lt;ref name="ReynoldsMTVJan2010" /&gt; By that June, [[Robert Rodriguez]] had been asked to direct the film.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez" /&gt; He confirmed this a month later, saying he had been sent a "really good" script and was considering taking on the project.&lt;ref name="RodriguezScript" /&gt; By October he was no longer interested in it, and [[Adam Berg (director)|Adam Berg]] was being looked at to direct the film.&lt;ref name="BergContender" /&gt; In April 2011, [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] was hired after working on the visual effects for some of the ''X-Men'' films,&lt;ref name="Miller2011" /&gt; in part because of his work creating animated short films. These included the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award-winning]] ''Gopher Broke'' and a [[DC Universe Online]] trailer which was "epic and cinematic, everything [Fox wanted] their comic book movies to be".&lt;ref name="THRHistory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MillerOscar" /&gt; Miller would make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film, while Reynolds closed a deal with Fox to produce the film.&lt;ref name="Miller2011" /&gt;

Reynolds's ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' superhero film was released later in 2011 and was "a disaster". This tainted the ''Deadpool'' project. Fox executives were already concerned about its R-rated content. After several meetings the studio agreed the film could not be reconfigured for a more traditional PG-13 rating, and gave Miller "a low-six-figure budget" to produce some test footage.&lt;ref name="THRHistory" /&gt; He created the footage using CGI at his animation company [[Blur Studio]] in 2012, with Reynolds voicing Deadpool.&lt;ref name="LeakedOfficial" /&gt; The footage did not convince Fox to green-light the film.&lt;ref name="THRHistory" /&gt; After the successful May release of Marvel's ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', Reese and Wernick thought ''Deadpool'' might be approved as an already developed superhero film. Fox was actually even more doubtful about the script, however, and began exploring ways to include Deadpool in an ''Avengers''-esque team-up film.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickDoGFeb2016" /&gt; At different times during development, [[James Cameron]] and [[David Fincher]], both friends of Miller, read the film's script and championed the project to Fox executives.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickColliderNov2016" /&gt;

{{Quote box|width=30%|quote="I would have [leaked the test footage], if I had known it would have caused that! ... Now, we get to make the movie. We don't get to make it with the budget of most superhero movies, but we get to make it the way we want to make it."|source=‚ÄîStar and producer Ryan Reynolds on ''Deadpool'' finally getting the green-light after the test footage leak.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsLeakAttribution" /&gt;}}
The test footage was leaked online in July 2014,&lt;ref name="LeakedFootage" /&gt; and was met with an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response.&lt;ref name="THRHistory" /&gt; That September, Fox gave ''Deadpool'' a release date of February 12, 2016.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDate" /&gt; Production was set to begin in March 2015, with [[Simon Kinberg]] joining as producer.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsConfirmed" /&gt; Reynolds attributed Fox's green-lighting of the film entirely to the leak. He, Miller and the writers had previously discussed leaking the footage themselves, and Reynolds initially thought that Miller had done so. He later believed the leak came from someone at Fox. In exchange for being able to make the film the way they wanted, Fox gave the crew a much smaller budget than is typical for superhero films.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsLeakAttribution" /&gt;

====Writing====
Reese and Wernick wrote a draft of the script each year before completing the film,&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016"/&gt; with around 70 percent of the first draft ending up in the final film.&lt;ref name="CSRealHeroes"/&gt; Reese described Reynolds as "the keeper of the Deadpool flame for many years ... if we ever do something that is off the Deadpool path, or if it doesn't feel like Deadpool, he catches it."&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickMTVFeb2010"/&gt; The writers did not want the film to be an [[origin story]], but Reynolds disagreed. They settled on a "modern" Deadpool story as well as the origin story connected by Deadpool's narration and fourth wall breaking. This helped to balance the darker origin story with the cartoon-like Deadpool scenes. It also allowed the opening fight sequence to be extended through the first half of the film (with the origin story told throughout), saving money on additional fight scenes.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016"/&gt; This fight sequence labeled the "Twelve Bullets Fight" reimagines the original test footage.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown"/&gt; Once the origin story is told, Deadpool uses a "fast-forward button" to return the audience to the present day.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016"/&gt;

In October 2014, Kinberg confirmed that ''Deadpool'' would be set in the same [[shared universe]] as the ''X-Men'' films, but would "stand independently".&lt;ref name="KinbergUniverse"/&gt; The writers wanted a traditional X-Man in the film as a foil to Deadpool and felt [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] was a character who had not been explored much in previous films.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016" /&gt; Miller wanted "more superhero stuff", instead of "just Deadpool and a lot of guns". The character [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] was added as a trainee X-Man mentored by Colossus.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown"/&gt; She was chosen for her name from the list of comic characters available for use by Fox.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown"/&gt; The characters [[Garrison Kane]], [[Wyre (comics)|Wyre]], and Sluggo were included in the script at one point, but ultimately removed for budgetary reasons.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickColliderNov2016" /&gt; [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Tar Baby (comics)|Tar Baby]] were also considered.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YahooNov2015" /&gt; These villains were replaced by a single character, [[Angel Dust (comics)|Angel Dust]].&lt;ref name="io9Writers" /&gt; The [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] character was also set to appear, but was eventually pushed to a potential sequel so this film could "get Deadpool on his feet" first.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickColliderNov2016" /&gt;

The writers worked to keep the script's pop-culture references up-to-date throughout its development.&lt;ref name="YahooNov2015" /&gt; Kinberg confirmed the film would make fun of Deadpool's portrayal in ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine''.&lt;ref name="KinbergUniverse" /&gt; It also includes jokes at the expense of ''Green Lantern''.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; While Miller felt it was okay for audience members not to understand all of the film's jokes, he wanted to avoid anything targeted specifically at comic fans. He was not in favor of any joke the audience "needs to look up on the internet" after the movie ends.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; The film's post-credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986), where the title character of that film breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool. In the parody scene, Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home.&lt;ref name="PostCredits" /&gt; He also confirms that Cable will appear in [[Deadpool 2|the sequel]].&lt;ref name="CablePostCredits" /&gt; After reading the scene, a Fox executive described the film as combination of ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'' and ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' (1994), a description the writers felt was accurate.&lt;ref name="PostCredits" /&gt;

[[File:5.12.18RhettReeseByLuigiNovi6.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Co-writer Rhett Reese said the studio's cuts to the film's budget made the script more efficient&lt;ref name="io9Writers" /&gt;|alt=The film's co-writer Rhett Reese smiling at a 2018 event]]
48 hours before the film received the official green-light from Fox, the studio cut its budget by $7‚Äì$8&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="io9Writers" /&gt; down to $58&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; This forced a last minute re-write that saw about nine pages cut from the 110-page script. Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase at the end of the Twelve Bullets Fight and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having to shoot a costly gun fight in the third act. Reese said, "It was that last, lean and mean chop that got us to a place where Fox was willing to make it. The script was very efficient and not too long. That was a function of budget more than anything, but I think it really made the movie pace nicely."&lt;ref name="io9Writers" /&gt;

===Pre-production===
In January 2015, [[T.J. Miller]] and [[Ed Skrein]] were in talks to appear in the film, Miller as "an additional comic voice" and Skrein as a villain.&lt;ref name="MillerSkreinTalks" /&gt; A month later, Fox was testing actresses to portray the female lead, including [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Taylor Schilling]], [[Crystal Reed]], [[Rebecca Rittenhouse]], [[Sarah Greene (actress)|Sarah Greene]] and [[Jessica De Gouw]].&lt;ref name="SixActressesTest" /&gt; [[Gina Carano]] was cast as Angel Dust, and Miller was confirmed for an unspecified role.&lt;ref name="MillerCaranoCast" /&gt; Baccarin was cast as Deadpool's love interest before the end of February.&lt;ref name="BaccarinCast" /&gt; Colossus actor [[Daniel Cudmore]] said he would not be reprising the role for ''Deadpool'',&lt;ref name="NoCudmore" /&gt; and declined an offer to provide reference for a CG version of the character to be voiced by another actor.&lt;ref name="CudmoreExplanation" /&gt;

An immediate focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit.&lt;ref name="Yahoo5Things" /&gt; Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions were hired to create the costume. Shinkle noted that "comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique", and he tried to balance that with reality.&lt;ref name="ShinkleToS" /&gt; Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave it a slimmer, "quintessential Deadpool" look.&lt;ref name="LivelySuit" /&gt; Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume.&lt;ref name="LivelySuit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReynoldsCBJul2015" /&gt; Reynolds explained, "we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That's hard to accomplish and a feat, but we're just so happy with how this came out."&lt;ref name="ReynoldsCBJul2015" /&gt; The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind. The mask's eye areas were removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without having to change the whole mask.&lt;ref name="ShinkleToS" /&gt; The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI. Visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed this on the suit's fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to "get into the gutters and the cracks ... [so when] the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt."&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.&lt;ref name="FilmIllusions" /&gt;

Miller wanted Deadpool's scarred appearance to make him appear "fucking horrible" to justify his anger.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; Makeup designer [[Bill Corso]] had some leeway because in the comics "he's everything from a rotten corpse to a guy with a couple of lines on his face". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as "disfigured" but also wanted him to be "kind of charming and iconic". He wanted to avoid comparisons with [[Freddy Krueger]] and looked to ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005) for inspiration.&lt;ref name="CorsoColliderMar2016" /&gt; The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds's head, which took several hours to apply.&lt;ref name="CorsoTHRNov2016" /&gt; For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply Reynold's full-body makeup.&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; Corso described the makeup for the rest of the film's characters as "pretty simple. Tim wanted to keep it really grounded."&lt;ref name="CorsoColliderMar2016" /&gt;

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2015, in [[Vancouver]], Canada, under the [[working title]] ''Wham!''. Filming took place at [[North Shore Studios]] and on location around the city.&lt;ref name="FilmingBegins"/&gt; The production hired over 2,000 locals as actors, extras and crew members.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt; T. J. Miller and Baccarin were revealed to be playing [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]] and [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]], respectively.&lt;ref name="LiefeldVanessa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weasel" /&gt; Skrein confirmed he was in the film, playing [[Ajax (comics)#Deadpool character|Ajax]].&lt;ref name="Ajax" /&gt; Newcomer [[Brianna Hildebrand]] was cast as Negasonic Teenage Warhead.&lt;ref name="Hildebrand" /&gt;

Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng wanted the film to look "grittier and less clean and glossy" than other superhero films. They decided to shoot with digital cameras but add [[film grain]] in post-production to give the images texture. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, and Panavision primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. The film's exterior scenes have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with "unpredictable" weather.&lt;ref name="DMW" /&gt; For instance, the production had use of the [[Georgia Viaduct]] for two weeks and shot rain or shine before their permit expired. Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep a consistent look.&lt;ref name="DMW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmingBegins" /&gt; Production designer Sean Haworth, who had specific ideas for the sets, also worked closely with Miller. The production had to be very specific about which elements of each set were constructed to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI. A [[gimbal]] was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with many digital elements.&lt;ref name="Haworth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haworth2" /&gt; The final sequence was filmed in a naval yard dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.&lt;ref name="HaworthComicCon2016" /&gt;

[[File:Deadpool, Georgia Viaduct, Vancouver, April 6 2015 - 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Stunt coordinator Philip J. Silvera in costume as Deadpool on set in Vancouver&lt;ref name="FightFootage" /&gt;|alt=refer to caption]]
When Fox was unwilling to pay Reese and Wernick to be on set every day,&lt;ref name="CSRealHeroes" /&gt; Reynolds paid their salaries.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsPayWriters" /&gt; The writers had scripted the action very specifically, "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators were free to change this.&lt;ref name="CSRealHeroes" /&gt; Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the film's [[stunt coordinators]];&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage.&lt;ref name="SilveraTest" /&gt; The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors. Skrein worked "nonstop" to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds "has a photographic memory; he'd do something three or four times and remember it very well."&lt;ref name="SilveraWtW" /&gt; A lot of the film's jokes were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016" /&gt; He said the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsGoogle" /&gt; For example, Reese said Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic. Instead Reynolds improvised the line on set, "You know it's funny how I only see the two of you here. It's like the studio couldn't afford any more X-Men." This was based in truth and became then Fox chairman [[Jim Gianopulos]]' favorite line.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016" /&gt; Filming ended on May 29.&lt;ref name="FilmingEnds" /&gt;

===Post-production===
[[Leslie Uggams]] said that she was in the film in July 2015, portraying [[Blind Al]].&lt;ref name="Uggams" /&gt; Tim Miller stated that [[Jed Rees]] portrays "The Recruiter", and "did a good job of being creepy and syrupy sweet". Miller explained that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film,&lt;ref name="TrailerBreakdown" /&gt; with Andre Tricoteux cast to provide motion reference on set for the role along with the voice.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapicic" /&gt; In December, the voice of Colossus was recast, with [[Stefan Kapiƒçiƒá]] taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.&lt;ref name="Kapicic" /&gt;

As soon as editor [[Julian Clarke]] began selecting shots for the film, they were [[color grading|color graded]] by [[EFILM]]'s Tim Stipan to ensure they all matched.&lt;ref name="DMW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ClarkeVerge" /&gt; Stipan colored the characters slightly differently. He gave Deadpool a "dark, modern touch" and Colossus a "particular vibrancy and substance".&lt;ref name="StipanIF" /&gt; Clarke edited each scene focusing on humor, choosing between alternate takes of jokes. He removed jokes made after Vanessa is kidnapped because they felt inappropriately timed. He cut down other scenes with fewer jokes, such as Wilson being tortured, as they were "too much". It would take the audience "too long to recover [and] get back in the irreverent spirit of the movie." During editing, a linear version of the film was produced. Clarke decided to go with interweaving the timelines to balance the different serious and silly tones.&lt;ref name="ClarkeVerge" /&gt;

One sequence removed from the film saw Wilson and Vanessa travel to Mexico looking for a cure after he turned down the recruiter. It was removed for pacing reasons and replaced with a short scene of Wilson sitting beside his window that was originally filmed to show him thinking about his diagnosis. In its new context the scene implies him re-thinking the recruiter's offer.&lt;ref name="ClarkeCut" /&gt;

Because of the animation required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded the lines in an [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|additional dialogue recording]] session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of ''Wolverine'' star [[Hugh Jackman]]'s natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character [[Professor X]] is being portrayed by [[James McAvoy]] or [[Patrick Stewart]] at that point in the ''X-Men'' timeline. This became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickBIJan2017" /&gt;

====Visual effects====
[[Digital Domain]] (DD), Atomic Fiction, Blur Studio, [[Weta Digital]], [[Rodeo FX]] and [[Luma Pictures]] produced ''Deadpool''{{'}}s visual effects.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Reynolds credited Miller and his visual effects experience with producing a film that looked like others made with bigger budgets.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsGoogle" /&gt; Motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle agreed, noting that Miller held off working on the CGI for Colossus until after the film was edited to avoid spending money on shots that would not be used.&lt;ref name="LaSalle" /&gt; Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart to design and complete the film's 1500 effects shots‚Äî700 more than originally planned. 800 of them were completed in the last four weeks of production.&lt;ref name="Rothbart" /&gt;

[[File:Colossus - mocap.jpg|thumb|left|Top: Andre Tricoteux (center) on set as Colossus, wearing a gray tracking suit. Bottom: Completed shot, with CG Colossus by Digital Domain and environment by Atomic Fiction.|alt=refer to caption]]
Colossus's movements were re-recorded with performer [[T.J. Storm]], as Tricoteux had been unable to move athletically because of the platform shoes he wore on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's metallic finish to avoid looking "chromey", visiting a metal company to look at samples. They settled on [[Cold-formed steel|cold rolled steel]], with the darker [[Hot working|hot rolled steel]] used for his hair. The model also includes ridges which could be moved separately to keep them perfectly straight as in the comic books.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; DD also created the model of Deadpool was used by all the FX vendors. His mask was animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics. This helped balance out the "chinwag" coming through the bottom of the mask as Reynolds's acted. Fully Replacing Deadpool's head was going to be too costly, so Weta Digital warped each shot based on facial references from Reynolds and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes instead. This was called an "ingenious 2D-ish solution".&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

Atomic Fiction created a freeway environment for the Twelve Bullets Fight, with a backdrop based on Detroit, Chicago, and Vancouver. They also created the vehicles used in the sequence.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; These assets were used by Blur for the opening titles, which move through a frozen moment where Deadpool is fighting thugs inside a crashing car. The amusing titles include "Directed by an overpaid tool" and "Produced by asshats".&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Reynolds, Miller, and the writers came up with their own credits hoping to set the tone for the film.&lt;ref name="YahooFeb2016" /&gt;

Luma contributed the film's blood and gore using practical footage as well as digital effects for more complex scenes. When Deadpool cuts off his own hand, DD did not want to be "outdone" by Luma and had "buckets of blood pouring out". Luma created the regrowing hand, inspired by the hand of a fetus.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; When Deadpool breaks both his hands, DD went through 20 or 30 different versions of what broken fingers could look like.&lt;ref name="CBC" /&gt; For Deadpool's initial scarring from the warehouse fire, Rodeo FX referenced rotting fruit and maggot-eaten meat. The company added a CG penis to Reynolds in this sequence, which visual effects supervisor Wayne Brinton said, "you don't even notice [but] when it wasn't there it looked really weird". Rodeo also augmented the practical fire in the scene.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

The vendors all collaborated for the final battle sequence, which takes place in the wreckage of a helicarrier. Luma created the climactic fight between Deadpool and Ajax; DD created most of the Colossus effects until he is damaged when Blur Studio took over; DD  created the effects for Negasonic Teenage Warhead's abilities as well as expanding the helicarrier's deck; Rodeo contributed [[matte paintings]] for the background; and Weta provided the facial animation for Deadpool.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HelicarrierArt" /&gt; Negasonic's abilities were the only "supernatural effect-sy thing" in the film, and were based on [[Thermobaric weapon|fuel-air explosives]] and [[solar flare]]s to try ground them in reality.&lt;ref name="Rothbart" /&gt; Setting the final sequence on the wrecked helicarrier was Miller's idea. This helped to expand the scope of the third act and include more connections to the comics and the wider Marvel Universe.&lt;ref name="HelicarrierSR" /&gt; To avoid rights issues with Marvel Studios, the helicarrier for ''Deadpool'' was designed to be "as different as possible from the one in ''The Avengers''".&lt;ref name="HelicarrierArt" /&gt; Additionally, a French animation artist with a "unique style" created 2D cartoon characters that dance around Deadpool after he is stabbed in the head during the fight.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt;

==Music==
{{main|Deadpool (soundtrack)}}
[[Junkie XL|Tom Holkenborg]] announced in October 2015 that he would compose the score for ''Deadpool''.&lt;ref name="Holkenborg" /&gt; Noting that Deadpool only makes pre-1990 musical references,&lt;ref name="HolkenborgCreators" /&gt; Holenborg decided to use sounds from the 1980s in the movie's main theme, such as those of an [[Oberheim Electronics#Oberheim polyphonic synthesizers|Oberheim]] and a [[Synclavier]] .&lt;ref name="HolkenborgStudio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HolkenborgStudio2" /&gt; Several songs were written in to Reese and Wernick's script to be used in the film. Some of these ultimately did not work as intended. For example, the sex montage with Wilson and Vanessa was to play out to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s version of "[[It Was a Very Good Year]]" in the script, but this was changed to [[Neil Sedaka]]'s "[[Calendar Girl (song)|Calendar Girl]]" during editing.&lt;ref name="ClarkeCut" /&gt; A soundtrack album featuring Holkenborg's score and the songs heard in the film was released digitally on February 12, 2016, and physically on March 4 through [[Milan Records]].&lt;ref name="Soundtrack" /&gt;

==Marketing==
{{main|Marketing for Deadpool (film)}}
The marketing budget for ''Deadpool'' was limited so Reynolds worked closely with Fox's domestic marketing chief Marc Weinstock to use the Internet to their advantage and come up with cheaper, "Deadpool-based" ways to market the film.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsMarketing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AdAgeSocialMedia" /&gt; This included unique trailers,&lt;ref name="THRTrailer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Teaser" /&gt; unconventional billboards,&lt;ref name="WiredMarketing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SRMarketing" /&gt; promotional tie-ins with [[Super Bowl L]] and [[Viacom]]&lt;ref name="SemMarketing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Commercials" /&gt; and an extensive social media presence.&lt;ref name="WiredMarketing" /&gt; Reynolds kept one of the Deadpool costumes for himself, and appeared in it throughout the marketing campaign.&lt;ref name="Yahoo5Things" /&gt; Visual effects vendor [[Image Engine]] animated Deadpool's mask for these appearances, using a process similar to that used by Weta Digital for the film.&lt;ref name="FXGuide" /&gt; Emma Grey Ellis at [[Wired.com]] described the campaign as "crazy and unrelenting" with Deadpool waging "a relentless marketing siege of every platform you would think of‚Äîand some you didn‚Äôt."&lt;ref name="WiredMarketing" /&gt; Bobby Anhalt at [[Screen Rant]] called it possibly "the best film marketing campaign in the history of cinema".&lt;ref name="SRMarketing" /&gt; [[HostGator]]'s Jeremy Jensen attributed the campaign's success to Reynolds, and to Fox for embracing the film's R rating.&lt;ref name="HGMarketing" /&gt;

==Release==
===Theatrical===
''Deadpool''{{'}}s  world premiere was held at the [[Grand Rex]] in Paris on February 8, 2016,&lt;ref name="Premiere" /&gt; before its initial theatrical release in Hong Kong the next day. This was followed by releases in 49 other markets over the next few days, including the United States on February 12.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InternationalRelease" /&gt; The movie was released in several formats, including [[IMAX]], [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]], premium large formats, and [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]].&lt;ref name="ClarkeCut" /&gt;

Kinberg explained that unlike the previous ''X-Men'' films, ''Deadpool'' is "a hard R. It's graphic. Nothing is taboo. You either commit to a truly outrageous boundary-pushing kind of movie or you don't."&lt;ref name="RatedR" /&gt; China forbid the film's release because of this. Though R-rated American films are often "cleaned-up" for release there, it was decided that doing so was impossible without affecting the plot.&lt;ref name="NoChina" /&gt; It was not released in Uzbekistan after theater owners in the country decided against showing the film because of its age restriction and how it violated the country's societal norms.&lt;ref name="NoUzbekistan" /&gt; ''Deadpool'' received seven "general cuts" to obtain approval for release in India.&lt;ref name="India" /&gt; Despite being blocked in China during this initial release, ''Deadpool'' eventually premiered in the country during the 2018 [[Beijing International Film Festival]], which ran over a week from April 15‚Äì22. The original version of the film played at the festival without any edits being made specifically for Chinese censors.&lt;ref name="BeijingIFF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BeijingIFFHappened" /&gt;

===Home media===
''Deadpool'' was released for [[digital distribution|digital download]] on April 26, 2016, moved up from the physical home media release, which came on May 10. The latter release, for [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]], included behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and two audio commentaries: one by Tim Miller and Deadpool co-creator [[Rob Liefeld]], and another by Reynolds, Reese, and Wernick.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia" /&gt; On November 7, Fox re-released the film and its special features on Blu-ray for the holiday season, as ''Deadpool's Holiday Blu-ray package''.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia2" /&gt; The film was re-released again in April 2018 in a ''Deadpool'' Two Year Anniversary Edition Blu-ray package, with collectible covers as well as "stickers, car decals, temporary tattoos and a set of paper dolls". A 4K UHD Steelbook version was also released exclusively through [[Best Buy]] featuring original artwork.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia3" /&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Deadpool'' grossed $363.1&amp;nbsp;million in the United States and Canada and $420&amp;nbsp;million in other countries for a worldwide total of $783.1&amp;nbsp;million, against a budget of $58&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; It broke numerous records with its opening weekend gross across the world, and went on to become the highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film and the highest-grossing ''X-Men'' film,&lt;ref name="HighestR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="XMenRecord" /&gt; as well as the [[2016 in film|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016]].&lt;ref name="BOM2016Ranking" /&gt; ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' calculated the net profit of the film to be $322&amp;nbsp;million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the second-most profitable release of 2016. When discussing potential reasons for the film's surprise success, the site highlighted its marketing campaign.&lt;ref name="NetProfit" /&gt;

At the end of January 2016, the film was projected to earn $55‚Äì60&amp;nbsp;million over its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="BOProjections" /&gt; Fox's rivals projected the film to earn closer to $80&amp;nbsp;million. It ultimately opened at No. 1, making $132.4&amp;nbsp;million for the weekend, and $152.2&amp;nbsp;million over the long [[Washington's Birthday|Presidents' Day]] weekend. Trying to explain this surprise, Fox's domestic distribution chief Chris Aronson said "it's hard to comp and predict. You're doing something that's never been done. It's like you throw the rulebook out the window." The weekend included $12.7&amp;nbsp;million from Thursday preview showings on February 11, $47.5&amp;nbsp;million on its opening day, $42.5&amp;nbsp;million on February 13, and $42.6&amp;nbsp;million on February 14, as well as $19.8&amp;nbsp;million on February 15 to end the long weekend. These were all day-of-the-week records for R-rated films and days in February for Thursday through Monday. $16.8&amp;nbsp;million of this came from [[IMAX]] screens, a record opening weekend for R-rated films and February releases in that format.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWeekend" /&gt; ''Deadpool'' earned an additional $55&amp;nbsp;million in its second weekend. This kept it at No. 1, and made it the fastest R-rated film to cross $200&amp;nbsp;million, doing so in nine days.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWeekend2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deadline200" /&gt; It became the highest-grossing ''X-Men'' film and R-rated comic book superhero film the next day.&lt;ref name="ForbesWeekend2" /&gt; It remained in the No. 1 position for its third week,&lt;ref name="DeadlineWeekend3" /&gt; but fell behind ''[[Zootopia]]'' and ''[[London Has Fallen]]'' the following week.&lt;ref name="THRWeekend4" /&gt; ''Deadpool''{{'}}s domestic run ended on June 17, after 126 days, with $363.1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="DomesticRunEnds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; This was shortly after it became the highest-grossing R-rated film worldwide.&lt;ref name="HighestR" /&gt; The film's U.S. audience, across its whole run, was 59% Caucasian, 21% Hispanic, 12% African-American, and 8% Asian. It was also 62% male, and had an average age of 35.&lt;ref name="AudienceStudy" /&gt;

The film was released in 80 markets around the world, many of them in its first week. This included the United Kingdom, France, and Australia on its first day, February 9, where it was the No. 1 film and broke several records. The film also opened well in Asian countries, notably Taiwan‚Äîwhere Reynolds had traveled for promotion and made the "central hub" of South East Asia for the film‚Äîand Hong Kong, where the film had the biggest Chinese New Year single day ever.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntlOpening" /&gt; It went on to gross $132.2&amp;nbsp;million for its international opening weekend, which included $9&amp;nbsp;million from IMAX showings breaking opening weekend records for February releases and R-rated films in that format in several markets. It was the No. 1 film in all markets where it was released over the weekend, except Poland and Malaysia where it was No. 2 behind local films ''[[Planet Single]]'' and ''[[The Mermaid (2016 film)|The Mermaid]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntlWeekend" /&gt; The film broke the record for biggest opening weekend in Russia and Thailand, and set records for biggest R-rated film and February opening weekends in several other markets.&lt;ref name="THRRecords" /&gt; It remained No. 1 for the international box office in its second weekend, making an additional $84.7&amp;nbsp;million from 77 markets. The film made No. 1 debuts in 17 new countries, including Korea, Spain, and Italy, and maintained its No. 1 position in countries like the UK, Germany, and Brazil. Its South East Asia performance was compared favorably to bigger superhero films like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (both 2014).&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntlWeekend2" /&gt; ''Deadpool'' was No. 1 for a third consecutive weekend,&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntlWeekend3" /&gt; before falling to No. 3 behind ''[[Ip Man 3]]'' and ''Zootopia'' in its fourth.&lt;ref name="DeadlineIntlWeekend4" /&gt; ''Deadpool'' opened in its final market, Japan, in June, and was the No. 1 film there, with a $6.5&amp;nbsp;million opening weekend.&lt;ref name="DeadlineJapan" /&gt;

===Critical response===
On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 317 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Fast, funny, and gleefully profane, the fourth-wall-busting ''Deadpool'' subverts superhero film formula with wildly entertaining‚Äîand decidedly non-family-friendly‚Äîresults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deadpool/|title=Deadpool (2016)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/deadpool|title=Deadpool Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale. [[PostTrak]] reported an average positive score of 97%, with 45% of filmgoers saying the film exceeded their expectations.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWeekend" /&gt;

Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' scored ''Deadpool'' three-and-a-half out of four, calling it a "voraciously self-aware comedy" and the first R-rated Marvel film "with real teeth". He praised the film's attitude and tone, Reynolds for making Deadpool a likeable character and the film's action scenes.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost" /&gt; ''[[TheWrap]]''{{'}}s Alonso Duralde said ''Deadpool'' "shouldn't work, but it absolutely does", feeling that it successfully balanced comedy with superhero action, and that the chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin gave enough weight to the plot to support the tone and violence.&lt;ref name="TheWrap" /&gt; Calvin Wilson at the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' also gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, saying it was "smart, sexy, and outrageous", but that it would not work without Reynolds.&lt;ref name="StLouisPostDispatch" /&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Peter Bradshaw gave the film four out of five calling it "neurotic and needy‚Äîand very entertaining", comparing it to ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'' (2010) and ''[[Kill Bill]]'' (2003). He did feel the film's villains were underused.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Writing for [[Uproxx]], Drew McWeeny described it as "the world's most violent and vulgar [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon", and praised the film's unconventional plot structure, its personal stakes, the difference in tone and storytelling from other superhero films, and the cast.&lt;ref name="Uproxx" /&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Justin Chang said the film is "terribly arch and juvenile [but] also startlingly effective", praising Reynolds's performance (and the film's willingness to hide his looks under prosthetics), the script, and director Miller for staying "out of the way of his script and his star".&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; Todd McCarthy at ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt the film took a while to get going, "but once it does, ''Deadpool'' drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos".&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter" /&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Peter Travers said the film "goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness", but the "junky feel is part of its charm". He praised the cast, particularly Reynolds as well as Tim Miller's action sequences.&lt;ref name="RollingStone" /&gt; At ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Tom Russo gave the film three stars. He criticized the "featherweight" plot, but said that there is enough humor to support it, and that Reynolds was "born to play" Deadpool.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe" /&gt; Chris Nashawaty graded the film a 'B' for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', saying it "doesn't have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story" but makes up for that with R-rated fun. Nashawaty felt Reynolds was the perfect star for the film and is "a blast of laughing gas in a genre that tends to take itself way too seriously".&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly" /&gt; Tasha Robinson at ''[[The Verge]]'' felt there was too much juvenile humor. She noted the film was did not make homophobic, racist, or sexist jokes, and that its overall tone remained joyous despite the material.&lt;ref name="Verge" /&gt; David Edelstein of ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' said the film's jokes save it from a lack of subtext and strong villains and noted the "gratifyingly twisty" structure.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; Manohla Dargis at ''[[The New York Times]]'' was not impressed with the listing of the film's genre cliches in the opening credits before they were used. She highlighted the "human" elements in the film and the moments where Reynolds and Tim Miller did "more than hit the same bombastic notes over and over again".&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes" /&gt; [[IndieWire]]{{'}}s Kate Erbland gave the film a 'B-', praising its style, and Reynolds's Deadpool for breaking the superhero mold, but criticizing the overall film for following genre conventions and focusing on "numbing" violence and un-original swearing and nudity.&lt;ref name="IndieWire" /&gt;

Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Kenneth Turan said that ''Deadpool'' "gets off to a fun start"  but the character "eventually wears out his welcome". He noted that though the film has a complicated narrative, it is masking a conventional Marvel origin story. Turan did highlight the film's romantic element and Baccarin's performance.&lt;ref name="LosAngelesTimes" /&gt; Jonathon Pile of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film three out of five, saying the number of jokes "will soon numb you to their impact" He called the film a fun alternative to other superhero films.&lt;ref name="Empire" /&gt; Robbie Collin at ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' also gave the film three out of five, saying it is not "the future of superhero movies" calling it "an enjoyably obnoxious detour". He felt some of the film's jokes about superhero cliches were out of date by the time the film was released.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s Mick LaSalle did not appreciate the humor, fourth wall breaking, or violence. He concluded the film is "bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it's just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema's future".&lt;ref name="SanFranciscoChronicle" /&gt;

===Accolades===
{{main|List of accolades received by Deadpool (film)}}
''Deadpool'' has received many awards and nominations, recognizing the film as a whole, as well as: the cast's performance, particularly Reynolds as Deadpool; several technical areas, including the film's makeup, sound, and visual effects; and the film's unconventional marketing campaign. It was nominated for two [[Golden Globe Awards]],&lt;ref name="GoldenGlobe" /&gt; four [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards]] (winning two),&lt;ref name="CriticsChoice" /&gt; a [[Directors Guild of America Award]],&lt;ref name="DGA" /&gt; five [[Empire Awards]],&lt;ref name="EmpireAwards" /&gt; seven [[Golden Trailer Awards]] (winning two),&lt;ref name="GTA17" /&gt; a [[Hugo Award]],&lt;ref name="Hugo" /&gt; two [[Key Art Awards]] for marketing (winning both),&lt;ref name="KeyArt" /&gt; eight [[MTV Movie Awards]] (winning two),&lt;ref name="MMA" /&gt; a [[Producers Guild of America Award]],&lt;ref name="PGAAwards" /&gt; four [[People's Choice Awards]] (winning two),&lt;ref name="PeoplesChoice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PeoplesChoice2" /&gt; three [[Saturn Award]]s (winning one),&lt;ref name="SaturnAwards" /&gt; six [[Teen Choice Awards]] (winning two)&lt;ref name="TeenChoice" /&gt; and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].&lt;ref name="WGAAwards" /&gt;

After being nominated for awards such as the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, and Writers Guild of America, ''Deadpool'' was considered a serious contender by commentators for several [[Academy Awards]], despite its content and tone.&lt;ref name="VFOscars" /&gt; This included potential nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and after its Producers Guild of America nomination, [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].&lt;ref name="USAOscars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ColliderOscars" /&gt; When the film did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it was widely considered to have been "[[wikt:snub|snubbed]]".&lt;ref name="OscarsSnub" /&gt; Analyzing potential reasons for this, Screen Rant's Alex Leadbeater said that while the film "earned a solid thumbs up from most", it was generally not praised by top critics for offering any "depth or related subversion of its genre". He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters' have against superhero films; the lack of a targeted campaign for the awards by Fox, who did not seem to be expecting any of the film's previous awards either; and the number of other films in contention, as "2016 was, all in all, a pretty good year for movies".&lt;ref name="OscarsAnalysis" /&gt; A variant cover for Marvel Comics' ''[[X-Men Gold]]'' #1, with art by [[Ron Lim]] and released in April 2017, references ''Deadpool''{{'}}s Oscar snub.&lt;ref name="SnubVariant" /&gt;

===Cinematic impact===
Before ''Deadpool''{{'}}s success, R-rated, comic-based films considered successful were ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2006) and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009), which earned about half the opening weekend gross of successful PG-13 superhero films. ''Kick-Ass'', a film tonally similar to ''Deadpool'', made even less with a $19.8&amp;nbsp;million opening. Many reasons were given why ''Deadpool'' went on to be more successful than these, including the popularity of the Marvel brand and Reynolds's performance.&lt;ref name="DeadlineWeekend" /&gt; Tom Huddleston, Jr. wrote for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' that ''Deadpool'' was proof to Hollywood that R-rated films can be as successful as PG-13 films, "particularly when fans see the rating itself as validation that the film is true to its source material".&lt;ref name="FortuneR" /&gt;

A Hollywood executive, not involved with the film, felt it succeeded because it "has a self-deprecating tone that's riotous. It's never been done before. It's poking fun at Marvel. That label takes itself so seriously; can you imagine them making fun of themselves in a movie?" [[James Gunn]], director of Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', rejected this saying ''Deadpool'' was a success because "it's original, it's damn good ... and it wasn't afraid to take risks". Gunn hoped studios would learn "the right lesson" from the film and not just try to make more films like ''Deadpool''.&lt;ref name="Gunn" /&gt; After Fox's ''[[Logan (2017 film)|Logan]]'' (2017) also became a success, ''Forbes''{{'}} Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was "appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes", but "too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work".&lt;ref name="ForbesR" /&gt; Graeme McMillan of the ''The Hollywood Reporter'' concurred, adding, "Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?"&lt;ref name="THRR" /&gt;

In March 2017, a [[Warner Bros.]] executive said that an R-rated [[DC Extended Universe]] film could "absolutely" happen,&lt;ref name="DCR" /&gt; while [[Sony Pictures]] began developing an R-rated adaptation of the character [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] with a smaller budget, inspired by Fox's success with ''Deadpool'' and ''Logan''.&lt;ref name="VenomR" /&gt; In June, [[Marvel Studios]] president [[Kevin Feige]] said in response to the successes that, though that company was not planning any R-rated films for its [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], "it's not out of the question".&lt;ref name="FeigeR" /&gt; After the [[proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] said that the company would be willing to make future R-rated Marvel films like ''Deadpool'', potentially under a "Marvel-R" brand, "as long as we let the audiences know what's coming".&lt;ref name="DisneyMarvelR" /&gt;

==Sequels==
{{further|X-Men (film series)}}
Before ''Deadpool''{{'}}s release, Fox green-lit a sequel with Reese and Wernick returning to write the screenplay.&lt;ref name="GreenLight" /&gt; The involvement of Reynolds and Tim Miller was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon in April,&lt;ref name="CinemaCon2016" /&gt; but at the end of October, Miller left the film over "mutual creative differences" with Reynolds.&lt;ref name="MillerExit" /&gt; The next month, [[David Leitch (director)|David Leitch]] signed on to replace Miller for the sequel.&lt;ref name="LeitchConfirmed" /&gt; Leitch first made a short film, ''[[No Good Deed (2017 film)|No Good Deed]]'', which was written by Reese and Wernick and played in front of ''Logan''.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickShort" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MangoldPost" /&gt; ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' was released on May 18, 2018,&lt;ref name="SequelReleaseDate" /&gt; with Baccarin,&lt;ref name="BaccarinSequel" /&gt; T. J. Miller,&lt;ref name="TJMillerSequel" /&gt; Uggams,&lt;ref name="UggamsSequel" /&gt; Hildebrand,&lt;ref name="KapicicHildebrandSequel" /&gt; and Kapiƒçiƒá all returning.&lt;ref name="KapicicHildebrandSequel" /&gt; [[Josh Brolin]] joined them as Cable.&lt;ref name="Brolin" /&gt; The film explores the team [[X-Force]], which includes Deadpool and Cable.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017XForce" /&gt; In March 2017, Reese said that a future film focused on that group would be separate from ''Deadpool 3'', "so I think we'll be able to take two paths. [''X-Force''] is where we're launching something bigger, but then [''Deadpool 3'' is] where we're contracting and staying personal and small."&lt;ref name="ReeseMar2017" /&gt; After the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Bob Iger said that Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe under Disney.&lt;ref name="DisneyFoxMCU" /&gt;

A '''deed in lieu of foreclosure''' is a [[deed]] instrument in which a mortgagor (i.e. the borrower) conveys all interest in a [[real property]] to the mortgagee (i.e. the lender) to satisfy a loan that is in [[Default (finance)|default]] and avoid [[foreclosure]] proceedings.

The deed in lieu of foreclosure offers several advantages to both the borrower and the lender.  The principal advantage to the borrower is that it immediately releases him/her from most or all of the personal indebtedness associated with the defaulted loan.  The borrower also avoids the public notoriety of a foreclosure proceeding and may receive more generous terms than he/she would in a formal [[foreclosure]].  Another benefit to the borrower is that it hurts his/her credit less than a foreclosure does. Advantages to a lender include a reduction in the time and cost of a repossession, lower risk of borrower revenge ([[metal theft]] and vandalism of the property before sheriff eviction), and additional advantages if the borrower subsequently files for [[bankruptcy]].

If there are any junior liens a deed in lieu is a less attractive option for the lender.  The lender will likely not want to assume the liability of the junior liens from the property owner, and accordingly, the lender will prefer to foreclose in order to clean the title.

In order to be considered a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the indebtedness must be [[Collateral (finance)|secured by]] the real estate being transferred.  Both sides must enter into the transaction ''voluntarily'' and in ''[[good faith]]''.  The settlement agreement must have total [[consideration]] that is at least equal to the [[fair market value]] of the property being conveyed.  Sometimes, the lender will not proceed with a deed in lieu of foreclosure if the outstanding indebtedness of the borrower exceeds the current fair value of the property; in other cases, a lender will agree since it will likely end up with the property anyway through the costly foreclosure process.

Because of the requirement that the instrument be voluntary, lenders will often not act upon a deed in lieu of foreclosure unless they receive a written offer of such a conveyance from the borrower that specifically states that the offer to enter into negotiations is being made voluntarily.  This will enact the [[parol evidence rule]] and protect the lender from a possible subsequent claim that the lender acted in [[bad faith]] or pressured the borrower into the settlement.  Both sides may then proceed with settlement negotiation.
The [[Home Equity Theft Prevention Act]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] has created some confusion regarding this frequently-used method of settlement.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} It is unclear whether HETPA applies to deeds in lieu of foreclosure since there is no clear exclusion as there is for a referee's deed, for example. The 2-year right of rescission is not a risk that banks or title insurers are comfortable with, especially given the complexities of compliance, so many banks and title insurers in New York are not willing to work with deeds in lieu.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Don Curtis''' (born '''Donald Beitelman''') (May 22, 1927 ‚Äì March 6, 2008) was an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], best known for being a member of a [[tag team]] with [[Mark Lewin]] in the 1950s and 1960s. During his partnership with Lewin, they won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Florida version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]]. Curtis was a [[promoted|wrestling promoter]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] until 1981. 

==Professional wrestling career==
Beitelman decided to become a professional wrestler in 1951, after working out with [[Lou Thesz]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; During his early career, he worked in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, appearing as "Don Curtis."&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

In 1958 promoter [[Eddie Graham]] teamed Curtis with Mark Lewin.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;  Curtis and Lewin held the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Northeast version)]] twice in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Note:They were the first holders of the championship, defeating [[Hans Schmidt (wrestler)|Hans Schmidt]] and [[Dick the Bruiser]]&lt;/ref&gt; trading it with Graham and his "brother" [[Dr. Jerry Graham|Jerry]].&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

Curtis teamed up with Graham in May 1960 to win the [[NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Florida version)]]. He held the title with [[Chief Jay Strongbow|Joe Scarpa]] in October 1962; [[Bob Ellis]] in March 1964; and [[Jose Lothario]] in March 1967.

In 1962, Curtis moved to Florida&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; and teamed with Joe Scarpa to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship (Florida version) from [[Kurt Von Brauner|Kurt]] and [[Karl Von Brauner]].&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; In January 1963, he won the title with Lewin from [[The Fabulous Kangaroos]] ([[Al Costello]] and [[Roy Heffernan]]).&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; After vacating the title, Curtis and Lewin regained it in December from the Assassins.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Lewin left the team the following month, and the title was once again vacated.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; In May 1964, Curtis teamed with [[Abe Jacobs]] to hold the title for the last time.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; In [[Jacksonville, Florida]], Curtis promoted shows and managed the coliseum.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Curtis attended the [[University at Buffalo]], where he played football and was an amateur wrestler.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; He was the wrestling team captain during 1949 and 1950.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

After retiring from professional wrestling, Curtis worked in real estate as well as managing the Jacksonville Coliseum.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; In 1980, he was inducted into the University of Buffalo Athletic Hall of Fame for wrestling and [[American football|football]].&lt;ref name=owow&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/d/don-curtis.html| title=Don Curtis| publisher=Online World of Wrestling| accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 26, 2008, Curtis suffered a "massive [[stroke]]", and his wife, Dotty, released a statement that it was "due to a [[blood clot]] breaking loose and hitting the left side of his brain." He was admitted into the [[Mayo Clinic]] Hospice facility that day, and died on March 6, 2008 at the age of 80.&lt;ref name=owow/&gt; In 2009, Curtis was posthumously inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]] along with Mark Lewin (under the "Tag Team" category).&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt;

'''''Drymiotis v Du Toit'''''&lt;ref&gt;1969 (1) SA 631 (T).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in the [[South African law of lease]], heard on September 3, 1968. The applicant's attorneys were Schwartz &amp; Goldblatt; the respondent's were Vermaas &amp; Kie. HJ Preiss appeared for the applicant; JJ Strydom appeared for the respondent.

== Facts ==
A contract was entered into between Simon Drymiotis and Johannes Frederick du Toit to enable the latter, for a fixed period, to produce and deliver [[andalusite]] at the Pietersburg Railway Station in bags, from two farms, these being the property of Drymiotis. The contract provided as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The andalusite produced will be priced at R20 per ton delivered in the truck at the station in bags, being production costs. It is further agreed that the purchasing company be approached to pay to the said producing contractor, the respondent, R20 per ton on his share of the andalusite and the balance to be paid to the owner of the mineral (the applicant). Provided that the sale price is R30 or more F.O.B. per ton, minimum to be R30 per ton.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Argument ==
In an application for the ejectment of the respondent from the land, Drymiotis contended that the contract was void, as it had not been notarially executed in terms of section 3(1) of the General Law Amendment Act.&lt;ref&gt;50 of 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgment ==
The court, after reserving judgment, held that the "contract" was essentially a "lease of rights to minerals in land" in terms of the section. Accordingly the contract was void for want of notarial attestation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2234">'''''Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru''''' (''The [[University of Wales]] Dictionary'') is the standard [[historical dictionary]] of the [[Welsh language]], aspiring to be "comparable in method and scope to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''".  Vocabulary is defined in Welsh, and English equivalents are given. Detailed attention is given to variant forms, collocations, and etymology.&lt;ref name=GPC&gt;[http://www.welsh-dictionary.ac.uk/ GPC official website (in English)] 2014, accessed 21 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was published in four volumes between 1967 and 2002, containing 7.3 million words of text in 3,949 pages, documenting 105,000 [[headword]]s. There are almost 350,000 dated citations, from the seventh century to 2002, with 320,000 Welsh [[definition]]s and 290,000 English [[synonym]]s.

==History==
In 1921, a small team at the [[National Library of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]], organised by the Rev. J. Bodvan Anwyl, arranged for volunteer readers to record words. The task of editing the dictionary was undertaken by [[R. J. Thomas (academic)|R. J. Thomas]] in the 1948/49 academic year.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

The first edition of Volume I appeared in 1967, followed by Volume II in 1987, Volume III in 1998, and Volume IV, edited by Gareth A. Bevan and P. J. Donovan, in December 2002. Work then immediately began on a second edition. 

In January 2008 Andrew Hawke was appointed as managing editor, following the retirement of the previous co-editors.

On 26 June 2014 a free online version of the dictionary was launched and on 24 February 2016 free apps for iOS and Android were launched.&lt;ref name=GPC/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2485">The '''German mines at Caldbeck''' were part of the operations of the [[Society of Mines Royal|Company of Mines Royal]] in [[Caldbeck]], which introduced German miners from modern day [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] into the [[Lake District]] in 1563, though earlier works in the area are thought to have been begun in the 1300s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rock-site.co.uk/cms.php?id_cms=18 |title=Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria, England |last= |first= |date= |website=Steetley Minerals |publisher=Peter Briscoe |access-date=4 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/Lasting-German-links-with-mines-of-Keswick-and-Coniston-0068ba05-283a-44cc-ac5e-cff3e29a5a3b-ds |title=Lasting German links with mines of Keswick and Coniston|last=Crosby |first=Alan |date= 10 March 2016 |website=The Mail |publisher= CN Group |access-date= 4 December 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the operation lies in its historical significance as the first large-scale [[copper mining]] and smelting operation in the British Islands which was well-documented. New smelting techniques were introduced which were allowed the treatment of [[argentiferous]] [[copper sulphide]] ores and the more complex lead-copper-silver ores from Caldbeck.

Mining started at Caldbeck in June 1566 but was soon discontinued and was not resumed until 1568, when work continued under the supervision of the [[Hochstetter]] family until around 1630, and then was not resumed until around 1695. The identity of the principal copper mines near [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] and [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] has long been known, but the locations of the Caldbeck mines have not. The lead-copper mines at [[Roughtengill]] have been considered to be the most probable candidates. However, recent fieldwork combined with records from archives has allowed identification of the principal mines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-2055-1/dissemination/pdf/Article_Level_Pdf/tcwaas/003/2001/vol1/tcwaas_003_2001_vol1_0011.pdf The lost German mines at Caldbeck], by Richard Smith, Samuel Murphy and Warren Allison, Archaeology Data Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''His''' or '''Her Majesty's Ship''', abbreviated '''HMS''', is the [[ship prefix]] used for ships of the navy in some monarchies. Derived terms such as "HMAS" and equivalents in other languages such as "SMS" are used.

==United Kingdom==
In the British [[Royal Navy]], the prefix was originally always quoted in full; the first recorded use of the abbreviated form, "HMS", occurred in 1789 in respect of [[HMS Phoenix (1783)|HMS ''Phoenix'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_sailfaq.htm |title= Frequently Asked Questions of the Sailing Navy Gallery |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= www.royalnavalmuseum.org |publisher= National Museum of the Royal Navy |accessdate= 18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2018}} Formerly,{{when?|date=October 2018}} '''HBMS''' (for '''His''' or '''Her Britannic Majesty's Ship''') was also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq63-1.htm |title= Ship Naming in the United States Navy |work= Frequently Asked Questions |publisher= Naval History and Heritage Command |accessdate= 2012-08-04 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150103224426/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq63-1.htm |archivedate= 2015-01-03 |df= |quote= Some, but apparently not all, other navies also use prefixes with their ships' names. Perhaps the best known of these is 'HMS' (His or Her Majesty's Ship), long used by the Royal Navy. In earlier times this was also seen as 'HBMS,' for 'His Britannic Majesty's Ship.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Submarines in Her Majesty's service also use the prefix "HMS", standing for "Her Majesty's Submarine". The [[Royal Yacht Britannia|Royal Yacht ''Britannia'']], which was a commissioned ship in the Royal Navy, was known as HMY ''Britannia''. Otherwise all ships in the Royal Navy are known as HM Ships, though formerly when a distinction was made between three-masted ship-rigged ships and smaller vessels they would be called HM Frigate ''X'', or HM Sloop ''Y''.

The prefix "HMS" is also used by shore establishments that are commissioned "[[stone frigate]]s" in the Royal Navy. Examples include [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], a training school located on an island in [[Portsmouth Harbour]], and [[Dounreay#Vulcan_NRTE|HMS ''Vulcan'']], in [[Caithness]] in the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] area of [[Scotland]], which is established to test the design of [[nuclear power]] systems for use in submarines.

The sample ship name used by the [[Royal Navy]] to signify a hypothetical vessel is {{HMS|Nonsuch}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/static/pages/3190.html |title= Royal Navy |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060206211827/https://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/static/pages/3190.html |archivedate= February 6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''is'' a name that has been used by the [[Royal Navy]] in the past; on the eve of [[World War II]] the name was given{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. {{As of | 2012}} [[Her Majesty's Canadian Ship|HMCS]] ''Nonsuch'' was the "stone frigate" of the Edmonton Division of the [[Canadian Naval Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/navres/nearestUnit_uniteLaPlusPres/hmcs_ncsm_NONSUCH/noh-unitPortal_portailUnite-eng.asp |title= HMCS Nonsuch |accessdate= 2012-08-04 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130630044740/http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/navres/nearestUnit_uniteLaPlusPres/hmcs_ncsm_NONSUCH/noh-unitPortal_portailUnite-eng.asp |archivedate= 2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefixing the name by "the", as in "the HMS Ark Royal", while common, is considered bad grammar.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

British government ships not in the Royal Navy have other designations, such as "RFA" for ships in the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]].

==Commonwealth realms and former British Empire==
Historically, variants on "HMS" have been used by the navies of British colonies. The practice is maintained in several [[Commonwealth realm]]s (states which recognise [[Queen Elizabeth II]] as their head of state).

==Germany==
'''{{lang|de|Seiner Majest√§t Schiff}}''' ({{IPA-de|Ààza…™ÃØn…ê maj…õsÀàt…õÀêt  É…™f|pron}}; [[German language|German]]: "His Majesty's Ship", abbreviated to '''S.M.S.''' or '''SMS''') was the [[ship prefix]] used by the Prussian [[merchant navy|Maritime Enterprise]] (''Seehandlung''), the [[Prussian Navy]], the [[Imperial German Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine'') and the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. It was created by translating the British prefix into German.

It was sometimes also abbreviated to  '''S.M.''' or '''SM''' (for ''Seiner Majest√§t'') when a ship was mentioned by class, such as ''S.M. Kleiner Kreuzer Emden'' ("His Majesty's Light Cruiser Emden").

Special forms included
*S.M.Y. (or SMY) = ''Seiner Majest√§t Yacht'' ("His Majesty's Yacht") for king's or emperor's [[yacht]]
*I.M.Y. = ''Ihrer Majest√§t Yacht'' ("Her Majesty's Yacht") for the queen's or empress' yacht.
*S.M.F. = ''Seiner Majest√§t Feuerschiff'' ("His Majesty's [[Lightvessel]]")
*S.M.H. = ''Seiner Majest√§t Hilfsschiff'' ("His Majesty's [[auxiliary ship|Auxiliary Ship]]")
*S.M.W. = ''Seiner Majest√§t Werkstattschiff'' ("His Majesty's Workshop Ship")
*S.M.U. = ''Seiner Majest√§t Unterseeboot'' ("His Majesty's Submarine", prefixing a number not a name)

==Sweden==
In the [[Swedish Navy]] (formerly the Royal Swedish Navy), all vessels are given the prefix ''HMS'' ('''Hans''' or '''Hennes Majest√§ts Skepp'''). This is true for both surface and submarine vessels.&lt;ref name=forsvarsmakten&gt;[http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/Ordbok/?l=H Ordbok: "H"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812094737/http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/ordbok/?l=h |date=2011-08-12 }} ''F√∂rsvarsmakten'' {{Swe icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abroad, Swedish navy ships are sometimes given the prefix ''HSwMS'' (for ''His Swedish Majesty's Ship''), to avoid confusion with other uses of the HMS prefix.&lt;ref name=forsvarsmakten /&gt;

[[File:1913FebBrittanica.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Advertisement for ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', 1913]]

The ''[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]]'' has been published continuously since 1768, appearing in fifteen official editions. Several editions have been amended with multi-volume "supplements" (3rd, 5th/6th), consisted of previous editions with added supplements (10th, and 12th/13th) or undergone drastic re-organizations (15th). In recent years, digital versions of the ''Britannica'' have been developed, both online and on [[optical media]]. Since the early 1930s, the ''Britannica'' has developed several "spin-off" products to leverage its reputation as a reliable reference work and educational tool.

==Historical context==
{{See also|Encyclopedia|List of encyclopedias}}
{{refimprove|date=June 2016}}
Encyclopedias of various types had been published since antiquity, beginning with the collected works of [[Aristotle]] and the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], the latter having 2493 articles in 37 books. Encyclopedias were published in Europe and China throughout the [[Middle Ages]], such as the ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Martianus Minneus Felix Capella]] (early 5th century), the ''Speculum majus'' (''Great Mirror'') of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] (1250), and ''Encyclopedia septem tomis distincta'' (''A Seven-Part Encyclopedia'') by [[Johann Heinrich Alsted]] (1630). Most early encyclopedias did not include biographies of living people and were written in [[Latin]], although some encyclopedias were translated into English, such as ''De proprietatibus rerum (On the properties of things)'' (1240) by [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]]. However, English-composed encyclopedias appeared in the 18th century, beginning with ''Lexicon technicum, or A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences'' by [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] (two volumes, published 1704 and 1710, respectively), which contained articles by such contributors as [[Isaac Newton]]. [[Ephraim Chambers]] wrote a very popular two-volume ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopedia]]'' in 1728, which went through multiple editions and awakened publishers to the enormous profit potential of encyclopedias. Although not all encyclopedias succeeded commercially, their elements sometimes inspired future encyclopedias; for example, the failed two-volume ''A Universal History of Arts and Sciences'' of [[Dennis de Coetlogon]] (published 1745) grouped its topics into long self-contained treatises, an organization that likely inspired the "new plan" of the ''Britannica''. The first encyclopedia to include biographies of living people was the 64-volume ''[[Grosses Universal-Lexicon]]'' (published 1732‚Äì1759) of [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]], who argued that death alone should not render people notable.

==Earliest editions (1st‚Äì6th, 1768‚Äì1824)==
===First edition, 1771===
{{Main article|Encyclop√¶dia Britannica First Edition}}
[[Image:Britannica 1. baskƒ±.JPG|220px|thumb|right|[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica First Edition|First edition]] replica.]]
[[File:Britannica 1st ed.jpg|thumb|Title page from the first edition]]
[[File:Britannica 1st ed. page.jpg|thumb|right|A page from the first edition. The flow of short entries is interrupted here by one of the major treatises.]]

The ''Britannica'' was the idea of [[Colin Macfarquhar]], a bookseller and printer, and [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], an engraver, both of [[Edinburgh]]. They conceived of the ''Britannica'' as a conservative reaction to the French ''[[Encyclop√©die]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] (published 1751‚Äì1766), which was widely viewed as heretical. Ironically, the ''Encyclop√©die'' had begun as a French translation of the popular English encyclopedia, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' published by [[Ephraim Chambers]] in 1728. Although later editions of Chambers' ''Cyclopaedia'' were still popular, and despite the commercial failure of other English encyclopedias, Macfarquhar and Bell were inspired by the intellectual ferment of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and thought the time ripe for a new encyclopedia "compiled upon a new plan".

Needing an editor, the two chose a 28-year-old scholar named [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]] who was offered 200 [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] to produce the encyclopedia in 100 parts (called "numbers" and equivalent to thick pamphlets), which were later bound into three volumes. The first number appeared on 6 December 1768 in Edinburgh, priced [[British sixpence coin|sixpence]] or 8 [[pence]] on finer paper. The ''Britannica'' was published under the [[pseudonym]] "A Society of Gentlemen in Scotland", possibly referring to the many gentlemen who had bought subscriptions.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; By releasing the numbers in weekly instalments, the ''Britannica'' was completed in 1771, having 2,391 pages. The numbers were bound in three equally sized volumes covering A‚ÄìB, C‚ÄìL, and M‚ÄìZ; an estimated 3,000 sets were eventually sold, priced at 12&amp;nbsp;pounds sterling apiece.&lt;ref name="Britannica History"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica First Edition|The 1st edition]] also featured 160 copperplate illustrations engraved by Bell. Three of the engravings in the section on midwifery, depicting childbirth in clinical detail, were sufficiently shocking to prompt some readers to tear those engravings out of the volume.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

The key idea that set the ''Britannica'' apart was to group related topics together into longer essays, that were then organized alphabetically. Previous English encyclopedias had generally listed related terms separately in their alphabetical order, rather like a modern technical dictionary, an approach that the ''Britannica's''' management derided as "dismembering the sciences".&lt;ref name="online encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/EMS_EUD/ENCYCLOPAEDIA.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although anticipated by [[Dennis de Coetlogon]], the idea for this "new plan" is generally ascribed to [[Colin Macfarquhar]], although [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]] claimed it as his own invention.

Smellie wrote most of the first edition, borrowing liberally from the authors of his era, including [[Voltaire]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Pope]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. He later said:&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

{{quote|I wrote most of it, my lad, and snipped out from books enough material for the printer. With pastepot and scissors I composed it!|[[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]|at a meeting of the [[Crochallan Fencibles]]}}

The vivid prose and easy navigation of the first edition led to strong demand for a second. Although this edition has been faulted for its imperfect scholarship, Smellie argued that the ''Britannica'' should be given the benefit of the doubt:

{{quote|With regard to errors in general, whether falling under the denomination of mental, typographical or accidental, we are conscious of being able to point out a greater number than any critic whatever. Men who are acquainted with the innumerable difficulties of attending the execution of a work of such an extensive nature will make proper allowances. To these we appeal, and shall rest satisfied with the judgment they pronounce.|[[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]|in the Preface to the 1st edition of the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''}}

Smellie strove to make ''Britannica'' as usable as possible, saying that "utility ought to be the principal intention of every publication. Wherever this intention does not plainly appear, neither the books nor their authors have the smallest claim to the approbation of mankind".

The first edition was reprinted in [[London]], with slight variants on the title page and a different preface, by Edward and Charles Dilly in 1773 and by John Donaldson in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/186618/Encyclopaedia-Britannica |title=''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'' (English language reference work)&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of the [[Bicentennial of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|200th anniversary of the 1st edition]], [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc.]] published a facsimile of the 1st edition, even including "age spots" on the paper. This has been periodically reprinted and is still part of Britannica's product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1st edition reprint | publisher = Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc. | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-85229-066-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second edition, 1783, Supplement 1784===
{{Main article|Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Second Edition}}
[[File:2ndBritannica.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Second Edition|''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'' First and Second Editions]]]]

After the success of the first edition, a more ambitious [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Second Edition|second edition]] was begun in 1776, with the addition of history and biography articles.&lt;ref name="Trivia Library 1"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.trivia-library.com/b/history-of-the-encyclopedia-britannica-part-1.htm
| title = History of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Part 1

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smellie declined to be editor, principally because he objected to the addition of biography. Macfarquhar took over the role himself, aided by pharmacist [[James Tytler]], M.A.,&lt;ref&gt;The degree of M.A. is found after his name in the 11th edition of Britannica in the article Encyclopedia, vol. 9., p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; who was known as an able writer and willing to work for a very low wage.&lt;ref name="wells_1968"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wells | first = James M. | year = 1968 | title = The Circle of Knowledge: Encyclopaedias Past and Present | publisher = The Newberry Library | location = Chicago | id = Library of Congress catalog number 68-21708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macfarquhar and Bell rescued Tytler from the debtors' sanctuary at Holyrood Palace, and employed him for seven years at 17 shillings per week. Tytler wrote many science and history articles and almost all of the minor articles; by [[Robert Burns]]' estimate, Tytler wrote over three-quarters of the second edition.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kogan | first = Herman | year = 1958 | title = The Great EB: The Story of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | id = Library of Congress catalog number 58-8379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the 1st edition, the second had five times as many long articles (150), including "Scotland" (84 pages), "Optics" (132 pages), and "Medicine" (309 pages), which had their own indices. The second edition was published in 181 numbers from 21 June 1777 to 18 September 1784; these numbers were bound into ten volumes dated 1778‚Äì1783, having 8,595 pages and 340 plates again engraved by [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]].&lt;ref name="Britannica History"/&gt; A [[pagination]] error caused page 8000 to follow page 7099. Most of the maps of this edition (eighteen of them) are found in a single 195-page article, "[[Geography]]".

The second edition improved greatly upon the 1st, but is still notable for the large amount of now-archaic information it contained. For example, "Chemistry" goes into great detail on an obsolete system of what would now be called alchemy, in which earth, air, water and fire are named elements containing various amounts of [[phlogiston]]. Tytler also describes the architecture of [[Noah's Ark]] in detail (illustrated with a copperplate engraving) and, following [[James Ussher|Bishop Ussher]], includes a remarkably precise [[geochronology|chronology for the Earth]], beginning with its creation on 23 October 4004 B.C. and noting that the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]] of 2348 B.C. lasted for exactly 777 days. The 2nd edition also reports a cure for [[tuberculosis]]:

{{quote|He chose a spot of ground on which no plants had been sown, and there he made a hole large and deep enough to admit the patient up to the chin. The interstices of the pit were then carefully filled up with the fresh mould, so that the earth might everywhere come in contact with the patient's body. In this situation the patient suffered to remain till he began to shiver or felt himself uneasy...The patient was then taken out, and, after being wrapped in a linen cloth, was placed upon a mattress, and two hours afterwards his whole body was rubbed with the ointment composed of the leaves of the ''[[solanum nigrum]]'' and hog's lard.|[[James Tytler]]|in the 2nd edition of the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''}}

and a somewhat melancholy article on "[[Love]]" that persisted in the ''Britannica'' for nearly a century (until its 9th edition):

{{quote|As the force of love prevails, sighs grow deeper; a tremor affects the heart and pulse; the countenance is alternately pale and red; the voice is suppressed in the sauces; the eyes grow dim; cold sweats break out; sleep absents itself, at least until the morning; the secretions become disturbed; and a loss of appetite, a hectic fever, melancholy, or perhaps madness, if not death, constitutes the sad catastrophe.|[[James Tytler]]|in the 2nd‚Äì8th editions of the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''}}

Like the first edition, the second was sold in sections by subscription at the printing shop of [[Colin MacFarquhar]]. When finished in 1784, complete sets were sold at Charles Elliot's book shop in Edinburgh for 10 pounds, unbound. Over 1,500 copies of the second edition were sold this way by Elliot in less than one year,&lt;ref&gt;''The Great EB, the story of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', Herman Kogan, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; making the second edition enough of a financial success that a more ambitious third edition was begun a few years later.

The long period of time during which this edition was written makes the later volumes more updated than the earlier ones. Volume 10, published in 1783 after the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was over, gives in the entry for Virginia: "Virginia, late one of the British colonies, now one of the United States of North America..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/britannica.htm |title=Encyclopedia Britannica First 1st Second 2nd Third 3rd Fourth 4th Edition |publisher=Hyzercreek.com |date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the entry in Volume 2 for Boston, published in 1778, states, "Boston, the capital of New England in North America, ....The following is a description of this capital before the commencement of the present American war."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, second edition. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes of the [[American Revolution|Revolution]] are outlined concisely by Tytler in the article "Colonies" thus:

{{quote|Because several of the colonies had claimed the soul and exclusive right of imposing taxes upon themselves, the statute 6 Geo. III. c. 12 expressly declares, that all his Majesty's colonies in America, have been, are, and of right ought to be, subordinate to and dependent upon the imperial crown and parliament of Great Britain; who have full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient validity to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects to the crown of Great Britain in all cases whatsoever. And the attempting to enforce this by other acts of Parliament, penalties, and at last by military power, gave rise, as is well known, to the present revolt of our colonies.}}

A 204-page appendix, written in 1784, is found at the end of Vol. 10. It does not have its own title page, but merely follows with pagination continuing from 8996 to 9200. The appendix introduces articles on Entomology, Ichthyology, Weather, Hindus (spelled Gentoos), and others, and contains many new biographies, including one of Captain James Cook. It curiously contains 25 new pages on Air, which give very little new information about air itself, but mainly cover hot air ballooning, one of Tytler's hobbies. The first page of the supplement begins with the words "Appendix containing articles omitted and others further explained or improved, together with corrections of errors and of wrong references." The appendix also includes 10 plates, namely CCCXIV to CCCXXIII.

===Third edition, 1797===
{{Main article|Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Third Edition}}
[[File:3rdBritannica.JPG|thumb|right|240px|[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Third Edition|Third edition]] dated 1797]]
The third edition was published from 1788 to 1797 in 300 weekly numbers (1 shilling apiece); these numbers were collected and sold unbound in 30 parts (10 shilling, sixpence each), and finally in 1797 they were bound in 18 volumes with 14,579 pages and 542 plates, and given title pages dated 1797 for all volumes. [[Colin Macfarquhar|Macfarquhar]] again edited this edition up to "Mysteries" but died in 1793 (aged 48) of "mental exhaustion"; his work was taken over by [[George Gleig]], later Bishop Gleig of Brechin (consecrated 30 October 1808). [[James Tytler]] again contributed heavily to the authorship, up to the letter M.&lt;ref&gt;George Gleig in the foreword to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Third Edition, 1797, Vol.1, p. preface, Gleig lists authors of the 3rd edition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], Macfarquhar's partner, bought the rights to the ''Britannica'' from Macfarquhar's heirs.

Nearly doubling the scope of the 2nd edition, Macfarquhar's encyclopedic vision was finally realized. Recruited by Gleig, several illustrious authorities contributed to this edition, such as Dr. [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]], who introduced modern chemical nomenclature in a chart appended to the Chemistry article,&lt;ref&gt;Many authors cite Thomson's Chemistry article in the 3rd edition supplement, in error, as being the first printed usage of chemical symbols, but no chemical symbols were used is that article, nor in Millar's 4th edition article, reprinted in the 5th and 6th editions, nor even in the article in the 7th edition, written by the same Thomas Thomson 40 years later. In fact, chemical symbols did not appear in Britannia's Chemistry article until the 8th edition's, written by William Gregory. What Thomson did was introduce modern chemical nomenclature without symbols...oxide of tin, chloride of lime, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and would go on to re-write that article in the 1801 supplement (see below), and [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]], Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, who wrote several well-regarded articles on sciences then called [[natural philosophy]]. The third edition established the foundation of the ''Britannica'' as an important and definitive reference work for much of the next century. This edition was also enormously profitable, yielding 42,000&amp;nbsp;pounds sterling profit on the sale of roughly 10,000 copies. The 3rd edition began the tradition (continued to this day) of dedicating the ''Britannica'' to the reigning British monarch, then [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]; calling him "the Father of Your People, and enlightened Patron of Arts, Sciences and Literature", Gleig wished

{{quote|...that, by the Wisdom of Your Councils, and the Vigour of Your Fleets and Armies, Your MAJESTY may be enabled soon to restore Peace to Europe; that You may again have leisure to extend Your Royal Care to the Improvement of Arts, and the Advancement of Knowledge; that You May Reign long over a Free, Happy and a Loyal People...|[[George Gleig]]|in the Dedication of the 3rd edition of the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''}}

The [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Third Edition|3rd edition]] is also famous for its bold article on "Motion", which erroneously rejects [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of [[gravitation]]. Instead, Dr. Gleig, or more likely, [[James Tytler]], wrote that gravity is caused by the [[Fire (classical element)|classical element of fire]]. He seems to have been swayed by [[William Jones (1726‚Äì1800)|William Jones]]' ''Essay on the First Principles of Natural Philosophy'' (1762), which in turn was based on [[John Hutchinson (writer)|John Hutchinson's]] [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|MA thesis]], ''Moses' Principia'', which was written in 1724 but rejected by [[Oxford University]]. Nevertheless, Gleig was sanguine about the errors of the 3rd edition, echoing [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]'s sentiment in the 1st edition quoted above:

{{quote|For perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects.|[[George Gleig]]|in the 3rd edition of the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''}}

The first "American" encyclopedia, ''[[Dobson's Encyclop√¶dia]]'', was based almost entirely on the 3rd edition of the ''Britannica'' and published at nearly the same time (1788‚Äì1798), together with an analogous supplement (1803), by the Scottish-born printer, [[Thomas Dobson (printer)|Thomas Dobson]]. The first United States [[copyright]] law was passed on 30 May 1790‚Äîalthough anticipated by Section 8 of Article I of the [[United States Constitution]] (ratified 4 March 1789)‚Äîbut did not protect foreign publications such as the ''Britannica''. Unauthorized copying of the ''Britannica'' in America was also a problem with the 9th edition (1889). Unlicensed copies were also sold in Dublin by James Moore under the title, ''Moore's Dublin Edition, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''; this was an exact reproduction of the ''Britannica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 3rd edition.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; By contrast, Dobson's work had various corrections and amendments for American readers.

===Supplement to the third edition, 1801, 1803===
A two-volume supplement to the [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Third Edition|third edition]] was published in 1801, having 1,624 pages and 50 copperplates by D. Lizars. A revised edition was published in 1803. This supplement was published by a wine-merchant, [[Thomas Bonar]], the son-in-law of the ''Britannica's'' owner [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]]; unfortunately, the two men quarreled and they never spoke for the last ten years of Bell's life (1799‚Äì1809). Bonar was friendly to the article authors, however, and conceived the plan of paying them as well as the article reviewers, and of allowing them to retain copyright for separate publication of their work.

The ''Britannica'' explicitly positioned itself as a conservative publication in reaction to the radical French ''[[Encyclop√©die]]'' of [[Diderot]] published between 1751 and 1766.&lt;ref name="EB_encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Encyclopedias and Dictionaries | encyclopedia = Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 15th ed. | publisher = Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc. | year = 2007 | volume = 18 | pages = 257‚Äì286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the royal dedication penned on 10 December 1800, Dr. Gleig elaborated on the editorial purpose of the ''Britannica''

{{quote|The French Encyclop√©die had been accused, and justly accused, of having disseminated far and wide the seeds of anarchy and atheism. If the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica shall in any degree counteract the tendency of that pestiferous work, even these two volumes will not be wholly unworthy of your Majesty's attention.&lt;ref name="online encyclopedia"/&gt;|[[George Gleig]]|in the Dedication of the Supplement to the 3rd edition of the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''}}

===Fourth edition, 1810===
The fourth edition was begun in 1800 and completed in 1810, comprising 20 volumes with 16,033 pages and 581 plates engraved by [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]]. As with the 3rd edition, in which title pages were not printed until the set was complete, and all volumes were given title pages dated 1797, title pages for the 4th edition were sent to bookbinders in 1810, dated that year for all volumes. The editor was Dr. [[James Millar (scientist)|James Millar]], a physician, who was good at scientific topics but criticized for being "slow &amp; dilatory &amp; not well qualified". The mathematical articles of Prof. Wallace were widely praised in the 4th edition. Overall, the 4th edition was a mild expansion of the 3rd, from 18 to 20 volumes, and was updated in its historical, scientific, and biographical articles.

Some of the long articles were entirely re-written for the 4th edition. For example, the 56-page "Botany" of the 3rd edition was replaced in the 4th with a 270-page version by moving all the individual plant articles into one. Conversely, the 53-page "[[Metallurgy]]" of the 3rd was removed, and replaced by the note "see Gilding, Parting, Purifying, Refining, Smithery."  The article "Chemistry," which was 261 pages long in the 3rd, written by [[James Tytler]], and had been re-written in that edition's supplement as a 191-page treatise by [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]], appears in the 4th edition as an entirely new 358-page article, which, according to the preface to the 5th edition, was authored by Millar himself. The new treatise was necessary because the copyright to the supplement to the 3rd, which included Thomson's excellent treatise, was not owned by Britannica. (Thomson would much later author the article for the 7th edition). The article "Electricity", 125 pages in the 3rd edition, was completely re-written for the 4th edition and was 163 pages. By contrast, the 125-page "[[Metaphysics]]" of the 3rd was largely unchanged for the 4th, and the 306-page "Medicine" of the 3rd was only superficially edited in the 4th and of roughly equal length. (Medicine had been a similar 302 pages in the 2nd edition). The 79-page "Agriculture" of the 3rd was entirely and excellently re-written, and is 225 pages, for the 4th edition. Sixty pages of new information were added onto the end of "America," which grew to 138 pages, with an index and new maps. "[[Entomology]]" was expanded from 8 pages and one plate in the 3rd edition to 98 pages and 4 plates in the 4th, with a 3-page index. Human "Physiology" was entirely re-written, and went from 60 pages to 80, with an index. "Physics," on the other hand, is unchanged from the 3rd.

In addition, some long articles appear for the first time in the 4th edition. "Geology" is new, even though the word had been coined in 1735.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1991, under the word geology.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the 3rd edition's 30-page entry "Earth," as well as its 24-page article "Earthquake," and the geological sections of its article "[[Natural History]]", were dropped, as these topics are found in the 4th edition's newly written article, which is 78 pages long and has its own index. For other examples, the 4th edition has a 96-page article "[[Conchology]]", which listing does not appear in the 3rd or its supplement, and "[[Herpetology|Erpetology]]", 60 pages long in the 4th edition, with a 3-page index, is a new listing as well. After "Science" is a new 24-page article "Amusements In Science", which is a virtual [[Watch Mr. Wizard|Mr. Wizard]] for the opening of the 19th century.

The majority of copy in the 4th edition, however, is unchanged from the 3rd. Large blocks of text were carried over, line-by-line, unchanged in their typesetting, with some minor editing here and there. For example, the "Boston" article in the 3rd edition contains the sentence, "The following is a description of this capital before the commencement of the present American war." This line is exactly as it had appeared in the 2nd edition, which was written during the war. (The war had been over for years when the 3rd edition was published). In the 4th edition, the word "present" was replaced with "late," the rest of the article remaining entirely unchanged.

The copyright of the material in the supplement to the 3rd edition was held by [[Thomas Bonar]], who asked 20,000&amp;nbsp;pounds sterling for it, which Bell declined. The supplemental material was licensed for the fourth edition for 100&amp;nbsp;pounds, but this copyright issue remained a problem through the 6th edition and the material was not used. The supplements had to be purchased separately.

===Fifth edition, 1817===
[[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]] died in 1809, one year before the 4th edition was finished. In 1815, his heirs began producing the fifth edition but sold it to [[Archibald Constable]], who finished it; Dr. Millar was again the editor. Completed in 1817, the fifth edition sold for 36&amp;nbsp;pounds sterling (''2011: ¬£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|36|1817|2011|r=-2}}}}'') and consisted of 20 volumes with 16,017 pages and 582 plates. In 1816, Bell's trustees sold the rights to the ''Britannica'' for 14,000&amp;nbsp;pounds to Archibald Constable, an apprentice bookseller, who had been involved in its publication from 1788. To secure the copyrights for the 3rd edition supplement, Constable gave Bonar a one-third stake in the ''Britannica''; after Bonar's death in 1814, Constable bought his rights to the ''Britannica'' for 4,500&amp;nbsp;pounds sterling.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

[[File:4th5th.jpg|thumb|Comparing the 4th edition (left) to the 5th. In lines 4 and 16 of the second paragraph, the word iron was corrected with the word zinc.]] The fifth edition was a corrected reprint of the fourth; there is virtually no change in the text. The errata are listed at the end of each volume of the 4th edition, and corrected in the 5th, but the number of errata is small and in some volumes there are none. The plates and plate numbers are all the same, but with the name A. Bell replaced with W. Archibald or other names on all plates, including the maps. Some of the plates have very minor revisions, but they are all basically Bell's work from the 4th or earlier editions, and these new names were probably added for business reasons involving copyright royalties. W. Archibald was probably Constable himself.

Being a reprint of the 4th, set in the same type, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica's 5th edition was one of the last publications in the English language to use the [[long s]] in print. The long s started being phased out of English publications shortly after the turn of the 19th century, and by 1817 it was archaic. The Supplement To The Fifth edition, (see below), as well as the 6th edition, used a modern font with a short s.

While the 6th volume of the 5th edition was being printed, Constable became owner of Britannica, as well as Bonar's 3rd edition supplements.&lt;ref&gt;"Preface to the 5th edition, 1817" page. ix.  Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 6th edition, 1823, printed for Archibald Constable and Company, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal disputes over the copyright of the 3rd edition supplements continued, however, and for this reason a new supplement was written by Constable's company, which was completed in 1824.

===Supplement to the fifth edition, 1824 (later known as the supplement to the fourth, fifth and sixth editions)===
After securing sole-ownership rights in December 1816, Constable began work on a supplement to the 5th edition, even before the fifth edition had been released (1817). The supplement was completed in April 1824, consisting of 6 volumes with 4933 pages, 125 plates, 9 maps, 3 "dissertations" and 160 biographies, mainly of people who had died within the preceding 30 years.

This supplement contained a rudimentary form of an index, listing the 669 articles in alphabetical order at the end of volume six, by volume but not page number, but it did not contain any sort of cross referencing. The index was called "Table of the Articles and Treatises Contained in This Work" and was 9 pages long. It was nothing to be compared to a typical encyclopedia index, such as the ones found at the end of the seventh and further editions of Britannica.

This supplement had remarkably illustrious contributors. Constable was friends with Sir [[Walter Scott]], who contributed the "Chivalry" article. To edit the supplement, Constable hired [[Macvey Napier]], who recruited other eminent contributors such as Sir [[Humphry Davy]], [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[William Hazlitt]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[Thomas Malthus]]. [[Peter Mark Roget]], compiler of the famous [[Roget's Thesaurus]] and a former secretary of the [[Royal Society]], contributed the entry for [[physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Encyclopaedia-Britannica-English-language-reference-work/Supplement-to-the-fourth-fifth-and-sixth-editions|title=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions {{!}} English language reference work|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young's]] article on [[Egypt]] included the translation of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] on the [[Rosetta Stone]].&lt;ref name="Britannica History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The supplement was compiled, for the first five volumes, at a pace which would have given it more than the 6 volumes it eventually would consist of; the alphabet from A-M was put into those five. It was apparently rushed to completion with volume 6, which contained the rest of the alphabet, viz:

*Vol. I: A‚ÄìATW, 648 pages.
*Vol. II: AUS‚ÄìCEY, 680 pages.
*Vol. III: CHE‚ÄìECO, 726 pages.
*Vol. IV: EDI‚ÄìHOR, 708 pages.
*Vol. V: HUN‚ÄìMOL, 586 pages.
*Vol. VI: NAI‚ÄìZ, 863 pages.

===Sixth edition, 1823===
[[File:5th6thEdition.jpeg|thumb|Comparing the 5th edition, top, with the 6th. The only change was the typeface, which included the removal of the [[long s]] from the font.]]
Constable also produced the sixth edition, which was completed in May, 1823. It was published in 40 half-volume parts, priced 16 shillings in boards (32 pounds for the set). The editor was [[Charles Maclaren]]. The 6th edition was a reprint of the 5th with a modern typeface. It even used the preface to the 5th edition, dated December 1, 1817, as its own. Only the short page, "Advertisement To The Sixth Edition", which was bound in volume 1 after the forward and dated January, 1822, set it apart. In that advertisement, it is claimed that some geographical articles would be updated, and that the articles in the supplement to the 3rd edition would be inserted into the encyclopedia in their proper alphabetical places. Although the advertisement claimed that these articles would be included in this manner, they were not, and the author of the preface to the 7th edition states that none of this material entered the main body until that edition, and even gives a list of the articles which were.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 7th edition, preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NYC 5th6th.jpeg|thumb|left|Comparing the 5th edition to the 6th, showing one of the geographical updates. The population of New York City was increasing rapidly, and that figure needed to be revised.]]Almost no changes were made to the text, it was basically a remake of the 5th with very minor updates. All in all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions are virtually the same as each other. Rather than revising the main text of the encyclopedia with each edition, Constable chose to add all updates to the supplement. It's probable that the 6th edition only exists because of the need to remove the [[long s]], which had gone out of style, from the font, which required the whole encyclopedia to be re-typeset.

The Supplement to the 5th edition was finished in 1824, and was sold with those sets, as well as with sets of the 6th edition, to be delivered at its completion. This supplement curiously was started during the production of the 5th edition but was not finished until after the 6th was completed. It also was sold as a unit for owners of the 4th edition, and became known as "Supplement to the 4th, 5th and 6th edition."

Unfortunately, Constable went bankrupt on 19 January 1826 and the rights to the ''Britannica'' were sold on auction; they were eventually bought on 16 July 1828 for 6150 [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] by a partnership of four men: [[Adam Black]] (a publisher), Alexander Wight (a banker), Abram Thomson (a bookbinder) and Thomas Allen, the proprietor of the ''[[Caledonian Mercury]]''. Not long after, Black bought out his partners and ownership of the ''Britannica'' passed to the Edinburgh publishing firm of [[A &amp; C Black]].&lt;ref name="Trivia Library 1"/&gt;

Britannica by the 6th edition was in some regards hopelessly out of date. The supplement to the 3rd edition contained updates which were not included in it, and which had become dated themselves anyway, the 4th edition expanded the text somewhat but revised very little, and the 5th and 6th were just reprints of the 4th. The supplement to the 4th/5th/6th edition addressed the issue of updates in a clumsy way, often referring back to the encyclopedia, essentially making the reader look everything up twice. What was needed was a completely new edition from the ground up. This was to be accomplished with the magnificent 7th edition.

==A. and C. Black editions (7th‚Äì9th, 1827‚Äì1901)==
===Seventh edition, 1842===
[[File:Rosetta Stone.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Early 19th-century editions of ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'' included seminal works such as [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young's]] article on [[Egypt]], which included the translation of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] on the [[Rosetta Stone]].]]
[[File:Marbled Paper.jpeg|thumb|right|Endpaper from the 7th edition]]
The 7th edition was begun in 1827 and published from March 1830 to January 1842, although all volumes have title pages dated 1842. It was a new work, not a revision of earlier editions, although some articles from earlier editions and supplements are used. It was sold to subscribers in monthly "parts" of around 133 pages each, at 6 shilling per part, with 6 parts combined into 800 page volumes for 36 shillings. The promise was made in the beginning that there would be 20 volumes, making the total ¬£36 for the set. Volume 1 was only 5 parts, entirely made up of dissertations. Volume 2, in 6 parts, was the beginning of alphabetical listings. The 12th part, another dissertation, was ready in 1831, and would have been the first part of volume 3, but the publishers put it into a separate volume at 12 shillings. In total the subscribers wound up paying for 127 parts (¬£38, two shillings).

It was edited by [[Macvey Napier]], who was assisted by [[James Browne (writer)|James Browne]], LLD. It consisted of 21 numbered volumes with 17,101 pages and 506 plates. It was the first edition to include a general index for all articles, a practice that was maintained until 1974. The index was 187 pages, and was either bound alone as an unnumbered thin volume, or was bound together with volume I. Many illustrious contributors were recruited to this edition, including Sir [[David Brewster]], [[Thomas de Quincey]], [[Antonio Panizzi]] and [[Robert Stephenson]]. [[James Wilson]] did all of Zoology, Dr. Hampden did all of Greek philosophy, and [[William Hosking]] contributed the excellent article Architecture. [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]], who wrote Chemistry for the 3rd edition supplement 40 years earlier, was recruited to write that article again for the 7th edition. Mathematical diagrams and illustrations were made from woodcuts, and for the first time in Britannica's history, were printed on the same pages as the text, in addition to the copperplates.

The 7th edition, when complete, went on sale for ¬£24 per set. However, Adam Black had invested over ¬£108,766 in its production: ¬£5,354 for advertising, ¬£8,755 for editing, ¬£13,887 for 167 contributors, ¬£13,159 for plates, ¬£29,279 for paper, and ¬£19,813 for the printing.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; In the end, roughly 5,000 sets were sold but Black considered himself well-rewarded in intellectual prestige.

Title pages for all volumes were printed in 1842 and delivered with the completed set. An index to the entire set was created that year as well, and was the first of its kind for Britannica. Being only 187 pages long, it did not warrant its own volume, and was sent to bookbinders with instructions to include it at the beginning of volume 1, the dissertations volume, which had been printed in 1829. This same arrangement would also be used for the 8th edition, but not the 9th.

===Eighth edition, 1860===
[[File:8thEditionAdvert.jpeg|150px|thumb|right|1858 advertisement for then-available volumes 1 through 19 of the 8th edition, cloth-bound at 24 shillings per volume]]The 8th edition was published from 1853 to 1860, with title pages for each volume dated the year that volume was printed. It contained 21 numbered volumes, with 17,957 pages and 402 plates. The index, published in 1861, was 239 pages, and was either bound alone as an unnumbered 22nd volume, or was bound together with volume I, the dissertations volume. Four of these dissertations were carried over from the 7th edition, and two were new to the 8th. The five included in volume 1 of the 8th (1853) were authored by Dugald Stewart, James Mackintosh, Richard Whately, John Playfair, and John Leslie, in that order, with the Whately work being a new one. A sixth dissertation, by J.D. Forbes, was issued in 1856, in a separate quarto volume, "gratis, along with Vol. XII".

The alphabetical encyclopedia began at the beginning of volume 2. The price was reduced to 24 shillings per volume, cloth-bound. In addition to the Edinburgh sets, more sets were authorized by Britannica to the London publishers Simpkin, Marshall and Company,&lt;ref&gt;see image to the right&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Little, Brown and Company]] of Boston.

Since [[Macvey Napier]] died in 1847, Adam Black selected for its editor Dr. [[Thomas Stewart Traill]], a professor of medical jurisprudence at Edinburgh University. When Dr. Traill fell ill, he was assisted by a young Scottish philosopher, John Downes. Black was able to hold costs to roughly ¬£75,655. This edition began the tradition of a contributors' banquet to celebrate the edition's completion (5 June 1861).&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

The Eighth edition is a thorough revision, even more so than the Seventh. Some long articles were carried over from the 7th edition, but most were completely re-written, and new articles by illustrious contributors were added. In all, there were 344 contributors, including [[Lord Macaulay]], [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], the Rev. [[Charles Merivale]], Dr. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], Baron [[Robert Bunsen]], Sir [[John Herschel]], Professors [[Richard Owen]], [[John Stuart Blackie]] and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin). [[Photography]] is listed for the first time. This edition also featured the first American contributor to the ''Britannica'', [[Edward Everett]], who wrote a 40,000-word hagiographic biography of [[George Washington]]&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

{{quote|In being a living proof that pure patriotism is not a delusion, or virtue an empty name, no one of the sons of man has equalled George Washington.|[[Edward Everett]]|in the eighth edition of the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''}}

The consequences of reducing the costs of production of the 8th edition can be seen today in surviving sets. With only 402 plates, this edition has the fewest since the second edition, and far fewer woodcuts within the text pages were used than in the 7th edition. The maps are all reprinted from the 7th edition, even the ones that should have been updated. In the first few volumes, a sheet of onion-skin paper faces each plate, but after volume 6, they were eliminated. To save money, the end pages and covers were not marbled, as this was an expensive process. Finally, the end pages contain advertisements for other products sold by A &amp; C. Black, such as atlases and travel guides, and advertisements encouraging subscribers to continue their enrollments.

===Ninth edition, 1889&lt;!--linked from redirect "Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Ninth Edition"--&gt;===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
{{original research|section|date=April 2016}}

The landmark ninth edition, often called "the Scholar's Edition",&lt;ref name="Britannica History"/&gt; was published from January 1875 to 1889 in 25 volumes, with volume 25 the index volume. Unlike the first two Black editions, there were no preliminary dissertations, the alphabetical listing beginning in volume 1. Up to 1880, the editor, and author of the Foreword, was [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]]‚Äîthe first English-born editor after a series of Scots‚Äîand [[W. Robertson Smith]] afterwards. An intellectual prodigy who mastered advanced scientific and mathematical topics, Smith was a professor of theology at the Free Church College in Edinburgh, and was the first contributor to the ''Britannica'' who addressed the historical interpretation of the [[Bible]], a topic then already familiar on the Continent of Europe. Dr. Smith contributed several articles to the 9th edition, but lost his teaching position on 24 May 1881, due to the controversy his (ir)religious articles aroused; he was immediately hired to be joint editor-in-chief with Baynes.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

The 9th and 11th editions are often lauded as high points for scholarship; the 9th included yet another series of illustrious contributors such as [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[William Michael Rossetti]]. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], then 25, contributed an article about [[Robert Burns]] that, being unenthusiastic, was never printed.&lt;ref name="wells_1968" /&gt; There were roughly 1100 contributors altogether,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopediabrit25newyrich#page/483/mode/1up |volume=25 |chapter=List of contributors |title=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica |location=New York |edition=9th |year=1889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a handful of whom were women; this edition was also the first to include a significant article about women ("Women, Law Relating to"). Evolution was listed for the first time, in the wake of [[Charles Darwin]]'s writings, but the subject was treated as if still controversial, and a complete working of the subject would have to wait for the 11th edition. The 8th edition has no listing for the subject at all.

Compared to the 8th edition, the 9th was far more luxurious, with thick boards and high-quality leather bindings, premier paper, and a production which took full advantage of the technological advances in printing in the years between the 1850s and 1870s. Great use was made of the new ability to print large graphic illustrations on the same pages as the text, as opposed to limiting illustrations to separate copperplates. Although this technology had first been used in a primitive fashion the 7th edition, and to a much lesser extent in the 8th, in the 9th edition there were thousands of quality illustrations set into the text pages, in addition to the plates. The 9th edition was a critical success, and roughly 8,500 sets were sold in Britain. [[A &amp; C Black]] authorized the American firms of [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] of New York, [[Little, Brown and Company]] of Boston, and Samuel L. Hall of New York, to print, bind and distribute additional sets in the United States, and provided them with stereotype plates for text and graphics, specifications on the color and tanning quality of the leather bindings, etc., so the American-produced sets would be identical to the Edinburgh sets except for the title pages, and that they would be of the same high quality as the Edinburgh sets. Scribner's volumes and Hall volumes were often mixed together in sets by N.Y. distributors and sold this way as they were interchangeable, and such sets are still found this way. A total of 45,000 authorized sets were produced this way for the US market.&lt;ref name="wells_1968" /&gt;  Scribners' claimed U. S. copyright on several of the individual articles.&lt;ref&gt;the copyrighted articles are listed at the front of each volume of the Scribner's sets&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this, ''several hundred thousand'' cheaply produced bootlegged copies were also sold in the U.S., which still did not have copyright laws protecting foreign publications.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; Famous infringers of that era include the [[Philadelphia]]n Joseph M. Stoddart, who employed a spy in the ''Britannica's'' own printshop, Neill and Company, in Edinburgh. The spy would steal the proofreader's copies and send them by fastest mail to the United States, allowing Stoddart to publish his version simultaneously with the ''Britannica'' and at nearly half the price ($5 versus $9 per volume). His right to do so was upheld in an infamous decision by Justice Arthur Butler who argued

{{quote|To reproduce a foreign publication is not wrong.

Another successful infringer was Henry G. Allen, who developed a photographic reproduction method for the ''Britannica'' and charged only half as much as Stoddart ($2.50 per volume). Other people alleged to have copied the 9th edition included [[John Wanamaker]] and the Reverend [[Isaac Kaufmann Funk]] of the [[Funk and Wagnalls]] encyclopedia. Richard S. Pearle &amp; Co. of Chicago photoengraved some sets in 1891, and added 3 volumes of "American Revisions and additions," the first 2 in 1891 and the third in 1892. In 1893 they published sets with volumes 1‚Äì24 from the original Britannica, the 3 "American" volumes 25‚Äì27, and the index as Vol. 28. Some copies of this version say they were printed by Werner, also of Chicago, and from 1902 to 1907 Werner printed the commonly found "New Werner Edition," of 30 volumes (24 volumes plus 5 ''New American Supplement'' volumes and a new index for all 29 volumes). In 1890, James Clarke published the ''Americanized Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Revised and Amended'' which was only 10 volumes, as was the 1895 Belford-Clark issue by the same name (Chicago).

In addition to American unauthorized copies, there were American supplements which were written to be appended to authorized copies of Britannica. The Hubbard Brothers of Philadelphia produced a 5-volume American supplement between 1882 and 1889, in quality leather bindings designed to match the authorized volumes in appearance. Of good scholarship, it contained biographies of Americans and geographies of US places, as well as other US interests not mentioned in the main encyclopedia.

In 1896, Scribner's Sons, which had claimed US copyright on many of the articles, obtained court orders to shut down bootlegger operations, some of whose printing plates were melted down as part of the enforcement.&lt;ref name="kister_1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kister | first = KF | authorlink = Kenneth Kister | year = 1994 | title = Kister's Best Encyclopedias: A Comparative Guide to General and Specialized Encyclopedias | edition = 2nd | publisher = Oryx Press | location = Phoenix, Arizona | isbn = 0-89774-744-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers were able to get around this order, however, by re-writing the articles that Scribner's had copyrighted; for example, the "United States" article in Werner's 1902 unlicensed edition was newly written and copyrighted by R.S. Pearle.&lt;ref&gt;Werner's 1902 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, [[Saalfield Publishing]] published the ''Americanized'' [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]] in 8 volumes with a 4 volume supplement (when the British edition had 24 volumes).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Company]] had acquired all the rights to the encyclopedia{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in America.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In addition, [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] claimed that the 4 volume supplement{{clarify|date=April 2016}} used material from ''[[Appletons' Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} To avoid further litigation, the suit against Saalfield Publishing was settled in court "by a stipulation in which the defendants agree not to print or sell any further copies of the offending work, to destroy all printed sheets, to destroy or melt the portions of the plates from which the infringing matter in the Supplement as it appears in the ''Americanized [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]]'' has been printed, and to pay D. Appleton &amp; Co. the sum of $2000 damages."&lt;ref&gt;The Publishers' Weekly No. 1688, June 4, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horace Everett Hooper]] was an American businessman, and a close associate of James Clarke, one of the leading American bootleggers.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Hooper recognized the potential profit in the ''Britannica'' and, again in 1896, learned that both the ''Britannica'' and ''[[The Times (London)|The Times]]'' of London were in financial straits.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Hooper formed a partnership with Clarke, his brother George Clarke, and [[Walter Montgomery Jackson]] to sell the ''Britannica'' under the sponsorship of ''The Times'', meaning that ''The Times'' would advertise the sale and lend its respectable name. Hooper and his energetic advertising manager, Henry Haxton, introduced many innovative sales methods: full-page advertisements in ''The Times'', testimonials from celebrities, buying on installment plans, and a long series of so-called 'final offers'.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Although the crass marketing was criticized as inappropriate to the ''Britannica's'' history and scholarship, the unprecedented profits delighted the manager of ''The Times'', [[Charles Frederic Moberly Bell]],&lt;ref name="wells_1968" /&gt; who assessed Hooper as "a ranker who loved to be accepted as a gentleman. Treat him as a gentleman and one had no trouble with him; treat him as an essentially dishonest ranker and one got all the trouble there was to get."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kitchen | first = F. Harcourt | year = 1925 | title = Moberley Bell and his Times: An Unofficial Narrative | publisher = Philip Allan and Co | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American partnership sold over 20,000 copies of the ''Britannica'' in the United States (four runs of 5000), after which Hooper and Jackson bought out the two Clarke brothers in early 1900.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; [[A &amp; C Black]] had moved to London in 1895 and, on 9 May 1901, sold all the rights to the ''Britannica'' to Hooper and Jackson, then living in London.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The sale of the ''Britannica'' to Americans has left a lingering resentment among some British citizens, especially when it is perceived that parochial American concerns are emphasized.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; For example, one British critic wrote on the centenary of the sale:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mosley | first = Charles | title = No title | journal = Manchester Guardian Weekly | date = 10 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The full horror of what an American editorial monopoly entails is seldom appreciated.

Again under the sponsorship of ''[[The Times (London)|The Times]]'' of London, and with Adam &amp; Charles Black in the UK, the new owners quickly produced an 11-volume supplement to the 9th edition; being 9 volumes of text, 25‚Äì33, a map volume, 34, which was 1 inch taller than the other volumes, and a new index, vol 35, also an inch taller than 25‚Äì33, which covered the first 33 volumes (the maps volume 34 had its own index). The editors were [[Hugh Chisholm]], Sir [[Donald Mackenzie Wallace]], [[Arthur T. Hadley]] and [[Franklin Henry Hooper]], the brother of the owner Horace Hooper. Taken together, the 35 volumes were dubbed the "10th edition". The re-issue of the 9th edition under the moniker "10th edition" caused some outrage, since many articles of the 9th edition were over 25 years old. This led to the popular joke: "''The Times'' is behind the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'' and the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'' is behind the times."&lt;ref name="thomas_1992"&gt;{{cite book| last = Thomas | first = Gillian | authorlink = Gillian Thomas | year = 1992 | title = A Position to Command Respect: Women and the Eleventh Britannica | publisher = Scarecrow Press | isbn = 0-8108-2567-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Britannica10th.jpg|thumb|A &amp; C. Black and ''The Times'' of London produced the 10th edition]]
The 1903 advertising campaign for the tenth edition was an onslaught of [[direct marketing]]: hand-written letters, telegrams, limited-time offers, etc.. The following quote, written in 1926, captures the mood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Courtney | first = Janet E. | year = 1926 | title = Recollected in Tranquillity | publisher = Heinemann | page = 225|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Who that is old enough does not remember the "campaign" of 1903, the insidious payment by instalments, the sets dumped at your door, bookcase and all, on receipt of a guinea, the scholarships, the competition questions, the reply-paid telegrams pursuing you to the innermost sanctuary of your home ("From my bath I curse you", one man wired back!), the "Going, going, gone" tactics‚Äî"Only five days left and one of them the shortest!" so irrelevant, but so arresting!|Janet E. Courtney, long-time employee of the ''Britannica'', from her book, ''Recollected in Tranquillity''}}

An excellent collection of prospectuses received by a single person (C. L. Parker) in that year has been preserved by the [[Bodleian Library]] (catalogued under #39899.c.1). The advertising was clearly targeted at middle and lower-middle-class people seeking to improve themselves.&lt;ref name="thomas_1992" /&gt; The advertising campaign was remarkably successful; over 70,000 sets were sold, bringing in over ¬£600,000&amp;nbsp;pounds profit.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; When one British expert expressed surprise to [[Horace Everett Hooper|Hooper]] that so many people would want an outdated encyclopedia, he replied, "They didn't; I ''made'' them want it."&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

Even after the Tenth edition was published, some American infringement companies were still printing thousands of copies of the Ninth without the supplements. See above. Some of these companies were adding their own "Americanized" supplements, but none of them reproduced the Tenth. Copyright violation did not end until shortly before the Eleventh edition came out.

===Eleventh edition, 1910===
{{Main article|Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition}}
[[File:11Britannica.JPG|200px|thumb|left|[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition]]]]
The renowned eleventh edition of ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'' was begun in 1903, and published in 1910‚Äì1911 in 28 volumes, with a one-volume Index. Edited by [[Hugh Chisholm]] in London and by [[Franklin Henry Hooper]] in [[New York City|New York]], the 11th edition was the first to be published substantially at one time, instead of volume by volume. Its illustrious contributors are legion, including [[Baden Baden-Powell]] writing on [[kite|kite-flying]]; [[Arthur Eddington]] on astronomy; [[Edmund Gosse]] on [[literature]] and [[Donald Tovey]] on music. Sometimes called the 1911 ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', this edition is still highly regarded for its lucid explanations of scholarly subjects. Being in the [[public domain]], the complete text is freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;There are many places the encyclopedia can be accessed online (see the [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition#External links|External links section]] of the [[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] article).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th edition retained the high scholarship and eminent contributors that marked the 9th edition, but tempered that scholarship with shorter, simpler articles that were more intelligible to lay-readers. Thus, the 9th and 11th editions had 17,000 and 40,000 articles, respectively, although they were roughly equivalent in size. This shift accommodated the American business strategy of popularizing the ''Britannica'' for a mass market, while still retaining its quality as a reference work. The high literary and scholarly level of the 11th edition is largely due to the zeal of its owner, [[Horace Everett Hooper]], who held scholarship in high regard and spared no expense to make the 11th edition as excellent as possible.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

After a heated legal dispute and all-too-public corporate wrangling over ownership of the ''Britannica'' (1908‚Äì1909), Hooper bought out [[Walter Montgomery Jackson|Walter Jackson]], becoming the sole owner of the ''Britannica''. The public furor caused ''[[The Times (London)|The Times]]'' to cancel its sponsorship contract with Hooper, feeling that the interests of the newspaper were not being served.&lt;ref name="wells_1968" /&gt; After failing to win over [[Oxford University]], Hooper managed to secure [[Cambridge University]] as a new sponsor; thus, the 11th edition was published initially by [[Cambridge University Press]], and scholars from Cambridge University were allowed to review the text and veto any overly aggressive advertising.&lt;ref name="wells_1968" /&gt; Perhaps because of this, the ''Britannica'' encountered financial difficulties, whereupon it was licensed to [[Sears Roebuck]] and Co. of [[Chicago]], who issued a physically smaller but complete version known as the "handy edition," with each volume almost pocket-sized. The owner of Sears, philanthropist [[Julius Rosenwald]], was friends with Horace Hooper and enthusiastic about the ''Britannica's'' promise; he single-handedly saved the ''Britannica'' from [[bankruptcy]] several times over the next fifteen years. Although Sears' handy set was successful in 1915‚Äì1916, sales dropped significantly when the United States entered World War I.

The 11th edition employed 35 named female contributors, out of 1500 total (2.3%). Although this was not much of an increase over the 10th edition (which named 37 female contributors out of 1800 total), it was heralded publicly as a major advance in recognizing the contributions of women in learned circles.&lt;ref name="thomas_1992" /&gt; However, the 11th edition did employ hundreds of women to write unsigned articles; some women, such as Irish medical expert Harriet Hennessy, even rose to be (uncredited) department editors.&lt;ref name="thomas_1992" /&gt;

Sales figures for the 11th edition were comparable to those of the 9th, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies including the unlicensed sets. Unlike the 9th, however, the 11th edition was not infringed, all sets being printed legitimately by Britannica. It can be seen{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} that the 9th and 11th editions were massively better-sellers than previous editions. This is mainly due to the increase in population of, and sales in, the United States, which were mere colonies with low population when Britannica started out in 1768.

===Twelfth and thirteenth editions (competing supplements to the eleventh)===
The poor sales of the war years brought the ''Britannica'' to the brink of [[bankruptcy]].  The [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Sears Roebuck]], [[philanthropist]] [[Julius Rosenwald]], was devoted to the mission of the ''Britannica'' and bought its rights on 24 February 1920 from his friend [[Horace Everett Hooper]] for $1.25 million. The ''Britannica's'' headquarters were moved to [[Chicago]], where they have remained. In 1922, a 3-volume supplement to the eleventh edition was released that summarized the developments just before, during and after World War I; these three volumes, taken together with the eleventh edition of 1910, became known as the twelfth edition. The articles describing World War I and the political changes brought about by it took up a large portion of the supplement, but articles on such things as radio (still called wireless telephony) are informative. The editor of the supplement was [[Hugh Chisholm]], who also had been the main editor of the eleventh edition, as well as the 1902 eleven-volume supplement to the ninth edition, known as the tenth edition. Horace Hooper died in 1922, a few weeks after the publication of the twelfth edition.&lt;ref name="wells_1968" /&gt; This edition was a commercial failure, losing Sears roughly $1.75 million, after which Sears gave it back to Hooper's widow, Harriett Meeker Cox, and her brother, William J. Cox, who ran the company from 1923 to 1928.

The passage of a few years led to a better perspective on that era. In 1926, the ''Britannica'' released three new volumes covering the history of 1910‚Äì1926, which were intended to supplant those of the twelfth edition. Again taken together with the eleventh edition, the new volumes became known as the thirteenth edition, which maintained the ''Britannica's'' tradition of illustrious contributors: [[Harry Houdini]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Ferdinand Foch]], [[Gustav Stresemann]], [[Thomas G. Masaryk]] and [[Elihu Root]].

In 1928, Rosenwald bought back the rights to the ''Britannica'', leaving Cox as publisher. Cox argued forcefully for a new fourteenth edition, pointing out that the eleventh edition (the bulk of the twelfth and thirteenth editions) was badly out of date. Cox also tried to involve the [[University of Chicago]] in producing the ''Britannica'', even including a $1 million advance from Rosenwald as a temptation; however, the trustees of the University turned down his proposal, a choice they almost repeated a generation later under [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]].

===Fourteenth edition, 1929===
By 1926, the eleventh edition was beginning to show its age, and work on a new edition was begun. The editors were [[J. L. Garvin]] in London and [[Franklin Henry Hooper]] in [[New York City|New York]]. It has 24 volumes, reduced from 29 in the 11th edition, yet has 45,000 articles compared to 37,000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;as stated by J.L. Garvin in his original 1929 introduction to the 14th&lt;/ref&gt; It has 15,000 illustrations, of which 1,500 are full plates.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The 14th edition took three years to complete, at the then exorbitant cost of $2.5 million, all of it invested by [[Julius Rosenwald]] of [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]. It was very different from the 11th edition, having fewer volumes and simpler articles, continuing the business strategy of popularizing the ''Britannica'' for the American mass market at the expense of its scholarship.&lt;ref name="Trivia Library 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; The 14th edition also drew criticism for deleting information unflattering to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McCabe | first=Joseph | authorlink=Joseph McCabe | title=Lies and Fallacies of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: How Powerful and Shameless Clerical Forces Castrated a Famous Work... | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/joseph_mccabe/lies_of_britannica.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the 14th also included many illustrious contributors, including eighteen [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]] in science, such as [[Robert Millikan]], [[Albert Abraham Michelson]] and [[Arthur Compton]]. More coverage was given to popular entertainment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = 23 September 1929 | title = Patriarch Revised | journal = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732859-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Gene Tunney]] writing on [[boxing]], [[Lillian Gish]] on [[acting]] and [[Irene Castle]] on [[ballroom dancing]]. [[George Bernard Shaw]] contributed a well-regarded article on [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; In all, there were roughly 3500 named contributors, of which roughly half were American.&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt; The 14th edition was again criticized for [[sexism]], by a woman who wrote to editor Walter Yust that too many biographies were of men; Yust made a count and found that 6% of its 13,000 biographies were of [[woman|women]].&lt;ref name="kogan_1958" /&gt;

The 14th edition was published in September 1929, and had 23 volumes with a one-volume Index that also contained a complete atlas. Unfortunately, the [[Great Depression]] struck scarcely a month after the release of the 14th edition, and sales plummeted. Despite the unfailing support of the [[Sears Roebuck]] company, the ''Britannica'' almost went bankrupt over the next few years. Rosenwald died in 1932, and General [[Robert E. Wood]] took over; Cox was removed as publisher and the Secretary-Treasurer of Sears, [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] was installed as the new President of the ''Britannica''.

===Policy of continuous revision===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
[[Elkan Harrison Powell|E. H. Powell]] identified and fixed a key vulnerability of ''Britannica'', namely, that its sales (and, hence, the company's income) fluctuated strongly over the life-cycle of an edition. After the release of a new edition, sales would generally begin strong, and decline gradually for 10‚Äì20 years as the edition began to show its age; finally, sales would drop off precipitously with the announcement that work had begun on a new edition, since few people would buy an obsolete encyclopedia that would soon be updated. These strong fluctuations in sales led to economic hardship for the ''Britannica''.

To address this problem, Powell suggested in 1933 the policy of continuous revision, with the goal of keeping the ''Britannica'' "always timely and always salable". The basic idea was to maintain a continuous editorial staff that would constantly revise the articles on a fixed schedule. Earlier encyclopedias did not maintain a continuous editorial staff, but rather assembled one just prior to beginning a new edition. Rather than releasing supplemental editions or volumes, new printings would be made every year with only enough copies made to cover the sales for that year. An analysis of the ''Britannica's'' articles suggested that roughly 75% required only occasional revising, whereas 25% required revision every 1‚Äì3 years. The articles were therefore divided into 30 classifications and a schedule for their revision worked out, such that every article would be checked at least twice a decade.

Powell also conceived the ''Britannica's'' "Book of the Year", in which a single volume would be released every year covering the developments of the previous year, particularly in rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, culture and politics. The "Book of the Year" continues to be published even today. Powell also introduced the Library Research Service (1936), in which owners of the ''Britannica'' could write to have their personal questions researched and answered by the editorial staff.

Under Powell's leadership, the ''Britannica'' began to capitalize on its reputation by aggressively developing "spin-offs", such as the 12-volume ''Britannica Junior'' for children (published 1934, and revised to 15 volumes in 1947), the historical timeline ''The March of Man'' (published 1935, and edited by Albert Bushwell Hart, Isaac J. Cox and Lawrence H. Dawson), the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica World Atlas'' (published 1942, and prepared by G. Donald Hudson) and ''[[10 Eventful Years]]'', a summary of the national and international events surrounding World War II (1937‚Äì1946).

===Transfer of ownership to William Benton===
[[Sears Roebuck]] published the ''Britannica'' until 1943. In 1941, Sears offered the rights to the ''Britannica'' as a gift to the [[University of Chicago]]. The story of this offer was recounted at the [[Bicentennial of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|bicentennial banquet]] of the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica''&lt;ref name="EB_bicentennial"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1968 | title = Banquet at Guildhall in the City of London, Tuesday 15 October 1968: Celebrating the 200th Anniversary of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and the 25th Anniversary of the Honorable William Benton as its Chairman and Publisher | publisher = Encyclop√¶dia Britannica International, Ltd. | location = United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was after lunch on the afternoon of December 9, 1941 that General [[Robert E. Wood]], Chairman of [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears, Roebuck]] and [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]], then vice-president of the [[University of Chicago]], were discussing the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] which had occurred two days earlier. At the end of this conversation, as coffee was served, Bill changed the subject and said to Wood, "General, don't you think it is rather unsuitable for a mail-order house to own the ''Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'', and isn't it even more unsuitable in wartime?"

"Yes", replied General Wood, "Sears, Roebuck should never have acquired it in the first place."

"Does it make any money?" Bill asked. Wood replied that sales would earn his company some $300,000 before taxes that year. Bill replied, "Well, General, you know that universities do not have any money. They cannot buy businesses. Why don't you make a gift of the ''Britannica'' to the University of Chicago?"

General Wood did not reply immediately but walked to his car. As he got into the car, he turned to Bill Benton and said, "All right, Bill, I will give you the ''Britannica''."}}

The [[University of Chicago]] declined the offer, viewing the mission of the university as not entirely consistent with a large commercial publishing house; however it continues even today to be involved in its production, offering editorial advice and allowing its name to be associated with the ''Britannica''. Thus, in 1943, the wealthy and powerful [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]], a former U.S. senator and advertising executive, obtained exclusive control of the ''Britannica'', which he published until his death in 1973. His widow Helen Hemingway Benton continued to publish the ''Britannica'' until her own death in 1974. After their deaths, the [[Benton Foundation]] continued to manage the ''Britannica'' until it was sold to [[Jacqui Safra]] in 1996.

==The fifteenth edition==
===First version (1974‚Äì1984)===
Despite the policy of continuous revision, the 14th edition of the ''Britannica'' gradually became outdated. Beginning in the early 1960s, the failings of the 14th edition began to be collated and published by [[physicist]] [[Harvey Einbinder]], culminating in his highly critical 390-page book, ''The Myth of the Britannica'' (1964).&lt;ref name=brit-myth&gt;Einbinder, Harvey ''The Myth of the Britannica''. New York: [[Grove Press]], 1964 (OCLC 152581687)/ London: MacGibbon &amp; Kee, 1964 (OCLC 807782651) / New York: Johnson Reprint Corp., 1972. (OCLC 286856)&lt;/ref&gt; Goaded into action, the ''Britannica'' began to work on a new edition, the current 15th.

The 15th edition was produced over ten years at a cost of $32 million and released in 1974 in 30 volumes. The so-called ''New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica'' (or ''Britannica 3'') had a unique three-part organization: a single ''Prop√¶dia'' (''Primer for Education'') volume, which aimed to provide an outline of all known, indeed knowable, information; a 10-volume ''Microp√¶dia'' (''Small Education'') of 102,214 short articles (strictly less than 750 words); and a 19-volume ''Macrop√¶dia'' (''Large Education'') of 4,207 longer, scholarly articles with references, similar to those of the 9th and 11th editions.&lt;ref name="chauncy_1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Harris | year = 1975 | title = The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica | journal = Geographical Review | pages = 141‚Äì145 | doi = 10.2307/213852 | volume = 65|first =Chauncy D. | issue = 1 | publisher = Geographical Review, Vol. 65, No. 1 | jstor = 213852}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Microp√¶dia'' and ''Macrop√¶dia'' articles are listed in alphabetical order; the 4,287 contributors to the ''Macrop√¶dia'' articles are identified scrupulously, but the ''Microp√¶dia'' articles are generally anonymous and unreferenced.

This 15th edition had no general index, which had been a feature of the ''Britannica'' since its 7th edition; even in the 2nd edition, individual long articles had their own indices. The idea of [[Mortimer J. Adler]] was that the ''Prop√¶dia'' and the ''Microp√¶dia'' could serve the role of an index. More generally, Dr. Adler felt that the ''Britannica'' should not merely serve as a reference work, but also aspire to be a categorization of ''omne scibile'' (everything knowable), to fulfill [[Francis Bacon]]'s grand conception of [[epistemology]]. Thus, the ''Prop√¶dia'' was intended to be the road-map of all knowledge, within which every fact, technique, and theory could be organized. With this edition EB became the first encyclopedia that serves both functions of fact-checking and self-education.

The lack of an index and the unusual organization into ''two'' sets of alphabetically organized articles provoked much criticism.&lt;ref name="kister_1994" /&gt; In a typical contemporary assessment, "It is called the ''Microp√¶dia'', for 'little knowledge,' and little knowledge is what it provides. It has proved to be grotesquely insufficient as an index, radically constricting the utility of the ''Macrop√¶dia.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wolff | first = G |date=November 1976 | title = Britannica 3, Failures of | journal = The Atlantic | pages = 107‚Äì110}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more laconically, "This arrangement has nothing to recommend it except commercial novelty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = McCracken | first = S |date=February 1976 | title = The Scandal of 'Britannica 3' | journal = Commentary | pages = 63‚Äì68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most readers could not predict whether a given subject would be found in ''Microp√¶dia'' or the ''Macrop√¶dia''; the criteria by which the articles were sorted were not obvious even to scholars,&lt;ref name="chauncy_1975" /&gt; despite Dr. Adler's claims that the sorting followed naturally from the ''Prop√¶dia's'' outline of all knowledge.

===Second version (1985‚Äì2010)===
In 1985, the ''Britannica'' responded to reader requests by restoring the index as a two-volume set. The number of topics indexed by the ''Britannica'' has fluctuated from 500,000 (1985, the same as in 1954) to 400,000 (1989,1991) to 700,000 in the current 2007 print version. Presumably, this recent increase reflects the introduction of efficient electronic indexing, since the size of the encyclopedia has remained nearly constant at approximately 40 million words from 1954 to the present and far less than 40% of the encyclopedia has changed from 1985 to 2007.

Under the editorship of [[Philip W. Goetz]], the 1985 version of the 15th edition introduced other major changes. The 4,207 articles of the first version ''Macrop√¶dia'' were combined into 674 longer articles; for example, the individual articles for each of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s were merged into what became a 310-page article "[[United States of America]]". The ''[[Macrop√¶dia]]'' was also restricted somewhat from 19 volumes to the present 17 volumes. At the same time, the number of ''[[Microp√¶dia]]'' volumes was increased from 10 to the present 12 volumes, although the number of articles was reduced from 102,214 to roughly 65,000. The strict 750-word limit was softened to allow articles of medium length, such as [[Internet]], which almost fills one page. Superficially, the ''[[Prop√¶dia]]'''s Outline of Knowledge was simplified for easier use. In reality, by breaking the intrinsic links between a topic in ''[[Prop√¶dia]]'' with its associated EB articles the intended function (or usefulness) of ''[[Prop√¶dia]]'' is hindered significantly. 

On March 14, 2012, Britannica announced it would not be printing any more sets of its paper version, which accounted for less than 1 percent of its sales, and would instead focus on its DVD and on-line versions. It had not printed any new sets since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;CBS News, [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57397197-501465/encyclopaedia-britannica-ends-244-years-of-print/ "Encyclopaedia Britannica ends 244 years of print"], March 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Global Edition==
Britannica Global Edition was printed in 2009. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller "compact" volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain Macro- and Micropedia sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. It currently is out of print and sold out. The last printing was in 2011. The following is Britannica's description of the work:&lt;ref&gt;The Britannica online store {{cite web |url=http://store.britannica.com/products/043009100 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705002524/http://store.britannica.com/products/043009100 |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Is is no longer being produced or sold by Britannica, and its Web site now focuses on material for children, which was much more profitable than its traditional encyclopedia. Used copies of the CD are available, but the online version of the Britannica as known up to 2012 is not available in 2018 from any vendor.

==Development of electronic versions==
&lt;!-- deleted file removed [[File:Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.png|thumb|[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]], available on DVD]] --&gt;
In the 1980s [[Microsoft]] approached Britannica to collaborate on a [[CD-ROM]] encyclopedia, but the offer was declined. Senior managers at Britannica were confident in their control of the market and that their healthy profits would continue. At this time complete sets of the encyclopedia were priced between [[USD|$]]1,500 and $2,200, and the product was considered part of a luxury brand with an impeccable reputation handed down from generation to generation. The management did not believe that a CD-ROM could adequately compete or supplement their business.  Microsoft responded by using content from ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia]]'' to create what is now known as ''[[Encarta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1990 the ''Britannica's'' sales reached an all-time high of $650 million, but ''[[Encarta]]'', released in 1993, soon became a software staple with almost every computer purchase and the ''Britannica's'' market share plummeted. Britannica countered by offering a CD-ROM version of their product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5519440_ITM|title= CD-ROM Technology Poses Challenge for Encyclopedia Industry|accessdate= November 21, 2006|last= Ridder|first= Knight|date= 1994-06-26|work= San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it could not generate the print version's $500‚Äì600 in sales commissions. Britannica decided to charge $995 for just the CD-ROM, while bundling a free disc with the print version, hoping that including the CD-ROM would persuade buyers to stay with the brand.

In 1994 an online version was launched,&lt;ref name="Britannica History"/&gt; with subscriptions for sale for $2,000. By 1996 the price of the CD-ROM had dropped to $200, and sales had dropped to $325 million‚Äîabout half of their 1990 levels. Only 55,000 hard copy versions were sold in 1994, compared with 117,000 in 1990, and sales later fell to 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing financial pressure, Britannica was bought in 1996 by Swiss financier [[Jacob Safra]] for $135 million, a fraction of its book value. Safra introduced severe price-cutting measures to try to compete with ''Encarta'', even offering the entire reference free of charge for a time (around 18 months, from October 1999 to March 2001) on the [[Internet]].

Currently, Britannica co-operates with [[Taiwan]] companies (ÈÅ†ÊµÅ/Êô∫ÊÖßËóèÂ≠∏ÁøíÁßëÊäÄÂÖ¨Âè∏) to provide a [[Traditional Chinese]]-English bilingual version encyclopedia on internet according to the 2002 edition. It is the first bilingual product of Britannica.

Former editor-in-chief [[Robert McHenry]] believes that Britannica failed to exploit its early advantages in the market for electronic encyclopedias. Britannica had, for example, published the second [[multimedia]] encyclopedia titled [[Compton's Encyclopedia|''Compton's MultiMedia Encyclopedia'']] as early as 1989 (the first one being the ''[[Academic American Encyclopedia]]'' published by [[Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia|Grolier]]), but did not launch ''Britannica CD'' until 1994, a year after Microsoft launched their ''Encarta'' encyclopedia. McHenry believes these failures were due to a reluctance among senior management to fully embrace the new technology, caused largely by the overriding influence of the sales staff and management. The sales personnel earned commissions from door-to-door selling of the print encyclopedias, which McHenry believes led to decisions about the distribution and pricing of the electronic products being driven by the desires of the sales personnel rather than market conditions and customer expectations.&lt;ref name="EBonline"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Building of Britannica Online | work=howtoknow.com | url=http://www.howtoknow.com/BOL1.html | accessdate=December 30, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080425/http://www.howtoknow.com/BOL1.html | archivedate=September 27, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Albanians}}

The '''Islamization of Albania''' occurred as a result of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of [[Albania]] during the late 14th century. The Ottomans through their administration and military brought [[Islam]] to Albania through various policies and tax incentives, trade networks and transnational religious links. In the first few centuries of [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman rule]], the spread of Islam in Albania was slow and mainly intensified during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries due in part to greater Ottoman societal and military integration, geo-political factors and collapse of church structures. It was one of the most significant developments in [[History of Albania|Albanian history]] as [[Albanians]] in Albania went from being a largely [[Christian]] ([[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]) population to one that is mainly [[Muslim]] ([[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Bektashi]] and some other sects), while retaining significant ethnic Albanian Christian minorities in certain regions. The resulting situation where Sunni Islam was the largest faith in the Albanian ethnolinguistic area but other faiths were also present in a regional patchwork played a major influence in shaping the political development of Albania in the late Ottoman period. Apart from religious changes, conversion to Islam also brought about other social and cultural transformations that have shaped and influenced Albanians and [[Culture of Albania|Albanian culture]].

== History ==
{{See also|Islam in Albania|Islam in Albania (1800-1912)|Islam in Albania (1913-1944)|Islam in Albania (1945-1991)}}

=== Early Ottoman period ===
[[File:Gjergj Kastrioti.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Skanderbeg (1405 ‚Äì1468)]]
Albanians began converting to Islam when they became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the late 14th century.&lt;ref name="Ramet209"/&gt; Albania differs from other regions in the Balkans such as [[Bulgaria]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] in that until the 1500s, Islam remained confined to members of the co-opted aristocracy and sparse military outpost settlements of [[Yuruks]].&lt;ref name="Zhelyaz"&gt;Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‚Äò‚ÄôAlbanian Identities‚Äô‚Äô. Sofia, 2000: International Center for Minority Studies and Intercultural Relations. Page 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bieber"&gt;{{cite news|author= Florian Bieber|title=Muslim identity in the Balkans before the establishment of nation states| magazine=Nationalities Papers: The Journal of Nationalism and Ethnicity|date= 19 August 2010| pages =15‚Äì19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, actual conversion to Islam at first occurred mainly amongst the Christian elite, who retained some previous political and economic privileges, and the emerging class of [[timar]] or estate holders of the [[sipahi]]s in the new Ottoman system.&lt;ref name="Ergo22"&gt;{{harvnb|Ergo|2010|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These included aristocratic figures such as George Kastrioti ([[Skanderbeg]]) who while in the service of the Ottomans was a convert to Islam and later reverted to Christianity during the late 15th century northern Albanian uprising he initiated.&lt;ref name="Ramet209"/&gt; In doing so, he also ordered others who had embraced Islam or were Muslim colonists to convert to Christianity or face death.&lt;ref name="Ramet209"&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|1998|p=209}}. "The Ottomans first invaded Albania in 1385. A second Ottoman force was sent to Albania 1394-96, occupying the country. Given both the Ottoman disposition to tolerate religious diversity among loyal subjects and the generally bellicose traditions of the Albanians, Ottoman authorities adopted a conciliatory policy toward Albanian Christians in the early decades of occupation. Still, although conversion to Islam was not required, a Christian Albanian lord could count on winning favor if he converted. If the Ottomans did not believe that religious reasons could compel a Christian to convert to Islam, they nonetheless looked askance when a Muslim converted (or reconverted) to Christianity. This happened in 1443 when Gjergj Kastrioti (called Skenderbeg), who had been reared as a Muslim in the sultan's palace, abandoned the Islamic faith and publicly reverted to the creed of his forefathers. But this conversion was not merely a public gesture of defiance. It was the first act in a revolutionary drama. For, after changing his religious allegiance, Skenderbeg demanded that Muslim colonists and converts alike embrace Christianity on pain of death, declaring a kind of holy war against the sultan/caliph."&lt;/ref&gt; Skanderbeg received military assistance from the [[Kingdom of Naples]] that sent in 1452 [[Ramon d‚ÄôOrtaf√†]] who was appointed as viceroy of Albania and tasked with maintaining Catholicism among the local population from the spread of Islam.&lt;ref name=Marinescu182&gt;{{harvnb|Marinescu|1994|p=182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the conflicts between Skanderbeg and Ottomans the various battles and raiding pushed [[Sultan Mehmet II]] to construct the fortress of [[Elbasan]] (1466) in the lowlands to counter resistance coming from the mountain strongholds.&lt;ref name="Inalcik327"&gt;{{harvnb|Inalcik|1989|p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to and after Skanderbeg's death (1468) parts of the Albanian aristocracy migrated to southern Italy with some number of Albanians to escape the Ottoman conquest whose [[Arb√´resh√´ people|descendants]] still reside in many villages they settled.&lt;ref name="Nasse"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasse|1964|pp=24‚Äì26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even long after the fall of Skanderbeg, large regions of the Albanian countryside frequently rebelled against Ottoman rule, often incurring large human costs, including the decimation of whole villages.&lt;ref&gt;Zhelyazkova, Antonina, ‚Äò‚ÄôAlbanian identities‚Äô‚Äô, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1570s, a concerted effort by Ottoman rulers to convert the native population to Islam in order to stop the occurrence of seasonal rebellions began in Elbasan and Reka, and a failed rebellion in 1596 among Catholics in the North preceded a series of heavy punitive measures that induced conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Zhelyazkova, Antonina. ‚Äò‚ÄôAlbanian Identities‚Äô‚Äô. Pages 15-16, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The peak of Islamization in Albania occurred much later than other Islamized or partially Islamized areas: 16th century Ottoman census data showed that sanjaks where Albanians lived remained overwhelmingly Christian with Muslims making up no more than 5% in most areas while during this period Muslims had already risen to large proportions in parts of Bosnia (Bosnia 46%, Herzegovina 43%, urban Sarajevo 100%), Northern Greece (Trikala 17.5%), urban Macedonia (Skopje and Bitola both at 75%) and Eastern Bulgaria (Silistra 72%, Chirmen 88%, Nikopol 22%). Later on, in the 19th century, when the process of Islamization had halted in most of the Balkans it continued to make significant progress in Albania, especially in the South.&lt;ref name = "MinkovDemographics"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anton Minkov|title= Conversion to Islam in the Balkans|pages=41‚Äì42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early period of Ottoman rule the areas that form contemporary Albania were reorganised into an administrative unit named Sancak-i Arnavid or Sancak-i Arnavud.&lt;ref name="Norris3637"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|pp=36‚Äì37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the onset of Ottoman rule only prominent churches with significant symbolic meaning or cultural value of an urban settlement were converted into mosques.&lt;ref name="Ergo18"&gt;{{harvnb|Ergo|2010|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most early mosques constructed in Albania were mainly built within fortresses for Ottoman garrisons at times by Ottoman Sultans during their military campaigns in the area like [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Mosque]] in Shkod√´r, the [[Red Mosque, Berat|Red Mosque]] in Berat and others.&lt;ref name="Nurja197198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ergo3435"/&gt;

As a rule, Ottoman rule largely tolerated Christian subjects but also discriminated against them, making them second-class citizens with higher taxes and various legal restrictions like being unable to take Muslims to court, have horses, have weapons, or have houses overlooking those of Muslims. While the Ottoman authorities were chronically suspicious of Catholicism, they largely allowed the Orthodox church to function unhindered, except during certain periods when the church was suppressed with expulsions of bishops and seizure of property and revenues. During the Ottoman period, most Christians as well as most Muslims employed a degree of syncretism, still practicing various pagan rites; many of these rites are best preserved among mystical orders like the [[Bektashi Order]].&lt;ref name="Vryonis"&gt;Vryonis, Spyros.

=== Northern Albania ===
[[File:Clement XI.jpg|140px|thumb|left|[[Pope Clement XI]] was the Pope from 1700 to 1721. Born to the noble [[Albani family]] of Italian and Albanian origin,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/09/21/fr_lombardi_papal_journey_a_blessing_for_all_albanians/1107019, ..."a silver portrait of Pope Clement XI ‚Äì who belonged to the Albani family, so was traditionally of Albanian origin."&lt;/ref&gt; and convened the ''Kuvendi i Arb√´nit'' to halt the decline of the Catholic population]]
The Ottoman conquest of certain northern cities from the Venetians happened separately to the initial conquest of Albania from local feudal lords. Cities such as [[Lezh√´]] fell in 1478, [[Shkod√´r]] during 1478‚Äì79 and [[Durr√´s]] in 1501 with the bulk of their Christian population fleeing.&lt;ref name=Malcolm12/&gt; Over the course of the sixteenth century the urban populations of these cities became primarily Muslim.&lt;ref name=Malcolm12&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|2015|pp=12‚Äì13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, the spread of Islam was slower due to resistance from the Roman [[Catholic Church]] and the mountainous terrain which contributed to curb Muslim influence in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Ramet209210"&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|1998|pp=209‚Äì210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman conquest and territorial reorganisation of Albania though affected the Catholic church as ecclesiastical structures were decimated.&lt;ref name="Ergo8"&gt;{{harvnb|Ergo|2010|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, the sanjak of Shkod√´r was reported as having a Muslim population standing at 4.5% of the total, while Dukagjini (sparsely populated at the time) had 0% and Prizreni had 1.9%.&lt;ref name="MinkovDemographics"/&gt;

Catholic Albanian rebellions, often in the context of Ottoman wars with Catholic powers of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in the seventeenth century resulted in severe reprisals against Catholic Albanians who had rebelled which accentuated conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name=Ramet210/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi235242"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederer333334"/&gt; In 1594, the Pope incited a failed rebellion among Catholic Albanians in the North, promising help from [[Spain]]. However the assistance did not come, and when the rebellion was crushed in 1596, Ottoman repression and heavy pressures to convert to Islam were implemented to punish the rebels.&lt;ref name="Zhelyaz"/&gt; Steep decreases occurred during the 1630s-1670s where for example the number of Catholics in the diocese of Lezh√´ declined by 50%, whereas in the diocese of [[Pult]] Catholics went from being 20,000 to 4,045 adherents, with most converting to Islam and a few to Orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=Ramet210&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|1998|p=210}}. "Then, in 1644, war broke out between Venice and the Ottoman empire. At the urging of the clergy, many Albanian Catholics sided with Venice. The Ottomans responded with severe repressions, which in turn drove many Catholics to embrace Islam (although a few elected to join the Orthodox Church instead)... Within the span of twenty-two years (1649-71) the number of Catholics in the diocese of Alessio fell by more than 50 percent, while in the diocese of Pulati (1634-71) the number of Catholics declined from more than 20,000 to just 4,045. In general, Albanian insurrections during the Ottoman-Venetian wars of 1644-69 resulted in stiff Ottoman reprisals against Catholics in northern Albania and significantly accelerated Islamization... In general, a pattern emerged. When the, Ottoman empire was attacked by Catholic powers, local Catholics were pressured to convert, and when the attack on the Ottoman empire came from Orthodox Russia, the pressure was on local Orthodox to change faith. In some cases Islamization was only superficial, however, and in the nineteenth century many villages and some entire districts remained "crypto-Catholic" in spite of the adopting the externals of Islamic culture."&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the [[Great Turkish War|Great Austro-Turkish War]], when Albanian Catholic leaders [[Pjet√´r Bogdani]] and [[Toma Raspasani]] had rallied Kosovo Albanian Catholics and Muslims to the pro-Austrian cause but Kosovo did not end up part of the Hapsburg empire, another round of harsh reprisals occurred and large numbers of Catholics&lt;ref name=Raspasani/&gt; and Serbs were&lt;ref name=Pahumi/&gt; reported to have fled north where it was reported that many Catholics "died, some of hunger, others of disease" around [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=Raspasani&gt;{{cite book|last=Malcolm|first=Noel|title=Kosovo: a short history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGQ_AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Toma+Raspasani&amp;dq=Toma+Raspasani&amp;hl=en|accessdate=21 June 2011|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-66612-8|ref=harv|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the flight of Serbs, the Pasha of Ipek (Albanian Peja, Serbian Pec) forced Catholic Albanians in the North to move to the now depopulated plains of Southern Serbia, and forced them to convert to Islam there.&lt;ref name=Pahumi&gt;Pahumi, Nevila (2007). "The Consolidation of Albanian Nationalism". Page 18: "The pasha of Ipek forcibly removed Catholic inhabitants of northern Albania into the plains of southern Serbia after a failed Serb revolt in 1689 and the flight of many Serbs to the Hapsburg Empire. The transferred villagers were forced to convert over to Islam."&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion among Catholics in communities of Northern Albania involved males outwardly embracing Islam, often to avoid payment of taxes and other social pressures which in the Ottoman system targeted men while females of the household remained Christian.&lt;ref name="Doja60"/&gt; Christian wives were sought by converted Muslim men to retain a degree of Catholicism in the household.&lt;ref name="Doja60"&gt;{{harvnb|Doja|2008|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1703 pope [[Pope Clement XI|Clement XI]], himself of Albanian heritage, ordered a synod of local Catholic bishops that discussed stemming conversions to Islam which also agreed to deny communion to crypto-Catholics in Albania who outwardly professed Islam.&lt;ref name="Skendi235242"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frazee"&gt;{{harvnb|Frazee|2006|pp=167‚Äì168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Albania, conflict with Slavs emerged as an additional factor toward conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos498"/&gt; Sharing the faith of Ottoman authorities allowed northern Albanians to become allies and equals in the imperial system and gain security against neighbouring Orthodox Slavs.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos498"/&gt;

In some areas adjacent to the east of Northern Albania, Islam became the majority faith faster: for example, official Ottoman statistics of [[Nahiya]] of Tetova across the border with [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (which had a mixed Albanian, Slavic Macedonian, and Turkish population) show Muslim families outnumbering Christian families for the first time in 1545, where there are 2 more Muslim families than Christian families, and 38 of the Muslim families had recently converted from Christianity,&lt;ref name="wallaby.vu.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wallaby.vu.edu.au/adt-VVUT/uploads/approved/adt-VVUT20060426.160820/public/02ch1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108131821/http://wallaby.vu.edu.au/adt-VVUT/uploads/approved/adt-VVUT20060426.160820/public/02ch1.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Opolje|Opoja]] in [[Kosovo]] near Prizren, Muslims are shown to have the majority in 1591.&lt;ref&gt;TKGM, TD ‚Ññ 55 (412), (Defter sand≈æaka Prizren iz 1591. godine).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Albania ===

[[File:LEAD MOSQUE IN DOWNTOWN BERAT, ALBANIA.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The 16th-century built [[Lead Mosque, Berat|Lead mosque]] in Berat]]

Consisting of plains and being an in between area of northern and southern Albania, central Albania was a hub on the old [[Via Egnatia]] road that linked commercial, cultural and transport connections which were subject to direct Ottoman administrative control and religious Muslim influence.&lt;ref name="Pistrick78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1956316318320"/&gt; The conversion to Islam of most of central Albania has thus been attributed in large part to the role its geography played in the socio-political and economic fortunes of the region.&lt;ref name="Pistrick78"&gt;{{harvnb|Pistrick|2013|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1956316318320"/&gt;

The official Ottoman recognition of the Orthodox church resulted in the Orthodox population being tolerated until the late 18th century, and the traditionalism of the church's institutions slowed the process of conversion to Islam amongst Albanians.&lt;ref name="Lederer333334"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramet203/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ergo26"&gt;{{harvnb|Ergo|2010|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox population of central and south-eastern Albania was under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Orthodox [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]], while south-western Albania was under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]] through the Metropolis of Ioannina.&lt;ref name="Ergo37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giakoumis7981"&gt;{{harvnb|Giakoumis|2010|pp=79‚Äì81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between Christian Albanians of central Albania and archbishops of Ohrid led to conversions to Bektashi Islam that made an appeal to all while insisting little on ritual observance.&lt;ref name="Winnifrith107"&gt;{{harvnb|Winnifrith|2002|p=107}}."But the difficult archbishops of Ohrid must have produced some difference in their flocks. Less contentious faiths were available. It so happens that converting to Islam in central Albania was eased by the strength there of the Bektashi cult, a mystical faith, designed to appeal to all, demanding little in the way of strict rules of observance."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 16th century the Albanian cities of [[Gjirokast√´r]], [[Kanin√´]], [[Delvin√´]], [[Vlor√´]], [[Kor√ß√´]], [[K√´lcyr√´]], [[P√´rmet]] and [[Berat]] were still Christian and by the late 16th century Vlor√´, P√´rmet and Himar√´ were still Christian, while Gjirokast√´r increasingly became Muslim.&lt;ref name="Ergo37"&gt;{{harvnb|Ergo|2010|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giakoumis84"/&gt; In the earlier parts of the 16th century, the sanjak of Elbasan was reported as having a 5.5% Muslim population, the highest at the time of all the Albanian-inhabited sanjaks.&lt;ref name="MinkovDemographics"/&gt; In 1570, a concerted effort by Ottoman authorities to convert the restive Christian populations of Elbasan and Reka began.&lt;ref name = "Zhelyaz"/&gt; In the area around Durr√´s, it was reported by a Greek traveler that there were no longer any Orthodox Christians due to Islamization.&lt;ref name="Giakoumis84"&gt;{{harvnb|Giakoumis|2010|p=84}}. On Durres: "At the end of the 16th century conversion to Islam had so much penetrated into central Albania, that a Greek traveller in Durr√´s in 1580 reported that ‚Äïin the region of Durr√´s there are no Greeks‚Äñ (that is, Orthodox Christians)"&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion to Islam in cities overall within Albania was slow during the 16th century as around only 38% of the urban population had become Muslim.&lt;ref name="Ergo38"&gt;{{harvnb|Ergo|2010|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Berat from 1670 onward became mainly Muslim and its conversion is attributed in part to a lack of Christian priests being able to provide religious services.&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"/&gt;

=== Southern Albania ===

In the 16th century, the sanjaks of Vlora was found to be 1.8% Muslim while the sanjak of Ohrid was found to be 1.9%.&lt;ref name="MinkovDemographics"/&gt; It was mainly during the late eighteenth century however that Orthodox Albanians converted in large numbers to Islam due overwhelmingly to the Russo-Turkish wars of the period and events like the Russian instigated [[Orlov Revolt|Orlov revolt]] (1770) that made the Ottomans view the Orthodox population as allies of [[Russian Empire|Russia]].&lt;ref name=Ramet203/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1956321323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vickers16"/&gt; As some Orthodox Albanians rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, the Porte responded with and at times applied force to convert Orthodox Albanians to Islam while also implementing economic measures to stimulate religious conversion.&lt;ref name=Ramet203/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vickers16"&gt;{{harvnb|Vickers|2011|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koti1617"/&gt; By 1798 a massacre perpetrated against the coastal Orthodox Albanian villages of Sh√´nvasil and Nivic√´-Bubar by [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]], semi-independent ruler of the [[Pashalik of Yanina]] led to another sizable wave of conversions of Orthodox Albanians to Islam.&lt;ref name=Ramet203&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|1998|p=203}}. "The Ottoman conquest between the end of the fourteenth century and the mid-fifteenth century introduced a third religion ‚Äì Islam  - but the Turks did not at first use force in its expansion, and it was only in the 1600s that large-scale conversion to Islam began ‚Äì chiefly, at first, among Albanian Catholics."; p.204. "The Orthodox community enjoyed broad toleration at the hands of the Sublime Porte until the late eighteenth century."; p. 204. "In the late eighteenth century Russian agents began stirring up the Orthodox subjects of the Ottoman empire against the Sublime Porte. In the Russo-Turkish wars of 1768-74 and 1787-91 Orthodox Albanians rose against the Turks. In the course of the second revolt the "New Academy" in Voskopoje was destroyed (1789), and at the end of the second Russo-Turkish war more than a thousand Orthodox fled to Russia on Russian warships. As a result of these revolts, the Porte now applied force to Islamicize the Albanian Orthodox population, adding economic incentives to provide positive stimulus. In 1798 Ali Pasha of Janina led Ottoman forces against Christian believers assembled in their churches to celebrate Easter in the villages of Shen Vasil and Nivica e Bubarit. The bloodbath unleashed against these believers frightened Albanian Christians in other districts and inspired a new wave of mass conversions to Islam."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1956321323"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1956|pp=321‚Äì323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Albania as a whole, and especially Southern Albania, was notable as a rare region in the Ottoman Balkans where the Christian population was still losing considerable numbers of adherents to Islamization; the only other such region that showed similar decrease in the Christian population was Dobrudja.&lt;ref name="MinkovDemographics"/&gt;

During this time conflict between newly converted Muslim Albanians and Orthodox Albanians occurred in certain areas. Examples include the coastal villages of [[Borsh]] attacking [[Piqeras]] in 1744, making some flee abroad to places such as southern Italy.&lt;ref name="Kallivretakis233"&gt;{{harvnb|Kallivretakis|2003|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond30"/&gt; Other areas such as 36 villages north of the Pogoni area converted in 1760 and followed it up with an attack on Orthodox Christian villages of the Kolonj√´, Leskovik and P√´rmet areas leaving many settlements sacked and ruined.&lt;ref name="Hammond30"&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1967|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late eighteenth century socio-political and economic crises alongside nominal Ottoman government control resulted in local banditry and Muslim Albanian bands raided Greek, Vlach and Orthodox Albanian settlements located today within and outside contemporary Albania.&lt;ref name="Anscombe88107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond197662"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koukoudis2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jorgaqi3839"/&gt; Within Albania those raids culminated in [[Vithkuq]], mainly an Orthodox Albanian centre, [[Moscopole]] (Albanian: Voskopoj√´, Greek: Moschopolis) mainly a Vlach centre, both with Greek literary, educational and religious culture and other smaller settlements being destroyed.&lt;ref name=Ramet203/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koti1617"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond197662"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koukoudis2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jorgaqi3839"/&gt; Those events pushed some Vlachs and Orthodox Albanians to migrate afar to places such as Macedonia, Thrace and so on.&lt;ref name=Ramet203/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koti1617"&gt;{{harvnb|Koti|2010|pp=16‚Äì17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond197662"&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1976|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koukoudis2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Koukoudis|2003|pp=321‚Äì322}}. "Particularly interesting is the case of Vithkuq, south of Moschopolis, which seems to have shared closely in the town's evolution, though it is far from clear whether it was inhabited by Vlachs in the glory days before  1769. It may well have had Vlach inhabitants before 1769, though the Arvanites were certainly far more numerous, if not the largest population group. This is further supported by the linguistic identity of the refugees who fled Vithkuq and accompanied the waves of departing Vlachs. Today it is inhabited by Arvanites and Vlachs, though the forebears of the modern Vlach residents arrived after the village had been abandoned by its previous inhabitants and are mainly of Arvanitovlach descent. They are former pastoral nomads who settled permanently in Vithkuq."; p. 339. "As the same time as, or possibly shortly before or after, these events in Moschopolis, unruly Arnauts also attacked the smaller Vlach and Arvanitic communities round about. The Vlach inhabitants of Lleng√´, Ni√ß√´, Grabov√´, Shipck√´, and the Vlach villages on Grammos, such as Nikolic√´, Linotopi, and Grammousta, and the inhabitants of Vithkuq and  even the last Albanian speaking Christian villages on Opar found themselves at the mercy of the predatory Arnauts, whom no-one could withstand. For them too, the only solution was to flee... During this period, Vlach and Arvanite families from the surrounding ruined market  towns and villages settled alongside the few Moscopolitans who had returned. Refugee families came from Dushar and other villages in Opar, from Vithkuq, Grabov√´, Nikolic√´, Ni√ß√´, and Lleng√´ and from Kolonj√´."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jorgaqi3839"&gt;{{harvnb|Jorgaqi|2005|pp=38‚Äì39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winnifrith109"&gt;{{harvnb|Winnifrith|2002|p=109}}. "Of these Vithkuq... All these villages have a Vlach element in their population, and it is Vlach tradition that they were large and important... This culture was of course Greek culture...&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox individuals, known as [[New Martyr|neo-martyrs]], attempted to stem the tide of conversion to Islam amongst the Orthodox Albanian population and were executed in the process.&lt;ref name="Giakoumis8991"/&gt; Notable among these individuals was [[Cosmas of Aetolia]], (died 1779) a Greek monk and missionary who traveled and preached afar as Kruj√´, opened many Greek schools before being accused as a Russian agent and executed by Ottoman Muslim Albanian authorities.&lt;ref name="Elsie5960"/&gt; Cosmas advocated for Greek education and spread of Greek language among illiterate Christian non-Greek speaking peoples so that they could understand the scriptures, liturgy and thereby remain Orthodox while his spiritual message is revered among contemporary Orthodox Albanians.&lt;ref name="Elsie5960"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2001|pp=59‚Äì60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsie200048"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2000|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackridge5859"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackridge|2009|pp=58‚Äì59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other factors for conversion ===

Other conversions such as those in the region of [[Lab√´ria]] occurred due to ecclesiastical matters when for example during a famine the local bishop refused to grant a break in the fast to consume milk with threats of [[hell]].&lt;ref name="Giakoumis8687"/&gt; Conversion to Islam also was undertaken for economic reasons which offered a way out of heavy taxation such as the ''[[jizya]]'' or poll tax and other difficult Ottoman measures imposed on Christians while opening up opportunities such as wealth accumulation and so on.&lt;ref name="Lederer333334"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giakoumis8687"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris4748"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|pp=47‚Äì48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In times of conflict between Muslims and Christians, local interests such as protection of family predominated over fighting causing the Ottomans to refuse Muslim Albanians the bearing of arms as often Christian Albanians would convert to Islam to obtain the right to arms and then employ them against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Myhill232"&gt;{{harvnb|Myhill|2006|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other multiple factors that led to conversions to Islam were the poverty of the Church, illiterate clergy, a lack of clergy in some areas and worship in a language other than Albanian.&lt;ref name="Lederer333334"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1956316318320"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giakoumis8687"&gt;{{harvnb|Giakoumis|2010|pp=86‚Äì87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the reliance of the bishoprics of Durr√´s and southern Albania upon the declining Archbishopric of Ohrid, due in part to [[simony]] weakened the ability of Orthodox Albanians in resisting conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi1956316318320"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1956|pp=316, 318‚Äì320}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crypto-Christianity]] also occurred in certain instances throughout Albania in regions such as Shpat amongst populations that had recently converted from Christian Catholicism and Orthodoxy to Islam.&lt;ref name=Ramet210/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi235242"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967b|pp=235‚Äì242}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lederer333334"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Giakoumis8991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pistrick7981"&gt;{{harvnb|Pistrick|2013|pp=79‚Äì81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gora (region)|Gor√´]], a borderland region straddling contemporary north-eastern Albania and southern Kosovo, had a Slavic Orthodox population which converted to Islam during the latter half of the eighteenth century due to the abolition of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá]] (1766) and subsequent unstable ecclesiastical structures.&lt;ref name="Duijzings16"&gt;{{harvnb|Duijzings|2000|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas starting from the seventeenth and increasing in the following centuries, the mainly Slavic Orthodox population of the now Albanian borderland central-eastern region of [[Gollobord√´]] converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="Limanoski74"&gt;{{harvnb|Limanoski|1989|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romani people]] entered Albania sometime in the fifteenth century and those that were Muslim became part of local Muslim Ottoman society.&lt;ref name="DeSotoBeddiesGedeshi7"&gt;{{harvnb|De Soto|Beddies|Gedeshi|2005|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowe196"&gt;{{harvnb|Crowe|1996|p=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam was closely associated with the state that made the Ottoman Empire an Islamic polity of which religious law coincided alongside state law with only Muslims having full civic rights while ethnic or national affiliations were disregarded.&lt;ref name="Jordan1582"&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|2015|p=1582}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the center and south by the end of the seventeenth century the urban centers had largely adopted the religion of the growing Muslim Albanian elite. The construction of mosques in Albania increased substantially from the 17th century onward with the advent of large numbers of Muslim Albanian converts.&lt;ref name="ManahasaKolay7079"/&gt; The Albanian old aristocratic ruling class converted to Islam to retain their lands.&lt;ref name="Stavrianos498"&gt;{{harvnb|Stavrianos|2000|p=498}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century a class of local aristocratic Albanian Muslim notables had emerged.&lt;ref name="ManahasaKolay7079"&gt;{{harvnb|Manahasa|Kolay|2015|pp=70, 78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of that class as [[pashas]] and [[beys]] during that period, having military employment as soldiers and mercenaries while also able to join the Muslim clergy played an increasingly important role in Ottoman political and economic life that became an attractive career option for many Albanians.&lt;ref name="Nurja197198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris123137155160"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond217"&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1967|p=217}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Babuna290291"/&gt; Depending on their role, these people in Muslim Albanian society attained a respectable position as they performed administrative tasks and maintained security in urban areas and sometimes were rewarded by the Ottoman state with high ranks and positions.&lt;ref name="Nurja197198"&gt;{{harvnb|Nurja|2012|pp=197‚Äì198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Albanians, as such were also represented in sizable numbers at the imperial Ottoman court.&lt;ref name="Ergo23"&gt;{{harvnb|Ergo|2010|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside Christians though, many Muslim Albanians were poor and partially serfs that worked on the land of the emerging landowning Ottoman Albanian elite while others found employment in business, as artisans and in other jobs.&lt;ref name="Lederer333334"&gt;{{harvnb|Lederer|1994|pp=333‚Äì334}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunni Islam was promoted and protected by Ottoman governors and feudal society that resulted in support and spread of dervish Sufi orders considered more orthodox in the Balkans region.&lt;ref name="Norris101"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Foremost of these were the Bektashi order who were considered Sunni by means of association with shared legal traditions, though viewed as Shiite by everyday Muslims due to esoteric practices such as revering [[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]], [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husein]] and other notable Muslim figures.&lt;ref name="BlumiKrasniqi480482"&gt;{{harvnb|Blumi|Krasniqi|2014|pp=480‚Äì482}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doja9193100102"&gt;{{harvnb|Doja|2006|pp=91‚Äì93; 100‚Äì102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During Ottoman rule the Albanian population partially and gradually began to convert to [[Islam]] through the teachings of [[Bektashism]] in part to gain advantages in the Ottoman trade networks, bureaucracy and army.&lt;ref name="Doja8687"&gt;{{harvnb|Doja|2006|pp=86‚Äì87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many Albanians were recruited into the Ottoman [[Dev≈üirme]] and [[Janissary]] with 42 [[Grand Viziers]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] being of Albanian origin. The most prominent Albanians during Ottoman rule were [[Koca Davud Pasha]], [[Hamza Kastrioti]], [[Iljaz Hoxha]], [[K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha]], [[Ali Pasha of Yanina|Ali Pasha]], [[Et√´hem Bey Mollaj|Edhem Pasha]], [[Ibrahim Pasha of Berat]], [[K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] and [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]]. Within these contexts of serving in the military and as administrators, the relationship of Muslim Albanians with the Ottomans was at times one of cooperation and mutual advantage.&lt;ref name="Malcolm82"&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|2002|p=82}}. "Modern historians would also think it necessary to refer to the many examples of cooperation (sometimes to mutual advantage) between inhabitants of the Albanian lands and their foreign rulers - above all, in the case of the Ottomans, with their innumerable soldiers and officials of Albanian origin.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muslim denominations and sects ===

Besides those associated with [[Sunni]] Islam, the Muslims of Albania during the Ottoman period belonged to several [[Sufi]] Orders.&lt;ref name="Clayer3336"/&gt; The [[Qadiriyya|Qadiri]] order spread within urban areas of the seventeenth century and was linked with [[Futuwwa|guilds]] of urban workers while in the 18th century the Qadiri had spread into central Albania and in particular the mountainous Dib√´r region.&lt;ref name="Clayer3336"/&gt; The Qadiri contributed to the economic, and in the Dib√´r area, the socio-political milieu where they were based.&lt;ref name="Clayer3336"/&gt; The [[Khalwati order|Halveti]] order who competed with the Bektashis for adherents and based in the south and northeast of Albania.&lt;ref name="Clayer3336"&gt;{{harvnb|Clayer|2007|pp=33‚Äì36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sufi orders were the [[Rufai]] and the [[Mevlevi Order|Melami]] and so on. The most prominent of these in Albania were and still are the [[Bektashi]]s, a mystic [[Dervish]] order belonging to Shia Islam that came to Albania during the Ottoman period, brought first by the [[Janissary|Janissaries]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"/&gt; The spread of Bektashism amongst the Albanian population though occurred during the 18th and mainly early 19th centuries, especially in the domains of Ali Pasha who is thought to have been a Bektashi himself.&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris123137155160"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doja9498"&gt;{{harvnb|Doja|2006|pp=94‚Äì98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych2122"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=21‚Äì22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufi [[dervishes]] from places afar like [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Anatolia]] arrived, proselytized, gained disciples and in time a network of tekkes was established that became centres of Sufism in regions such as Skrapar and Devoll.&lt;ref name="Norris123137155160"/&gt; Some of the most prominent tekkes in Albania were in settlements such as Gjirokast√´r, Mel√ßan, Kruj√´ and Frash√´r.&lt;ref name="Norris123137155160"/&gt; Of the Bektashi order by the early 20th century Albanians formed a sizable amount of its dervishes outside the Balkans, even at the [[Haji Bektash Veli Complex|tekke]] of Sufi saint [[Haji Bektash Veli|Haji Bektash]] in Anatolia and in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Norris212218"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|pp=212‚Äì218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasluck97"&gt;{{harvnb|Hasluck|1913|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufi orders, in particular the Bektashis, associate Christian saints and their local shrines with Sufi holy men, creating a synthesis and syncretism of religious observance and presence.&lt;ref name="Norris123137155160"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|pp=123‚Äì137, 155‚Äì160}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Babuna290291"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasluck106119"/&gt; For Albanian converts to Islam, Bektashism with its greater religious freedoms and syncretism was viewed at times as a more appealing option than Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babuna290291"&gt;{{harvnb|Babuna|2004|pp=290‚Äì291}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasluck106119"&gt;{{harvnb|Hasluck|1913|pp=106‚Äì119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bektashi sect is considered heretical by conservative Muslims.&lt;ref name="Giakoumis8991"&gt;{{harvnb|Giakoumis|2010|pp=89‚Äì91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally Bektashis are found in sizable numbers within southern Albania and to a lesser extent in central Albania, while the rest{{dubious|date=July 2017}} of the Muslim population belongs to Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="Skendi1013"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967a|pp=10‚Äì13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jazexhi2223"&gt;{{harvnb|Jazexhi|2014|pp=22‚Äì23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social and cultural change ===
[[File:Xhamia e Iljaz Bej Mirahorit, Korce.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Mirahori Mosque in Kor√ß√´]]
The Ottoman conquest also brought social, cultural and linguistic changes into the Albanian-speaking world. From the fifteenth century onward words from Ottoman Turkish entered the Albanian language.&lt;ref name="Norris6181"/&gt; A corpus of poets and other Muslim Albanian authors wrote in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Persian or in the Albanian language in Arabic script ([[aljamiado]]) encompassing narrative prose, poetry, reflective works on religion and socio-political situations and so on.&lt;ref name="Norris6181"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsie289305"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|1992|pp=289‚Äì305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent amongst these authors were [[Yahya bey Dukagjini]], [[Haxhi Shehreti]] or ''[[bejtexhinj]]'' poets like [[Nezim Frakulla]], [[Muhamet Ky√ßyku]], [[Sulejman Naibi]], [[Hasan Zyko Kamberi]], [[Haxhi Ymer Kashari]] and others.&lt;ref name="Norris6181"/&gt; Apart from Elbasan founded (1466) around a fortress, towns and cities in Albania underwent change as they adopted Ottoman architectural and cultural elements.&lt;ref name="Ergo3435"&gt;{{harvnb|Ergo|2010|pp=34‚Äì35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nurja193"/&gt; Some settlements with the construction of buildings related to religion, education and social purposes like mosques, madrassas, imarets and so on by the Ottoman Muslim Albanian elite became new urban centres like Kor√ß√´, Tiran√´ and Kavaj√´.&lt;ref name="Nurja193"&gt;{{harvnb|Nurja|2012|p=193}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, older urban centres such as Berat attained mosques, [[Turkish bath|hamams]] (Ottoman bathhouses), madrasas (Muslim religious schools), coffee houses, tekes and became known for poets, artists and scholarly pursuits.&lt;ref name="Norris6181"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|pp=61‚Äì81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Kosovo or Macedonia, architecturally Albania's Ottoman Muslim heritage was more modest in number, though prominent structures are the [[Iljaz Mirahori Mosque|Mirahori Mosque]] in Kor√ß√´ (built 1495‚Äì96), [[Bazaar Mosque|Murad Bey Mosque]] in [[Kruj√´]] (1533‚Äì34), [[Lead Mosque, Shkod√´r|Lead Mosque]] in Shkod√´r (1773‚Äì74),  [[Et'hem Bey Mosque]] in Tiran√´ (begun 1791‚Äì94; finished 1820‚Äì21) and others.&lt;ref name="Norris56"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ManahasaKolay7079b"&gt;{{harvnb|Manahasa|Kolay|2015|pp=70‚Äì79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion from Christianity to Islam for Albanians also marked a transition from ''[[Rum Millet|Rum]]'' (Christian) to ''Muslim'' confessional communities within the Ottoman [[millet system]] that collectively  divided and governed peoples according to their religion.&lt;ref name="Anscombe88107"/&gt; The Ottomans were nonetheless aware of the existence of Muslim Albanians and used terms like ''Arnavud'' (ÿßÿ±ŸàÿßŸÜŸäÿØ) extensively as an ethnic marker to address the shortcomings of the usual millet religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records.&lt;ref name="Anscombe88107"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|p=88}}. "This Albanian participation in brigandage is easier to track than for many other social groups in Ottoman lands, because Albanian (''Arnavud'') was one of the relatively few ethnic markers regularly added to the usual religious (Muslim-Zimmi) tags used to identify people in state records. These records show that the magnitude of banditry involving Albanians grew through the 1770s and 1780s to reach crisis proportions in the 1790s and 1800s."; p.107. "In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article:  that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman "Albania" or ''Arnavudluk'' (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical "justification" for the creation of a "Greater Albania" today."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anscombe2006b"/&gt; In Ottoman Turkish, the country was referred to as ''Arnavudluk'' (ÿ¢ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸàŸàÿØŸÑŸÇ).&lt;ref name="Anscombe2006b"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|p=772}}.  "In this case, however, Ottoman records contain useful information about the ethnicities of the leading actors in the story. In comparison with ‚ÄòSerbs‚Äô, who were not a meaningful category to the Ottoman state, its records refer to ‚ÄòAlbanians‚Äô more frequently than to many other cultural or linguistic groups. The term ‚ÄòArnavud‚Äô was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as ‚ÄòArnavudluk‚Äô, and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters ‚Äî a group, in short, difficult to control. Other peoples, such as Georgians, Ahkhaz, Circassians, Tatars, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs who were frequently identified by their ethnicity, shared similar cultural traits."&lt;/ref&gt; Also a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Misha35"/&gt; The ethnic demonym ''Shqiptar√´'', derived from Latin connoting clear speech and verbal understanding gradually replaced ''Arb√´resh/Arb√´nesh'' amongst Albanian speakers between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Lloshi277"&gt;{{harvnb|Lloshi|1999|p=277}}. "They called themselves arb√´nesh, arb√´resh, the country Arb√´ni, Arb√´ri, and the language arb√´neshe, arb√´reshe. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by shqiptar√´, Shqip√´ri and shqipe. The primary root is the adverb shqip, meaning "clearly, intelligibly". There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun Deutsche, "the Germans" and "the German language" (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and Shqipni/Shqip√´ri is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of Arb√´ni, Arb√´ri. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

=== Albanian societal views of the Islamisation of Albania ===

[[File:Et'hem Bey Mosque Tirana 2.JPG|thumb|150px|right|[[Minbar]] within richly decorated interior of [[Et'hem Bey Mosque]], Tiran√´.]]
Islam and the Ottoman legacy has also been a topic of conversation among wider Albanian society. Islam and the Ottomans are viewed by many Albanians as the outcome of ''[[jihad]]'', ''anti-Christian violence'', ''[[Turkification]]'' and within those discourses Albania's sociopolitical problems are attributed as the outcome of that legacy.&lt;ref name="Endresen4748"/&gt; Some members from the Muslim community, while deemphasizing the Ottoman past, have responded to these views by criticizing what they perceive as prejudice toward Islam.&lt;ref name="Endresen4748"/&gt; Among Albanian intellectuals and other notable Albanians in the wider Balkans, discussions and at times debates about Islam, its legacy and role within Albania have occurred.&lt;ref name="Brisku181183"&gt;{{harvnb|Brisku|2013|pp=181‚Äì183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Within these discourses, controversial Orientalist, racist and biological terminology has been used by some Albanian intellectuals when discussing Islam, its legacy and contemporary role among Albanians.&lt;ref name="Sulstarova6872"&gt;{{harvnb|Sulstarova|2013|pp=68‚Äì72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ElbasaniRoy465"&gt;{{harvnb|Elbasani|Roy|2015|p=465}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in those discussions were written exchanges in newspaper articles and books between novelist [[Ismail Kadare]] of Gjirokast√´r and literary critic [[Rexhep Qosja]], an Albanian from the former Yugoslavia in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="Brisku184186"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke15"/&gt; Kadare asserted that Albania's future lay with Europe due to its ancient European roots and Christian traditions, while Qosja contended that Albanian identity was both a blend of Western (Christian) and Eastern (Islam) cultures and often adaptable to historical contexts.&lt;ref name="Brisku184186"&gt;{{harvnb|Brisku|2013|pp=184‚Äì186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke15"/&gt; Piro Misha wrote that the Islamisation of Albanians during the 17th and 18th centuries as being "two of the darkest centuries in the modern history of Albania".&lt;ref name="Misha35"&gt;{{harvnb|Misha|2002|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Misha also maintained that due to that experience "Albania was more influenced by Turco-Oriental culture than perhaps any other country in the region",&lt;ref name="Misha"&gt;{{harvnb|Misha|2002|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though he notes that Albanian Muslims were only Muslim group "in European Turkey who made common cause with their Christian compatriots to fight against the government in Constantinople."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Misha|2002|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- placement of Misha after Sulstarova noting the presence of "Orientalist, racist and biological" discussions about Islam in Albania could be construed as veering into accusations against a living person (i.e. a really serious personal attack for the largely Western audience of En-Wiki). If the intent actually was to say that Misha is Islamophobic -- I got all the pages of his essay accessed except for 35 and 36 and I couldn't find anything of that theme. Additionally: You sure he was referring to ''Islamization'' as being the negative aspect of the 1600s and 1700s rather than the wars and the pretty awful economic circumstances? Quote for 35?--&gt;

In a 2005 speech given in Britain by president, [[Alfred Moisiu]] referred to Islam in Albania as having a "European face", it being "shallow" and that "if you dig a bit in every Albanian, he can discover his Christian core".&lt;ref name="Brisku187"/&gt; The Muslim Forum of Albania responded to those and Kadare's comments and referred to them as "racist" containing "[[Islamophobia]]" and being "deeply offensive".&lt;ref name="Brisku187"&gt;{{harvnb|Brisku|2013|p=187}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following trends dating back from the communist regime, the post-communist Albanian political establishment continues to approach Islam as the faith of the Ottoman "invader".&lt;ref name="Barbullushi158"&gt;{{harvnb|Barbullushi|2010|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Olsi Jazexhi has argued that contemporary Albanian politicians akin to the communists perceive "[[Modernisation]]" to mean "De-Islamisation", making Muslim Albanians feel alienated from their Muslim traditions instead of celebrating them and embracing their Ottoman heritage.&lt;ref name="Endresen4748"&gt;{{harvnb|Endresen|2011|pp=47‚Äì48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Albanian writers have also claimed that the Albanian dedication to Islam was superficial and these arguments have been popular within the Orthodox and Catholic Albanian communities.&lt;ref name="Malcolm86"&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|2002|p=86}}. "Even more confusing was his deployment of another standard argument, using the evidence of syncretistic folk-religion to suggest that the Albanian commitment to Islam was only superficial: ‚ÄòThe Albanian Moslem has never forgotten ... his former religion to some of the saints of which he still pays tribute, such as St. George ... and St. Demeter. This argument (understandably popular among Catholic and Orthodox Albanians, but, in view of the use made of it by Slav and Greek propagandists, a dangerous one for Albanian interests) raised a potentially awkward question. If the Albanians had been so devoted to Christianity (which was at one stage their national religion), why had so many of them converted to Islam?"&lt;/ref&gt; In debates over Albanian school textbooks where some historians have asked for offensive content regarding Turks to be removed, some Christian Albanian historians countered angrily by referring to negative experiences of the Ottoman period and wanting Turkey to seek redress for the "invasion" of Albania and Islamisation of Albanians.&lt;ref name="Jazexhi14"&gt;{{harvnb|Jazexhi|2012|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious establishment views of the Islamisation of Albania ===

The official religious Christian and Muslim establishments and their clergy hold diverging views of the Ottoman period and conversion of Islam by Albanians. Both Catholic and the Orthodox clergy interpret the Ottoman era as a repressive one that contained anti-Christian discrimination and violence,&lt;ref name="Endresen237"/&gt; while Islam is viewed as ''foreign'' challenging Albanian tradition and cohesion.&lt;ref name="Endresen241"/&gt; The conversion to Islam by Albanians is viewed by both Catholic and Orthodox clergy as ''falsification'' of Albanian identity, though Albanian Muslims are interpreted as ''innocent victims'' of Islamisation.&lt;ref name="Endresen241"/&gt; Albanian Sunni Muslim clergy however views the conversion of Albanians as a ''voluntary'' process, while sidelining religious controversies associated with the Ottoman era.&lt;ref name="Endresen237"&gt;{{harvnb|Endresen|2010|p=237}} "The Muslim leaders advocate the view that the Albanians' embracing of Islam was voluntary.

"The Christians‚Äô view that the historical conversion to Islam presents a kind of falsification of national identity has interesting similarities with Serbian nationalist interpretations of Slavic conversions to Islam, though the Albanian clergy distinguish between Islam and local Muslims and not consider their compatriots‚Äô conversion as treason to the same extent. Although the Christian leaders do place Islam on the wrong side of history, its Albanian adherents are portrayed as innocent victims of the cruel polities of foreign intruders. Moreover, the Christian clergy do not exclude Albanian Muslims from the national community, and by the same token none of the Muslim leaders seem to nurture any resentment towards those who did not embrace Islam."&lt;/ref&gt; Christian identities in Albania have been forged on being in a minority position, at times with experiences of discrimination they have had historically in relation to the Muslim majority.&lt;ref name="Endresen250"/&gt; Meanwhile, Muslim clergy in Albania highlight the change of fortune the demise of the Ottoman Empire brought with the political empowerment of Balkan Christians making Muslims a religious minority{{clarify|date=July 2017}} in contemporary times.&lt;ref name="Endresen250"&gt;{{harvnb|Endresen|2010|p=250}}. "Myths of martyrdom and "unjust treatment" in the sense that the national and/or the religious community is a "victim of aggression", run like a thread through the clerics‚Äô discourse. These are partly based on the historical fact that in one way or another each community is or has been under threat: since the second half of the 19th Century, Albania and Albanians in the Balkans have been in the firing line of Christian neighbours with territorial claims, which have made efforts to assimilate, expel or even kill the population in disputed areas. This is reflected in the Communities‚Äô constructions of the national community. Orthodox and Catholic identities are shaped by the fact that Christianity is a minority religion in Albania, and that the country‚Äôs Christians have a long history as second class citizens under various forms of Muslim pressures, either as imperial, Islamist polity or under authoritarian leadership dominated by leaders with a Muslim background (Zogu and Hoxha). Conversely, the Muslim clerics focus on how the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire has given the Balkans‚Äôs Christians the upper hand politically. Islam is also a minority religion in Europe with a historical reputation as demonic and with a modern image problem in the West related to the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and global terrorist networks."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamisation of Albania within scholarship ===
{{See also|Historiography of Albania}}

Within scholarship in contemporary times, the conversion of Albanians and the legacy of Islam within Albania is a contested topic. Communist era and contemporary Albanian scholars with nationalist perspectives interpret the Ottoman period as negative and downplay the conversion to Islam as having had barely any benefits to Albanians in a socio-cultural and religious sense.&lt;ref name="Elsie34"/&gt; In 1975, Hasan Kaleshi challenged these  mainly "negative" views of the period of Islamization.&lt;ref name="Clayer135"/&gt; Kaleshi, whose views were later supported by Elsie and Schmidt-Neke,&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke15"&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt-Neke|2014|p=15.}} "Hasan Kaleshi who argued that the islamization of the majority of the Albanians saved them from assimilation into Greeks and Slavs (Kaleshi 1975)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsie34"&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2005|p=34}}. "Modern Albanian scholars tend to view the consequences of these centuries of Turkish rule as completely negative, in terms of wild Asiatic hordes ravaging and plundering a country which might otherwise have flourished in the cradle of European civilization... Scholar Hasan Kaleshi (1922‚Äì1976) has convincingly suggested that the Turkish occupation of the Balkans had at least the one positive consequence. It saved the Albanians from ethnic assimilation by the Slavs, just as the Slavic invasion of the Balkans in the sixth century had put an end to the process of Romanization which had threatened to assimilate the non-Latin-speaking ancestors of the Albanians a thousand years earlier. Although not recognized by the Turks as an ethnic minority (the population of the Ottoman Empire was divided according to religion, not according to nationality), the Albanians managed to survive as a people and indeed substantially expand their areas of settlement under Turkish rule."&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the Ottoman conquest and conversion to Islam by Albanians averted Hellenization and Slavification the same way that he argued that the Slavic invasions of the 6th century halted the [[Romanization (cultural)|romanization]] process of the progenitors of the Albanians.&lt;ref name="Elsie34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayer135"/&gt; Kaleshi maintained that though recognised within the millet system as Muslims only, the partial Islamisation of the population halted the assimilation process occurring through churches and the influence of landlords of the Greeks, Latins and Slavs.&lt;ref name="Elsie34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayer135"/&gt; Additionally the Islamisation of Albanians also resulted in the extension of the Balkan Albanian settlement area through either population movements or the assimilation of other Muslim non-Albanian elements during Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name="Elsie34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayer135"/&gt; Kaleshi's thesis has over time been distorted by some Albanians who argue that Albanians converted to Islam with the aim of keeping their national and ethnic identity, instead of Albanian identity being preserved as a consequence of Islamisation and Ottoman rule; this has been called an "inversion" of Kaleshi's argument.&lt;ref name="Clayer135"&gt;{{harvnb|Clayer|1997|pp=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lichtspiel / Kinemathek Bern''' is a [[film archive]] in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]].

In summer 2000, cinema technician Walter A. Ritschard took care of the Lichtspiel, an old cinematographic collection, and from this a regional film archive was developed. Since 2006, the Lichtspiel has been a member of the [[F√©d√©ration Internationale des Archives du Film]] (FIAF).

== History ==

=== Regional film archive ===
The Lichtspiel is concerned with preserving the national film and cinema heritage, through preservation and restoration of old materials.

=== Filmhaus Bern ===
Since 2012, the Lichtspiel is a part of the Filmhaus Bern and in this community much more a place between film production and museum. There are often a program with films from people, who work in the same house.

== Program ==
Since the opening of the Lichtspiel, there are shown every Sunday evening two film reels with short clips from the archive and gives the chance to take a view inside the collection of the archive. In this way the Lichtspiel has shown 40% of his collection today. Another part of the program contains retrospectives.

== Archiv- und Sammlungst√§tigkeit ==
Die Sammlungen des Lichtspiels setzen sich aus diversen Depositen von Filmemachern sowie privaten Sammlungsbest√§nden und zahlreichen Nachl√§ssen unterschiedlichster Pers√∂nlichkeiten zusammen.

The [[Film Collection]] contains in this moment 15'000 film reels with regional semi-professional, education and documentary films. Further it is a special interest of the archive to collect Scopitones and animation films.

The [[Library]] contains a lot of literature to film in generally and in detail a lot of Swiss film journals. There are also a lot of stuff to the technical aspects of cinema and projection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">A '''living document''', also known as an '''evergreen document''' or '''dynamic document''', is a [[document]] that is continually edited and updated. An example of a living document is an article in [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia that permits anyone to freely edit its articles, in contrast to "dead" or "static" documents, such as an article in a single edition of the ''[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]]''.

A living document may or may not have a framework for updates, changes, or adjustments.  This type of document without proper context can change away from its original purpose through multiple uncontrolled edits. This can encourage open collaboration within the network, but in some cases there can also be stagnation if no one takes on the initiative of updating the work. One reason why initiative is not taken to update the document could come from [[ambiguity effect|a sense of ambiguity]].

However, a living document may evolve through successive updates, be expanded as needed, and serve a different purpose over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shanahan|first1=Daniel R|title=A living document: reincarnating the research article|journal=Trials|date=11 April 2015|volume=16|issue=1|page=151|doi=10.1186/s13063-015-0666-5|pmc=4403711|url=http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/151|pmid=25873052}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Living documents are changed through revisions that may or may not reference previous iterative changes.  The rate of document drift depends on the structure of the original document, or original intent of such document, or guidelines for modifying such document.

==In law==
{{further|Living Constitution}}
===Canada===
In Canadian law, this concept is called the "[[living tree doctrine]]" (French: ''th√©orie de l'arbre vivant''). The 1929 case ''[[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', which decided upon the right of women to sit in the Canadian Senate, was the first to establish this principle. The case was decided by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], whereupon [[Viscount Sankey]] wrote of the ruling: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The British North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits. The object of the Act was to grant a Constitution to Canada. Like all written constitutions it has been subject to development through usage and convention...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Their Lordships do not conceive it to be the duty of this Board‚Äîit is certainly not their desire‚Äîto cut down the provisions of the Act by a narrow and technical construction, but rather to give it a large and liberal interpretation so that the Dominion to a great extent, but within certain fixed limits, may be mistress in her own house, as the provinces to a great extent, but within certain fixed limits, are mistresses in theirs.&lt;ref name = Edwards&gt;[http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/en/browseSubjects/edwardspc.asp Reference to Meaning of Word "Persons" in Section 24 of British North America Act, 1867. (Judicial Committee of The Privy Council). Edwards v. A.G. of Canada &amp;#91;1930&amp;#93; A.C. 124] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328051442/http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/en/browseSubjects/edwardspc.asp |date=March 28, 2015 }}. ''Human Rights in Canada: A Historical Perspective''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From this the approach was born what became known as the [[living tree doctrine]] which requires "large and liberal" interpretation, declaring a doctrine of constitutional interpretation that says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and progressive manner so as to adapt it to the changing times.

The living tree principle was again expressed by the Supreme Court of Canada, in Re: Same-Sex Marriage (2004), when it held that Parliament (as opposed to provincial legislatures) had the power to define marriage as including same-sex unions. It rejected claims that the constitutionally enumerated federal authority in matters of "Marriage and Divorce" could not include same-sex marriage because marriage as conceived in 1867 was necessarily opposite-sex:

{{quote|The "frozen concepts" reasoning runs contrary to one of the most fundamental principles of Canadian constitutional interpretation: that our Constitution is a living tree which, by way of progressive interpretation, accommodates and addresses the realities of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Canada, in its ruling, Re: Same-Sex Marriage, December [[2004 in Canada|2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The United States===
In United States constitutional law, the Living Constitution, also known as loose constructionism, permits the Constitution as a static document to have an interpretation that shifts over time as the cultural context changes. The opposing view, [[originalism]], holds that the original intent or meaning of the writers of the Constitution should guide its interpretation.

==In business==
In business a living document may fall under corporate [[change management]] or be shared among a team.  It may start as a draft that at some time graduates into general acceptance, or may originate as part of a formal documentation process.  Regardless of the degree of formality, a living document needs rules or guidelines for its modification.  Such guidelines allow ‚Äî and should ideally encourage ‚Äî the document's evolution over time.  It is in this sense of ''growth'' that the document can be thought of as "living."

==In technology==
In technology, living documents can be implemented using a [[wiki]]. Other common living document tools are [[Google Docs]], [[Nextcloud]] Collabora, etc.

Living documents can also be implemented by using test tools such as "HipTest"

Living documentation is a key concept in [[Specification by example]].

==In pastoral theology==
In [[pastoral theology]] the 'living document' refers to an individual person.

'''''Lophius piscatorius''''', commonly known as the '''angler''', is a [[monkfish]] in the family [[Lophiidae]]. It is found in coastal waters of the northeast [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], from the [[Barents Sea]] to the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Black Sea]]. Within some of its range, including the [[Irish Sea]], this species comprises a significant [[Commercial fishing|commercial fishery]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. (2011). [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Irish_Sea?topic=49523 ''Irish Sea''. eds. P. Saundry &amp; C.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC] Retrieved 11 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It has a very large head which is broad, flat, and depressed; the rest of the body appears to be a mere appendage. The wide mouth extends all the way around the anterior circumference of the head, and both jaws are armed with bands of long, pointed [[teeth]]. These are inclined inwards, and can be closed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but to prevent its escape from the mouth.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Angler|volume=2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[pelvic fin]]s are so articulated as to perform the functions of feet, so the fish is able to walk along the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides itself in the [[sand]] or amongst [[seaweed]]. Around its head and also along the body, the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short fronds of seaweed, a structure which, combined with the extraordinary faculty of assimilating the colour of the body to its surroundings, assists this fish greatly in [[camouflage|camouflaging]] itself in the places which it selects on account of the abundance of prey. It has no [[Scale (zoology)|scales]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Female anglers grow to a length of more than {{convert|2|m}}.

==Angling==
[[File:Lophius piscatorius MHNT.jpg|240px|thumb|Skeleton - [[MHNT]]]]
[[Image:1911 Lophius piscatorius.png|240px|thumb|''Lophius piscatorius'']]
The fish has long filaments along the middle of its head, which are, in fact, the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior [[dorsal fin]]. The filament most important to the angler is the first, which is the longest, terminates in a lappet, and is movable in every direction. The angler is believed to attract other fish by means of its [[fishing lure|lure]], and then to seize them with its enormous jaws. While it is considered probable that smaller fish are attracted in this way experiments have shown that the actions of the jaw is automatic and depends on contact of the prey with the tentacle. Its stomach is expandable and it is not unknown for these fish to swallow prey of their own size.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Lifecycle==
The [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] of the angler consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material {{convert|2|or|3|ft|cm|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|25|-|30|ft}} long drifting freely in the water. The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own little cavity. The [[larva]]e are free-swimming and their [[pelvic fin]]s are elongated into filaments.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8979">The '''Mongoose Gang''' was a  [[private army]] or [[militia]] which operated from 1970 to 1979 under the control of Sir [[Eric Gairy]], the [[List of heads of government of Grenada|Premier]] and later [[Prime Minister of Grenada|Prime Minister]] of [[Grenada]], and head of the [[Grenada United Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/COLDgairy.htm|title=Eric Gairy : Biography|accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Officially, Mongoose Gang members were called Special Reserve Police (S.R.P.) or Volunteer Constables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/bloodymonday.html|title=BLOODY MONDAY, or the "Battle of St. George's" 21 January 1974|accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the terms "police aides" and "Mongoose Gang" were sometimes used synonymously and interchangeably; although it should be added that the names of certain persons were unmistakably identified as members of the Mongoose Gang as distinct from also being police aides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/duffus56thru57.html|title=Report of the Duffus Commission of Inquiry into the Breakdown of Law &amp; Order, and Police Brutality in Grenada|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1975 Duffus Commission of Inquiry into the Breakdown of Law &amp; Order, and Police Brutality in Grenada, Nugent David, a former Commissioner of Police, confirmed that a group of men known as the Mongoose Gang were among the police aides. To his knowledge, Moslyn Bishop and his brother Willie Bishop were reputedly leaders of the gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/duffus67.html|title=Report of the Duffus Commission of Inquiry into the Breakdown of Law &amp; Order, and Police Brutality in Grenada|accessdate=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to David the police aides were under his jurisdiction because they assisted the police with their duties although they were not recruited normally as policemen who were required to undergo tests for educational and physical fitness; but they were paid through the office of the Commissioner. David said he did not know how or by whom the recruitment of police aides was done except that he knew the recruitment took place in [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]] and that after he assumed the post of acting commissioner of Police he heard from policemen that the men were selected by the Premier, Eric Gairy. As he understood the functions of the police aides, their main duties were guard duties and at times they assisted the police in searches, but they were subject to no discipline or control similar to that of the Police Force nor were any regulations ever made with respect to them. He added that in his knowledge none of the police aides was issued with firearms although he knew that some of them possessed and carried firearms on guard duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/duffus60thru62.html|title=Report of the Duffus Commission of Inquiry into the Breakdown of Law &amp; Order, and Police Brutality in Grenada|accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mongoose Gang was responsible for silencing critics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/223562/Sir-Eric-Matthew-Gairy Sir Eric Matthew Gairy (prime minister of Grenada) - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; breaking up demonstrations and murdering opponents of the Gairy regime, including [[Rupert Bishop]], the father of [[Maurice Bishop]] in January 1974. Maurice Bishop himself was beaten by members of the Mongoose Gang two months previously, in November 1973, and jailed.&lt;ref name="Jessup1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E.

In November 1974, 10 months after Grenada's independence from [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], Bishop's [[New Jewel Movement]] issued a People's Indictment calling for "power to the people" and declaring that "the Gairy Government was born in blood, baptized in fire, christened with bullets, is married to foreigners, and is resulting in death to the people".&lt;ref name="Foran2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Foran|title=Taking Power: On the Origins of Third World Revolutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szJtXBrr2poC&amp;pg=PA164|date=17 November 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44518-4|pages=164‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Grenadian general election, 1976|1976 Grenadian general election]], the Grenada United Labour Party won nine of the 15 seats, whilst the opposition People's Alliance (a coalition of the New Jewel Movement, the [[Grenada National Party]] and the United People's Party) won the remainder. However, the elections were marred by fraud (and branded fraudulent by international observers), as the Mongoose Gang had been threatening the opposition.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p301-302 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1977 Gairy began receiving advice from General [[Augusto Pinochet]] of [[Chile]] on how to deal with civil unrest. His police and military also received "counter insurgency" training from the Pinochet regime. The New Jewel Movement retaliated by developing links with [[Fidel Castro]] and his Marxist government in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/COLDgairy.htm|title=Eric Gairy|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongoose Gang was used against protesters during the 1977 [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States]] hosted by Grenada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ad1a70.html|title=Grenada: The "Mongoose Gang" in Grenada|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, a rumour circulated that Gairy would use the Gang to eliminate leaders of the New Jewel Movement while he was out of the country.&lt;ref name="Mawby2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer Mawby|title=Ordering Independence: The End of Empire in the Anglophone Caribbean, 1947-69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jrI_pys1zUC&amp;pg=PA239|date=20 August 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-27818-9|pages=239‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://writing.danmalo.info/tag/mongoose-gang/|title=Grenada: Gairy, Bishop, Balance or Coup|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, Bishop overthrew Gairy in March of that year while the latter was visiting the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.gd/biographies/eric_gairy_bio.html|title=Biography: Sir Eric Matthew Gairy|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Mongoose Gang then ceased to operate; the Gang's leader, Mosyln Bishop, a taxi driver, was subsequently sentenced later that year to fourteen years in prison for attempting to murder three people in November 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=757&amp;dat=19791208&amp;id=QzZkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vkYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2458,1135652 The Virgin Islands Daily News - Google News Archive Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name 'Mongoose Gang' originated in the 1950s, when the local health officials sought to eliminate the [[mongoose]] as a pest, and paid people who brought in mongoose tails as proof of killing the animals. The men who were employed in such work became known as the 'mongoose-gang'. Later, the name shifted to refer to gangs of political thugs on Grenada.&lt;ref name="AllsoppAllsopp2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Allsopp|author2=Jeannette Allsopp|title=Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmvSk13sIc0C&amp;pg=PA385|year=2003|publisher=University of the West Indies Press|isbn=978-976-640-145-0|pages=385‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Mongoose Gang has often been compared to the [[Tonton Macoute]] of [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/grenada/history|title=Grenada : History|accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caribbean-beat.com/issue-96/end-eric#axzz4AMgDH6uW|title=The end of Eric Gairy|accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Mervyn Sheppard was born on 21 June 1905 in [[Ireland]]. He obtained his early education at [[Marlborough College]] later at [[Cambridge University]]. He enrolled in the Malayan Civil Services (MCS) in 1928; a year after passing his qualification examination exam in London. He eventually became attached to the country and its people during his posting there. He served as a Company Commander in the [[Malaya Command|Federated Malay States Volunteer Force]] (FMSVF) from 1941 until 1942, in which he became a [[prisoner of war]] during the [[Second World War]]. He retired as a Major in the FMSVF in 1945, deciding to stay on his job in the civil service until his total retirement in 1963. He converted into Islam in 1957, taking on the name of Abdul Mubin Sheppard.

In 1958, he was appointed as the first Keeper of Public Records, whose office would eventually evolve to become the ''Arkib Negara'', or the National Archives.&lt;ref name="ANM" /&gt; One year later, he became the first director of the then-Federation of Malaya's [[National Museum (Malaysia)|own national museum]];&lt;ref name="ANM" /&gt; where he had assembled a team tasked with retrieving artefacts covering the many historical eras of Malaya from cities like [[Lisbon]] and [[London]] to be exhibited there.&lt;ref name="Utusan1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0403&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Rencana&amp;pg=re_08.htm|title=Muzium jadi darah daging|last=Noraini Abd.

He died on 11 September 1994 at the Subang Jaya Medical Centre in [[Subang Jaya]], [[Selangor]].

== Legacy ==
The Mubin Sheppard Memorial Prize was established under his name in 1996 by the Malaysia Heritage Trust to stimulate students' awareness of "the need to conserve Malaysia's built heritage and to encourage research and writings on various aspects of conservation and preservation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badanwarisan.org.my/publications/1998_1999/msmp.php|title=Mubin Sheppard Memorial Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=Badan Warisan Malaysia {{!}} Malaysia Heritage Trust|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220021442/http://www.badanwarisan.org.my/publications/1998_1999/msmp.php|archive-date=20 February 2012|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum displays are divided into four main themes: The Great Port, Global City, People‚Äôs Republic, and Wondrous Place, located in four large gallery spaces. On the ground floor, displays look at the city's urban and technological evolution, both local and national, including the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the changes in the [[British Empire]], and how these changes have impacted the city's economic development. The upper floor looks at Liverpool's particular and strong identity through examining the social history of the city, from settlement in the area from [[Neolithic]] times to the present day, migration, and the various communities and cultures which contribute to the city's diversity.&lt;ref name=themes/&gt;

The Museum also features: Little Liverpool, a gallery for children under six; History Detectives, an interactive archaeology and history resource centre; a 180-seat theatre for community and audio-visual performances and meeting facilities.&lt;ref name=themes/&gt; It also has a gallery called "City Soldiers" which tells the story of the [[King's Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/visit/galleries/soldiers/index.aspx|title=City Soldiers|publisher=Museum of Liverpool|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''museum ship''', also called a '''memorial ship''', is a [[ship]] that has been preserved and converted into a [[museum]] open to the public for educational or [[memorial]] purposes. Some are also used for training and recruitment purposes, mostly for the small number of museum ships that are still operational and thus capable of regular movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnsa.org/activities.htm Activities of the Historic Naval Ships Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808174110/http://hnsa.org/activities.htm |date=2007-08-08 }} (the international [[Historic Naval Ships Association]] website.

Accessed 2008-06-06.)&lt;/ref&gt; though many are not naval museum ships, from general merchant ships to [[tugboat|tug]]s and [[Lightvessel|lightships]]. Many, if not most, museum ships are also associated with a [[maritime museum]].

==Significance==
[[File:CruiserAurora061609.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian [[Russian cruiser Aurora|''Aurora'']], one of the few [[protected cruiser]]s that are preserved, is one of the world's most visited vessels.]]
[[Image:USS Missouri veterans.JPG|thumb|right|Former crew members of {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} pose for photos after the Anniversary of the End of World War II ceremony.]]
Relatively few ships are preserved beyond their useful life, due to the high cost of maintaining them against the ravages of the elements. Most are broken up and sold for scrap, while a relative handful are sunk as naval target practice, scuttled to create artificial reefs, and so on. Some survive because of historical significance, but more often due to luck and circumstance. Since an old ship tied up at dockside, without attention, still decays and eventually sinks, the practice of recent years has been to form some sort of preservation society, solicit donations from governments or private individuals, organize volunteer labor from the enthusiasts, and open the restored ship to visitors, usually for a fee.

The [[conservation-restoration|restoration]] and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] of museum ships presents problems for historians who are asked for advice, and the results periodically generate some controversy{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. For instance, the rigging of sailing ships has almost never survived, and so the rigging plan must be reconstructed from various sources. Studying the ships also allows historians to analyze how life on and operation of the ships took place.&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;[http://www.dsm.de/Pubs/22_04.htm ''Museum ships built in 1999: Remarks on the reconstruction of historical inland and sea-going vessels'' (abstract)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20031111101110/http://www.dsm.de/Pubs/22_04.htm |date=2003-11-11 }} - Ingo Heidbrink, Ingo; Deutsches Schiffahrtsarchiv (DSA) 22, 1999, Page 43‚Äì58&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scientific papers have been written on ship restoration and maintenance, and international conferences are held discussing the latest developments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maritime.org/conf-sched.htm Conference Proceedings] (from the 'Third International Conference on the Technical Aspects of the Preservation of Historic Vessels' (1997) webpage on the [[San Francisco Maritime Park Association]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; Some years ago, the [[Barcelona Charter]] was signed by a variety of international owner organizations of traditional vessels, and provides certain accepted minimum criteria for the restoration and operation of traditional watercraft still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Barcelona Charter", European Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Traditional Ships in Operation'' - Ingo Heidbrink (editor), Bremen (Hauschildt Verlag, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consideration is the distinction between a "real" museum ship, and a [[ship replica]]. As repairs accumulate over time, less and less of the ship is of the original materials, and the lack of old parts (or even "appropriate" work tools) may lead to the use of modern "short-cuts" (such as [[welding]] a metal plate instead of [[rivet]]ing it, as would be the case during the ships historical period).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.maritime.org/conf/conf-kearon.htm Conserving Unique and Historic Ships]'' - Kearon, John; Head of Shipkeeping, Industrial and Land Transport Conservation, [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]], paper from the Third International Conference on the Technical Aspects of the Preservation of Historic Vessels (1997) webpage on the [[San Francisco Maritime Park Association]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors without historical background are also often unable to distinguish between a historical museum ship and a (more-or-less historically relevant) ship replica, which may serve solely as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

==Museum usage==
[[File:Vasa Museum interior1.jpg|thumb|The 17th-century warship {{ship||Vasa|ship|2}} on display in the [[Vasa Museum]]]]
Typically the visitor enters via [[Wood plank|gangplank]], wanders around on the deck, then goes below, usually using the original stairways, giving a sense of how the crew got around. The interior features restored but inactivated equipment, enhanced with mementos including old photographs, explanatory displays, pages from the ship's logs, menus, and the like. Some add recorded sound effects, audio tours or video displays to enhance the experience.

In some cases, the ships radio room has been brought back into use, with volunteers operating [[amateur radio]] equipment.  Often, the [[callsign]] assigned is a variation on the original identification of the ship.  For example, the [[submarine]] {{USS|Cobia|SS-245|6}}, which had the call NBQV, is now on the air as NB9QV.  The World War II submarine {{USS|Pampanito|SS-383|6}}, berthed at the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]], had the wartime call NJVT and is now on the air as NJ6VT. In other cases, such as {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, a distinctive call (in this case KH6BB) is used.  This radio work not only helps restore part of the vessel, but also provides worldwide publicity for the museum ship.

A number of the larger museum ships have begun to offer hosting for weddings, meetings, other events, and sleepovers, and on a few ships still seaworthy, cruises. In the United States, this includes {{USS|Constitution}}{{-'}}s annual "turnaround", when the old ship is towed out into the harbor and brought back in facing the other way, so as to weather evenly. A place on the deck is by invitation or lottery only, and highly prized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themuseumresourcenetwork.org/ |title=The Museum Resource |accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many consider the [[tourism]] appeal of an interesting old vessel on the city waterfront strong enough that any port city should showcase one or more museum ships. This may even include building a [[Ship replica|replica ship]] at great expense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eb-5investors.com/POHF%20Summary.htm A Proposal to Recreate the Royal Yacht Ha'Aheo o Hawai'i (Pride of Hawaii)] ([[International Historic Watercraft Society]], via a website of the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|USCIS]] Regional Center Immigrant Investor Program.

[[Image:Nautical almanac 01.png|thumb|250px|right|Two sample pages of the 2002 Nautical Almanac published by the U.S. Naval Observatory]]

A '''nautical almanac''' is a publication describing the positions of a selection of [[celestial bodies]] for the purpose of enabling navigators to use [[celestial navigation]] to determine the position of their ship while at sea. The Almanac specifies for each whole hour of the year the position on the Earth's surface (in [[declination]] and [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]] [[hour angle]]) at which the [[sun]], [[moon]], [[planet]]s and [[first point of Aries]] is directly overhead. The positions of 57 selected [[star]]s are specified relative to the [[first point of Aries]].

In [[Great Britain]], ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]'' has been published annually by [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]], ever since the first edition was published in 1767.

In the United States, a nautical almanac has been published annually by the [[US Naval Observatory]] since 1852.&lt;ref name="USNO almanac history"/&gt; It was originally titled ''[[American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac]]''.  Since 1958, the USNO and HMNAO have jointly published a unified nautical almanac, ''[[The Astronomical Almanac]]'' for use by the navies of both countries.&lt;ref name="USNO almanac history"/&gt;  Almanac data is now available online from the US Naval Observatory.&lt;ref name="USNO celnavdata"&gt;

Also commercial almanacs were produced that combined other information. A good example would be Brown's ‚Äî which commenced in 1877 ‚Äì and is still produced annually, its early twentieth century subtitle being "Harbour and Dock Guide and Advertiser and Daily Tide Tables".  This combination of trade advertising, and information "by permission... of the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty]]" provided a useful compendium of information.  More recent editions have kept up with the changes in technology ‚Äì the 1924 edition for instance had extensive advertisements for coaling stations. Meanwhile the Reeds Nautical Almanac, published by [[Adlard Coles Nautical]], has been in print since 1932, and in 1944 was used by landing craft involved in the [[Normandy landings]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reedsnauticalalmanac.co.uk/aboutus&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Air Almanac" of the United States and Great Britain tabulates celestial coordinates for 10-minute intervals for the use in aerial navigation.  The [[Sokkia]] Corporation's annual "Celestial Observation Handbook and Ephemeris" tabulated daily celestial coordinates (to a tenth of an arcsecond) for the Sun and nine stars; it was last published for 2008.

To find the position of a ship or aircraft by [[celestial navigation]], the navigator measures with a [[sextant]] the apparent height of a celestial body above the horizon, and notes the time from a [[marine chronometer]].  That height is compared with the height predicted for a trial position; the arcminutes of height difference is how many nautical miles the position line is from the trial position.

'''New Advent''' is a website that provides [[online]] versions of various works connected with the [[Catholic Church]].

== History ==
In 1993, Kevin Knight, then a 26-year-old resident of [[Denver, Colorado]], was inspired, during the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to that city for [[World Youth Day]], to launch a project to publish the 1913 edition of the 1907‚Äì1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' on the Internet. Knight founded the website New Advent to house the undertaking. Volunteers from the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[France]] and [[Brazil]] helped in the transcription of the original material. The site went online in 1995 and transcription efforts finished in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholic.org/prwire/headline.php?ID=118|title=Online Catholic Encyclopedia Completed|publisher=Catholic Online|date=June 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Kevin Knight ‚Äì On New Advent and Digitizing Catholic Tradition |url=http://www.ignitumtoday.com/2012/07/09/interview-with-kevin-knight-on-new-advent-and-digitizing-catholic-tradition/ |publisher=Ignitum |first=Brandon |last=Vogt |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boulevard is one of the main attractions of the city and country.&lt;ref&gt; Kazakhstan - Page 99 Paul Brummell - 2012 "On the east side of the square, as Nurzhol Boulevard continues its eastward march, is the fountain composition ... Around the [[Ak Orda]] At the east end of Nurzhol Boulevard are two tall conical buildings, faced in a covering of reflective gold. North and south of these a large, curving, wall-like building, which houses various government ministries and agencies, essentially serves to enclose the space to its east, up to the bank of the River Ishim beyond."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Central Asia - Page 176 Bradley Mayhew, Greg Bloom, Paul Clammer - 2010 "Back on Nurzhol bulvar &lt;/ref&gt; Both Nurzhol Boulevard and the layout of the city were designed by renowned architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]].

'''ORM-D''' is a marking for [[mail]] or [[shipping]] in the United States that identifies '''other regulated materials for domestic transport only'''.  Packages bearing this mark contain [[Dangerous goods|hazardous material]] in a limited quantity that presents a limited hazard during transportation, due to its form, quantity, and packaging. 

'''Consumer commodity''' is a hazardous material that is packaged and distributed in a quantity and form intended or suitable for retail sale and designed for consumption by individuals for their personal care or household use purposes. This term can also include certain drugs or medicines. 

Examples of items classed ORM-D include:
* [[Aerosol can]]s
* [[Charcoal]]
* [[Drain opener]]s{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* [[Lighter]]s
* [[Nitromethane]] fuel{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* [[Perfume]]s
* [[Small arms]] [[ammunition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=49:2.1.1.3.8.2.25.1 Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 Part 172.101]&lt;/ref&gt; (not shipped as Consumer Commodity)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=49:2.1.1.3.9.3.25.14 Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 Part 173.63]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Soldering [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]]
* Some [[photographic processing|photographic chemicals]]

The [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) Title 49&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title49/49cfrv2_02.tpl The Code Of Federal Regulations Title 49 Transportation]&lt;/ref&gt; Part 171.8 defines a Consumer Commodity and those items with exceptions provided in the 172.101 table, of limited quantity, and conforming to the definition of "Consumer Commodity" may be marked and sent ORM-D.  There are weight and volume restrictions for all ORM-D packages which vary by hazard class.  For example, a gallon of a Class 3 flammable liquid PGII cannot be reclassified as ORM-D because it exceeds the limited quantity volume.  However,  a gallon of a Class 6, PGIII material is within the volume criteria for a Limited Quantity.  That gallon can then be labeled as an ORM-D if it meets the definition of a substance that can be converted from a Limited Quantity to an ORM-D.  

It is impossible to have an ORM-D that does not fit the criteria for a Limited Quantity.  First an item is determined to be a Limited Quantity, and then it is determined if it can be reclassified further to become an ORM-D.  If the item is able to be reclassified as ORM-D the proper shipping name is usually, but not always, "Consumer Commodity" as found in the 172.101 table. Other proper shipping names used for ORM-D material are Cartridges Small Arms and Cartridges Power Device. These products will no longer fall under one of the 9 hazard classes either, its "Hazard Class or Division" is now defined as "ORM-D."

Material marked "ORM-D" and shipped by surface transportation does not require hazardous shipping papers, simply an ORM-D and proper shipping name marking on the box. This marking can either be in the form of an ORM-D sticker, or written by hand.  If written by hand the letters "ORM-D" must be enclosed by a rectangle.  When transported by air, ORM-D shipments require an ORM-D-AIR marking and full hazardous shipping papers.

Both [[United Parcel Service|UPS Ground]] and [[FedEx Ground]] do not require a hazardous shipping contract to ship ORM-D packages except to Alaska and Hawaii. FedEx Ground does not transport ORM-D packages to Alaska or Hawaii. The [[United States Postal Service]] will accept ORM-D packages only for materials intended for domestic surface transportation. Its use is prohibited in international mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c3_014.htm United States Postal Service Publication 52 - Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail]&lt;/ref&gt;.  As of Jan 1, 2014, [[FedEx Ground]] will no longer accept shipments labeled as ORM-D, Consumer Commodity, however these same materials can still be shipped using a different label.  Per DOT regulations, [[FedEx Ground]] Limited Quantity packages can be shipped with a Hazardous Shipping Paper (OP-900) and Hazardous Material Certification OP-950), or without shipping papers by affixing the specific Limited Quantity Diamond Label to the package.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fedex.com/us/hazardous-materials/current-requirements/&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4900">'''Old Ball''' is a [[tradition|folk custom]] that existed in the [[Forest of Rossendale]] in [[Lancashire]], [[North West England|north-western]] [[England]] during the nineteenth century. The tradition entailed the use of a  [[hobby horse]] that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a [[sackcloth]]. It represents a regional variation of a "hooded animal" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles.

The Lancashire Old Ball custom differs from other animal head traditions in Britain by being associated with Easter; most of the others were instead carried out at [[Christmas]] time.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=142}} Demonstrating potential links to other regional traditions is the use of the name "Ball" for hobby horses in other areas. At [[Ashford, Derbyshire|Ashford]] and [[Little Hucklow]] in [[Derbyshire]], the [[Old Horse]] tradition was recorded as using hobby horses named "Ball", while at [[Alderley Edge]] in [[Cheshire]], the hobby horse was called "Young Ball".{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=142}}

==Description==
The Old Ball tradition took place around [[Easter]].{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}} The term "Ball" or "Old Ball" was the name of the hobby horse that featured in it.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}} This hobby horse consisted of a horse skull affixed to a pole, with the bottom of glass bottles for eyes. The pole was carried by a man hidden beneath a sackcloth, and there was sometimes a tale affixed to the outfit.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}}

The hobby horse was taken around by a group of about six men, who disguised themselves by blackening their faces or wearing masks.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}} This group sang a song, although its lyrics and tune were not recorded.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}} Old Ball itself would chase people in order to obtain money from them.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}}

==History and regional distribution==

The southern point of the custom's distribution lies near the foothills of the [[Forest of Rossendale]]. It was also recorded in neighbourhoods of [[Blackburn]] and [[Burnley]], near the northern margins of that forest about 15 to 20 miles north.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}}
All of the settlements in which it was recorded were [[industrial town]]s; those in the south were mostly connected to cotton spinning, while the two in the north were associated with cotton weaving.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}}

Recorded accounts of the Old Ball tradition all come from the first three quarters of the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=140}}

Old Ball was part of a wider "hooded animal" tradition that the folklorist E. C. Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=210}} Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=210, 212}} In South Wales, the [[Mari Lwyd]] tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over the Christmas period.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=94‚Äì109}} In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions ‚Äî the Padstow [['Obby 'Oss festival]] and [[Minehead Hobby Horse]] ‚Äî which take place not at Christmas time but on [[May Day]].{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=157‚Äì177}}
Although the origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|pp=93‚Äì94}} In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's [[Morris dance]] tradition, which became a "nation-wide craze" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into "a set of sharply delineated regional traditions".{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=94}}

'''Paul V. Mockapetris''' (born 1948 in Boston, Massachusetts, US) is an American [[computer scientist]] and [[Internet pioneer]], who, together with [[Jon Postel]], invented the Internet [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).

==Education==
Mockapetris graduated from the prestigious [[Boston Latin School]] in 1966, received his bachelor's degrees in physics and electrical engineering from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1971 and his doctorate in information and computer science from the [[University of California at Irvine]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=ISINames-2003&gt;[http://www3.isi.edu/about-news_story.htm?s=54 "ISI Names Dr. Paul Mockapetris Visiting Scholar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826032920/http://www3.isi.edu/about-news_story.htm?s=54 |date=2012-08-26 }}, Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, 27 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BiologyDaily-2006&gt;[http://biosphere.biologydaily.com/biology/Paul_Mockapetris "Paul Mockapetris"], ''Biology Daily'', 19 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1983, he proposed a Domain Name System architecture in RFC 882 and RFC 883. He had recognized the problem in the early [[Internet]] (then [[ARPAnet]]) of [[Hosts (file)|holding name to address translations in a single table on a single host]], and instead proposed a distributed and dynamic DNS database: essentially DNS as it exists today.&lt;ref name=ISINames-2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=BiologyDaily-2006/&gt;

The '''Rodin Museum''' is an art museum located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], that contains the largest collection of sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]'s works outside [[Paris]]. Opened in 1929, the museum is administered by the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

In 2012, the museum re-opened after a three-year, $9 million renovation that brought the museum back to its original vision of displaying Rodin's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18102098 |title=BBC News - Rodin Museum re-opens after three years of work |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Associated Press |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Rodin-Museum-in-Philadelphia-to-reopen-in-July-3563486.php#ixzz1v9CsQqed |title=Rodin Museum in Philadelphia to reopen in July |publisher=seattlepi.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
The Museum was the gift of movie-theater magnate [[Jules Mastbaum]] (1872‚Äì1926) to the city of Philadelphia. Mastbaum began collecting works by Rodin in 1923 with the intent of founding a museum to enrich the lives of his fellow citizens. Within just three years, he had assembled the largest collection of Rodin's works outside Paris, including bronze castings, plaster studies, drawings, prints, letters, and books. In 1926, Mastbaum commissioned French architects [[Paul Cret]] and [[Jacques Gr√©ber]] to design the museum building and gardens. Unfortunately, the collector did not live to see his dream realized, but his widow, [[Etta Wedell Mastbaum]] honored his commitment to the city, and the Museum opened on November 29, 1929. Murals in the museum were executed by the painter [[Franklin C. Watkins]].

==Collection==
[[File:Philly Thinker.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.0|''The Thinker'']]
The best-known of Rodin's works, ''[[The Thinker]]'' (1880‚Äì1882), sits outside the museum in the entry courtyard. Visitors once entered through a cast of ''The Gates of Hell'', located at the main entrance to the museum, which is no longer used.  This massive 5.5-m-tall bronze doorway was originally created for the Museum of Decorative Arts (which was to have been located in Paris but never came into existence).  Rodin sculpted more than 100 figures for these doors from 1880 until his death in 1917. This casting is one of the three originals; several others have been made since. Several of his most famous works, including ''The Thinker'', are actually studies for these doors which were later expanded into separate works.

The museum's several rooms house many more of the artist's works, including ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' (1886), ''[[Eternal Springtime]]'' (1884), ''The Age of Bronze'' (1875‚Äì76), and ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'', a monument commissioned by the City of [[Calais]] in 1884.

'''''The Act of Killing''''' ({{lang-id|Jagal}}, meaning "Butcher") is a 2012 [[documentary film]] about individuals who participated in the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965‚Äì66]]. The film is directed by [[Joshua Oppenheimer]] and co-directed by Christine Cynn and an anonymous Indonesian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shoard|first=Catherine|title=The Act of Killing&amp;nbsp;‚Äì review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/14/act-of-killing-review|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is a Danish-British-Norwegian [[International co-production|co-production]], presented by Final Cut for Real in Denmark and produced by Signe Byrge S√∏rensen. The executive producers were [[Werner Herzog]], [[Errol Morris]], Joram ten Brink, and [[Andr√© Singer (producer)|Andre Singer]]. It is a [[Docwest]] project of the [[University of Westminster]].

== Synopsis ==
The film focuses on the perpetrators of the [[Indonesian killings of 1965‚Äì66]] in the present day; ostensibly towards the communist community where almost a million people were killed. When [[Suharto]] overthrew [[Sukarno]], the President of Indonesia, following the failed coup of the [[30 September Movement]] in 1965, the [[Preman (Indonesian gangsters)|gangsters]] Anwar Congo and Adi Zulkadry in [[Medan]] ([[North Sumatra]]) were promoted from selling [[black market]] movie theatre tickets to leading the most powerful [[death squad]] in North Sumatra. They also extorted money from the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] as the price for keeping their lives. Anwar is said to have personally killed 1,000 people.

Today, Anwar is revered by the [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] of a paramilitary organization, [[Pemuda Pancasila]], that grew out of the death squads. The organization is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers who are openly involved in corruption, election rigging and clearing people from their land for developers.

Invited by Oppenheimer, Anwar recounts his experiences killing for the cameras, and makes scenes depicting their memories and feelings about the killings. The scenes are produced in the style of their favorite films: gangster, [[Western (genre)|Western]], and [[musical film|musical]]. Various aspects of Anwar and his friends' filmmaking process are shown, but as they begin to dramatize Anwar's own experiences, the fiction scenes begin to take over the film's form. Oppenheimer has called the result "a documentary of the imagination".

Some of Anwar's friends state that the killings were wrong, while others worry about the consequences of the story on their public image.

After Anwar plays a victim, he cannot continue. Oppenheimer, from behind the camera, states that it was worse for the victims because they knew they were going to be killed, whereas Anwar was only acting. Anwar then expresses doubts over whether or not he has [[sin]]ned, tearfully saying he does not want to think about it. He revisits the rooftop where he claims many of his killings took place, and [[retching|retches]] repeatedly while describing how he had killed people during the genocide. The dancers from the film's theatrical poster are seen before the credits begin to roll.

== Production ==
In 2001, while conducting interviews for their 2003 film ''The Globalisation Tapes'', Oppenheimer and Cynn began delving into the [[Indonesian killings of 1965‚Äì66]]. After moving up the ranks of those involved with the killings, Oppenheimer's interviews led him to meet Anwar Congo in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|title=Making a 'Killing': Joshua Oppenheimer on the half-decade he spent filming for ''The Act of Killing''|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2013-08-09/making-a-killing/|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot mostly in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], between 2005 and 2011. After seeing an early preview of ''The Act of Killing'', filmmakers [[Werner Herzog]] and [[Errol Morris]] signed on as executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fortune|first=Drew|title=Joshua Oppenheimer and Werner Herzog on ''The Act of Killing''|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/joshua-oppenheimer-and-werner-herzog-on-ithe-act-o-100900|work=[[The A.V.

Nick Schager of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called it a "masterpiece."&lt;ref&gt;Schager, Nick (17 July 2003).

In some quarters Oppenheimer has been accused of treating his subjects in bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfi-film.dk/berlin-2013/berlin-2013/the-act-of-killing-3 The Act of Killing] ''DFI Film.''

[[Australian National University]] Professor of Asian History and Politics Robert Cribb stated that the film lacks historical context.&lt;ref&gt;Cribb, Robert (April‚ÄìJune 2013). [http://www.insideindonesia.org/feature-editions/review-an-act-of-manipulation "Review: An act of manipulation?"]. Inside Indonesia.&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Oppenheimer said that "the film is essentially not about what happened in 1965, but rather about a regime in which genocide has, paradoxically, been effaced [yet] celebrated&amp;nbsp;‚Äì in order to keep the survivors terrified, the public brainwashed, and the perpetrators able to live with themselves... It never pretends to be an exhaustive account of the events of 1965. It seeks to understand the impact of the killing and terror today, on individuals and institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin, Jess (April‚ÄìJune 2013). [http://www.insideindonesia.org/current-edition/an-interview-with-joshua-oppenheimer "An interview with Joshua Oppenheimer"], ''Inside Indonesia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley Simpson, historian at the [[University of Connecticut]] and director of the Indonesia/[[East Timor]] Documentation Project at the [[National Security Archive]], states the "brilliant Oscar-nominated film" has prompted vigorous debate among Indonesians about the crimes and the need to hold responsible parties accountable, and suggests that it could have a similar effect in the United States, whose own role in the killings "has never officially been acknowledged, much less accounted for, though some of the relevant documents have been made available to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Brad Simpson (28 February 2014).

An Indonesian academic, [[Soe Tjen Marching]], analyzed the film in relation to [[Hannah Arendt]]'s theory of the [[banality of evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marching|first=Soe Tjen|title=Coming to Grips With the Banality of Mass Murder in Indonesia's Past|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/opinion/coming-to-grips-with-the-banality-of-mass-murder-in-indonesias-past/|accessdate=7 July 2013|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|date=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary subjects in the film, Anwar Congo and Herman Koto, have seen the film and neither feels deceived, according to Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer says that upon watching the film Anwar Congo "started to cry...Tearfully, he told me: 'This is the film I expected. It's an honest film, a true film.' He said he was profoundly moved and will always remain loyal to it." Oppenheimer went on to say that in the call with Congo he also became down on himself saying "There is nothing left for me to do in life but to die". Oppenheimer seeing Congo so moved and almost ashamed for what he had done, said this to him. "You're only 70 years old, Anwar. You might live another 25 years. Whatever good you do in those years is not undermined by the awful things in your past." He felt it may have been cliche, but he felt it was honest and all he could manage to say to Congo.&lt;ref&gt;Applebaum, Stephen (13 April 2013) [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/the-killing-fields-revisited-in-joshua-oppenheimers-documentary/story-fn9n8gph-1226617607946" Indonesia's killing fields revisited in Joshua Oppenheimer's documentary"], ''The Australian''.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent interview on [[Al Jazeera]]'s program ''[[101 East]]'' revealed that Anwar had misgivings about the film and the negative reaction to it in Indonesia, which was causing problems for him. He confided these concerns directly to Oppenheimer in an apparent Skype conversation displayed within the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indonesia's Killing Fields |series=101 East |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/12/2012121874846805636.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214005113/http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/12/2012121874846805636.html |archive-date=14 February 2015 |date=21 December 2012 |station=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tower Green''' is a space within the [[Tower of London]], a royal castle in [[London]], where two [[English people|English]] [[Queen consort|Queens consort]] and several other [[British nobility|British nobles]] were [[Capital punishment|executed]] by [[Decapitation|beheading]]. It was considered more dignified for nobility to be executed away from spectators, and Queens [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Catherine Howard]] and [[Lady Jane Grey]] were among the nobility beheaded here. [[Queen Victoria]] asked for information on the exact location where the executions took place and had some granite paving laid to mark the spot. However, it is unclear whether the location is indeed correct because other sources place it on the current parade ground between the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] and the entrance to the current Waterloo Barracks.

==Location==
Tower Green is an open space located south of the [[Chapel Royal]] of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St. Peter ad Vincula]].  Beheading in the privacy of the Tower Green was considered a privilege of [[Nobility|rank]]; the executed were spared insults from jeering crowds, and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] was spared bad publicity.  Other prisoners in the tower were executed in public on [[Tower Hill]], just outside the fortress, or at [[Tyburn]] on the other side of the city. In the middle of the green is a small square plot paved with [[granite]], which shows the site commonly believed to be the spot on which stood the scaffold on which private executions took place. The granite paving was specially created by order of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-84176-170-2"&gt;{{cite book

There is dispute that the memorial site is actually the scaffold site. It appears that there are sources that indicate that the site of the current memorial is merely a spot incorrectly pointed out to Queen Victoria, by an unknowing Yeoman Warder, when she inquired about the scaffold site during a visit to the Tower. Other sources describe Anne Boleyn's final walk to the scaffold, at a location on the current parade ground, between the White Tower and the entrance to the current Waterloo Barracks (not built until 1845).

==History==
During the [[Middle Ages]], the area was used as a [[cemetery|burial ground]].  As a result of relaying the 19th century granite [[Sett (paving)|sett]] stones, shallow excavations of the foundations revealed remains of a building that sat on that site. Historic plans of the Tower of London show a building at the site of the Tower Green.  It was demolished in 1684, but was rebuilt in 1685.  It was removed once again soon thereafter.  It appears that the building was used at the time as a guardhouse for the predecessors of the [[Yeomen Warders]].&lt;ref name="Archeology"&gt;{{cite web

Each of these individuals was beheaded with an [[axe]], except for Anne Boleyn who was beheaded with a [[sword]]. The bodies of all seven were buried in the Chapel of [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-84176-170-2"/&gt;

In addition to the seven listed above, there are three additional names listed on the memorial at Tower Green: '''Malcolm Macpherson''', '''Samuel Macpherson''' and '''Farquhar Shaw'''. They were soldiers of the [[Black Watch]] Regiment from the [[Scottish Highlands]] who were convicted of mutiny, and were executed at the Tower on 19 July 1743 by a twelve-man firing squad composed of their fellow soldiers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4350">'''Transcendental anatomy''', also known as '''philosophical anatomy''', was a form of [[comparative anatomy]] that sought to find ideal patterns and structures common to all organisms in nature.&lt;ref name="Bates2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Bates|title=The Anatomy of Robert Knox: Murder, Mad Science and Medical Regulation in Nineteenth-Century Edinburgh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1kBF3mfIZMC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-381-2|pages=23‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated from [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist philosophy]] in the German provinces, and culminated in Britain especially by scholars [[Robert Knox]] and [[Richard Owen]], who drew from [[Goethe]] and [[Lorenz Oken]].&lt;ref name="Bates2010" /&gt; From the 1820s to 1859, it persisted as the medical expression of natural philosophy before the [[Darwinian_revolution#1859.E2.80.931930s:_Darwin_and_his_legacy|Darwinian revolution]].&lt;ref name="Caldwell2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janis McLarren Caldwell|title=Literature and Medicine in Nineteenth-Century Britain: From Mary Shelley to George Eliot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPvTSjOmYooC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=18 November 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45664-7|pages=14‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst its various definitions, transcendental anatomy has four main tenets:
* the presupposition of an Ideal Plan among the multiplicity of visible structures in the animal and plant kingdom, and that the Plan determines function 
* the Ideal Plan acted as a force for the maintenance of anatomical uniformity (as opposed to diversity-inducing forces of Nature)
* the belief that this ''a priori'' Plan was discoverable
* the desire to discover universal Laws underlying anatomical differences.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990" /&gt;

==History==
Johann Wolfgang Goethe was one of many naturalists and anatomists in the nineteenth century who was in search of an Ideal Plan in nature. In Germany, this was known as ''Urpflanze'' for the plant kingdom and ''Urtier'' for animals. He popularized the term "[[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]" for this search. Transcendental anatomy first derived from the naturalist philosophy known as ''Naturphilosophie''.&lt;ref name="Richards2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J. Richards|title=The Meaning of Evolution: The Morphological Construction and Ideological Reconstruction of Darwin's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z-72dKSIciEC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=2 February 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-71205-5|pages=21‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s, French anatomist Etienne Reynaud Augustin Serres (1786‚Äì1868) popularized the term ''transcendental anatomy'' to refer to the collective morphological of animal development.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Cunningham|author2=Nicholas Jardine|title=Romanticism and the Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=28 June 1990|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-35685-5|pages=144‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonymous expressions such as philosophical anatomy, higher anatomy, and transcendental morphology also arose at this time.

Some advocates regarded transcendental anatomy as the ultimate explanation for biological structures, while others saw it as one of several necessary explanatory devices.&lt;ref name="CunninghamJardine1990" /&gt;

==Vertebral theory==
[[File:SkullFromTheFront.JPG|150px|thumbnail|right|The osteology of the human skull was an important theory for transcendental anatomists.]]
Transcendental anatomists theorized that the bones of the skull were "cranial vertebra", or modified bones from the vertebrae.&lt;ref name="Bates2010" /&gt; Owen ardently supported the theory as major evidence for his theory of [[homology (biology)|homology]].&lt;ref name="Gregorio2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mario a Di Gregorio|title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZK004HREqgC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|isbn=978-3-525-56972-6|pages=268‚Äì}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has since been discredited.

{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}
'''Trapper Keeper''' is a [[brand]] of loose-leaf [[ring binder|binder]] created by [[MeadWestvaco|Mead]]. Popular with students in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and parts of [[Latin America]] from the 1970s to the 1990s, it featured sliding plastic rings (instead of standard snap-closed metal binder rings), folders, and pockets to keep schoolwork and papers, and a wrap around flap with a [[Velcro]] closure (originally a metal snap closure).

Trapper Keepers usually had a theme, such as a cartoon, television show, or video game. Between 1988 and 1995, "Designer Series" Trapper Keepers featured abstract designs and later computer-generated images.

==Design history==
The Trapper Keeper was invented in the late 70's by E. Bryant Crutchfield, Director of New Ventures at the Mead Corporation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Erin |title=The History of the Trapper Keeper |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/52726/history-trapper-keeper |website=Mental Floss |accessdate=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The binder got its name because it was sold in combination with pocket folders designed by Mead called "Trappers", which differed from other pocket folders in that the pockets' three sides connected with the bottom, outside edge, and top (as opposed to the bottom, outside edge, and spine) of the folders. This design prevented papers from falling out of the Trapper's pockets when it was closed. Trappers were three-hole punched so that they could be put in any 3-ring binder, including a Trapper Keeper. In August 1978, the Trapper Keeper was tested in Wichita, Kansas, and to the surprise of Crutchfield, it completely sold out. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McCarthy |first1=Erin |title=The History of the Trapper Keeper |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/52726/history-trapper-keeper |website=Mental Floss |accessdate=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years after the Trapper Keeper was released, the design was tweaked to include a Velcro strap instead of the initial metal buckle. This design change allowed for easier customer use and more efficient manufacturing. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Designer Series ran from 1988 to 1995, which introduced "fashionable, funky and sometimes psychedelic designs... The company also made a  deal with Lisa Frank... and licensed iconic characters like Garfield and Sonic the Hedgehog." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 2007, a new version of Trapper Keeper featured a magnetic closure in place of the Velcro closure, a customizable front cover, and binder dividers instead of Trapper folders.

In 2014, another new version of the Trapper Keeper was released, featuring a metal button closure, as well as a new feature called "Snapper Trappers", which are plastic strips that act as dividers and they can have regular notebooks attached to them in addition to folders and dividers; the Snapper Trappers can be placed or removed without having to open the rings of the binder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=helloample.com |url=http://www.trapperkeeper.com |title=Trapper Keeper is Back! ‚Äî Mead¬Æ Trapper Keeper |publisher=Trapperkeeper.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2015 school season, Trapper Keeper introduced ''[[Star Wars]]'' Trapper Keeper supplies, ''[[Hello Kitty]]'' Trapper Keeper supplies, and a new patterned line called ''Fun In The Sun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=helloample.com |url=http://www.trapperkeeper.com/history#48|publisher=Trapperkeeper.com|title=Way Back When ‚Äî Mead¬Æ Trapper Keeper }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
An advanced, futuristic, titular Trapper Keeper played a prominent role in season four, episode twelve of the American animated series ''[[South Park]]''. The episode, "[[Trapper Keeper (South Park)| Trapper Keeper]]", played with various [[science fiction]] tropes, including allusions to ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and ''[[The Terminator]]''.
