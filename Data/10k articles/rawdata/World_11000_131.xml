'''Highway 95''', better known as '''Abu Haidriyah Highway''', is a major highway in the Eastern Province of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Beginning from [[King Fahd Causeway]], the highway links [[Bahrain]] to Saudi Arabia, and extends to the [[Kuwait]]i border, serving major cities such as [[Dammam]] and [[Jubail]].

It was initially built by several international companies, including Jean Lefebvre &amp; Partners, a joint venture between Entreprise Jean Lefebvre (France) and Saudi partners, who appealed to hundreds of expatriates (men) to do the job. Most of these expatriates had the only right to live a single life in camps in the desert during their stays in Saudi Arabia.

The highway is over 300 kilometers long. It is a main path for the traffic of trucks and goods movement in the area. It runs parallel to the [[Dhahran-Jubail Highway]] as they substitute for each other when either of them is undergoing maintenance or reconstruction. The highway also serves as an eastern border for [[King Fahad International Airport]] in [[Dammam]].

Projects at the present time are being done to rebuild the highway including the construction of service roads and lighting.

Abu Hadriyah Highway is estimated to have the highest rate of fatal car accidents of all of the Kingdom's major highways. The majority of accidents are attributed to individuals driving at high speeds.

'''Beovoz''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Беовоз) was a [[commuter rail]] that provided [[mass-transit]] service within the [[Belgrade]] [[metropolitan area]]. The main usage of system was to connect the suburbs with downtown [[Belgrade]]. Beovoz was operated by [[Serbian Railways]].

Belgrade suburban railway system connected the suburbs and nearby cities to the west, north and south of the city.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The Beovoz public transit system first began operation in 1992.

==Ridership==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Beovoz handled 6,182,000 passengers in 2006.

[[File:Beovoz in Novi Beograd railway station 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Beovoz 412 engine]]
[[File:Unutrašnjost BG Voza.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of a Beovoz train]]

==Service area==
{{See|List of Beovoz stations}}
There were four lines in the Belgrade underground railway network:

* Inđija - Novi Beograd - [[Vukov Spomenik railway station|Vukov Spomenik]] - [[Pančevo]] Vojlovica
* Velika Plana - [[Rakovica, Belgrade|Rakovica]] - Novi Beograd - Zemun - Inđija
* [[Mladenovac]] - Ripanj - [[Rakovica, Belgrade|Rakovica]] - [[Vukov Spomenik railway station|Vukov Spomenik]] - [[Pančevo]] Vojlovica
* [[Valjevo]] - [[Rakovica, Belgrade|Rakovica]] - [[Vukov Spomenik railway station|Vukov Spomenik]] - [[Pančevo]] Vojlovica

Most stations were above ground. [[Vukov Spomenik railway station|Vukov Spomenik]] and Karađorđev Park—the two underground stations of the Beovoz system—are located in downtown Belgrade.

==Abolishment==
Following introduction of [[BG Voz]] back in 2010, many vehicles used in Beovoz were rerouted towards new system. After the beginning of reconstruction of [[Pančevo bridge]] in 2013, some of the main lines (Belgrade-Pančevo and Valjevo-Pančevo) were abolished, while others were included in Serbian railways regional system. After this, Beovoz became officially defunct.

'''Camrail''' is a company operating passenger and freight traffic between the two largest cities in [[Cameroon]] and several smaller cities. The company was formed in 1999 and granted a 20-year concession to operate the [[Cameroon National Railways Authority|Cameroon National Railway]]. The company is a [[subsidiary]] of French investment group [[Bolloré]] and the railway has been operated by [[Comazar]], a subsidiary of Bolloré, since 1999. According to the Comazar website, the government of Cameroon owns the [[Rail tracks|track]] while the [[rolling stock]] is owned by Camrail.

According to a report by the [[World Bank]] in 2011, Camrail ranked relatively high amongst African countries for productivity indicators and was considered a regional leader in terms of implementing a concession to a non-state operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=AICD Cameroon Country Report| author=World Bank| date=2011| url=http://www.ppiaf.org/sites/ppiaf.org/files/publication/AICD-Cameroon-Country-Report.pdf| access-date=2014-05-01| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319104855/http://www.ppiaf.org/sites/ppiaf.org/files/publication/AICD-Cameroon-Country-Report.pdf#| archive-date=2013-03-19| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2016 Eséka train derailment]] took place on Camrail tracks and the company was under investigation by the government and was sued by relatives of the 79 passengers who died in the crash.

On 21 October 2016 at approximately 1100 local time, a [[2016 Eséka train derailment|passenger train derailed]] close to the town of [[Eséka]]. The train, traveling from the capital [[Yaoundé]] to the country's main port and economic hub, ([[Douala]]), was crammed with people because of road traffic disruption between the two cities and came off the tracks just before reaching Eséka. Initial reports are over 60 killed with many hundreds injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/22/dozens-killed-and-hundreds-injured-in-cameroon-train-derailment|title=Sixty-three killed and 500 injured in train derailment in Cameroon|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2016-10-22|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the accident is currently unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1958">'''Centre of West African Studies''' ('''CWAS''') is a division of the School of Historical Studies at the [[University of Birmingham]], England. The centre provides teaching and research into issues of African [[International Development|development]], [[African culture|culture]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[African politics|politics]], [[African history|history]], and the legacies of the [[African diaspora]], particularly in the [[UK]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[North America]]. 

CWAS offers undergraduate and postgraduate study programs in a number of Africa-related fields.

It is home to the John Fage Library, which houses the CWAS Archives and Electronic Music Database, and the Danford Collection, a unique collection of priceless African artifacts and cultural products.

==History==
The Centre was founded in 1963 by [[ John Fage]], a scholar of African (particularly [[Ghana]]ian) history, who during his career wrote several seminal works on the history of the African continent, including ''History of Africa'' (now in its 4th edition), ''Africa Discovers Her Past'', and ''Ghana: A Historical Interpretation'', which developed out of a series of lectures sir john cabot read at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1956. The Danford Collection evolved out of a collection of African cultural artifacts that were brought to the UK by a British civil servant after his posting in [[West Africa]], and has been expanded over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3449">The '''Council of Lillebonne''' was a meeting of the nobles and clergy of Normandy where, among other things, the expedition of [[William the Conqueror]], then Duke of Normandy, was approved. It was held at [[Lillebonne]], in the northeast of Normandy. [[Wace]], the 12th-century historian, wrote of the council, convened shortly before the actual invasion, likely in January 1066.  [[William of Poitiers]], a chronicler of the Norman invasion, claims that the duke also obtained the consent of [[Pope Alexander II]] for the invasion, along with a papal banner.

The council, also called the Norman Council and Assembly of Lillebonne, began with the refusal of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] to relinquish the crown of England.  Two such councils were held, a smaller council of trusted advisors and a larger council to discuss the planned conquest.  Relatives and allies of William participated including many of the proven [[Companions of William the Conqueror|Companions of William]]:
* [[Robert, Count of Mortain]], half-brother of William
* [[William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford]], cousin of William and a proven companion, a strong advocate of the invasion who convinced the doubters that the mission was feasible
* [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], William’s half-brother
* [[Odo, Count of Champagne]], William’s brother-in-lae
* [[Richard, Count of Évreux]], father of [[William, Count of Évreux]], a proven companion
* [[Hugh of Eu, Bishop of Lisieux]], brother of the traitor Busac
* [[Roger de Beaumont]], who murdered William’s tormentor [[Roger I of Tosny]], who advised William but did not participate in the invasion due to his advanced years
* [[Raoul IV de Conches]], grandson of Roger of Tosny
* [[Hugh de Grandmesnil]], a proven companion of William’s, originally banished but reinstated
* [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]], who had previously cursed William
* [[Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville]], a known companion of William’s
* [[Hugh de Montfort, Lord of Montfort-sur-Risle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seigneurs de Montfort-sur-Risle (Bastembourg)|url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/NORMAN%20NOBILITY.htm#_Toc384196844}}&lt;/ref&gt; a known companion of William’s
* [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey]].

Cajoled by William FitzOsbern, the council approved the invasion plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Edward A.|title=The Norman Council and the Assembly of Lillebonne|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William of Poitiers nevertheless describes the council and gives an account of a debate that took place between among the nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some formal meeting probably was held, it is unlikely that there was significant debate, as the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and those assembled would want to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1078">'''Enclosed cremation cemetery''' is a term used by [[archaeologist]]s to describe a type of [[cemetery]] found in north western [[Europe]] during the late [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]]. They are similar to [[urnfield]] burial grounds in that they consist of a concentration of pits containing [[cremation|cremated remains]] which have usually also been placed into pottery vessels. However they are also surrounded by a circular or oval bank and outer ditch which gives them their name. The most famous example is [[Stonehenge]] which functioned as such a cemetery during its early use when it was a simple earthwork [[Enclosure (archaeology)|
enclosure]]. They are interpreted as being variations on the ritual and funerary practice of enclosing significant sites of activity during the period, also exhibited by [[henge]]s and [[stone circle]]s.

The '''Estonian Security Police and SD''' ({{lang-de|Sicherheitspolizei und SD Estland}}, {{lang-et|Eesti Julgeolekupolitsei ja SD}}), or '''Sipo''', was a security police force created by the Germans in 1942 that integrated both Germans and Estonians within a unique structure mirroring the German [[Sicherheitspolizei]].&lt;ref name="birn"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Birn, Ruth Bettina| authorlink = Ruth Bettina Birn|year = 2001 | title = Collaboration with Nazi Germany in Eastern Europe: the Case of the Estonian Security Police|journal=Contemporary European History| volume = 10 | issue =2 | pages=181–198 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | doi =10.1017/S0960777301002016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the German occupation in 1941, the German Army created police ''Prefekts'' based upon the old Estonian police model. In 1942 a new Sicherheitspolizei structure was installed. The new Sipo force was designed by [[Martin Sandberger]], leader of [[Einsatzkommando#Einsatzkommando 1a|Einsatzkommando 1a]]. It was a unique joint structure that consisted of a German component called "Group A" with departments A-I to A-V and an Estonian component called "Group B" with corresponding departments. The Estonian Sipo wore the same uniforms as their German counterparts, and attended Sipo schools in the Reich.&lt;ref name="birn"/&gt;

In the area of tax policy, '''Exchange of Information''' is a critical tool in assuring compliance with tax codes. As the economy becomes increasingly [[globalized]] taxpayers gain greater freedom to move between countries and regions. Tax authorities, however, are restrained by national borders. In order for governments to ensure the proper application of their tax laws, the free and accurate exchange of information is critical. The [[OECD]] [[Centre for Tax Policy and Administration]] works to improve flow of information in this area and establish a legal framework to facilitate it.&lt;ref&gt;Exchange of Information, OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, OECD.org, 16 July 2007 http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_33767_1_1_1_1_1,00.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
Fiji's main island is known as Viti Levu and it is from this that the name "Fiji" is derived, though the common English pronunciation is based on that of their island neighbours in [[Tonga]]. Its emergence can be described as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fijians first impressed themselves on European consciousness through the writings of the members of the expeditions of [[James Cook|Cook]] who met them in Tonga. They were described as formidable warriors and ferocious cannibals, builders of the finest vessels in the Pacific, but not great sailors. They inspired awe amongst the Tongans, and all their Manufactures, especially bark cloth and clubs, were highly valued and much in demand. They called their home Viti, but the Tongans called it Fisi, and it was by this foreign pronunciation, Fiji, first promulgated by Captain James Cook, that these islands are now known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijihighcommission.org.uk/about_1.html About Fiji], section on Europeans in Fiji. Fiji High Commission to the United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Feejee", the Anglicised spelling of the Tongan pronunciation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Albert J.|title=The Forerunners of the Fijian Dictionary|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society|date=December 1974|volume=83|issue=4|pages=443–457|jstor=20705027}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used in accounts and other writings until the late 19th century, by missionaries and other travellers visiting Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barbour|first=Thomas|title=The Frogs of the Fiji Islands|journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|year=1923|volume=75|pages=111–115|jstor=4063878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scarr|first=Deryck|title=Fiji: A short history|year=1984|publisher=Institute for Polynesian Studies, Brigham Young University—Hawaii Campus|isbn=978-0-939154-36-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IkoxAQAAIAAJ|oclc=611678101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early settlement and development of Fijian culture===

Located in the central [[Pacific Ocean]], Fiji's [[Geography of Fiji|geography]] has made it both a destination and a crossroads for migrations for many centuries.
According to oral tradition, the [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] of today are descendants of the chief [[Lutunasobasoba]] and those who arrived with him on the [[Kaunitoni]] canoe.  Landing at what is now [[Vuda]], the settlers moved inland to the [[Nakauvadra]] mountains.  Though this oral tradition has not been independently substantiated, the Fijian government officially promotes it, and many tribes today claim to be descended from the children of Lutunasobasoba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usp.ac.fj/index.php?id%3D6482 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201135049/http://www.usp.ac.fj/index.php?id=6482 |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} Dr Patrick D. Nunn&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pottery]] art from Fijian towns shows that Fiji  was settled by [[Austronesian people]]s before or around 3500 to 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, with [[Melanesia]]ns following around a thousand years later, although the question of Pacific migration still lingers. 
It is believed that the [[Lapita people]] or the ancestors of the [[Polynesians]] settled the islands first but not much is known of what became of them after the [[Melanesians]] arrived; they may have had some influence on the new culture, and archaeological evidence shows that they would have then moved on to [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]] and even [[Hawai'i]].
[[Archeology|Archeological]] evidence shows signs of settlement on [[Moturiki Island]] from 600 BC and possibly as far back as 900 BC.
Aspects of Fijian culture are similar to the Melanesian culture of the western [[pacific Ocean|Pacific]] but have a stronger connection to the older Polynesian cultures. Trade between Fiji and neighbouring archipelagos long before European contact is testified by the [[canoe]]s made from native Fijian trees found in Tonga and Tongan words being part of the language of the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] group of islands. Pots made in Fiji have been found in Samoa and even the [[Marquesas Islands]].

In the 10th century, the [[Tu'i Tonga Empire]] was established in [[Tonga]], and Fiji came within its sphere of influence. The Tongan influence brought [[Polynesia]]n customs and language into Fiji. The empire began to decline in the 13th century.

Across {{convert|1000|km}} from east to west, Fiji has been a nation of many languages. Fiji's history was one of settlement but also of mobility and over the centuries, a unique Fijian culture developed. Large elegant watercraft with rigged sails called ''[[drua]]'' were constructed in Fiji, some being exported to Tonga. Distinctive village architecture evolved consisting of communal and individual [[Bure (Fiji)|''bure'']] and ''vale'' housing with an advanced system of rampants and moats usually being constructed around the more important settlements. Pigs were domesticated for food and a variety of agricultural plantations such as bananas existed from an early stage. Villages would also be supplied with water brought in by constructed wooden aqueducts. Fijians lived in societies that were led by chiefs, elders and notable warriors. Spiritual leaders, often called ''bete'', were also important cultural figures and the production and consumption of [[kava|''yaqona'']] was part of their ceremonial and community rites. Fijians developed a monetary system where the polished teeth of the [[sperm whale]], called ''tambua'', became an active currency. A type of writing also existed which can be seen today in various petroglyphs around the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|publisher=Fiji Times|location=Suva}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also produced a refined [[Tapa cloth|''masi'' cloth]] textile industry with the material being used to make sails and clothes such as the ''malo'' and the ''liku''. As with most other human civilisations, warfare was an important part of everyday life in pre-colonial Fiji and the Fijians were noted for their use of weapons especially war-clubs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.new-guinea-tribal-arts.com/fijian-war-clubs/|title=Fijian War clubs {{!}} Native weapons from Fiji {{!}} sell club {{!}} sell native weapon|date=2018-03-19|work=new guinea tribal arts|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poisoned arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Adolph|title=The hill tribes of Fiji|date=1922|publisher=Seeley|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/hilltribesoffiji00brew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of Europeans and colonialism in the late 1700s, many elements of Fijian culture were either repressed or modified to ensure European, namely British, control. This was especially the case concerning traditional Fijian spiritual beliefs. Early colonists and missionaries utilised and conflated the concept of [[cannibalism]] in Fiji to give a moral imperative for colonial intrusion. By labelling native Fijian customs as "debased and primitive", they were able to promote a narrative that Fiji was a "paradise wasted on savage cannibals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banivanua-Mar|first1=Tracey|title=Cannibalism and Colonialism: Charting colonies and frontiers in 19th century Fiji|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=2010|volume=52|issue=2|pages=255–281|jstor=40603087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extravagant stories made during the 19th century, such as that regarding [[Ratu Udre Udre]] who is said to have consumed 872 people and to have made a pile of stones to record his achievement,&lt;ref&gt;Sanday, Peggy Reeves (1986) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SYW6EzB9rYkC&amp;pg=PA166 Divine hunger: cannibalism as a cultural system]'', Cambridge University Press, p. 166, IBNS 0521311144.&lt;/ref&gt; permitted an enduring racial typecast of the "uncivilised" Fijian. Cannibalism, as an impression, was an effective racial tool deployed by the colonists that has endured through the 1900s and into the modern day. Authors such as Deryck Scarr,&lt;ref name=Scarr&gt;{{cite book|first=Daryck|last=Scarr|title=A Short History of Fijiyear=1984|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, have perpetuated 19th century claims of "freshly killed corpses piled up for eating" and ceremonial mass human sacrifice on the construction of new houses and boats.&lt;ref&gt;Scarr, page 19&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fiji was known as the ''Cannibal Isles'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanities.cqu.edu.au/history/52148/modules/pacific_peoplesA.html |title=Pacific Peoples, Melanesia/Micronesia/Polynesia |accessdate=1 March 2005 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301062252/http://humanities.cqu.edu.au/history/52148/modules/pacific_peoplesA.html |archivedate=1 March 2005 }}, [[Central Queensland University]].&lt;/ref&gt; other more recent research doubts even the existence of cannibalism in Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arens|first1=William|title=The Man-Eating Myth|date=1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is not without criticism, and perhaps the most accurate account of cannibalism in 19th century Fiji may come from [[William MacGregor]], the long term chief medical officer in British colonial Fiji. During the [[Little War (Fiji)|Little War]] of 1876, he stated that the rare occasion of tasting of the flesh of the enemy was done "to indicate supreme hatred and not out of relish for a gastronomic treat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=A.H.|title=Letters and Notes written during the disturbances in the highlands of Viti Levu, Fiji, 1876.

Recent archaeological research conducted on Fijian sites has begun to shed light on the accuracy of some of these European accounts of cannibalism. Studies conducted by scholars including Degusta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Degusta|first=David|date=1999|title=Fijian Cannibalism: Osteological Evidence from Navatu|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=110|pages=215–241|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochrane,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cochrane|first=Ethan|date=2004|title=Culturally Modified Human Remains Recovered from an Earth-Oven Interment on Waya Island, Fiji|url=|journal=Archaeology in Oceania|volume=39|pages=54–59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jones&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=S|date=2012|title=Kana Tamata or Feasts of Men: An Interdisciplinary Approach for Identifying Cannibalism in Prehistoric Fiji|url=|journal=Freshwater Biology|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide evidence that cannibalism has been practiced in Fiji through skeletal modifications such as those due to burning or cutting. In the Jones 2015 study, isotopic analysis of bone collagen provided evidence that human flesh had been consumed by Fijians, although it was likely a small and not necessarily regular part of the diet.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, these archaeological accounts indicate that cannibalistic practices were likely more varied and less ubiquitous than European settlers originally described. Exocannibalism, or cannibalism of members of outsider tribes, and cannibalism practiced as a means of violence or revenge probably play a significantly smaller role than European accounts suggested, with nonviolent and ritualistic practices being more likely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Early interaction with Europeans ===
[[File:Urville-Viti-Lebouka2.jpg|thumb|Levuka, 1842]]

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Abel Tasman]] was the first known [[Europe]]an visitor to Fiji, sighting the northern island of [[Vanua Levu]] and the North [[Taveuni]] archipelago in 1643 while looking for the Great Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery;jsessionid=ch285bg7t494l?method=4&amp;dsid=2222&amp;dekey=Abel+Tasman&amp;gwp=8&amp;curtab=2222_1&amp;sbid=lc05b&amp;linktext=Abel%20Tasman Abel Janszoon Tasman Biography], ''www.answers.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Cook]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] navigator, visited one of the southern [[Lau Islands|Lau]] islands in 1774.  It was not until 1789, however, that the islands were charted and plotted, when [[William Bligh]], the castaway captain of {{HMS|Bounty}}, passed [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]] and sailed between the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu en route to [[Jakarta|Batavia]], in what is now Indonesia.  [[Bligh Water]], the strait between the two main islands, is named after him, and for a time, the Fiji Islands were known as the ''Bligh Islands.''

The first Europeans to maintain substantial contact with the Fijians were [[sandalwood]] merchants, whalers and [[sea cucumber|"beche-de-mer"]] (sea cucumber) traders. Some of the Europeans who came to Fiji in this period were accepted by the locals and were allowed to stay as residents. Probably the most famous of these was a Swede by the name of Kalle Svenson, better known as [[Charles Savage (beachcomber)|Charlie Savage]]. Charlie was permitted to take wives and establish himself in a high rank in [[Bau (island)|Bau]] society in exchange for helping defeat local adversaries. In 1813, however, Charlie became a victim of this lifestyle and was killed in a botched raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|publisher=Fiji Times|location=Suva|pages=29–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1820s, [[Levuka]] was established as the first European-style town in Fiji, on the island of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]].  The market for "beche-de-mer" in China was lucrative and British and American merchants set up processing stations on various islands. Local Fijians were utilised to collect, prepare and pack the product which would then be shipped to Asia. A good cargo would result in a half-yearly profit of around $25,000 for the dealer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=Charles|title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition. Vol. 3|date=1849|location=Philadelphia|page=220|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gvAKAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fijian workers were often given firearms and ammunition as an exchange for their labour, and by the end of the 1820s most of the Fijian chiefs had muskets and many were skilled at using them. Some Fijian chiefs soon felt confident enough with their new weapons to forcibly obtain more destructive weaponry from the Europeans. In 1834, men from Viwa and Bau were able to take control of the French ship ''L'amiable Josephine'' and use its cannon against their enemies on the [[Rewa River]], although they later ran it aground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|pages=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian missionaries like David Cargill also arrived in the 1830s from recently converted regions such as [[Tonga]] and [[Tahiti]], and by 1840 the European settlement at Levuka had grown to about 40 houses with former whaler, [[David Whippey]], being a notable resident. The religious conversion of the Fijians was a gradual process which was observed first-hand by Captain [[Charles Wilkes]] of the United States Exploring Expedition. Wilkes wrote that "all the chiefs seemed to look upon Christianity as a change in which they had much to lose and little to gain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=Charles|title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition Vol. 3|date=1849|page=155|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gvAKAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianised Fijians, in addition to forsaking their spiritual beliefs, were pressured into cutting their hair short, adopting the [[Sulu (skirt)|sulu]] form of dress from Tonga and fundamentally changing their marriage and funeral traditions. This process of enforced cultural change was called ''lotu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Adolph|title=Hill Tribes of Fiji|date=1922|publisher=Seeley|location=London|page=25|url=https://archive.org/details/hilltribesoffiji00brew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensification of conflict between the cultures increased and Wilkes was also involved in organising a large punitive expedition against the people of [[Malolo]]. He ordered an attack with rockets which acted as makeshift incendiary devices. The village, with the occupants trapped inside, quickly became an inferno with Wilkes himself noting that the "shouts of men were intermingled with the cries and shrieks of the women and children" as they burnt to death. Wilkes demanded the survivors should "sue for mercy" and if not "they must expect to be exterminated". Around 57 to 87 Maloloan people were killed in this encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=Charles|title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition Vol 3|date=1849|page=278|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gvAKAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cakobau and the wars against Christian infiltration ===
[[File:Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa.jpg|thumb|Ratu [[Tanoa Visawaqa]].]]
[[File:Cakobau, died February 1883, photograph by Francis H. Dufty.jpg|thumb|Ratu [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], ''Tui Viti'']]
The 1840s was a time of conflict where various Fiji clans attempted to assert dominance over each other. Eventually, a warlord by the name of [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] of [[Bau Island (Fiji)|Bau Island]] was able to become a powerful influence in the region. His father was [[Ratu]] [[Tanoa Visawaqa]], the [[Vunivalu of Bau|Vunivalu]] (a chiefly title meaning ''Warlord,'' often translated also as ''Paramount Chief'') who had previously defeated the much larger [[Burebasaga]] confederacy and succeeded in subduing much of western Fiji. Cakobau, following on from his father, became so dominant that he was able to expel the Europeans from Levuka for five years over a dispute about their giving of weapons to his local enemies. In the early 1850s, Cakobau went one step further and decided to declare war on all Christians. His plans were thwarted after the missionaries in Fiji received support from the already converted Tongans and the presence of a British warship. The Tongan Prince [[Enele Ma'afu]], a Christian, had established himself on the Island of [[Lakeba]] in the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] archipelago in 1848, forcibly converting the local people to the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].  Cakobau and other chiefs in the west of Fiji regarded Ma'afu as a threat to their power and resisted his attempts to expand Tonga's dominion. Cakobau's influence, however, began to wane and his heavy imposition of taxes on other Fijian chiefs, who saw him at best as [[Primus inter pares|first among equals]], caused them to defect from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time the [[United States]] also became interested in asserting their power in the region and they threatened intervention following a number of incidents involving their consul in the Fiji islands, [[John Brown Williams]].  In 1849, Williams had his trading store looted following an accidental fire, caused by stray cannon fire during a [[Fourth of July]] celebration, and in 1853 the European settlement of Levuka was burnt to the ground. Williams blamed Cakobau for both these incidents and the US representative wanted Cakobau's capital at Bau destroyed in retaliation. A naval blockade was instead set up around the island which put further pressure on Cakobau to give up on his warfare against the foreigners and their Christian allies. Finally, on April 30, 1854, Cakobau offered his ''soro'' (supplication) and yielded to these forces. He underwent the "lotu" and converted to Christianity. The traditional Fijian temples in Bau were destroyed and the sacred ''nokonoko'' trees were cut down. Cakobau and his remaining men were then compelled to join with the Tongans, backed by the Americans and British, to subjugate the remaining chiefs in the region who still refused to convert. These chiefs were soon defeated with Qaraniqio of the [[Rewa Province|Rewa]] being poisoned and Ratu Mara of Kaba being hanged in 1855. After these wars, most regions of Fiji, except for the interior highland areas, had been forced into giving up much of their traditional systems and were now vassals of Western interest. Cakobau was retained as a largely symbolic representative of the Fijian people and was allowed to take the ironic title of "Tui Viti" ("King of Fiji"), but the overarching control now lay with foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|pages=76–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cotton, confederacies and the Kai Colo ===
[[File:Tui Namosi, Kai Colo.jpg|thumb|left|Kai Colo warrior]]
The rising price of cotton in the wake of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) saw a flood of hundreds of settlers come to Fiji in the 1860s from [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] in order to obtain land and grow cotton. Since there was still a lack of functioning government in Fiji, these planters were often able to get the land in violent or fraudulent ways such as exchanging weapons or alcohol with Fijians who may or may not have been the true owners. Although this made for cheap land acquisition, competing land claims between the planters became problematic with no unified government to resolve the disputes. In 1865, the settlers proposed a confederacy of the seven main native kingdoms in Fiji to establish some sort of government. This was initially successful and Cakobau was elected as the first president of the confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Gravelle, pg.102&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of Fiji.svg|thumb|Flag of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of Fiji, 1865–1867]]

With the demand for land high, the white planters started to push into the hilly interior of [[Viti Levu]], the largest island in the archipelago. This put them into direct confrontation with the Kai Colo, which was a general term to describe the various Fijian clans resident to these inland districts. The Kai Colo were still living a mostly traditional lifestyle, they were not Christianised and they were not under the rule of Cakobau or the confederacy. In 1867, a travelling missionary named [[Thomas Baker (missionary)|Thomas Baker]] was killed by Kai Colo in the mountains at the headwaters of the [[Sigatoka River]]. The acting British consul, [[John Bates Thurston]], demanded that Cakobau lead a force of Fijians from coastal areas to suppress the Kai Colo. Cakobau eventually led a campaign into the mountains but suffered a humiliating loss with 61 of his fighters being killed.&lt;ref&gt;Gravelle, pp.102–107&lt;/ref&gt; Settlers also came into conflict with the local eastern Kai Colo people called the Wainimala. [[John Bates Thurston]] called in the [[Australia Station]] section of the [[Royal Navy]] for assistance. The Navy duly sent Commander [[Rowley Lambert]] and {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} to conduct a punitive mission against the Wainimala. An armed force of 87 men shelled and burnt the village of Deoka and a skirmish ensued which resulted in the deaths of over forty Wainimala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166803071 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[Sydney Mail]] |volume=IX, |issue=429 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 September 1868 |accessdate=9 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kingdom of Fiji (1871–1874) ===
{{main|Kingdom of Fiji}}
[[File:Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Fiji_(1871-1874).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Kingdom of Fiji]], 1871–1874]]
After the collapse of the confederacy, [[Enele Ma'afu|Ma'afu]] established a stable administration in the [[Lau Islands]] and the Tongans, therefore, were again becoming influential. Other foreign powers such as the United States were also considering the possibility of annexing Fiji. This situation was not appealing to many settlers, almost all of whom were British subjects from [[Australia]]. Britain, however, still refused to annex the country and subsequently a compromise was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63106962 |title=The Empire. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=5767 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=11 May 1870 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1871, [[George Austin Woods]], an ex-lieutenant of the Royal Navy, managed to influence [[Cakobau]] and organise a group of like-minded settlers and chiefs into forming a governing administration. Cakobau was declared the monarch (''Tui Viti'') and the Kingdom of Fiji was established. Most Fijian chiefs agreed to participate and even Ma'afu chose to recognise Cakobau and participate in the [[constitutional monarchy]]. However, many of the settlers had come from British colonies like [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]] where negotiation with the [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous people]] almost universally involved the barrel of a gun. As a result, several aggressive, racially motivated opposition groups, such as the British Subjects Mutual Protection Society, sprouted up. One group called themselves the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a homage to the [[white supremacist]] group in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article191569882 |title=No title |newspaper=[[The Ballarat Courier]] |issue=1538 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=22 May 1872 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when respected individuals such as [[Charles St Julian]], Robert Sherson Swanston and John Bates Thurston were appointed by Cakobau, a degree of authority was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60446405 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=Illustrated Australian News For Home Readers |issue=187 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=16 July 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=154 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three kai colo, ca. 1873, carte de visite by Francis Herbert Dufty.jpg|thumb|left|Three Kai Colo men in traditional Fijian attire]]
With the rapid increase in white settlers into the country, the desire for land acquisition also intensified. Once again, conflict with the Kai Colo in the interior of [[Viti Levu]] ensued. In 1871, the killing of two settlers named Spiers and Mackintosh near the [[Ba River (Fiji)]] in the north-west of the island prompted a large [[punitive expedition]] of white farmers, imported slave labourers and coastal Fijians to be organised. This group of around 400 armed vigilantes, including veterans of the [[US Civil War]], had a battle with the Kai Colo near the village of Cubu in which both sides had to withdraw. The village was destroyed and the Kai Colo, despite being armed with muskets, received numerous casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158947917 |title=FIJIAN EXPERIENCES. |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |volume=XXVIII, |issue=1576 |location=South Australia |date=16 December 1871 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Kai Colo responded by making frequent raids on the settlements of the whites and Christian Fijians throughout the [[Ba (province)|district of Ba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170155477 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[Advocate]] |volume=IV, |issue=160 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=3 February 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the east of the island on the upper reaches of the [[Rewa River]], villages were burnt and a "great many" Kai Colo were shot by the vigilante settler squad called the Rewa Rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170157875 |title=MASSACRE OF NATIVES BY SETTLERS IN FIJI. |newspaper=[[Advocate]] |volume=IV, |issue=196 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=12 October 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Cakobau government did not approve of the settlers taking justice into their own hands, it did want the Kai Colo subjugated and their land sold off. The solution was to form an army. Robert S. Swanston, the minister for Native Affairs in the Kingdom, organised the training and arming of suitable Fijian volunteers and prisoners to become soldiers in what was invariably called the King's Troops or the Native Regiment. In a similar system to the [[Native Police]] that was present in the colonies of [[Australia]], two white settlers, James Harding and W. Fitzgerald, were appointed as the head officers of this paramilitary brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article194847556 |title=LETTER FROM FIJI. |newspaper=[[Hamilton Spectator]] |issue=1083 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=14 August 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of this force did not sit well with many of the white plantation owners as they did not trust an army of Fijians to protect their interests.

The situation intensified further in early 1873 when the Burns family were killed by a Kai Colo raid in the Ba River area. The Cakobau government deployed 50 King's Troopers to the region under the command of Major Fitzgerald to restore order. The local whites, with their own large force under the leadership of Mr White and Mr de Courcy Ireland, refused their posting and a further deployment of another 50 troops under Captain Harding was sent to emphasise the government's authority. To prove the worth of the Native Regiment, this augmented force went into the interior and massacred about 170 Kai Colo people at Na Korowaiwai. Upon returning to the coast, the force were met by the white settlers who still saw the government troops as a threat. A skirmish between the government's troops and the white settlers' brigade was only prevented by the timely intervention of Captain William Cox Chapman of {{HMS|Dido|1869|6}} who promptly detained Mr White and Mr de Courcy Ireland, forcing the group to disband. The authority of the King's Troops and the Cakobau government to crush the Kai Colo was now total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5851961 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=8 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=16 April 1873 |accessdate=12 April 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From March to October 1873, a force of about 200 King's Troops under the general administration of R.S. Swanston with around 1000 coastal Fijian and white volunteer auxiliaries, led a campaign throughout the highlands of Viti Levu to annihilate the Kai Colo. Major Fitzgerald and Major H.C. Thurston (the brother of [[John Bates Thurston]]) led a two pronged attack throughout the region. The combined forces of the different clans of the Kai Colo made a stand at the village of Na Culi. The Kai Colo were defeated with dynamite and fire being used to flush them out from their defensive positions amongst the mountain caves. Many Kai Colo were killed and one of the main leaders of the hill clans, Ratu Dradra, was forced to surrender with around 2000 men, women and children being taken prisoner and sent to the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63234385 |title=LATEST FROM FIJI. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=668 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=29 August 1873 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the months after this defeat, the only main resistance was from the clans around the village of Nibutautau. Major H.C. Thurston crushed this resistance in the two months following the battle at Na Culi. Villages were burnt, Kai Colo were killed and a further large number of prisoners were taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article162658560 |title=FIJI ISLANDS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Mail And New South Wales Advertiser]] |volume=XVI, |issue=694 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=18 October 1873 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=512 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operations were now over. About 1000 of the prisoners (men, women and children) were sent to [[Levuka]] where some were hanged, the rest being sold into [[slavery]] and forced to work on various plantations throughout the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blackbirding and slavery in Fiji ===
{{main|Blackbirding#In Fiji}}
[[File:Melanesian Cultural Area.png|thumb|Map of [[Melanesia]]]]

The [[blackbirding]] era began in Fiji in 1865 when the first [[New Hebrides|New Hebridean]] and [[Solomon Island]] labourers were transported there to work on cotton plantations. The [[American Civil War]] had cut off the supply of cotton to the international market when the Union blockaded southern ports. Cotton cultivation was potentially an extremely profitable business. Thousands of European planters flocked to Fiji to establish plantations but found the natives unwilling to adapt to their plans. They sought labour from the [[Melanesia]]n islands. On 5 July 1865 [[Ben Pease]] received the first licence to provide 40 labourers from the [[New Hebrides]] to Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janesoceania.com/oceania_blackbirding1/index.htm |title=The Story of Blackbirding in the South Seas – Part 2 |author=Jane Resture| publisher=Janesoceania.com |date= |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Queensland]] governments tried to regulate this recruiting and transport of labour. Melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years, paid three pounds per year, issued with basic clothing and given access to the company store for supplies. Most Melanesians were recruited by deceit, usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts, and then locked up. The living and working conditions for them in Fiji were worse than those suffered by the later [[Demographics of India|Indian]] [[indenture]]d labourers. In 1875, the chief medical officer in Fiji, Sir [[William MacGregor]], listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1000 labourers. After the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages, but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the Fiji waters. The British sent warships to enforce the law (Pacific Islanders' Protection Act of 1872) but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted.

[[File:Seizure of blackbirder Daphne.jpg|thumb|left|Seizure of the blackbirder ''Daphne'']]
A notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the [[brig]] ''Carl'', organised by Dr James Patrick Murray,&lt;ref name="G. Elmslie, 1979"&gt;R. G. Elmslie, 'The Colonial Career of James Patrick Murray', ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Surgery'', (1979) 49(1):154-62&lt;/ref&gt; to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of Fiji.  Murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books, so to appear to be church [[missionaries]].  When islanders were enticed to a religious service, Murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats.  During the voyage Murray shot about 60 islanders.  He was never brought to trial for his actions, as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;James A. Michener &amp; A. Grove Day, "Bully Hayes, South Sea Buccaneer", in ''Rascals in Paradise'', London: Secker &amp; Warburg 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G. Elmslie, 1979"/&gt; The captain of the ''Carl'', Joseph Armstrong, was later sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="G. Elmslie, 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20–23 Nov 1872, 1 March 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the blackbirded labour from other Pacific islands, thousands of people indigenous to the Fijian archipelago were also sold into slavery on the plantations. As the white settler backed Cakobau government, and later the British colonial government, subjugated areas in Fiji under its power, the resultant prisoners of war were regularly sold at auction to the planters. This not only provided a source of revenue for the government, but also dispersed the rebels to different, often isolated islands where the plantations were located. The land that was occupied by these people before they became slaves was then also sold off for additional revenue. An example of this is the Lovoni people of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau island]], who after being defeated in a war with the Cakobau government in 1871, were rounded up and sold off to the settlers at ₤6 per head. Two thousand Lovoni men, women and children were sold and their period of slavery lasted five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60865675 |title=A FIJIAN PLANTER'S CONFESSION. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=6379 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 September 1872 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, after the Kai Colo wars in 1873, thousands of people from the hill tribes of [[Viti Levu]] were sent to [[Levuka]] and sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article198499905 |title=GENERAL NEWS. |newspaper=[[Leader]] |volume=XXVII, |issue=940 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=3 January 1874 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=24 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warnings from the [[Royal Navy]] stationed in the area that buying these people was illegal were largely given without enforcement and the British consul in Fiji, Edward Bernard Marsh, regularly turned a blind eye to this type of labour trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60874042 |title=NINE MONTHS IN FIJI AND OTHER ISLANDS. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=6014 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=13 July 1871 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British colony ===
==== Annexation by the British in 1874 ====
Despite achieving military victories over the Kai Colo, the Cakobau government was faced with problems of legitimacy and economic viability. Indigenous Fijians and white settlers refused to pay taxes and the cotton price had collapsed. With these major issues in mind, [[John Bates Thurston]] approached the British government, at Cakobau's request, with another offer to cede the islands.  The newly elected [[Tory]] British government under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] encouraged expansion of the empire and was therefore much more sympathetic to annexing Fiji than it had been previously.
The murder of Bishop [[John Coleridge Patteson]] of the [[Melanesian Mission]] at [[Nukapu]] in the [[Reef Islands]] had provoked public outrage, which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than 150 Fijians on board the brig ''Carl.''  Two British commissioners were sent to Fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation.  The question was complicated by manoeuvrings for power between Cakobau and his old rival, [[Enele Ma'afu|Ma'afu]], with both men vacillating for many months. On 21 March 1874, Cakobau made a final offer, which the British accepted.  On 23 September, [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]], soon to be appointed the [[British Empire|British]] [[Governor of Fiji]], arrived on [[HMS Dido (1869)|HMS ''Dido'']] and received Cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute. After some vacillation, Cakobau agreed to renounce his ''[[Tui Viti]]'' title, retaining the title of ''Vunivalu'', or Protector. The formal cession took place on 10 October 1874, when Cakobau, Ma'afu, and some of the senior Chiefs of Fiji signed two copies of the [[Deed of Cession (Fiji)|Deed of Cession]].  Thus the [[Colony of Fiji]] was founded; 96 years of British rule followed.

==== Measles epidemic of 1875 ====
To celebrate the annexation of Fiji, Hercules Robinson, who was [[Governor of New South Wales]] at the time, took Cakobau and his two sons to [[Sydney]].  There was a [[measles]] outbreak in that city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article197680057 |title=Latest News. |newspaper=[[Evening Journal]] |volume=VII, |issue=1905 |location=South Australia |date=8 April 1875 |accessdate=15 April 2018 |page=2 (SECOND EDITION) |via=National Library of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the three Fijians all came down with the disease. On returning to Fiji, the colonial administrators decided not to quarantine the ship that the convalescents travelled in. This was despite the British having a very extensive knowledge of the devastating effect of infectious disease on an unexposed population. In 1875–76, an epidemic of [[measles]] resultant of this decision killed over 40,000 Fijians,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=645:our-country&amp;catid=68:about-fiji-&amp;Itemid=196 “Historical Time line”]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140914/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=645%3Aour-country&amp;catid=68%3Aabout-fiji-&amp;Itemid=196 |date=29 June 2011 }}.

BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Fijians who survived were of the opinion that this failure of quarantine was a deliberate action to introduce the disease into the country. Whether this is the case or not, the decision, which was one of the first acts of British control in Fiji, was at the very least grossly negligent.&lt;ref&gt;Gravelle, Kim (1983), pg. 139–143&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sir Arthur Gordon and the "Little War" ====
[[File:Sir_Arthur_Hamilton_Gordon.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]]]
[[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]] was replaced as [[Governor of Fiji]] in June 1875 by [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Sir Arthur Hamilton Gordon]]. Gordon was immediately faced with an insurgency of the Qalimari and Kai Colo people. In early 1875, colonial administrator [[Edgar Leopold Layard]], had met with thousands of highland clans at Navuso in [[Viti Levu]] to formalise their subjugation to British rule and the Christian religion. Layard and his delegation managed to spread the [[measles]] epidemic to the highlanders, causing mass deaths in this population. As a result, anger at the British colonists flared throughout the region and a widespread uprising quickly took hold. Villages along the [[Sigatoka River]] and in the highlands above this area refused British control and Gordon was tasked with quashing this rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes written during the disturbances in the highlands of Viti Levu, 1876|date=1879|publisher=R&amp;R Clark|location=Edinburgh|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes01stangoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what Gordon himself termed the "Little War", the suppression of this uprising took the form of two co-ordinated military campaigns in the western half of Viti Levu. The first was conducted by Gordon's second cousin, Arthur John Lewis Gordon, against the Qalimari insurgents along the Sigatoka River. The second campaign was led by [[Louis Knollys]] against the Kai Colo in the mountains to the north of the river. Governor Gordon invoked a type of martial law in the area where A.J.L. Gordon and Knollys had absolute power to conduct their missions outside of any restrictions of legislation. The two groups of rebels were kept isolated from each other by a force led by Walter Carew and [[George Le Hunte]] who were stationed at Nasaucoko. Carew also ensured the rebellion did not spread east by securing the loyalty of the Wainimala people of the eastern highlands. The war involved the use of the soldiers of the old Native Regiment of Cakobau supported by around 1500 Christian Fijian volunteers from other areas of Viti Levu. The colonial [[Government of New Zealand]] provided most of the advanced weapons for the army including one hundred [[Snider Rifle|Snider rifles]].

The campaign along the Sigatoka River was conducted under a [[scorched earth]] policy whereby numerous rebel villages were burnt and their fields ransacked. After the capture and destruction of the main fortified towns of Koroivatuma, Bukutia and Matanavatu, the Qalimari surrendered ''en masse''. Those who weren't killed in the fighting were taken prisoner and sent to the coastal town of Cuvu. This included 827 men, women and children as well as the leader of the insurgents, a man named Mudu. The women and children were distributed to places like [[Nadi]] and [[Nadroga-Navosa Province|Nadroga]]. Of the men, 15 were sentenced to death at a hastily conducted trial at [[Sigatoka]]. Governor Gordon was present, but chose to leave the judicial responsibility to his relative, A.J.L. Gordon. Four were hanged and ten, including Mudu, were shot with one prisoner managing to escape. By the end of proceedings the Governor noted that "my feet were literally stained with the blood that I had shed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes Vol. 1|date=1879|page=441|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes01stangoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern campaign against the Kai Colo in the highlands was similar but involved removing the rebels from large, well protected caves in the region. Knollys managed to clear the caves "after some considerable time and large expenditure of ammunition". The occupants of these caves included whole communities and as a result many men, women and children were either killed or wounded in these operations. The rest were taken prisoner and sent to the towns on the northern coast. The chief medical officer in British Fiji, [[William MacGregor]], also took part both in killing Kai Colo and tending to their wounded. After the caves were taken, the Kai Colo surrendered and their leader, Bisiki, was captured. Various trials were held, mostly at Nasaucoko under Le Hunte, and 32 men were either hanged or shot including Bisiki, who was killed trying to escape.&lt;ref name="Letters and Notes Vol. 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes Vol. 2|date=1879|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes00stangoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of October 1876, the "Little War" was over and Gordon had succeeded in vanquishing the rebels in the interior of Viti Levu. Those insurgents who weren't killed or executed were sent into exile with hard labour for up to 10 years. Some non-combatants were allowed to return to rebuild their villages, but many areas in the highlands were ordered by Gordon to remain depopulated and in ruins. Gordon also constructed a military fortress, Fort Canarvon, at the headwaters of the Sigatoka River where a large contingent of soldiers were based to maintain British control. He renamed the Native Regiment, the [[Armed Native Constabulary]] to lessen its appearance of being a military force.&lt;ref name="Letters and Notes Vol. 2"/&gt;
 
In order to further consolidate social control throughout the colony, Governor Gordon introduced a system of appointed chiefs and village constables in the various districts to both enact his orders and report any disobedience from the populace. Gordon adopted the chiefly titles ''Roko'' and ''Buli'' to describe these deputies and established a [[Great Council of Chiefs]] which was directly subject to his authority as Supreme Chief.  This body remained in existence until being suspended by the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]]-backed interim government in 2007 and only abolished in 2012.
Gordon also extinguished the ability of Fijians to own, buy or sell land as individuals, the control being transferred to colonial authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=France|first1=Peter|title=The founding of an orthodoxy: Sir Arthur Gordon and the doctrine of the Fijian way of life|journal=Journal of the Polynesian Society|date=1968|volume=77|issue=1|pages=6–32|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_77_1968/Volume_77%2C_No._1/The_founding_of_an_orthodoxy%3A_Sir_Arthur_Gordon_and_the_doctrine_of_the_Fijian_way_of_life%2C_by_Peter_France%2C_p_6_-_32|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indian indenture system in Fiji====
{{main|Indian indenture system|Indian indenture ships to Fiji|Repatriation of indentured Indians from Fiji}}
Gordon decided in 1878 to import indentured labourers from [[India]] to work on the [[sugarcane]] fields that had taken the place of the cotton plantations.  The 463 Indians arrived on 14 May 1879 – the first of some 61,000 that were to come before the scheme ended in 1916.  The plan involved bringing the Indian workers to Fiji on a five-year contract, after which they could return to India at their own expense; if they chose to renew their contract for a second five-year term, they would be given the option of returning to India at the government's expense, or remaining in Fiji.  The great majority chose to stay.  The [[Queensland Act]], which regulated indentured labour in Queensland, was made law in Fiji also.

Between 1879 and 1916, tens of thousands of Indians moved to Fiji to work as [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]], especially on [[sugarcane]] [[plantation]]s. A total of 42 ships made 87 voyages, carrying Indian [[indenture]]d labourers to Fiji. Initially the ships brought labourers from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], but from 1903 all ships except two also brought labourers from [[Madras]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]]. A total of 60,965 passengers left India but only 60,553 (including births at sea) arrived in Fiji. A total of 45,439 boarded ships in Calcutta and 15,114 in Madras. [[Sailing ship]]s took, on average, seventy-three days for the trip while steamers took 30 days. The shipping companies associated with the labour trade were [[Nourse Line]] and [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]].

[[Repatriation of indentured Indians from Fiji]] began on 3 May 1892, when the ''[[British Peer (ship)|British Peer]]'' brought 464 repatriated Indians to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. Various ships made similar journeys to Calcutta and [[Chennai|Madras]], concluding with ''Sirsa''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 1951 voyage. In 1955 and 1956, three ships brought Indian labourers from Fiji to Sydney, from where the labourers flew to [[Mumbai|Bombay]].
Indentured Indians wishing to return to India were given two options. One was travel at their own expense and the other free of charge but subject to certain conditions. To obtain free passage back to India, labourers had to have been above age twelve upon arrival, completed at least five years of service and lived in Fiji for a total of ten consecutive years. A child born to these labourers in Fiji could accompany his or her parents or guardian back to India if he or she was under twelve.
Due to the high cost of returning at their own expense, most indentured immigrants returning to India left Fiji around ten to twelve years after arrival. Indeed, just over twelve years passed between the voyage of the first ship carrying indentured Indians to Fiji (the ''[[Leonidas (ship)|Leonidas]]'', in 1879) and the first ship to take Indians back (the ''[[British Peer (ship)|British Peer]]'', in 1892).
Given the steady influx of ships carrying indentured Indians to Fiji up until 1916, repatriated Indians generally boarded these same ships on their return voyage. The total number of repatriates under the Fiji indenture system is recorded as 39,261, while the number of arrivals is said to have been 60,553. Because the return figure includes children born in Fiji, many of the indentured Indians never returned to India.
Direct return voyages by ship ceased after 1951. Instead, arrangements were made for flights from Sydney to Bombay, the first of which departed in July 1955. Labourers still travelled to Sydney by ship.

==== The Tuka rebellions ====
With almost all aspects of indigenous Fijian social life being controlled by British authorities, a number of charismatic individuals preaching dissent and return to pre-colonial culture were able to forge a following amongst the disenfranchised. These movements were called Tuka, which roughly translates as "those who stand up". The first Tuka movement, was led by Ndoongumoy, better known as Navosavakandua which means "he who speaks only once". He told his followers that if they returned to traditional ways and worshipped traditional deities such as Degei and Rokola, their current condition would be transformed with the whites and their puppet Fijian chiefs being subservient to them. Navosavakandua was previously exiled from the [[Viti Levu]] highlands in 1878 for disturbing the peace and the British quickly arrested him and his followers after this open display of rebellion. He was again exiled, this time to [[Rotuma]] where he died soon after his 10-year sentence ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Adolph|title=Hill tribes of Fiji|date=1922|page=236|url=https://archive.org/details/hilltribesoffiji00brew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Tuka organisations, however, soon appeared. The British were ruthless in their suppression of both the leaders and followers with figureheads such as Sailose being banished to an asylum for 12 years. In 1891, entire populations of villages who were sympathetic to the Tuka ideology were deported as punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Martha|title=Neither Cargo nor Cult|date=1995|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=100–118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ey0ms3khaAC|isbn=978-0822315933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in the highlands of [[Vanua Levu]], where locals had re-engaged in traditional religion, the [[Governor of Fiji]], [[John Bates Thurston]], ordered in the Armed Native Constabulary to destroy the towns and the religious relics. Leaders were jailed and villagers exiled or forced to amalgamate into government-run communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicole|first1=Robert|title=Disturbing History|date=2011|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/1607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1914, [[Apolosi Nawai]] came to the forefront of Fijian Tuka resistance by founding a co-operative company that would legally monopolise the agricultural sector and boycott European planters. The company was called the Viti Kabani and it was a hugely successful. The British and their proxy Council of Chiefs were not able to prevent the Viti Kabani's rise and again the colonists were forced to send in the Armed Native Constabulary. Apolosi and his followers were arrested in 1915 and the company collapsed in 1917. Over the next 30 years, Apolosi was re-arrested, jailed and exiled, with the British viewing him as a threat right up to his death in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gravelle|first1=Kim|title=Fiji's Times|date=1983|pages=179–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiji in World War I and II====
Fiji was only peripherally involved in [[World War I]].  One memorable incident occurred in September 1917 when [[Count]] [[Felix von Luckner]] arrived at [[Wakaya Island]], off the eastern coast of Viti Levu, after his raider, {{SMS|Seeadler|1888|6}}, had [[Ship grounding|run aground]] in the [[Cook Islands]] following the shelling of [[Papeete]] in the French territory of [[Tahiti]].  On 21 September, the district police inspector took a number of Fijians to Wakaya, and von Luckner, not realizing that they were unarmed, unwittingly surrendered.

Citing unwillingness to exploit the Fijian people, the [[British Empire|colonial authorities]] did not permit Fijians to enlist.  One Fijian of chiefly rank, a greatgrandson of Cakobau's, did join the [[French Foreign Legion]], however, and received [[France]]'s highest military decoration, the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]].  After going on to complete a [[LLB|Law]] degree at [[Oxford University]], this same chief returned to Fiji in 1921 as both a war hero and the country's first-ever university graduate.  In the years that followed, [[Lala Sukuna|Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna]], as he was later known, established himself as the most powerful chief in Fiji and forged embryonic institutions for what would later become the modern Fijian nation.

[[File:Flag of Fiji (1924-1970).svg|thumb|Flag of Fiji 1924–1970]]
By the time of [[World War II]], the United Kingdom had reversed its policy of not enlisting natives, and many thousands of Fijians volunteered for the [[Fiji Infantry Regiment]], which was under the command of [[Edward Cakobau|Ratu Sir Edward Cakobau]], another greatgrandson of Seru Epenisa Cakobau. The regiment was attached to New Zealand and Australian army units during the war.

Because of its central location, Fiji was selected as a training base for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  An airstrip was built at [[Nadi]] (later to become an international airport), and gun emplacements studded the coast.  Fijians gained a reputation for bravery in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], with one war correspondent describing their ambush tactics as "death with velvet gloves". Corporal [[Sefanaia Sukanaivalu]], of [[Yucata]], was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], as a result of his bravery in the [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Battle of Bougainville]].

====Responsible government====
[[File:Kamisese Mara.jpg|thumb|[[Kamisese Mara]]]]
A constitutional conference was held in [[London]] in July 1965, to discuss constitutional changes with a view to introducing responsible government.  Indo-Fijians, led by [[A. D. Patel]], demanded the immediate introduction of full self-government, with a fully elected legislature, to be elected by universal suffrage on a common voters' roll.  These demands were vigorously rejected by the [[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] delegation, who still feared loss of control over natively owned land and resources should an Indo-Fijian dominated government come to power.  The British made it clear, however, that they were determined to bring Fiji to self-government and eventual independence.  Realizing that they had no choice, Fiji's chiefs decided to negotiate for the best deal they could get.

A series of compromises led to the establishment of a cabinet system of government in 1967, with [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Kamisese Mara]] as the first [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]].  Ongoing negotiations between Mara and [[Sidiq Koya]], who had taken over the leadership of the mainly Indo-Fijian [[National Federation Party]] on Patel's death in 1969, led to a second constitutional conference in London, in April 1970, at which Fiji's Legislative Council agreed on a compromise electoral formula and a timetable for independence as a fully sovereign and independent nation with the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].  The Legislative Council would be replaced with a bicameral [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], with a [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]] dominated by Fijian chiefs and a popularly elected [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]].  In the 52-member House, Native Fijians and Indo-Fijians would each be allocated 22 seats, of which 12 would represent ''[[Communal constituencies]]'' comprising voters registered on strictly ethnic roles, and another 10 representing ''[[National constituencies]]'' to which members were allocated by ethnicity but elected by [[universal suffrage]].  A further 8 seats were reserved for "[[General electors]]" – [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Banaba Island|Banaban Islanders]], and other minorities; 3 of these were "communal" and 5 "national".  With this compromise, Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970.

=== Independence (1970) ===
The British granted Fiji independence in 1970. Democratic rule was interrupted by two [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coups]] in 1987 precipitated by a growing perception that the government was dominated by the [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] (Indian) community. The second 1987 coup saw both the Fijian monarchy and the [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor General]] replaced by a non-executive president and the name of the country changed from ''[[British Dominions|Dominion]] of Fiji'' to ''Republic of Fiji'' and then in 1997 to ''Republic of the Fiji Islands''. The two coups and the accompanying civil unrest contributed to heavy Indo-Fijian emigration; the resulting population loss resulted in economic difficulties and ensured that Melanesians became the majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=110|title=Fiji Islands: From Immigration to Emigration |last=Lal|first=Brij V|date=April 2003|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|accessdate=14 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the new constitution institutionalised ethnic Fijian domination of the political system. The [[Group Against Racial Discrimination]] (GARD) was formed to oppose the unilaterally imposed constitution and to restore the 1970 constitution. In 1992 [[Sitiveni Rabuka]], the Lieutenant Colonel who had carried out the 1987 coup, became Prime Minister following elections held under the new constitution. Three years later, Rabuka established the [[Constitutional Review Commission (Fiji)|Constitutional Review Commission]], which in 1997 wrote a new constitution which was supported by most leaders of the indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian communities. Fiji was re-admitted to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

The year 2000 brought along [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|another coup]], instigated by [[George Speight]], which effectively toppled the government of [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], who in 1997 had become the country's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister following the adoption of the new constitution. Commodore [[Frank Bainimarama]] assumed executive power after the resignation, possibly forced, of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Later in 2000, Fiji was rocked by [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'état|two mutinies]] when rebel soldiers went on a rampage at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks. The [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] ordered the reinstatement of the constitution, and in September 2001, to restore democracy, a general election was held which was won by interim Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]]'s [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lal|first=Brij V.|date=2002|title=In George Speight's Shadow: Fiji General Elections of 2001|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|volume=37|issue=1|pages=87–101|jstor=25169576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Qarase government amid much controversy proposed a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]] with power to recommend compensation for victims of the 2000 coup and amnesty for its perpetrators. However, the military, especially the nation's top military commander, Frank Bainimarama, strongly opposed this bill. Bainimarama agreed with detractors who said that to grant amnesty to supporters of the present government who had played a role in the violent coup was a sham. His attack on the legislation, which continued unremittingly throughout May and into June and July, further strained his already tense relationship with the government.

In late November and early December 2006, Bainimarama was instrumental in the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état]]. Bainimarama handed down a list of demands to Qarase after a bill was put forward to parliament, part of which would have offered pardons to participants in the 2000 coup attempt. He gave Qarase an ultimatum date of 4 December to accede to these demands or to resign from his post. Qarase adamantly refused either to concede or resign, and on 5 December the president, Ratu [[Josefa Iloilo]], was said to have signed a legal order dissolving the parliament after meeting with Bainimarama.

In April 2009, the [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Fiji Court of Appeal]] ruled that the 2006 coup had been illegal. This began the [[2009 Fijian constitutional crisis]]. President Iloilo abrogated the constitution, removed all office holders under the constitution including all judges and the governor of the Central Bank. He then reappointed Bainimarama under his "New Order" as interim Prime Minister and imposed a "Public Emergency Regulation" limiting internal travel and allowing press censorship.

For a country of its size, Fiji has fairly large armed forces, and has been a [[Fiji and the United Nations|major contributor]] to [[UN peacekeeping]] missions in various parts of the world. In addition, a significant number of former military personnel have served in the lucrative security sector in [[Iraq]] following the 2003 [[United States|US]]-led invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hermione Gee|title=Fijian peacekeepers in Iraq aren't just a battalion — they're a choir|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-05/fijian-peacekeepers-iraq-arent-just-battalion-theyre-choir|website=Public Radio International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiji covers a total area of some {{convert|194000|km2}} of which around 10% is land.

Fiji is the hub of the South West Pacific, midway between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Tonga]]. The archipelago is located between 176° 53′ east and 178° 12′ west. The 180° meridian runs through [[Taveuni]] but the [[International Date Line]] is bent to give uniform time (UTC+12) to all of the Fiji group. With the exception of Rotuma, the Fiji group lies between 15° 42′ and 20° 02′ south. [[Rotuma]] is located {{convert|220|nmi}} north of the group, {{convert|360|nmi}} from Suva, 12° 30′ south of the equator.

Fiji consists of 332&lt;ref name="Factbook-Fiji"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fj.html | title=Fiji | website=The World Factbook | publisher=CIA | accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of islands of Fiji|islands]] (of which 106 are inhabited) and 522 smaller islets. The two most important [[List of islands of Fiji|islands]] are [[Viti Levu]] and [[Vanua Levu]], which account for about three-quarters of the total land area of the country. The [[List of islands of Fiji|islands]] are mountainous, with peaks up to 1,324 metres (4,341&amp;nbsp;ft), and covered with thick [[tropical forest]]s.

The highest point is [[Mount Tomanivi]] on Viti Levu. Viti Levu hosts the capital city of [[Suva]], and is home to nearly three-quarters of the population. Other important towns include [[Nadi]] (the location of the international airport),&lt;ref name="cruise-rep" /&gt; and [[Lautoka]], Fiji's second city with large sugar cane mills and a seaport.

The main towns on Vanua Levu are [[Labasa]] and [[Savusavu]]. Other [[List of islands of Fiji|islands and island groups]] include [[Taveuni]] and [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]] (the third and fourth largest islands, respectively), the [[Mamanuca Group]] (just off Nadi) and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa Group]], which are popular tourist destinations, the [[Lomaiviti (archipelago)|Lomaiviti Group]], off Suva, and the remote [[Lau Islands|Lau Group]]. [[Rotuma]], some {{convert|270|nmi}} north of the archipelago, has a [[Local government in Fiji|special administrative status]] in Fiji. [[Conway Reef|Ceva-i-Ra]], an uninhabited reef, is located about {{convert|250|nmi}} southwest of the main archipelago.

=== Climate ===

The climate in Fiji is [[tropical marine climate|tropical marine]] and warm year round with minimal extremes. The warm season is from November to April and the cooler season lasts from May to October. Temperatures in the cool season still average {{convert|22|C|F}}. Rainfall is variable, with the warm season experiencing heavier rainfall, especially inland. For the larger islands, rainfall is heavier on the southeast portions of the islands than on the northwest portions, with consequences for agriculture in those areas. Winds are moderate, though cyclones occur about once a year (10–12 times per decade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Country |url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=645&amp;Itemid=196 |website=fiji.gov |publisher=Government of the Republicof the Fiji Islands |date=November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323104147/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=645&amp;Itemid=196 |archive-date=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiji: Land |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Fiji-republic-Pacific-Ocean/Land#ref1003314 |website=britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suva, Fiji Monthly Weather |url=https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/Suva+Fiji+FJXX0009:1:FJ |website=weather.com |publisher=The Weather Company |access-date=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Fiji}}

Politics in Fiji normally take place in the framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic wherein the Prime Minister of Fiji is the [[head of government]] and the President the [[Head of State of Fiji|Head of State]], and of a multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of Fiji]], and the [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

=== 2006 military takeover ===
{{Main|2006 Fijian coup d'état}}

Citing corruption in the government, Commodore [[Frank Bainimarama|Josaia Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama]], Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, staged a military takeover on 5 December 2006 against the prime minister that he had installed after a 2000 coup. There had also been a military coup in 1987. The commodore took over the powers of the presidency and dissolved the parliament, paving the way for the military to continue the takeover. The coup was the culmination of weeks of speculation following conflict between the elected prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, and Commodore Bainimarama. Bainimarama had repeatedly issued demands and deadlines to the prime minister. A particular issue was previously pending legislation to pardon those involved in the 2000 coup.

In the wake of the takeover, reports emerged of alleged intimidation of some of those critical of the interim regime.

On 9 April 2009, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court decision that Cdre. Bainimarama's takeover of Qarase's government was lawful and declared the interim government to be illegal. Bainimarama agreed to step down as interim PM immediately, along with his government, and president Iloilo was to appoint "a distinguished person independent of the parties to this litigation as caretaker Prime Minister, ...to direct the issuance of writs for an election".

On 10 April 2009, President Iloilo [[2009 Fijian constitutional crisis|suspended the Constitution]] of Fiji, dismissed the Court of Appeal and, in his own words, "appoint[ed] [him]self as the Head of the State of Fiji under a new legal order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_14712.shtml |title=President's Address to the Nation |accessdate=22 April 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818171844/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_14712.shtml |archivedate=18 August 2009 }}, fiji.gov.fj (10 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; As President, Iloilo had been Head of State prior to his abrogation of the Constitution, but that position had been determined by the Constitution itself. The "new legal order" did not depend on the Constitution, thus requiring a "reappointment" of the Head of State. "You will agree with me that this is the best way forward for our beloved Fiji", he said. Bainimarama was re-appointed as Interim Prime Minister; he, in turn, re-instated his previous cabinet.

On 2 May 2009, Fiji became the first nation ever to have been suspended from participation in the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], for its failure to hold democratic elections by the date promised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumsec.org/pages.cfm/newsroom/press-statements/2009/forum-chair-on-suspension-of-fiji-military-regime-from-pif.html Statement by Forum Chair on suspension of the Fiji military regime from the Pacific Islands Forum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324102614/http://www.forumsec.org/pages.cfm/newsroom/press-statements/2009/forum-chair-on-suspension-of-fiji-military-regime-from-pif.html |date=24 March 2012 }}; PIFS Press Statement (21/09), 2 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RNZI_46320"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=46320 |title=Chair of Pacific Islands Forum says Fiji has been suspended |date=2 May 2009 |website=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it remains a member of the Forum.

On 1 September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The action was taken because Cdre. Bainimarama failed to hold elections by 2010 as the Commonwealth of Nations had demanded after the 2006 coup. Cdre. Bainimarama stated a need for more time to end a voting system that heavily favoured ethnic Fijians at the expense of the multi-ethnic minorities. Critics, however, claimed that he had suspended the constitution and was responsible for human rights violations by arresting and detaining opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/34580/213088/010909fijisuspended.htm |title=Fiji suspended from the Commonwealth |date=1 September 2009 |publisher=Commonwealth.org |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904153829/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/34580/213088/010909fijisuspended.htm |archivedate=4 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8231717.stm |title=Fiji suspended from Commonwealth |publisher=BBC News |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2010 New Year's address, Cdre. Bainimarama announced the lifting of the Public Emergency Regulations (PER). However, the PER was not rescinded until January 8, 2012 and the Suva Philosophy Club was the first organisation to reorganise and convene public meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Fiji Times, 'PER Lifted' (12 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The PER had been put in place in April 2009 when the former constitution was abrogated. The PER had allowed restrictions on speech, public gatherings, and censorship of news media and had given security forces added powers. He also announced a nationwide consultation process leading to a new Constitution under which the [[Fijian general election, 2014|2014 elections]] will be held.

On 14 March 2014, the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]] voted to change Fiji's full suspension from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] to a suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth, allowing them to participate in a number of Commonwealth activities, including the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/fiji-flag-flies-again-following-commonwealth-ministerial-action-group-decision Fiji flag flies again following Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group decision]. thecommonwealth.org. 17 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turagaiviu|first1=Elenoa|title=Fiji’s Commonwealth suspension partially lifted|url=http://www.fbc.com.fj/fiji/18370/fiji%E2%80%99s-commonwealth-suspension-partially-lifted|accessdate=December 5, 2017|publisher=FBC News|date=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2014}} The suspension was lifted in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/media/press-release/fiji-rejoins-commonwealth-full-member|title=Fiji rejoins Commonwealth as a full member|publisher=The Commonwealth|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Fijian general election, 2014|general election took place on 17 September 2014]]. Bainimarama's FijiFirst party won with 59.2% of the vote, and the election was deemed credible by a group of international observers from Australia, India and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="bigstory.ap.org" /&gt;

=== Armed forces and law enforcement ===

The military consists of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]] (RFMF) with a total manpower of 3,500 active soldiers and 6,000 reservists, and includes a Navy Unit of 300 personnel.

The Land Force comprises the [[Fiji Infantry Regiment]] (regular and territorial force organised into six light infantry battalions), Fiji Engineer Regiment, Logistic Support Unit and Force Training Group. The two regular battalions are traditionally stationed overseas on peacekeeping duties.

The Law Enforcement branch is composed of:

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Local government of Fiji}}
[[File:Fiji divisions named.png|upright=1.15|thumb|A map of Fiji's administrative divisions.]]

Fiji is divided into Four Major Divisions which are further divided into 14 provinces. They are:

*[[Central Division, Fiji|Central Division]] has 5 provinces: [[Naitasiri Province|Naitasiri]], [[Namosi Province|Namosi]], [[Rewa Province|Rewa]], [[Serua Province|Serua]], and [[Tailevu Province|Tailevu]].

*[[Western Division, Fiji|Western Division]] has 3 provinces: [[Ba Province|Ba]], [[Nadroga-Navosa Province|Nadroga-Navosa]], and [[Ra Province|Ra]].

Fiji was also divided into 3 Confederacies or Governments during the reign of [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], though these are not considered political divisions, they are still considered important in the social divisions of the indigenous Fijians:

[[File:Suva, Fiji 01.jpg|thumb|Suva, capital and commercial centre of Fiji]]

Endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, Fiji is one of the most developed of the Pacific island economies, though still with a large [[Subsistence economy|subsistence sector]]. Some progress was experienced by this sector when [[Marion M. Ganey]], S.J., introduced credit unions to the islands in the 1950s. Natural resources include timber, fish, gold, copper, offshore oil, and hydropower. Fiji experienced a period of rapid growth in the 1960s and 1970s but stagnated in the 1980s. The coup of 1987 caused further contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Narayan|first1=Paresh|last2=Prasad|first2=Biman|title=The long‐run impact of coups on Fiji's economy: evidence from a computable general equilibrium model|date=30 May 2006|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=19|issue=2|pages=149–160|doi=10.1002/jid.1296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic liberalisation in the years following the coup created a boom in the garment industry and a steady growth rate despite growing uncertainty regarding land tenure in the sugar industry.{{citation needed|date = March 2015}} The expiration of leases for sugar cane farmers (along with reduced farm and factory efficiency) has led to a decline in sugar production despite subsidies for sugar provided by the EU; Fiji has been the second largest beneficiary of sugar subsidies after [[Mauritius]].{{citation needed|date = March 2015}} Fiji's vital gold mining industry based in [[Vatukoula]], which shut down in 2006, was reactivated in 2008.

Urbanisation and expansion in the service sector have contributed to recent GDP growth. Sugar exports and a rapidly growing tourist industry&amp;nbsp;– with tourists numbering 430,800 in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726122800/http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/fiji/fiji-overview/fiji-economy-and-politics.html|url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/fiji/fiji-overview/fiji-economy-and-politics.html|title=Fiji Economy and Politics|archivedate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increasing in the subsequent years&amp;nbsp;– are the major sources of foreign exchange. Fiji is highly dependent on tourism for revenue. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity. Long-term problems include low investment and uncertain property rights. The political turmoil in Fiji in the 1980s, the 1990s, and 2000 had a severe impact on the economy, which shrank by 2.8% in 2000 and grew by only 1% in 2001.{{citation needed|date = March 2015}}

The tourism sector recovered quickly, however, with visitor arrivals reaching pre-coup levels in 2002, resulting in a modest economic recovery which continued into 2003 and 2004 but grew by a mere 1.7% in 2005 and by 2.0% in 2006. Although inflation is low, the policy indicator rate of the [[Reserve Bank of Fiji]] was raised by 1% to 3.25% in February 2006 due to fears of excessive consumption financed by debt. Lower interest rates have so far not produced greater investment in exports.{{citation needed|date = March 2015}}

However, there has been a housing boom due to declining commercial mortgage rates. The tallest building in Fiji is the fourteen-storey [[Reserve Bank of Fiji Building]] in Suva, which was inaugurated in 1984. The [[Suva Central Commercial Centre]], which opened in November 2005, was planned to outrank the Reserve Bank building at seventeen stories, but last-minute design changes ensured that the Reserve Bank building remained the tallest.{{citation needed|date = March 2015}}

Trade and investment with Fiji have been criticised due to the country's military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DailyFinance |url=http://www.aolnews.com/surge-desk/article/fiji-water-leaves-fiji-4-things-to-know-about-the-shutdown/19736926 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202051420/http://www.aolnews.com/surge-desk/article/fiji-water-leaves-fiji-4-things-to-know-about-the-shutdown/19736926 |archivedate=2 December 2010 |title=Fiji Water Leaves Fiji: 4 Things to Know About the Shutdown |publisher=Aolnews.com |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Fiji's interim Prime Minister and coup leader [[Frank Bainimarama]] announced election delays and said that Fiji would pull out of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] in [[Niue]], where Bainimarama was to have met with [[Australian Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] and [[New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]].&lt;ref name=abcnet&gt;{{cite web|last=Zealand |first=New |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/19/2339510.htm?section=world |title=Democracy hopes dashed after Fiji pulls out of Pacific Forum |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=19 August 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Pacific Stock Exchange]] (SPSE) is the only licensed securities exchange in Fiji and is based in Suva.

== Science and technology ==
Fiji is the only developing Pacific Island country with recent data for gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD). The national Bureau of Statistics cites a GERD/GDP ratio of 0.15% in 2012. Private-sector research and development (R&amp;D) is negligible.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Government investment in R&amp;D tends to favour agriculture. In 2007, agriculture and primary production accounted for just under half of government expenditure on R&amp;D, according to the Fijian National Bureau of Statistics. This share had risen to almost 60% by 2012. However, scientists publish much more in the field of geosciences and health than in agriculture.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

The rise in government spending on agricultural research has come to the detriment of research in education, which dropped to 35% of total research spending between 2007 and 2012. Government expenditure on health research has remained fairly constant, at about 5% of total government research spending, according to the Fijian National Bureau of Statistics.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=693–731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fijian Ministry of Health is seeking to develop endogenous research capacity through the ''Fiji Journal of Public Health'', which it launched in 2012. A new set of guidelines are now in place to help build endogenous capacity in health research through training and access to new technology.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Fiji is also planning to diversify its energy sector through the use of [[Science and technology in Pacific Island countries|science and technology]]. In 2015, the [[Secretariat of the pacific community|Secretariat of the Pacific Community]] observed that, 'while Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects, there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean-based energy sources'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spc.int/edd/fr/section-01/energy-overview/energy?start=12|title=Pacific-first centre of excellence for renewable energy and energy efficiency takes shape|last=|first=|date=18 June 2015|work=Secretariat of Pacific Community press release|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Centre of Renewable Energy became operational at the [[University of Fiji]], with the assistance of the Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme (EPIC) funded by the [[European Union]]. Since the programme's inception in 2013, EPIC has also developed a master's programme in renewable energy management for the [[University of Fiji]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== Demographics ===
{{Main|Demographics of Fiji}}

The 2017 census found that the population of Fiji was 884,887, compared to the population of 837,271 in the 2007 census.&lt;ref name=2017census/&gt; The population density at the time of the 2007 census was 45.8 inhabitants per [[square kilometre]]. The [[life expectancy]] in Fiji was 72.1 years. Since the 1930s the population of Fiji has increased at a rate of 1.1% per year. The population is dominated by the 15–64 age segment. The median age of the population was 27.9, and the gender ratio was 1.03 males per 1 female.

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:Fijian women ceremonial.jpg|thumb|[[Fijians|Native Fijian]] women, 1935]]

The population of Fiji is mostly made up of [[Fijians|native Fijians]], who are [[Melanesians]] (54.3%), although many also have [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] ancestry, and [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]] (38.1%), descendants of Indian [[Indentured servant|contract labourers]] brought to the islands by the British colonial powers in the 19th century. The percentage of the population of Indo-Fijian descent has declined significantly over the last two decades due to migration for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=110 Fiji Islands: From Immigration to Emigration].

About 1.2% are [[Rotumans|Rotuman]] — natives of Rotuma Island, whose culture has more in common with countries such as [[Tonga]] or [[Samoa]] than with the rest of Fiji. There are also small but economically significant groups of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and other Pacific island minorities.
The total membership of other ethnic groups of Pacific Islanders is about 7,300.{{citation needed|date = March 2015}}

Relationships between ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians in the political arena have often been strained, and the tension between the two communities has dominated politics in the islands for the past generation. The level of political tension varies among different regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Minority Rights Groups International |title=Fiji Islands Overview |url=http://www.minorityrights.org/4371/fiji-islands/fiji-islands-overview.html |accessdate=3 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729195456/http://www.minorityrights.org/4371/fiji-islands/fiji-islands-overview.html |archivedate=29 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family groups ===

The concept of family and community is of great importance to Fijian culture. Within the indigenous (iTaukei) communities many members of the extended family will adopt particular titles and roles of direct guardians. Kinship is determined through a child's lineage to a particular spiritual leader, so that a clan is based on traditional customary ties as opposed to actual biological links. These clans, based on the spiritual leader, are known as a matangali. Within the matangali are a number of smaller collectives, known as the mbito. The descent is patrilineal, and all the status is derived from the father's side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304495447|title=Whitehead, John and Roffee, James.

=== Demonym ===

Within Fiji, many {{Who|date=October 2017}} argue that the term ''Fijian'' refers solely to [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]]: it denotes an ancestral ethnicity, not a nationality. Constitutionally, citizens of Fiji were previously referred to as "Fiji Islanders" though the term ''Fiji Nationals'' was used for official purposes. However, the current constitution refers to all Fijian citizens as "Fijians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Government of Fiji|title=Constitution of the Republic of Fiji|date=2013|location=Suva|page=3|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/getattachment/8e981ca2-1757-4e27-88e0-f87e3b3b844e/Click-here-to-download-the-Fiji-Constitution.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206063023/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/getattachment/8e981ca2-1757-4e27-88e0-f87e3b3b844e/Click-here-to-download-the-Fiji-Constitution.aspx|archivedate=6 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, shortly before the proposed [[People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress]] was due to be released to the public, it was announced that it recommended a change in the name of Fiji's citizens. If the proposal were adopted, all citizens of Fiji, whatever their ethnicity, would be called "Fijians". The proposal would change the English name of indigenous Fijians from "Fijians" to ''itaukei'', the [[Fijian language]] [[endonym]] for indigenous Fijians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fijilive.com/news_new/index.php/news/show_news/7352 |title=Charter proposes common Fijian name |accessdate=5 August 2008 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817045049/http://www.fijilive.com/news_new/index.php/news/show_news/7352 |archivedate=17 August 2008 }}, Fiji Live (4 August 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Deposed Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]] reacted by stating that the name "Fijian" belonged exclusively to indigenous Fijians, and that he would oppose any change in legislation enabling non-indigenous Fijians to use it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijivillage.com/?mod=story&amp;id=080808151d4615fbbca6b1f2d9d72e "The Name “Fijian” Belongs to Indigenous – Qarase"], FijiVillage, 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma|Methodist Church]], to which a large majority of indigenous Fijians belong, also reacted strongly to the proposal, stating that allowing any Fiji citizen to call themselves "Fijian" would be "daylight robbery" inflicted on the indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=99088 "Communalism is ‘to love thy neighbour'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511090956/http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=99088 |date=11 May 2011 }}, ''Fiji Times'' (29 August 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address to the nation during the [[2009 Fijian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of April 2009]], military leader and interim Prime Minister [[Frank Bainimarama|Voreqe Bainimarama]], who has been at the forefront of the attempt to change the definition of "Fijian", stated:

[[File:Fiji (9476712582) (2).jpg|thumb|Fijians]]
In May 2010, [[Attorney General of Fiji|Attorney-General]] [[Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum]] reiterated that the term "Fijian" should apply to all Fiji nationals, but the statement was again met with protest. A spokesperson for the Viti Landowners and Resource Owners Association claimed that even fourth-generation descendants of migrants did not fully understand "what it takes to be a Fijian", and added that the term refers to a legal standing, since legislation affords specific rights to "Fijians" (meaning, in legislation, indigenous Fijians).&lt;ref name="RNZI_53323"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=53323 |title=All Fiji nationals to be known as Fijians, says AG |date=3 May 2010 |website=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji academic [[Brij Lal (historian)|Brij Lal]], although a prominent critic of the Bainimarama government,&lt;ref name="TVNZ_2530474"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/bainimarama-hits-back-critics-2530474 |title=Bainimarama hits back at critics |date=10 March 2009 |website=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061840/http://24hdanslepacifique.com/padma-lal-expulsee-des-iles-fidji/ "Padma Lal expulsée des îles Fidji"], ABC Radio Australia, 14 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; said he "would not be surprised" if the new definition of the word "Fijian" were included in the government's projected new Constitution, and that he personally saw "no reason the term Fijian should not apply to everyone from Fiji".&lt;ref name="RNZI_53333"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=53333 |title=Decree on term Fijian could be imminent |date=3 May 2010 |website=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Fiji}}

[[Fijian language|Fijian]] is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian family]] spoken in Fiji. It has 350,000 first-language speakers, which is less than half the population of Fiji, but another 200,000 speak it as a second language. The [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]] established Fijian as an official language of Fiji, along with English and [[Fiji Hindi]].&lt;ref name="2013Constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/govt--publications/constitution.aspx|title=Fiji Government Online Portal – Constitution|website=www.fiji.gov.fj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fijian is a [[Verb–object–subject|VOS]] language.

The Fiji Islands developed many [[dialect]]s, which may be classified in two major branches&amp;nbsp;— [[East Fijian languages|eastern]] and [[West Fijian languages|western]]. Missionaries in the 1840s chose an Eastern dialect, the speech of [[Bau Island]] off the southeast coast of the main island of [[Viti Levu]], to be the written standard of the [[Fijian language]]. Bau Island was home to [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], the chief who eventually became the self-proclaimed King of Fiji.

According to the 2007 census, 64.4% of the population at the time was [[Christian]], while 27.9% was [[Hindu]], 6.3% [[Muslim]], 0.8% non-religious, 0.3% [[Sikh]], and the remaining 0.3% belonged to other religions.&lt;ref name="2007 Census – Religion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population by Religion and Province of Enumeration |url=http://www.statsfiji.gov.fj/index.php/document-library/doc_download/426-population-by-religion-province |website=2007 Census of Population |publisher=Fiji Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=7 November 2015 |ref=2007-Census-Religion |date=June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909212947/http://www.statsfiji.gov.fj/index.php/document-library/doc_download/426-population-by-religion-province |archivedate=9 September 2015 }} – Percentages are derived from total population figures provided in the source&lt;/ref&gt;
Among Christians, 54% were counted as [[Methodist]], followed by 14.2% [[Catholic]], 8.9% [[Assemblies of God]], 6.0% [[Seventh-day Adventist]], 1.2% [[Anglican]] with the remaining 16.1% belonging to other denominations.&lt;ref name="2007 Census – Religion" /&gt;

The largest Christian denomination is the [[Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma]]. With 34.6%&lt;ref name="2007 Census – Religion" /&gt; of the population (including almost two-thirds of ethnic Fijians), the proportion of the population adhering to [[Methodism]] is higher in Fiji than in any other nation. In 2012, permission was granted by the government for Methodists to hold their annual conference, for the first time in four years, with the conditions that the conference not coincide with the national Hibiscus Festival and should only last for three days, and that no political matters were to be discussed, only church matters.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Methodist Recorder]]'' (Issue 8060, 14 June 2012) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholicism in Fiji|Roman Catholics]] are headed by the Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Suva|Archdiocese of Suva]], whose province also includes the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rarotonga|Rarotonga]] (on the [[Cook Islands]], for those and [[Niue]], both New Zealand-associated countries) and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru|Tarawa and Nauru]] (with see at Tarawa on [[Kiribati]], also for [[Nauru]]) and the [[Mission Sui Iuris of Tokelau]] (again with New Zealand). This reflects that much major Roman Catholic missionary activity was conducted through the former Apostolic Prefecture (created in 1863 from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Central Oceania]]), then [[Apostolic Vicariate of Fiji]], which has since been promoted to Archdiocese of Suva, which spans the whole of Fiji. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Furthermore, the [[Assemblies of God]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) are significant. Fiji also is the base for the [[Anglican Diocese of Polynesia]] (part of the [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia]]). These and other denominations have small numbers of Indo-Fijian members; Christians of all kinds comprised 6.1% of the Indo-Fijian population in the 1996 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion - Fiji Bureau of Statistics|url=http://www.statsfiji.gov.fj/statistics/social-statistics/religion|website=www.statsfiji.gov.fj|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus belong mostly to the [[Sanatan]] sect (74.3% of all Hindus) or else are unspecified (22%). The small [[Arya Samaj]] sect claims the membership of some 3.7% of Hindus in Fiji. Muslims are mostly [[Sunni]] (96.4%) following the [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence, with a small [[Ahmadiyya Community|Ahmadiyya]] minority (3.6%). The [[Sikh]] religion comprises 0.9% of the Indo-Fijian population, or 0.4% of the national population in Fiji.

Fiji's culture is a rich mosaic of indigenous Fijian, Indo-Fijian, Asian and European traditions, comprising social polity, language, food (coming mainly from the sea, plus casava, dalo (taro) and other vegetables), costume, belief systems, architecture, arts, craft, music, dance, and sports.

While indigenous Fijian culture and traditions are very vibrant and are integral components of everyday life for the majority of Fiji's population, Fijian society has evolved over the past century with the introduction of traditions such as Indian and Chinese as well as significant influences from Europe and Fiji's Pacific neighbours, particularly Tonga and Samoa. Thus, the various cultures of Fiji have come together to create a unique multicultural national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Fiji: the challenges and opportunities of diversity|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/525fbfda4.pdf|journal=Minority Rights Group International 2013|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, they won Fiji's first ever Olympic medal in the [[Rugby sevens at the Summer Olympics]], winning gold by defeating Great Britain 43-7 in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-22/fiji-olympic-team-returns-home-to-celebrations/7771170|title=Fiji rugby heroes return home from Rio to national celebrations|date=2016-08-22|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fiji national rugby union team|national rugby union team]] has competed at five [[Rugby World Cup]] competitions, the first being in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]], where they reached the quarter-finals. The Fiji national side did not match that feat again until the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] when they upset [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] 38–34 to progress to the quarter-finals where they lost to the eventual Rugby World Cup winners, [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]. Fiji also defeated the British and Irish Lions in 1977.

Fiji competes in the [[Pacific Tri-Nations]] and the [[IRB Pacific Nations Cup]]. The sport is governed by the [[Fiji Rugby Union]] which is a member of the [[Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance]], and contributes to the [[Pacific Islanders rugby union team]]. At the club level there are the [[Skipper Cup]] and [[Farebrother Trophy Challenge]].

The Fiji national rugby union team is a member of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) formerly along with Samoa and Tonga. In 2009, Samoa announced their departure from the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance, leaving just Fiji and Tonga in the union. Fiji is currently ranked eleventh in the world by the IRB ({{as of|2015|December|28|lc=y}}).

Fiji is one of the few countries where rugby union is the main sport. There are about 80,000 registered players from a total population of around 900,000. One of the problems for Fiji is simply getting their players to play for their home country, as many have contracts in Europe with the French [[Top 14]] and the English [[Aviva Premiership]] or with [[Super Rugby]] teams, where monetary compensation is far more rewarding. The repatriated salaries of its overseas stars have become an important part of some local economies. In addition, a significant number of players eligible to play for Fiji end up representing Australia or New Zealand; notable examples are Fiji-born cousins and former [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand All Blacks]], Joe Rokocoko and Sitiveni Sivivatu, current All Blacks [[Waisake Naholo]] and Seta Tamanivalu as well as [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian Wallabies]] former winger, Lote Tuqiri and current Wallabies [[Tevita Kuridrani]], Samu Kerevi and [[Henry Speight]]. Fiji has won the most [[Pacific Tri-Nations]] Championships of the three participating teams.

==== Rugby league ====
{{Main|Rugby league in Fiji}}

The [[Fiji national rugby league team]], nicknamed the Bati (pronounced [mˈbatʃi]), represents Fiji in the sport of rugby league football and has been participating in international competition since 1992. It has competed in the [[Rugby League World Cup]] on three occasions, with their best results coming when they made consecutive semi-final appearances in the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup]] and [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]]. The team also competes in the [[Pacific Cup]].

Members of the team are selected from a domestic Fijian competition, as well as from competitions held in New Zealand and Australia. For the 2000, 2008 and 2013 World Cups, the Bati were captained by Lote Tuqiri, [[Wes Naiqama]] and the legendary [[Petero Civoniceva]] respectively. Fiji have also produced stars like [[Akuila Uate]], [[Jarryd Hayne]], [[Kevin Naiqama]], [[Semi Tadulala]], [[Marika Koroibete]], [[Apisai Koroisau]], [[Sisa Waqa]] and the Sims brothers [[Ashton Sims]], [[Tariq Sims]] and [[Korbin Sims]].

==== Rugby war dance (Cibi and Bole) and Fijian hymn ====
The [[Cibi]] (pronounced ''Thimbi'') war dance was traditionally performed by the Fiji rugby team before each match. It was replaced in 2012 with the new "Bole" (pronounced ''mBolay'') war cry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rudgard|first1=Olivia|last2=Rothwell|first2=James|title=Never mind the haka – here's the Bole|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/rugby-world-cup/11871886/Never-mind-the-haka-heres-the-Bole.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=elegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=4 November 2016|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tradition holds that the original Cibi was first performed on the rugby field back in 1939 during a tour of New Zealand, when then Fijian captain Ratu Sir George Cakobau felt that his team should have something to match the [[Haka]] of the All Blacks. The 'Cibi' had perhaps been used incorrectly though, as the word actually means "a celebration of victory by warriors," whereas 'Bole' is the acceptance of a challenge.

The Fiji Bati rugby league team also gather in a huddle and perform the hymn 'Noqu Masu' before each match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/video/league/rugby-league/fiji-emotional-pre-game-hymn!520818 ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Association football ====
[[Association football]] was traditionally a minor sport in Fiji, popular largely amongst the Indo-Fijian community, but with international funding from [[FIFA]] and sound local management over the past decade, the sport has grown in popularity in the wider Fijian community. It is now the second most-popular sport in Fiji, after rugby (union 15's and union 7's) for men, and after netball for women.

The [[Fiji Football Association]] is a member of the [[Oceania Football Confederation]]. The [[Fiji national football team|national football team]] defeated [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] 2–0 in the 2008 [[OFC Nations Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oceanian Nations Cup 2008 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/08oc.html | accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on their way to a joint-record third-place finish. However, they have never reached a [[FIFA World Cup]] to date. Fiji won the [[Pacific Games]] football tournament in [[Football at the 1991 South Pacific Games|1991]] and [[Football at the 2003 South Pacific Games|2003]]. Fiji qualified for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] men's tournament for the first time in history.

==== Basketball ====
Due to the success of Fiji's national basketball teams, the popularity of basketball in Fiji has experienced rapid growth in recent years. In the past, the country only had few basketball courts, which severely limited [[Fijians]] who desired to practice the sport more frequently. Due to recent efforts by the national federation ''Basketball Fiji'' and with the support of the Australian government, many schools have been able to construct courts and provide their students with basketball equipment such as shoes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fiba.com/news/basketball-fiji-bringing-the-sport-to-all Basketball Fiji bringing the sport to all], FIBA.com, 13 May 2016. Retrieved 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Netball ====
{{Main|Netball in Fiji}}
[[Netball]] is the most popular women's participation sport in Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fiji Times article on participation in netball, 14 Sept 2015 |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=321694 | accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1, Brij V. Lal, Kate Fortune, p458&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fiji national netball team|national team]] has been internationally competitive, at [[INF Netball World Cup|Netball World Cup]] competitions reaching 6th position in 1999, its highest level to date. The team won gold medals at the 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2007 South Pacific Games results |url=http://www.foxsportspulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?&amp;sID=43933&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=4358816 | accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Netball at the 2015 Pacific Games|2015]] [[Pacific Games]].

==== Cricket ====
[[Cricket]] is a minor sport in Fiji. [[Cricket Fiji]] is an Associate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] ("ICC"). The Fiji U19 team won the [[2015 EAP Under-19 Cricket Trophy|2015 edition]] of the [[ICC East Asia-Pacific]] tournament, and consequently qualified for the [[2016 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup|2016 Under-19 World Cup]]. Doing so made it the first U19 team other than Papua New Guinea's [[Papua New Guinea Under-19 cricket team|Under-19 team]] to qualify from the region.

'''Heubad''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɔʏbat}}) is an [[Austria]]n traditional [[hay]] [[bathing|bath]] with more than 200 years of history. Bathers immerse themselves in hay which releases heat from biodecomposition.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Information==
Heubad was ostensibly discovered by a tired field worker who, after resting in the hay after several hours of manual labor, felt refreshed and rejuvenated. Heubad is commonly and most popularly done in the Hotel Heubad Spa in Völs am Schlern, Italy. There, people taking part in Heubad burrow in the moist fermented hay for about twenty minutes, followed by lying down on a couch and relaxing for another thirty minutes. This process is considered to open up pores, detoxify the body, soothe aches and pains, and to stimulate the metabolism. The hay is heated to the temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit before the people lie in it. The hay used for the Heubad treatment is cut during July and August in the Dolomite mountains, about 2,000 meters above sea level.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news|last=Yan|first=Sophia|title=BEYOND THE MANI-PEDI Hay Bath|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1947694_1947700_1947714,00.html|publisher=TIME|accessdate=21 March 2013|date=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kiaulės Nugara''' is an island in [[Curonian Lagoon]], [[Port of Klaipėda]], [[Lithuania]]. The name of island means ''the back of a pig'' in Lithuanian language.

One of the biggest islands of Lithuania, its length is around 800 meters, and width around 200–300 meters. The island is used for the [[electric power transmission]] station between [[Klaipėda]] and [[Curonian Spit]]. Sailing between the island and ferry terminal is not allowed, because of electric cables which hang at a height of only nine meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vidmantas Matutis |url=http://www.delfi.lt/verslas/transportas/jachta-kliude-elektros-laidus.d?id=7118445 |title=Jachta kliudė elektros laidus - DELFI Verslas |publisher=Delfi.lt |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kołobrzeg Pier''' ({{lang|pl|Molo w Kołobrzegu}}) is a [[reinforced concrete]] [[pier]] in [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Poland]]. The structure has a length of 220 metres and the width of 9 metres and the pavilion is located about 4,5 metres above sea level. The pier was reopened after extensive renovation and modernisation works in November 27, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Molo w Kołobrzegu po liftingu|url=http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/gid,17066887,kat,1342,title,Molo-w-Kolobrzegu-po-liftingu,galeria.html?ticaid=115b52|website=Wiadomości WP|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first pier in Kołobrzeg was built in 1881. This was a wooden [[T-shaped]] construction, of about 100 metres in length. On the end of the pier there was located a [[jetty]] for [[sailing ship]]s. The historic pier was destroyed during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=View Of The Kołobrzeg Pier|url=http://kamery.nocowanie.pl/kolobrzeg/134398/|website=Kamery Nocowanie|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current pier was officially opened in June 19, 1971. On the end of the pier is located a jetty for small holiday [[barque]]s, from which ships sail for sightseeing tours. The Kołobrzeg Pier is one of the main attractions of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kołobrzeg Pier|url=http://www.rmf24.pl/fakty/polska/news-kolobrzeg-bedzie-mial-drugie-molo-wizualizacja,nId,1547987|website=RMF24|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded by an Oshie man from West Cameroon by the name of Awanga

[[File:US Net International Investment Position.png|thumb|US Net International Investment Position]]

The difference between a country's external financial assets and liabilities is its '''net international investment position''' ('''NIIP''').&lt;ref name=Bivens&gt;{{cite web |first=L. Josh |last=Bivens |url=http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/Issuebrief203 |title=Debt and the dollar: The United States damages future living standards by borrowing itself into a deceptively deep hole |publisher=Epinet.org |date=December 14, 2004 |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120130654/http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/Issuebrief203 |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A country's [[external debt]] includes both its [[government debt]] and [[private debt]], and similarly its public and privately held (by its legal residents) external assets are also taken into account when calculating its NIIP.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Economic and Finance of Argentina [http://www.mecon.gov.ar/cuentas/internacionales/documentos/international_investment_position_methodology.pdf International Investment Position Methodology] page.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that [[commodities]], as well as [[currencies]] tend to follow cyclical patterns, whereby they undergo significant valuation changes, of which is reflected in NIIP. 
 
A country's '''international investment position''' ('''IIP''') is a financial statement setting out the value and composition of that country's external financial assets and liabilities.  A positive NIIP value indicates a nation is a [[Sovereign default|creditor nation]], while a negative value indicates it is a ''debtor nation''.  The USA, as recently as 1960 the world's largest creditor, has now become the world's largest debtor, and since the 1980s, Japan [[Capital flows in Japan#Debtor to creditor|has replaced USA]] as the world's largest creditor nation.

[[Image:Flag of the Pacific Community.svg|thumb|250px|right|[[Flag of the Pacific Community]]]]

The '''Pacific Community (SPC)''' is the principal scientific and technical organisation in the Pacific region. It is an international development organisation owned and governed by its 26 country and territory members. With more than 600 staff, the organisation's headquarters are in [[Nouméa]], [[New Caledonia]], and it has regional offices in [[Suva]], [[Fiji]], and [[Pohnpei]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], as well as a country office in [[Honiara]], [[Solomon Islands]], and field staff in other Pacific locations. Its working languages are English and French.

== History ==
[[File:SPC 1947 Pacific zoom.png|thumb|right|334px|Pacific Community, 1947 member states' Pacific territories {{legend|#FF8040|Australia and its territories}} {{legend|#00FF00|New Zealand and its territories}} &lt;br&gt; {{legend|#808000|United States and its territories}} {{legend|#00FFFF|French territories}} {{legend|#FF0000|British territories}} {{legend|#FF00FF|Dutch territories}}]]

The Pacific Community was founded in 1947 as the '''South Pacific Commission''' by six developed countries with an interest in the region:

*{{Flag|Australia}}
*{{Flag|France}}
*{{Flag|Netherlands}}
*{{Flag|New Zealand}}
*{{Flag|United Kingdom}}
*{{flag|United States|1912}}

Two founding members, The Netherlands and Great Britain have since withdrawn from SPC as the Pacific territories they controlled either gained independence or the right to represent themselves in the organization. 

SPC's founding charter is the '''Canberra Agreement'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/coastfish/canberra.htm|title=CONSOLIDATION OF AGREED PROVISIONS AND PRACTICES RELATING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC COMMISSION, INCLUDING THE CANBERRA AGREEMENT OF 1947 AS AMENDED|last=The Governments of Australia, the French Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, New Zealand the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America|date=August 1984|edition=Fourth|work=Australian Treaty Series 1948 No. 15|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|accessdate=2008-08-11}} The fourth edition of the document hosted on the Secretariat of the Pacific Community web site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1948/15.html|title=

Ogden, PhD|accessdate=2008-08-16}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "The establishment of the Commission was a response by the then colonial powers to assure the economic and social stability of the Island countries and avoid a repeat of the World War II experience by creating mechanisms for meaningful relations among governments." In other words, the SPC fosters regional socio-economic stability and it provides a channel for intergovernmental relations. Regional stability and intergovernmental relations serve not only the people who live in the Pacific, but they also ultimately serve the military and political interests of the Western countries which helped found it.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start, SPC's role was constrained, and the invitation from Australia and New Zealand to the US, France, Netherlands and the UK to participate in a South Seas Commission Conference in 1947 included the statement that ''"the [South Pacific] Commission to be set up should not be empowered to deal in any way with political matters or questions of defense or security"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 2007-09-18|editor=A.H. McLintock, Editor|date=originally published 1966|series=International Relations: The South Pacific Commission|isbn=978-0-478-18451-8|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/I/InternationalRelations/TheSouthPacificCommission/en|accessdate=2008-08-16}} "From the outset political and security matters were excluded from consideration; the proposed Commission was to act in a consultative capacity on questions of welfare of the peoples in the area and social and economic development."&lt;/ref&gt; This constraint on discussion (particularly the constraint on discussing nuclear weapons testing in the region) led, eventually, to the creation of the [[Pacific Islands Forum|South Pacific Forum (now ''Pacific Islands Forum'')]], which not only excluded the more distant "metropolitan" powers of France, UK and USA, but also their Pacific Island territories.

== Present ==
[[File:SPC 2010 Pacific.png|thumb|right|334px|Pacific Community, 2010 member states' Pacific territories {{legend|#FF8040|Australia and its territories}} {{legend|#00FF00|New Zealand and its territories}} {{legend|#804000|the rest of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] member states}} &lt;br&gt; {{legend|#808000|United States and its territories}} {{legend|#00FFFF|French territories}} {{legend|#FF0000|UK [[Pitcairn Islands]] (the UK itself is not a member)}}]]

Today, SPC is the principal scientific and technical organisation in the Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.int/en/about-spc.html SPC Mission and Vision]. Retrieved 29 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

SPC works closely with donor and technical assistance organisations such as [[AusAID]], the European Union, [[FAO]], the United Nations, New Zealand Aid Programme and [[Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA)|CTA]].

The SPC family includes all 22 Pacific island countries and territories, which since 1983 have been full members:

{{columns-list|colwidth=17em|
* {{Flag|American Samoa}}
* {{Flag|Cook Islands}}
* {{Flag|Fiji}}
* {{Flag|French Polynesia}}
* {{Flag|Guam}}
* {{Flag|Kiribati}}
* {{Flag|Marshall Islands}}
* {{Flag|Federated States of Micronesia}}
* {{Flag|Nauru}}
* {{Flag|New Caledonia}}
* {{Flag|Niue}}
* {{Flag|Northern Mariana Islands}}

* {{Flag|Papua New Guinea}}

* {{Flag|Solomon Islands}}
* {{Flag|Tokelau}}
* {{Flag|Tonga}}
* {{Flag|Tuvalu}}
* {{Flag|Vanuatu}}
* {{Flag|Wallis and Futuna}}
}}
These were all territories (or, in the case of Tonga, a [[protected state]]) of the original founder members of SPC, but most are now independent. [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]], formerly represented in the SPC by the Netherlands, was transferred to the United Nations in 1962 and to Indonesia in 1969. Thus, the Netherlands is no longer represented in the SPC since the end of 1962. The United Kingdom also withdrew from the organisation on 1 January 1995.

SPC today is the oldest and largest organization in the [[Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific]] (CROP), a consultative process that is headed at the political level by the [[Pacific Islands Forum|Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat]]. Since the hand-over of co-ordination of regional political issues from the SPC Conference to the South Pacific Forum in the 1970s, SPC has concentrated on providing technical, advisory, statistical and information support to its member governments and administrations, particularly in areas where small island states lack the wherewithal to maintain purely national cadres of expertise, or in areas where regional co-operation or interaction is necessary.

SPC was the first CROP organization to be headed by a woman, [[Lourdes Pangelinan]] of Guam who left the organization end of January 2006. Colin Tukuitonga is the organization's current [[Pacific Community#SPC chief executives|Director-General]].

== SPC programmes and services ==
SPC works across more than 25 sectors. It is involved in such areas as fisheries science, public health surveillance, geoscience and conservation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. Much of SPC’s focus is on major cross-cutting issues, such as climate change, disaster risk management, food security, gender equality, human rights, non-communicable diseases and youth employment. Using a multi-sector approach in responding to its members’ development priorities, SPC draws on skills and capabilities from around the region and internationally, and supports the empowerment of Pacific communities and sharing of expertise and skills between countries and territories.

It has seven divisions: Economic Development, Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Ecosystems, Geoscience, Land Resources, Public Health, Social Development and Statistics for Development. SPC also has an Operations and Management Directorate, various programmes and other main work areas.

=== Land Resources Division ===
The Land Resources Division, based in Suva, comprises two programmes – sustainable management of forest and agriculture systems, and biosecurity and trade facilitation. It operates the [[Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees]], which is a plant propagation vault in Fiji. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community's Land Resources Division provides advice, expertise, technical support and training to members on all aspects of agriculture and forestry, including:

*	plant health
*	animal health
*	biosecurity and trade
*	forest and agriculture diversification
*	crop production
*	animal production
*	genetic resources
*	information, communication and extension
*	forest and trees

=== Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Ecosystems Division ===

SPC produces a television show, '''''The Pacific Way'''''. It began in 1995, supported by [[UNESCO]], as a trial for exchanging news stories – with just one tape circulated between TV stations in several Pacific Island nations – and has evolved into a series distributed to 21 TV stations around the region. The half-hour weekly show shares development stories about the Pacific for the Pacific. It covers important topics and key issues, such as climate change adaptation, health, youth employment, innovation in agriculture, fisheries management and the protection of cultural heritage.

[[File:Map of Pontus.jpg|right|thumb|280px|The area claimed for the Republic of Pontus after [[World War I]], based on the extent of the six local [[Greek Orthodox]] bishoprics.]]
The '''Republic of Pontus''' ({{lang-el|Δημοκρατία του Πόντου}}, ''Dimokratía tou Póntou'') was a proposed [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] state on the southern coast of the [[Black Sea]]. Its  territory would have encompassed much of historical [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] and today forms part of [[Turkey]]'s [[Black Sea Region]]. The proposed state was discussed at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, but the Greek government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] feared the precarious position of such a state and so it was included instead in the larger proposed state of [[Wilsonian Armenia]]. Ultimately, however, neither state came into existence and the [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] population was expelled from Turkey after 1922 and resettled in the [[Soviet Union]] or in [[Greek Macedonia]]. This state of affairs was later formally recognized as part of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] in 1923. In modern Greek [[right wing politics|right wing political circles]], the exchange is seen as inextricable from the contemporaneous [[Greek genocide]].

==History==
{{Main article|Pontus (region)|Greek genocide}}

Greek colonies were established on the Pontus coast in 800 BC, and by the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] the local inhabitants were already heavily [[Hellenized]]. By the 4th century AD Greek had become the sole spoken language in the region, and it would remain so for a thousand years, first under the [[Byzantine Empire]] and then the [[Empire of Trebizond]], a Byzantine successor state. In 1461 the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered Pontus, but the remote mountainous region remained predominately Greek speaking for centuries more.

[[File:Hagia Sophia, Trabzon.JPG|thumb|left|250x250px|Hagia Sophia of Trebizond]]

In the early 1830s, [[Greek War of Independence|the modern Greek state achieved independence]], but with less territory than it holds today. Hellenic nationalists made further claims upon Greek-populated territory elsewhere. The [[Pontic Greeks]] were far from the new Greek state, and had few connections to it, so joining the new Greece was never strongly considered.&lt;ref name=Hionidou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hionidou|first=Violetta|title="Abroad I was Greek and in Greece I am a Foreigner": Pontic Greeks from Former Soviet Union in Greece|journal=Journal of Modern Greek Studies|year=2012|volume=30|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, many Pontic Greeks migrated to the much closer orthodox states of Russia and Georgia.

In 1904 a secret society, the Pontus Society, was founded in [[Merzifon]] whose main purpose was achieving an independent republic of Pontus.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Stanford J.|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London, England|author2=Ezel Kural Shaw }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement gained significant support and during the 1910s and 1920s, the Metropolitan of Trabzon [[Archbishop Chrysanthus of Athens|Chrysanthos Filippides]], who would later become the Archbishop of Athens, became a major leader in pushing for an independent Republic of Pontus.&lt;ref name=Erimtan /&gt;   International societies of Pontic Greeks became connected with the Pontus Society in Merzifon and began significant lobbying efforts to push for an independent Pontic Greek state: most prominently in Russia and the United States.&lt;ref name=Voutira&gt;{{cite book|last=Voutira|first=Eftitia|title=The 'Right to Return' and the Meaning of Home|year=2011|publisher=Lit Verlag|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, [[Leonidas Iasonidis]] became a primary leader in the movement for the establishment of a Republic of Pontus.&lt;ref name=Voutira /&gt;
[[File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|thumb|right|240px|Proportion of nationalities in the [[vilayet]]s of Ottoman Asia Minor according to the Ottoman census of 1914.]]

Like [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and other [[Ottoman Greeks]], the Greeks of Trebizond province suffered a genocide at the beginning of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, first by the [[Young Turks]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and later by Kemalist forces.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In both cases, motivation was the fear of the Turks on losing the territory sooner or later to the local indigenous populations of Greeks, Assyrians and Armenians and the policy of turkification. Death marches through Turkey's mountainous terrain, forced labour in the infamous "[[Amele Taburu]]" in [[Anatolia]] and slaughter by the irregular bands of [[Topal Osman]] resulted in hundred of thousands of Pontic Greeks perishing during the period from 1915 to 1922. The Greek population of the city itself was however not targeted directly, as the local authorities refused to supply mass murderer Topal with weapons, and local Turks forced his band out of the city. The local Muslims of the city protested the arrest of prominent Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0312262116/ Library Journal Review of ''Not Even My Name'' by Thea Halo.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pontic Greeks that escaped the death marches went on to the mountains with women and children, and formed self-defense groups that were protecting the Greek and Armenian population, until the population agreement exchange in 1923.  The self-defense groups are believed to have saved the lives of more than 60 thousand Pontic Greeks and Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;people.http://www.impantokratoros.gr/antartiko-pontou.el.aspx/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hellinon.net/ANEOMENA/AntartikoPontou.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 1918, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson enunciated his ''[[Fourteen Points]]'' towards a post-war order. Point Twelve specified that the non-Turkish nationalities "which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development." This declaration led to significant activity to organize on the part of non-Turkish populations throughout Anatolia, including the Pontus region.&lt;ref name=Erimtan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erimtan|first=Can|title=Hittites, Ottomans and Turks: Ağaoğlu Ahmed Bey and the Kemalist Construction of Turkish Nationhood in Anatolia|journal=Anatolian Studies|year=2008|volume=58|pages=141–171|jstor=20455417|doi = 10.1017/S0066154600008711}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918–1919, Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] began a process of financial payment for repatriation of Pontic Greeks who had resettled in Russia during the violence before and during World War I.&lt;ref name=Voutira /&gt;

Following the [[Armistice of Mudros]] which ended World War I hostilities between the Allied powers and the Ottoman Empire, British troops landed in [[Samsun]] and occupied much of the region.&lt;ref name=Shaw /&gt;

At about the same time, with the beginning of the negotiations at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] to decide territorial issues in the [[Ottoman Empire]], Chrysanthos arrived at negotiations to push for an independent Pontus on April 29, 1919. While there he presented an 18-page memorandum of support for the establishment of a Republic of Pontus.&lt;ref name=Erimtan /&gt; The proposed Republic of Pontus was to include the districts of [[Trabzon Province|Trabzon]], [[Samsun Province|Samsun]], [[Sinop Province|Sinop]] and [[Amasya Province|Amasya]] and cover much of the northeast Black Sea region of modern Turkey.

At the Conference, Venizelos believed that an independent Republic of Pontus would be too remote for military assistance from Greece and too weak to defend itself against any Turkish attack. For this reason he opposed the creation of a Republic of Pontus and the discussion was largely ended.&lt;ref name=Freely&gt;{{cite book|last=Freely|first=John|title=Children of Achilles: the Greeks in Asia Minor Since the Days of Troy|year=2010|publisher=I.B. Taurus|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGzRrs4KkRoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was suggested that the district of Trabzon become part of the newly created Armenian state by Venizelos, but this idea did not gain traction with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] and violence in the area as a result of the [[Turkish–Armenian War]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]], and the Bolshevik takeover of Armenia soon muted the discussion.&lt;ref name=Freely /&gt; In May 1919, the head of the [[Greek Red Cross]] for the Pontus region wrote a report indicating that security for the population was very precarious and assistance was necessary.&lt;ref name=Voutira /&gt;

In 1921 large part of the Orthodox Christian males of Pontus were deported and sent to [[Labour Battalions (Ottoman Empire)|labour battalions]] at [[Erzerum]]. During this time an "Ad hoc Court of Turkish Independence" in [[Amasya]], which was controlled by the Turkish nationalists of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] (later Atatürk), sentenced several notable figures to death by hanging. Among them was the former member of the Ottoman parliament, [[Matthaios Kofidis]]. They were charged of supporting the independence movement of Pontus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Bruce|title=Twice a Stranger: The Mass Expulsion that Forged Modern Greece and Turkey|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge (Massachusetts)|isbn=9780674023680|pages=112–114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVZ3sLBEPEcC&amp;pg=PA114 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A large part of the Pontic Greek community resettled during the fighting and after the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 and as part of the Greek and Turkish population exchange.  Records find that 182,169 Pontic Greeks were displaced as part of population exchange.&lt;ref name=Freely /&gt; Many of the Pontic Greeks left for the Soviet Union, which had been the site of earlier Pontic migrations and thus had family connections.  Much of the rest migrated to Greece where they were given full citizenship rights (Pontic Greeks who migrate from Russia today receive similar privileges). In Greece the Pontic migrants were called ''Póndioi''.

Applications for a San Marino passport are lodged at the Passport Office in San Marino (or, in the case of citizens living overseas, at San Marino diplomatic missions) with the following documents:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/en/home/passport-office-services-and-forms/passport-office/passport-office---issue-of-ordinary-passports.html Republic of San Marino Ministry for Foreign and Political Affairs, Telecommunications and Transport: Passport Office - Issue of ordinary passports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619105747/http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/en/home/passport-office-services-and-forms/passport-office/passport-office---issue-of-ordinary-passports.html |date=2013-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* completed passport application form [https://archive.is/20130418230951/http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/en/home/passport-office-services-and-forms/passport-office/passport-office---passport-application-forms.html]
* certificates of birth, citizenship, residence (or relevant self-certification form)
* certificates of criminal record, pending suit and full civil capacity (to be issued by the Court without stamp duty)
* two photographs, one of which certified by the Registrar of Vital Statistics (also in this case it is possible to use the self-certification form)

In general, the processing time for a passport application is 15 days.

The application fee is €60 for applicants aged over 14, €20 for applicants aged 3–14 and €10 for applicants aged under 3.

In 2014, San Marino citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 151 countries and territories, ranking the Sammarinese passport 16th.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/hvri/HP%20Visa%20Restrictions%20Index%20141101.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently (2018), along with [[Serbian passport]] and Bosnian passport, among the only European "ordinary" passports to provide visa-free access to China, and of all nationals who can travel visa-free to China, the citizens of San Marino and Bosnia are granted the longest period to stay (90 days).

''' ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'' ''' is a book authored by George Gheverghese Joseph and published by [[Princeton University Press]], the third edition of which was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics Third Edition|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9308.html|website=Princeton University Press|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The book was brought out as a response to view of the [[history of mathematics]] epitomized by [[Morris Kline]]'s  statement that, comparing to what the Greeks achieved, 
"the mathematics of  Egyptians and Babylonians is the scrawling of children just learning to write, as opposed to great literature",&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1991), 
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=c-xT0KNJp0cC&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 177] misquotes Kline by replacing "Babylonians" by "Mesopotamians".
The actual quote from Kline is "Compared with the accomplishments of their immediate successors, the Greeks, the mathematics of the Egyptians and Babylonians is the scrawling of children just learning to write as opposed to great literature." {{cite book|last1=Morris Kline|title=Mathematics: A Cultural Approach|date=1962|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|page=14}}, Mathematics for Liberal Arts (1967), re-published as Mathematics for the Nonmathematician (1985), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=uGvCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 14].&lt;/ref&gt; criticised by Joseph as [[Eurocentric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clemency Montelle|title=Book Review|journal=Notices of the AMS|date=December 2013|pages=1459–1463|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201311/rnoti-p1459.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into 11 chapters. Chapter 1 provides a lengthy justification for the book. 
Chapter 2 is devoted to a discussion of the mathematics of Native Americans and Chapter 3 to the mathematics of ancient Egyptians. In the next two chapters the mathematics of Mesopotamia is considered. There are two chapters dealing with Chinese mathematics, three chapters with Indian mathematics. The book concludes with a chapter on the Islamic contribution to mathematics.

'''The Pit''' ({{lang-be|Яма}}) is a monument on the corner of Melnikayte and Zaslavskaya streets dedicated to the victims of the [[Holocaust]] in [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]]. It is on the site where, on March 2, 1942, the [[Nazi]] forces shot about 5,000 inhabitants of the nearby [[Minsk Ghetto]].

The [[obelisk]] was created in 1947, and in 2000 a [[bronze]] sculpture titled "The Last Way" was added. It represents a group of doomed victims descending the steps of the pit. The sculpture was created by the Belarusian artist and Chairman of the Jewish communities of Belarus, [[Leonid Mendelevich Levin|Leonid Levin]], and the sculptor [[Elsa Pollak]] from Israel. On the obelisk is written in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Yiddish]], "To the shining memory of the bright days of five thousand Jews who perished at the hands of sworn enemies of humanity, German-fascist butchers, March 2, 1942."&lt;!-- Idiomatic improvements to  this translation welcome. --&gt;

When the reconstruction of the memorial was undertaken, no machinery was used and all work done by hand, a process which took eight years to complete. According to the original plan, the sculptural group was to be more detailed, but it was ultimately left with an expressive aesthetic, devoid of national colors, and includes figures of a violinist, children, and a pregnant woman,  representing more collective characters. The memorial has been a target of vandalism.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://obozrevatel.com/news/2005/8/17/35288.htm&amp;usg=ALkJrhizUQdGczRgLsCZVwgY4oq80iFrPg In Minsk, a monument desecrated to Holocaust victims] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Funeral assemblies are held at the memorial every year on March 2.

'''Verint Systems''' is a [[Melville, New York|Melville]], New York-based [[analytics]] company which was founded in 2002. The company sells software and hardware products for customer engagement management, [[security]], [[surveillance]], and [[business intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Harrow |first= Robert |coauthors= |title=No Place to Hide |year=2006 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |quote=One government contractor is Verint Systems, the marketing and eavesdropping specialist on Long Island | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eNiOVQFkqeQC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Verint+Systems&amp;ei=ff9CSt2DDKb0ygTwyphd |isbn=0-7432-8705-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their products are designed to assist clients in [[data analysis]], specifically [[big data|large data sets]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post.

==History==

===Founding, early years===
Verint started as [[Comverse Technology]]'s Comverse Infosys business unit, which was created in 1999&lt;ref name="1999-subs"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/42086235.html?dids=42086235:42086235&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | title=Comverse Technology Boasts Surge in Profits | author=Mark Harrington | agency=[[Dow Jones News Service]] | newspaper=[[Newsday]] | date=3 June 1999 | page=A52 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was also incorporated in Delaware in February 1994 as a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Comverse Technology]].{{Dubious|date=February 2011}} Verint's initial focus was on the commercial call recording market, which at the time was transitioning from analog tape to digital recorders. On June 7, 1999, the company released an Internet Call Waiting service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=050915d0ce8e0fa8d213a566a5d33546&amp;docnum=38&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVzB-zSkAz&amp;_md5=8fa0ba5b401873941efc6bbdf9b1fb26 |title= Comverse Network Systems Unveils Internet Call Waiting Service
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion and name change===
In 1999, Comverse Infosys was combined with another division of Comverse focused on security and the [[Lawful interception|communications interception]] market. In 2001, Verint expanded into video security by combining with Loronix Information Systems, Inc., which had been previously acquired by Comverse.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 2002, Comverse Infosys changed its name to Verint Systems Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://verint.com/corporate/releases_view.cfm?article_level1_category_id=7&amp;article_level1_id=282&amp;pageno=3&amp;year=2002 | title=Comverse Infosys Changes Name to Verint Systems Inc. | publisher=Comverse Technology | date=February 1, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPO, acquisitions===
In May 2002, Verint completed an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] and became a [[public company]], although it was still majority owned by Comverse Technology. Since 2006 Verint has acquired several other companies such as  MultiVision Intelligent Surveillance Limited, a networked video security business; CM Insight Limited, a UK-based, customer management company; Mercom Systems Inc., a interaction recording and performance evaluation company; ViewLinks Euclipse Ltd., a provider of data mining and link analysis software; and Witness Systems, Inc. a workforce optimization company.&lt;ref name="iontas"/&gt;

In July 2008&lt;ref name="ablinkedin"/&gt; [[Amit Bohensky]] founded Focal-Info,&lt;ref name="absmachines"/&gt; a software company focused on [[web data extraction]] and analytics. The following month Focal-Info had been bought by Verint for an undisclosed amount, with Bohensky hired back on to lead Focal-Info's "extendend activity" within Verint.&lt;ref name="abqlik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clinchab"/&gt; A subsequent acquisition was of Iontas, in early 2010, a provider of desktop analytics solutions.&lt;ref name="iontas"&gt;{{cite press | url=http://verint.com/corporate/section2a.cfm?article_level2_category_id=1000&amp;article_level2a_id=289 |title =Iontas Acquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with a stock [[options backdating]] scandal in 2006, parent company [[Comverse Technology]] suffered a series of financial reporting problems, losses and layoffs, with one consequence that both Comverse and Verint were delisted from the [[NASDAQ stock market]] in 2007 and ended up on the [[Pink Sheets LLC|Pink Sheets]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sys-con.com/node/524389&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2010, Verint was relisted on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbol VRNT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://verint.com/corporate/releases_view.cfm?article_level1_category_id=7&amp;article_level1_id=1298&amp;pageno=1&amp;year=2010 Verint to be Relisted on NASDAQ July 6, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;   By that year, there was considerable talk that Comverse Technology would sell its remaining interest in Verint, with some private equity firms mentioned as possible buyers.&lt;ref name="b-ver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz-ulti"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/comverse-unloads-ulticom-to-platinum-equity-for-90m-1.319191 | title=Comverse unloads Ulticom to Platinum Equity for $90m  | author=Nir Zalik | newspaper=[[Haaretz]] | date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, Verint acquired Global Management Technologies Corporation, paying around $25 million for it.&lt;ref&gt;John Callegari, Long Island Business News.

===Full independence===
In August 2012, Verint announced that it would buy out Comverse Technology's stake in it, in a transaction valued at around $800 million.&lt;ref name="reut0812"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/13/us-comversetechnology-offer-verint-idUSBRE87C10F20120813 | title=Verint to buy Comverse Technology | agency=[[Reuters]] | date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[FBR Capital Markets]] analyst said the move "finally eliminates a major overhang on the name by removing Comverse's majority ownership stake."&lt;ref name="reut0812"/&gt;  The deal was finalized in February 2013.&lt;ref name="globes0213"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000820482&amp;fid=1725 | title=Verint completes separation from Comverse | author=Ron Steinblatt | newspaper=[[Globes]] | date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verint has also received millions of dollars in [[government contracts]] to outfit airports, shipping ports, and government facilities with intelligent video surveillance systems with tracking, [[biometrics]], and video analysis features.

'''Zero population growth''', sometimes abbreviated '''ZPG''' (also called the [[Total fertility rate#Replacement rates|replacement level of fertility]]),&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;Zero Population Growth Organizanion. "Zero Population Growth." BookRags Staff. N.p., 2005. Web. 7 Oct. 2009. &lt;http://www.bookrags.com/research/zero-population-growth-enve-02/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a condition of [[demographic]] balance where the number of people in a specified population neither [[Population growth|grows]] nor [[Population decline|declines]], considered as a social aim by some.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;Kingsley Davis (1973) "Zero population growth: the goal and the means" in ''The No-Growth Society'', Mancur Olson &amp; Hans H. Landsberg, eds. New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt;
According to some, zero population growth, perhaps after stabilizing at some [[optimum population]], is the ideal towards which countries and the whole world should aspire in the interests of accomplishing long-term environmental [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;Last, John M.

==History==
A loosely defined goal of ZPG is to match the [[Total fertility rate#Replacement rates|replacement fertility rate]], which is the average number of children per woman which would hold the population constant. This replacement fertility will depend on [[mortality rates]] and the sex ratio at birth, and varies from around 2.1 in developed countries to over 3.0 in some developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Espenshade, Thomas J.; Guzman, Juan Carlos and Westoff, Charles F. [http://www.princeton.edu/~tje/files/global_variation_in_replacement_fertility_prpr_2003.pdf "The Surprising Global Variation in Replacement Fertility"], Population Research and Policy Review, Vol.22, No. 5-6, Dec. 2003, pp. 575-583.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[demography|demographer]] [[Kingsley Davis]] is credited with coining the term&lt;ref name="Davis1967"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis |first=Kingsley |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1967 |month= |title=Population policy: Will current programs succeed? |journal=Science |volume=158 |issue=3802 |pages=730–739 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3802.730 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=6069101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970305davisobit.html|title=Kingsley Davis, Hoover fellow, demographer, sociologist, dies at age 88 (3/97)|website=www.stanford.edu|accessdate=16 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130752/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970305davisobit.html|archive-date=5 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but it was used earlier by George Stolnitz, who stated that the concept of a [[Demography#Common Rates and Ratios|stationary population]] dated back to 1693.&lt;ref name="Stolnitz1955"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stolnitz |first=George J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1955 |month= |title= A Century of International Mortality Trends_ I|journal=Population Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=24–55 |id= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.2307/2172340 |publisher=Population Investigation Committee |jstor=2172340}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mathematical description was given by [[James Mirrlees]].&lt;ref name="Mirrlees1967"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mirrlees |first=J.

In the late 1960s ZPG became a prominent political movement in the U.S. and parts of Europe, with strong links to [[environmentalism]] and [[feminism]]. [[Yale University]] was a stronghold of the ZPG activists who believed “that a constantly increasing population is responsible for many of our problems: pollution, violence, loss of values and of individual privacy.”&lt;ref&gt;“ZPG – A New Movement Challenges the U.S. to Stop Growing”, [[Life (magazine)|LIFE magazine]], April 27, 1970, page 12ff&lt;/ref&gt; Founding fathers of the movement were [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], author of ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', Richard Bowers, a Connecticut lawyer, and Professor [[Charles Lee Remington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationconnection.org/us/30-years-of-zpg/|title=Whatever happened to Zero Population Growth (ZPG)?|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich stated: “The mother of the year should be a sterilized woman with two adopted children.”

==Effects==
In the long term, zero population growth can be achieved when the [[birth rate]] of a population equals the [[death rate]], i.e. fertility is at replacement level and birth and death rates are stable, a condition also called demographic equilibrium. Unstable rates can lead to drastic changes in population levels. This analysis is valid for the planet as a whole (assuming that [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary travel]] remains at zero or negligible levels), but not necessarily for a region or country as it ignores [[human migration|migration]]. A population that has been growing in the past will have a higher proportion of young people.  As it is younger people who have children, there is large time lag between the point at which the fertility rate (mean total number of children each woman has during her childbearing years) falls to the replacement level (the fertility rate which would result in equal birth and death rates for a population at equilibrium) and the point at which the population stops rising.&lt;ref name="Ref_d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/ehrlich/3.html|title=The Population Explosion|website=www.ditext.com|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that even though the fertility rate has dropped to replacement level, people already within a population continue to live for some time. Therefore, equilibrium, with a static population, will not be reached until the first "replacement level" birth cohorts reach old age and die. The related calculations are complex because the population's overall death rate can vary over time, and mortality also varies with age (being highest among the old).

Conversely, with fertility below replacement, a large elderly generation eventually results (as in an aging “[[baby boom]]”); but since that generation failed to replace itself during its [[fertility|fertile]] years, a subsequent “population bust”, or decrease in population, will occur when the older generation dies off. This effect has been termed [[birth dearth]]. In addition, if a country's fertility is at replacement level, and has been that way for at least several decades (to stabilize its age distribution), then that country's population could still experience coincident growth due to continuously increasing [[life expectancy]], even though the population growth is likely to be smaller than it would be from natural population increase.

Zero population growth is often a goal of demographic planners and [[environmentalist]]s who believe that reducing population growth is essential for the health of the [[ecosystem]]. Preserving cultural traditions and [[ethnic diversity]] is a factor for not allowing human populations levels or rates to fall too low. Achieving ZPG is difficult because a country's population growth is often determined by economic factors, incidence of poverty, natural disasters, disease, etc.

However, even if there is zero population growth, there may be changes in demographics of great [[Demographic gift|importance to economic factors]], such as changes in [[population pyramid|age distribution]].

==How ZPG can be achieved==
Number of demographic experts have suggested a few ways to reach zero population growth.

Biologist Alan D. Thornhill and Author [[Daniel Quinn]] argue that human population growth is a function of the human food supply&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1011463231976#page-1|title = Human Population Numbers as a Function of Food Supply|last = Hoffenberg|first = Ruseell|date = March 2001|journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability|doi = 10.1023/A:1011463231976|pmid = |access-date = 12 December 2015|last2 = Pimentel|publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that human population growth can only be achieved by an expanded food supply to support the growing population. In 1998, they produced a video entitled "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAqWUxCjisE Food Production and Human Population Growth]" where they explain the theory and answer audience questions.

[[Albert Allen Bartlett|Albert Bartlett]], an emeritus professor of physics at University of Colorado at Boulder in his lifetime, suggested that the population have following choices to be at ZPG:

# Voluntarily limit births and immigration to achieve zero population growth;
#Continue on the present path until our population is so large that draconian measures become necessary to stop the growth of population;
#Do nothing and let nature stop the growth through disease, starvation, war and pestilence. If humans do not solve the problem, nature will.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Albert A. &amp; Lytwak, Edward P. “Zero Growth of the Population of the United States.” (http://www.albartlett.org/articles/ee_zero_growth_population_us_1995.pdf), Population and Environment, Vol.16, Issue 5, May. 1995, pp 415-428&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Jason Brent, another demographic expert, argues that there are three ways to achieve zero population growth. His argument is as follows:

# By war, with or without [[weapons of mass destruction]], [[starvation]], [[disease]], [[rape]], [[murder]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Internment|concentration camps]], and other horrors beyond the imagination, when humanity has exceeded the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth.
# By the voluntary action of all of humanity prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth. If any group or even if a single-family failed to control its population the entire program would fail.
# By coercive population control prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wooldbridge, Frosty (27 Feb 2013). “Zero population growth: only way out of world population overload” (http://churchandstate.org.uk/2013/03/zero-population-growth-only-way-out/).{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Church and State, Retrieved 2015-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In China==
[[China#Demographics|China]] is the largest country by population in the world, being home to some 1.4 billion people. China is expected to witness a zero population growth rate by 2030. China's population growth has slowed since the beginning of this century. This was mostly the result of China's economic growth and increasing living standards which led to the decline. However, many demographers also credit China's [[One-child policy|family planning policy]], which was formulated in the early 1970s, encourages late marriages, late childbearing, and the use of contraceptives, and since 1980 has limited most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children. According to government projections, the work-age population will then drop to 870 million.  It was said, in 2009, that the Chinese government was hoping to see zero population growth in the future&lt;ref name="Xiang2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/21/content_11746029.htm|title=China expected to see zero population growth by 2030: expert|last=Xiang|first=Zhang|date=21 July 2009|work=China View|accessdate=2010-03-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722071749/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/21/content_11746029.htm|archivedate=22 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in November 2013, a relaxation of the one-child policy was announced amid unpopularity, reduced labour pool and support for an ageing population.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24957303|title=China reforms: One-child policy to be relaxed|date=15 November 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
