      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1132">'''ASR-complete''' is, by analogy to "[[NP-completeness]]" in complexity theory, a term to indicate that the difficulty of a computational problem is equivalent to solving the central [[Automatic Speech Recognition]] problem, i.e. recognize and understanding [[spoken language]]. Unlike "NP-completeness", this term is typically used informally.

Such problems are hypothesised to include:

*Spoken natural language understanding
*Understanding speech from far-field microphones - i.e. handling the reverbation and background noise

These problems are easy for humans to do (in fact, they are described directly in terms of imitating humans). Some systems can solve very simple restricted versions of these problems, but none can solve them in their full generality.

[[File:Beckton STP, Activated Sludge Tank - geograph.org.uk - 1481906.jpg|thumb|Activated sludge tank at Beckton [[sewage treatment plant]], UK - the white bubbles are due to the diffused air aeration system]]
The '''activated sludge''' process is a type of [[wastewater treatment]] process for treating [[sewage]] or [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewaters]] using [[aeration]] and a biological [[floc (biofilm)|floc]] composed of bacteria and [[protozoa]].

The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items: An aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected in the mixed liquor. This is followed by a settling tank (usually referred to as "final clarifier" or "secondary settling tank") to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.

==Purpose==
[[Image:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|right|300 px|A generalized, schematic diagram of an activated sludge process.]]
[[File:Activated sludge addition to membrane bioreactor (5729651741).jpg|thumb|Activated sludge addition (seeding) to a pilot scale membrane bioreactor in Germany]]
[[File:Mikrofoto.de-Belebtschlamm 6.jpg|thumb|Activated sludge under the microscope]]
In a sewage (or industrial wastewater) treatment plant, the activated sludge process is a biological process that can be used for one or several of the following purposes: oxidizing [[biotic material|carbonaceous biological matter]], oxidizing nitrogenous matter: mainly [[ammonium]] and [[nitrogen]] in biological matter, removing [[nutrients]] (nitrogen and phosphorus).

==Process description==
The process takes advantage of [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] micro-organisms that can digest organic matter in sewage, and clump together (by [[flocculation]]) as they do so. It thereby produces a liquid that is relatively free from suspended solids and organic material, and flocculated particles that will readily settle out and can be removed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/pdf/WW/publications/pipline/PL_SP03.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous pollution includes the following items:
* Aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected in the mixed liquor.
* Settling tank (usually referred to as "final clarifier" or "secondary settling tank") to allow the biological flocs (the sludge blanket) to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.
  
Treatment of nitrogenous matter or phosphate involves additional steps where the mixed liquor is left in anoxic condition (meaning that there is no residual dissolved oxygen).

===Bioreactor and final clarifier===
The process involves air or [[oxygen]] being introduced into a mixture of screened, and primary treated sewage or industrial wastewater ([[wastewater]]) combined with organisms to develop a biological [[flocculation|floc]] which reduces the [[organic matter|organic]] content of the [[sewage]]. This material, which in healthy sludge is a brown floc, is largely composed of [[saprotrophic]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] but also has an important [[protozoa]]n flora component mainly composed of [[amoeba]]e, [[Spirotrich]]s, [[Peritrich]]s including [[Vorticella|Vorticellids]] and a range of other filter-feeding species. Other important constituents include motile and sedentary [[Rotifer]]s. In poorly managed activated sludge, a range of [[mucilage|mucilaginous]] filamentous bacteria can develop including ''[[Sphaerotilus natans]]'' which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket decanting over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality. This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal communities are relatively uncommon.

The combination of wastewater and biological mass is commonly known as ''mixed liquor''. In all activated sludge plants, once the wastewater has received sufficient treatment, excess mixed liquor is discharged into settling tanks and the treated [[supernatant]] is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the [[sludge]], is returned to the head of the [[aeration]] system to re-seed the new wastewater entering the tank. This fraction of the floc is called ''return activated sludge'' (R.A.S.).

The space required for a sewage treatment plant can be reduced by using a [[membrane bioreactor]] to remove some wastewater from the mixed liquor prior to treatment. This results in a more concentrated waste product that can then be treated using the activated sludge process.

Many sewage treatment plants use [[axial flow pump]]s to transfer nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification.  These pumps are often referred to as internal mixed liquor recycle pumps (IMLR pumps). The raw sewage, the RAS, and the nitrified mixed liquor are mixed by [[submersible mixer]]s in the anoxic zones in order to achieve denitrification.

=== Sludge production===
Activated sludge is also the name given to the active biological material produced by activated sludge plants. Excess sludge is called "surplus activated sludge" or "waste activated sludge" and is removed from the treatment process to keep the ratio of biomass to food supplied in the wastewater in balance. This [[sewage sludge]] is usually mixed with primary sludge from the primary clarifiers and undergoes further [[sewage sludge treatment|sludge treatment]] for example by [[anaerobic digestion]], followed by thickening, dewatering, [[composting]] and land application.

The amount of sewage sludge produced from the activated sludge process is directly proportional to the amount of wastewater treated. The total sludge production consists of the sum of primary sludge from the primary sedimentation tanks as well as waste activated sludge from the bioreactors. The activated sludge process produces about 70–100&amp;nbsp;kg/ML of waste activated sludge (that is kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). A value of 80&amp;nbsp;kg/ML is regarded as being typical.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title = Wastewater engineering : treatment and reuse|publisher = Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA|isbn = 0-07-112250-8|page = 1456|edition = 4th|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 110–170&amp;nbsp;kg/ML of primary sludge is produced in the primary sedimentation tanks which most - but not all - of the activated sludge process configurations use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A variant of the activated sludge process is the [[Nereda]] process where aerobic granular sludge is developed by applying specific process conditions that favour slow growing organisms.

===Process control===

The general process control method is to monitor sludge blanket level, SVI (Sludge Volume Index), MCRT (Mean Cell Residence Time), F/M (Food to Microorganism), as well as the biota of the activated sludge and the major nutrients DO ([[Dissolved oxygen]]), [[nitrogen]], [[phosphate]], BOD ([[Biochemical oxygen demand]]), and COD ([[Chemical oxygen demand]]). In the reactor/aerator and clarifier system, the sludge blanket is measured from the bottom of the clarifier to the level of settled solids in the clarifier's water column; this, in large plants, can be done up to three times a day.

The SVI is the volume of settled sludge in milliliters occupied by 1 gram of dry sludge solids after 30 minutes of settling in a 1000 milliliter graduated cylinder.&lt;ref name="MECC"&gt;[http://water.me.vccs.edu/courses/ENV149/operationb.htm#svi Operation and Control] From the Water/ Wastewater Distance Learning Website of the Mountain Empire Community College in Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath"&gt;[http://www.ragsdaleandassociates.com/WastewaterSystemOperatorsManual/Chapter%2017%20-%20Mathematics.pdf Mathematics For Wastewater Operators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907112903/http://www.ragsdaleandassociates.com/WastewaterSystemOperatorsManual/Chapter%2017%20-%20Mathematics.pdf |date=2012-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCRT is the total mass (lbs) of mixed liquor suspended solids in the aerator and clarifier divided by the mass flow rate (lbs/day) of mixed liquor suspended solids leaving as WAS and final effluent.&lt;ref name="MECC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath" /&gt; The F/M is the ratio of food fed to the microorganisms each day to the mass of microorganisms held under aeration. Specifically, it is the amount of BOD fed to the aerator (lbs/day) divided by the amount (lbs) of [[Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids]] (MLVSS) under aeration. Note:  Some references use MLSS (Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids) for expedience, but MLVSS is considered more accurate for the measure of microorganisms.&lt;ref name="MECC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WastewaterMath" /&gt; Again, due to expedience, COD is generally used, in lieu of BOD, as BOD takes five days for results.

Based on these control methods, the amount of settled solids in the mixed liquor can be varied by wasting activated sludge (WAS) or returning activated sludge (RAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckenfelder, Jr.|first1=W. Wesley|last2=Cleary|first2=Joseph G.|title=Activated Sludge Technologies for Treating Industrial Wastewaters|date=2014|publisher=DEStech Publications|isbn=978-1-60595-019-8|pages=234|edition=1st|url=http://www.destechpub.com/links/catalogs/bookstore/environmental-technology-6/activated-sludge-technologies-for-treating-industrial-wastewaters/|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of plants==

There are a variety of types of activated sludge plants.&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; These include:

===Package plants===
There are a wide range of types of package plants, often serving small communities or industrial plants that may use hybrid treatment processes often involving the use of aerobic sludge to treat the incoming sewage. In such plants the primary settlement stage of treatment may be omitted. In these plants, a biotic floc is created which provides the required substrate.  Package plants are designed and fabricated by specialty engineering firms in dimensions that allow for their transportation to the job site in public highways, typically width and height of 12 by 12 feet.  Length varies with capacity with larger plants being fabricated in pieces and welded on site.  Steel is preferred over synthetic materials (e.g., plastic) for its durability.

Package plants are commonly variants of [[extended aeration]], to promote the 'fit &amp; forget' approach required for small communities without dedicated operational staff. There are various standards to assist with their design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishwater.co.uk/Document/Download.aspx?uid=3d63842c-eb86-48b1-be17-12eebf7487a5 Code of Practice, ''Flows and Loads-2'', British Water]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://products.ihs.com/cis/Doc.aspx?AuthCode=&amp;DocNum=252510 Review of UK and international standards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105619/http://products.ihs.com/cis/Doc.aspx?AuthCode=&amp;DocNum=252510 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardsdirect.org/standards/standards4/StandardsCatalogue24_view_5158.html British Standard BS 6297:1983]&lt;/ref&gt;

To use less space, treat difficult waste, and intermittent flows, a number of designs of hybrid treatment plants have been produced. Such plants often combine at least two stages of the three main treatment stages into one combined stage. In the UK, where a large number of wastewater treatment plants serve small populations, package plants are a viable alternative to building a large structure for each process stage. In the US, package plants are typically used in rural areas, highway rest stops and trailer parks.&lt;ref name="EPA Package"&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2000). [http://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/package_plant.pdf "Package Plants."] Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet. Document no. EPA 832-F-00-016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidation ditch===
In some areas, where more land is available, sewage is treated in large round or oval ditches with one or more horizontal aerators typically called brush or disc aerators which drive the mixed liquor around the ditch and provide aeration.&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; These are oxidation ditches, often referred to by manufacturer's trade names such as Pasveer, Orbal, or Carrousel. They have the advantage that they are relatively easy to maintain and are resilient to shock loads that often occur in smaller communities (i.e. at breakfast time and in the evening).

Oxidation ditches are installed commonly as 'fit &amp; forget' technology, with typical design parameters of a [[hydraulic retention time]] of 24 – 48 hours, and a sludge age of 12 – 20 days. This compares with nitrifying activated sludge plants having a retention time of 8 hours, and a sludge age of 8 – 12 days.

===Deep shaft / Vertical treatment===
Where land is in short supply sewage may be treated by injection of oxygen into a pressured return sludge stream which is injected into the base of a deep columnar tank buried in the ground. Such shafts may be up to 100 metres deep and are filled with sewage liquor. As the sewage rises the oxygen forced into solution by the pressure at the base of the shaft breaks out as molecular oxygen providing a highly efficient source of oxygen for the activated sludge biota. The rising oxygen and injected return sludge provide the physical mechanism for mixing of the sewage and sludge. Mixed sludge and sewage is decanted at the surface and separated into supernatant and sludge components. The efficiency of deep shaft treatment can be high.

Surface aerators are commonly quoted as having an aeration efficiency of 0.5 - 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh, diffused aeration as 1.5 - 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/KWh. Deep Shaft claims 5 – 8&amp;nbsp;kg O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh.

However, the costs of construction are high. Deep Shaft has seen the greatest uptake in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wholewater.com/H2OTREATMENT/verticalshaftprojects.htm Vertical Shaft Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; because of the land area issues. Deep Shaft was developed by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], as a spin-off from their [[Pruteen]] process. In the UK it is found at three sites: Tilbury, Anglian water, treating a wastewater with a high industrial contribution;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=8054833 Tilbury construction]&lt;/ref&gt; Southport, United Utilities, because of land space issues; and Billingham, ICI, again treating industrial effluent, and built (after the Tilbury shafts) by ICI to help the agent sell more.

DeepShaft is a patented, licensed, process. The licensee has changed several times and currently (2015) Noram Engineering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noram-eng.com/groups/biosystems-group-overview.html NORAM VERTREAT™ (VERtical TREATment)]&lt;/ref&gt; sells it.

===Surface-aerated basins===
{{further|Aerated lagoon}}
[[Image:Surface-Aerated Basin.png|thumb|right|318px|A Typical Surface-Aerated Basing (using motor-driven floating aerators)]]
Most biological oxidation processes for treating industrial wastewaters have in common the use of oxygen (or air) and microbial action. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90% removal of [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] with retention times of 1 to 10 days.&lt;ref name=Basin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, M.R.|year=1971|title=Performance of surface-aerated basins|journal=Chemical Engineering Progress Symposium Series|volume=67|issue=107|pages=322–339|issn=}} [http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes Available at CSA Illumina website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114140052/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7112203&amp;q=&amp;uid=788301038&amp;setcookie=yes |date=2007-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres and utilize motor-driven aerators floating on the surface of the wastewater.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

In an aerated basin system, the aerators provide two functions: they transfer air into the basins required by the biological oxidation reactions, and they provide the mixing required for dispersing the air and for contacting the reactants (that is, oxygen, wastewater and microbes). Typically, the floating surface aerators are rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7&amp;nbsp;kg [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[kW]]h. However, they do not provide as good mixing as is normally achieved in activated sludge systems and therefore aerated basins do not achieve the same performance level as activated sludge units.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 40&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4&amp;nbsp;°C and 32&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Basin/&gt;

=== Sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) ===
{{Main|Sequencing batch reactor}}
[[Sequencing batch reactor]]s (SBRs) treat wastewater in batches within the same vessel. This means that the bioreactor and final clarifier are not separated in space but in a timed sequence. The installation consists of at least two identically equipped tanks with a common inlet, which can be switched between them. While one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is [[aeration|aerating]] and filling.

== Aeration methods ==

===Diffused aeration ===

Sewage liquor is run into deep tanks with [[Diffuser (sewage)|diffuser]] grid aeration systems that are attached to the floor. These are like the diffused [[airstone]] used in [[tropical fish]] tanks but on a much larger scale. Air is pumped through the blocks and the curtain of bubbles formed both oxygenates the liquor and also provides the necessary mixing action. Where capacity is limited or the sewage is unusually strong or difficult to treat, oxygen may be used instead of air. Typically, the air is generated by some type of blower or compressor.

=== Surface aerators (cones) ===
Vertically mounted tubes of up to 1-metre diameter extending from just above the base of a deep concrete tank to just below the surface of the sewage liquor. A typical shaft might be 10 metres high. At the surface end, the tube is formed into a cone with helical vanes attached to the inner surface. When the tube is rotated, the vanes spin liquor up and out of the cones drawing new sewage liquor from the base of the tank. In many works, each cone is located in a separate cell that can be isolated from the remaining cells if required for maintenance. Some works may have two cones to a cell and some large works may have 4 cones per cell.

===Pure oxygen aeration===
Pure oxygen activated sludge aeration systems are sealed-tank reactor vessels with surface aerator type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen carbon liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen entrainment, or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), can be controlled by a weir adjusted level control, and a vent gas oxygen controlled oxygen feed valve. Oxygen is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, [[pressure swing adsorption]], or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.

== Recent developments ==
A new development of the activated sludge process is the [[Nereda]] process which produces a granular sludge that settles very well (the sludge volume index is reduced from 200-300 to 40 mL/g). A new process reactor system is created to take advantage of this quick settling sludge and is integrated into the aeration tank instead of having a separate unit outside.&lt;ref name="thesourcemagazine.org"&gt;http://www.thesourcemagazine.org/mark-van-loosdrecht-professor-at-delft-university-of-technology/&lt;/ref&gt; About 30 Nereda wastewater treatment plants worldwide are operational, under construction or under design, varying in size from 5,000 up to 858,000 person equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/15338-first-of-three-nereda-wastewater-treatment-plants-in-ireland-took-flow.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610185342/http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/15338-first-of-three-nereda-wastewater-treatment-plants-in-ireland-took-flow.html |archive-date=2016-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Davyhulme Laboratory - early 20th century.jpg|thumb|The [[Davyhulme#Davyhulme Sewage Works|Davyhulme Sewage Works Laboratory]], where the activated sludge process was developed in the early 20th century.]]
The activated sludge process was discovered in 1913 in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] by two engineers, Edward Ardern and W.T. Lockett,&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd | year=1967 | id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were conducting research for the Manchester Corporation Rivers Department at [[Davyhulme Sewage Works]]. This development led to arguably the single most significant improvement in [[public health]] and the [[Ecology#Physical environments|environment]] during the course of the century.

In 1912, Dr. [[Gilbert John Fowler|Gilbert Fowler]], a scientist at the [[University of Manchester]], observed experiments being conducted at the Lawrence Experiment Station at [[Massachusetts]] involving the aeration of sewage in a bottle that had been coated with algae. Fowler's engineering colleagues, Ardern and Lockett,&lt;ref name="Beychok"/&gt; experimented on treating sewage in a [[sequencing batch reactor|draw-and-fill reactor]], which produced a highly treated effluent. They aerated the waste-water continuously for about a month and were able to achieve a complete nitrification of the sample material. Believing that the sludge had been activated (in a similar manner to [[activated carbon]]) the process was named ''activated sludge''. Not until much later was it realized that what had actually occurred was a means to concentrate biological organisms, decoupling the liquid retention time (ideally, low, for a compact treatment system) from the solids retention time (ideally, fairly high, for an effluent low in BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ammonia.)

Their results were published in their seminal 1914 paper, and the first full-scale continuous-flow system was installed at [[Worcester]] two years later. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]] the new treatment method spread rapidly, especially to the USA, [[Denmark]], [[Germany]] and [[Canada]]. By the late 1930s, the activated sludge treatment became a well-known biological wastewater treatment process in those countries where [[sanitary sewer|sewer systems]] and [[sewage treatment plant]]s were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_v0WjdM6sLoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Culture of Flushing: A Social and Legal History of Sewage|author=Benidickson, Jamie|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animal locomotion''', in [[ethology]], is any of a variety of movements or methods that [[animal (biology)|animal]]s use to move from one place to another.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/345861/locomotion|title=Animal locomotion|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modes of locomotion are (initially) self-propelled, e.g., running, swimming, jumping, flying, hopping, soaring and gliding. There are also many animal species that depend on their environment for transportation, a type of mobility called [[Passive locomotion in animals|passive locomotion]], e.g., sailing (some jellyfish), [[Ballooning (spider)|kiting]] (spiders), rolling (some beetles and spiders) or riding other animals ([[phoresis (biology)|phoresis]]).

Animals move for a variety of reasons, such as to find [[Foraging|food]], a [[Mating system|mate]], a suitable [[microhabitat]], or to [[Escape response|escape predators]]. For many animals, the ability to move is essential for survival and, as a result, [[natural selection]] has shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms used by moving organisms. For example, [[Animal migration|migratory animals]] that travel vast distances (such as the [[Arctic tern]]) typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance, whereas non-migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to [[Escape reflex|escape predators]] are likely to have energetically costly, but very fast, locomotion.

The anatomical structures that animals use for movement, including [[Cilium|cilia]], [[leg]]s, [[wing]]s, [[arm]]s, [[fin]]s, or [[tail]]s are sometimes referred to as ''locomotory organs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beckett | first = B.

==Etymology==
The term "locomotion" is formed in English from Latin ''loco'' "from a place" (ablative of ''locus'' "place") + ''motio'' "motion, a moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=locomotion|title=Locomotion|accessdate=December 16, 2014|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--we could mention names like planthopper, mudskipper, sugarglider, treecreeper, roadrunner, backswimmer, pond skater as being derived from means of loco, perhaps, with suitable refs--&gt;

==Locomotion in different media==
Animals move through, or on, four types of environment: [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] (in or on water), [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] (on ground or other surface, including [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]], or tree-dwelling), [[fossorial]] (underground), and [[Flying and gliding animals|aerial]] (in the air).  Many animals—for example [[:wikt:semi-aquatic|semi-aquatic]] animals, and [[diving bird]]s—regularly move through more than one type of medium. In some cases, the surface they move on facilitates their method of locomotion.

==Aquatic==
{{Main|Aquatic locomotion}}

===Swimming===
[[File:Dolphinsurfresize.jpg|thumb|Dolphins surfing]]
{{further|Fish locomotion}}

In water, staying afloat is possible using buoyancy. If an animal's body is less dense than water, it can stay afloat. This requires little energy to maintain a vertical position, but requires more energy for locomotion in the horizontal plane compared to less buoyant animals. The [[Drag (physics)|drag]] encountered in water is much greater than in air. Morphology is therefore important for efficient locomotion, which is in most cases essential for basic functions such as [[predation|catching prey]]. A fusiform, [[torpedo]]-like body form is seen in many aquatic animals,&lt;ref name="Gaston"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gaston, K.A., Eft, J.A. and Lauer, T.E.|year=2016|title=Morphology and its effect on habitat selection of stream fishes|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science|volume=121|issue=1|pages=71–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewar"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dewar, H.  |author2=Graham, J.|year=1994|title=Studies of tropical tuna swimming performance in a large water tunnel-kinematics|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=192|issue=1|pages=45–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the mechanisms they use for locomotion are diverse.

The primary means by which [[fish]] generate [[thrust]] is by oscillating the body from side-to-side, the resulting wave motion ending at a large [[Caudal fin|tail fin]]. Finer control, such as for slow movements, is often achieved with thrust from [[pectoral fins]] (or front limbs in marine mammals).  Some fish, e.g. the spotted ratfish (''Hydrolagus colliei'') and batiform fish (electric rays, sawfishes, guitarfishes, skates and stingrays) use their pectoral fins as the primary means of locomotion, sometimes termed [[labriform swimming]].  [[Marine mammal]]s oscillate their body in an up-and-down (dorso-ventral) direction.
Other animals, e.g. penguins, diving ducks, move underwater in a manner which has been termed "aquatic flying".&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walker, J.A. and Westneat, M.W.|year=2000|title=Mechanical performance of aquatic rowing and flying|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=267|issue=1455|pages=1875–1881|doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1224|pmc=1690750}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some fish propel themselves without a wave motion of the body, as in the slow-moving seahorses&lt;!--which rely on [[camouflage]] among seaweeds--&gt; and ''[[Gymnotus]]''&lt;!--which need a straight back to generate stable electric fields--&gt;.&lt;ref name=Sfakiotakis&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sfakiotakis, M., Lane, D.M. and Davies, J.B.C. |year=1999 |title=Review of Fish Swimming Modes for Aquatic Locomotion |url=http://www.mor-fin.com/Science-related-links_files/http___www.ece.eps.hw.ac.uk_Research_oceans_people_Michael_Sfakiotakis_IEEEJOE_99.pdf |journal=IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering |volume=24 |pages=237–252 |doi=10.1109/48.757275 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224091124/http://www.mor-fin.com/Science-related-links_files/http___www.ece.eps.hw.ac.uk_Research_oceans_people_Michael_Sfakiotakis_IEEEJOE_99.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-24 |bibcode=1999IJOE...24..237S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals, such as [[Cephalopoda|cephalopods]], use [[jet propulsion]] to travel fast, taking in water then squirting it back out in an explosive burst.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/accessory/Cephalopod_Jet_Propulsion?acc_id=2060 |title=Cephalopod jet propulsion|author1=Young, R.E.  |author2=Katharina M. Mangold, K.M. |publisher=Tree of Life |accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other swimming animals may rely predominantly on their limbs, much as humans do when swimming. Though life on land originated from the seas, terrestrial animals have returned to an aquatic lifestyle on several occasions, such as the fully aquatic [[cetacean]]s, now very distinct from their terrestrial ancestors.

Dolphins sometimes ride on the [[bow wave]]s created by boats or surf on naturally breaking waves.&lt;ref name="Fish"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fish, F.E.  |author2=Hui, C.A. |year=1991 |title=Dolphin swimming–a review |journal=Mammal Review |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=181–195 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2907.1991.tb00292.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benthic===
[[File:scallop jump.svg|thumb|[[Scallop]] in jumping motion; these bivalves can also swim.]]

[[Benthic]] locomotion is movement by animals that live on, in, or near the bottom of aquatic environments. In the sea, many animals walk over the seabed.  [[Echinoderms]] primarily use their [[tube feet]] to move about. The tube feet typically have a tip shaped like a suction pad that can create a vacuum through contraction of muscles. This, along with some stickiness from the secretion of [[mucus]], provides adhesion. Waves of tube feet contractions and relaxations move along the adherent surface and the animal moves slowly along.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, J. E. |year=1937 |title=The structure and function of the tube feet in certain echinoderms |journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=345–357 |doi=10.1017/S0025315400012042 |url=http://sabella.mba.ac.uk/966/01/The_structure_and_function_of_the_tube_feet_in_certain_echinoderms.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115215341/http://sabella.mba.ac.uk/966/01/The_structure_and_function_of_the_tube_feet_in_certain_echinoderms.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sea urchins also use their spines for benthic locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chenoweth |first1=Stanley |title=The Green Sea Urchin in Maine, Fishery and Biology|url=http://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/species/seaurchin/green_sea_urchin_general_summary.html |publisher=State of Maine |accessdate=4 October 2016 |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crabs typically walk sideways&lt;ref name="Sleinis"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Locomotion in a forward walking crab |author1=Sleinis, S.  |author2=Silvey, G.E. |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A |volume=136 |issue=4 |year=1980 |doi=10.1007/BF00657350 |pages=301–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a behaviour that gives us the word [[wikt:crabwise|''crabwise'']]). This is because of the articulation of the legs, which makes a sidelong gait more efficient.&lt;ref name="Vidal-Gadea"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Skeletal adaptations for forwards and sideways walking in three species of decapod crustaceans |author1=A.

A stomatopod, ''[[Nannosquilla decemspinosa]]'', can escape by rolling itself into a self-propelled wheel and somersault backwards at a speed of 72 rpm.  They can travel more than 2 m using this unusual method of locomotion.&lt;ref name="Srour"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 29, 2016|title=Mantis Shrimp (Crustacea: Stomatopoda)|date=July 13, 2011|author=Srour, M.|publisher=Bioteaching.com|url=http://bioteaching.com/mantis-shrimp-crustacea-stomatopoda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquatic surface==
[[File:Velella Bae an Anaon.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Velella]]'' moves by sailing.]]
{{Main|Animal locomotion on the water surface}}

''[[Velella]]'', the by-the-wind sailor, is a cnidarian with no means of propulsion other than [[sailing]]. A small rigid sail projects into the air and catches the wind. ''Velella'' sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an [[aerofoil]], so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Animal Locomotion |first=R. |last=McNeill Alexander |authorlink=R. McNeill Alexander |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-691-08678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While larger animals such as ducks can move on water by floating, some small animals move across it without breaking through the surface. This surface locomotion takes advantage of the [[surface tension]] of water. Animals that move in such a way include the [[water strider]]. Water striders have legs that are [[hydrophobic]], preventing them from interfering with the structure of water.&lt;ref name="Gao"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gao, X.  |author2=Jiang, L.|year=2004|title=Biophysics: water-repellent legs of water striders|journal=Nature|volume=432|issue=7013|pages=36–36|doi=10.1038/432036a|bibcode=2004Natur.432...36G}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another form of locomotion (in which the surface layer is broken) is used by the [[basilisk lizard]].&lt;ref name="NationalGeographic"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Geographic News|year=2010|accessdate=February 20, 2016|title=How "Jesus Lizards" walk on water|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/11/1116_041116_jesus_lizard_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerial==
===Active flight===
[[File:Brimstone Butterflies Twisting Wings in Courtship Flight.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[Gonepteryx rhamni|brimstone butterflies]] in flight. The female, above, is in fast forward flight with a small [[angle of attack]]; the male, below, is twisting his wings sharply upward to gain [[lift (force)|lift]] and fly up towards the female.]]
{{Main|Flight|Flying and gliding animals}}

Gravity is the primary obstacle to [[flight]]. Because it is impossible for any organism to have a density as low as that of air, flying animals must generate enough [[Lift (force)|lift]] to ascend and remain airborne. One way to achieve this is with [[wing]]s, which when moved through the air generate an upward [[lift (force)|lift force]] on the animal's body. Flying animals must be very light to achieve flight, the largest living flying animals being birds of around 20 kilograms.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; Other structural adaptations of flying animals include reduced and redistributed body weight, fusiform shape and powerful flight muscles;&lt;ref name="Hedenstrom"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hedenstrom, A.  |author2=Moller, A.P. |year=1992 |title=Morphological adaptations to song flight in passerine birds: a comparative study |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=247 |issue=1320 |pages=183–187 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1992.0026}}&lt;/ref&gt; there may also be physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Sacktor"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sacktor, B. |year=1975 |title=Biochemical adaptations for flight in the insect |journal=Biochemical Society Symposium |volume=41 |pages=111–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active flight has [[convergent evolution|independently]] evolved at least four times, in the [[insect flight|insect]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[bird flight|bird]]s, and [[bat]]s. Insects were the first taxon to evolve flight, approximately 400 million years ago (mya),&lt;ref name="Selleh"&gt;{{cite web |title=Insects evolved flight as plants grew taller |date=November 7, 2014 |author=Salleh, A. |publisher=ABC |accessdate=October 14, 2016 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/11/07/4121879.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by pterosaurs approximately 220 mya,&lt;ref&gt;https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/12007/1/zitteliana_2008_b28_05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; birds approximately 160 mya,&lt;ref name=NatureBird&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pascal Godefroit |author2=Andrea Cau |author3=Hu Dong-Yu |author4=François Escuillié |author5=Wu Wenhao |author6=Gareth Dyke |year=2013 |title=A Jurassic avialan dinosaur from China resolves the early phylogenetic history of birds |journal=Nature |volume= 498|issue= 7454|pages= 359–62 |doi=10.1038/nature12168 |bibcode = 2013Natur.498..359G |pmid=23719374}}&lt;/ref&gt; then bats about 60 mya.&lt;ref name="Chiropteran"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vertebrate flight: Chiropteran flight |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/bats.html |accessdate=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2016}}

===Gliding===
{{Main|Flying and gliding animals}}
Rather than active flight, some (semi-) arboreal animals reduce their rate of falling by [[gliding (flight)|gliding]].  Gliding is heavier-than-air flight without the use of [[thrust]]; the term "volplaning" also refers to this mode of flight in animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/volplane volplane]. The Free Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;  This mode of flight involves flying a greater distance horizontally than vertically and therefore can be distinguished from a simple descent like a parachute. Gliding has evolved on more occasions than active flight.  There are examples of gliding animals in several major taxonomic classes such as the invertebrates (e.g., [[gliding ant]]s), reptiles (e.g., [[banded flying snake]]), amphibians (e.g., [[flying frog]]), mammals (e.g., [[sugar glider]], [[squirrel glider]]).

[[File:Pink-wing flying fish.jpg|thumb|2oopx|right|Flying fish taking off]]

Some aquatic animals also regularly use gliding, for example, [[flying fish]], octopus and squid.  The flights of flying fish are typically around 50&amp;nbsp;meters (160&amp;nbsp;ft),&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"&gt;[[Ross Piper]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flying Fish, Exocoetidae"&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/flying-fish/ Flying Fish, ''Exocoetidae''] ''National Geographic''.

===Soaring===
Soaring birds can maintain flight without wing flapping, using rising air currents. Many gliding birds are able to "lock" their extended wings by means of a specialized tendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Loon | first=Rael | title=Sasol Birds - The Inside Story | publisher=New Holland Published | location=City | year=2005 | isbn=1-77007-151-2 | page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soaring birds may alternate glides with periods of soaring in [[lift (soaring)|rising air]]. Five principal types of lift are used:&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;{{cite book | last=Welch | first=John | title=Van Sickle's Modern Airmanship | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=1999 | pages=856–858 | isbn=0-07-069633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[thermal]]s, [[ridge lift]], [[lee waves]], [[Convergence zone|convergences]] and [[dynamic soaring]].

Examples of soaring flight by birds are the use of:
*Thermals and convergences by [[bird of prey|raptor]]s such as [[vulture]]s
*Ridge lift by [[gull]]s near cliffs
*Wave lift by migrating birds&lt;ref&gt;[Report of use of wave lift by birds by Netherlands Institute for Ecology]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Dynamic effects near the surface of the sea by [[albatross]]es

===Ballooning===
[[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning]] is a method of locomotion used by spiders. Certain silk-producing [[arthropod]]s, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight [[Gossamer (spider silk)|gossamer silk]] for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrichs, Ann R. (2004) "[http://www.worldcat.org/title/spiders/oclc/54027960 Spiders]". Compass Point Books, ''Primary School : Nature's Friends'' series; Minneapolis, Minn. {{ISBN|9780756505905}}. She observes that the so-called ballooning is like a kite&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=instar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valerio |first=C.E. |year=1977 |title=Population structure in the spider ''Achaearranea Tepidariorum'' (Aranae, Theridiidae) |journal=Journal of Arachnology |volume=3 |pages=185–190 |url=http://fms.holycross.edu/JoA_free/JoA_v3_n3/JoA_v3_p185.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719210153/http://fms.holycross.edu/JoA_free/JoA_v3_n3/JoA_v3_p185.pdf |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=2009-07-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrestrial==
{{Main|Terrestrial locomotion}}
{{See also|Comparative foot morphology}}
[[File:Alticus arnoldorum hopping - pone.0011197.s007.ogv|thumb|[[Pacific leaping blenny]] ''Alticus arnoldorum'' hopping]]
[[File:Alticus arnoldorum climbing up a vertical piece of Plexiglas - pone.0011197.s009.ogv|thumb|Pacific leaping blenny climbing up a vertical piece of Plexiglas]]
Forms of locomotion on land include walking, running, hopping or [[jumping]], dragging and crawling or slithering. Here friction and buoyancy are no longer an issue, but a strong [[skeletal]] and [[muscular]] framework are required in most terrestrial animals for structural support. Each step also requires much energy to overcome [[inertia]], and animals can store [[elastic potential energy]] in their [[tendon]]s to help overcome this. [[Equilibrioception|Balance]] is also required for movement on land. Human [[infant]]s learn to [[Crawling (human)|crawl]] first before they are able to stand on two feet, which requires good coordination as well as physical development. Humans are [[bipedal]] animals, standing on two feet and keeping one on the ground at all times while [[walking]]. When [[running]], only one foot is on the ground at any one time at most, and both leave the ground briefly. At higher speeds [[momentum]] helps keep the body upright, so more energy can be used in movement.

===Jumping===
{{main|Jumping}}

Jumping (saltation) can be distinguished from running, galloping, and other gaits where the entire body is temporarily airborne by the relatively long duration of the aerial phase and high angle of initial launch. Many terrestrial animals use jumping (including hopping or leaping) to escape predators or catch prey—however, relatively few animals use this as a primary mode of locomotion. Those that do include the [[kangaroo]] and other macropods, [[rabbit]], [[hare]], [[jerboa]], [[hopping mouse]], and [[kangaroo rat]]. Kangaroo rats often leap 2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;ref name="BLM_CA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Merriam's Kangaroo Rat ''Dipodomys merriami'' | work=U. S.

{{anchor|Peristalsis}}
[[File:Leech looping locomotion.jpg|thumb|upright|Leech moving by looping using its front and back suckers]]

===Peristalsis and looping===
Other animals move in terrestrial habitats without the aid of legs. [[Earthworm]]s crawl by a [[peristalsis]], the same rhythmic contractions that propel food through the digestive tract.&lt;ref name=Quillan2000&gt;{{cite journal |date=2000 |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=203 |issue=Pt 18 |pages=2757–2770 |author=Quillan, K.J. |title=Ontogenetic scaling of burrowing forces in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/18/2757.full.pdf+html |pmid=10952876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20100214 Leech climbing door at Lake Leake, Tasmania.ogv|thumb|Leech moving on a flat surface]]

[[Leech]]es and [[geometer moth]] caterpillars move by looping or inching (measuring off a length with each movement), using their paired circular and longitudinal muscles (as for peristalsis) along with the ability to attach to a surface at both anterior and posterior ends. One end is attached and the other end is projected forward peristaltically until it touches down, as far as it can reach; then the first end is released, pulled forward, and reattached; and the cycle repeats. In the case of leeches, attachment is by a sucker at each end of the body.&lt;ref name="Brusca 2016"&gt;{{cite book | last=Brusca | first=Richard | title=Hirudinoidea: Leeches and Their Relatives | work=Invertebrates | publisher=Sinauer Associates | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-60535-375-3 | pages=591–597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sliding===
Due to its low coefficient of friction, ice provides the opportunity for other modes of locomotion.  Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ''tobogganing'', which conserves energy while moving quickly. Some pinnipeds perform a similar behaviour called ''sledding''.

===Brachiation===
Some animals are specialized for moving on non-horizontal surfaces. One common habitat for such [[arboreal locomotion|climbing animals]] is in trees, for example the [[gibbon]] is specialized for [[arboreal]] movement, traveling rapidly by [[brachiation]]. Another case is animals like the [[snow leopard]] living on steep rock faces such as are found in [[mountain]]s. Some light animals are able to climb up smooth sheer surfaces or hang upside down by [[adhesion]] using [[sucker (zoology)|suckers]]. Many insects can do this, though much larger animals such as [[gecko]]s can also perform similar feats.

===Walking and running===
Species have different numbers of legs resulting in large differences in locomotion.

&lt;!--Monopedalism means jumping using one hard foot--&gt;
Modern birds, though classified as [[tetrapod]]s, usually have only two functional legs, which some (e.g., ostrich, emu, kiwi) use as their primary, [[Bipedalism|Bipedal]], mode of locomotion.  A few modern mammalian species are habitual bipeds, i.e., whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. These include the [[Macropodidae|macropods]], [[Dipodomyinae|kangaroo rats and mice]], [[springhare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heglund, N.C. | author2=Cavagna, G.A. | author3=Taylor, C.R. | year=1982 | title=Energetics and mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. III. Energy changes of the centre of mass as a function of speed and body size in birds and mammals | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=97 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hopping mice]], [[pangolin]]s and [[hominina]]n apes. Bipedalism is rarely found outside [[terrestrial animal]]s—though at least two types of [[octopus]] walk bipedally on the sea floor using two of their arms, so they can use the remaining arms to camouflage themselves as a mat of algae or floating coconut.&lt;ref name="pmid15790846"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huffard CL, Boneka F, Full RJ |title=Underwater bipedal locomotion by octopuses in disguise |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5717 |page=1927 |year=2005 |pmid=15790846 |doi=10.1126/science.1109616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no three-legged animals—though some macropods, such as kangaroos, that alternate between resting their weight on their muscular tails and their two hind legs, could be looked at as an example of [[Tripedalism|tripedal]] locomotion in animals.

[[File:Muz PGI 1728-II-16 animated v20150114.svg|thumb|Animation of a [[Devonian]] tetrapod]]

Many familiar animals are [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]], walking or running on four legs. A few birds use quadrupedal movement in some circumstances. For example, the [[shoebill]] sometimes uses its wings to right itself after lunging at prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Naish |first=Darren |url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/12/balaeniceps_rex.php#more |title=B. rex! – Tetrapod Zoology |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly hatched [[hoatzin]] bird has claws on its thumb and first finger enabling it to dexterously climb tree branches until its wings are strong enough for sustained flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1891.tb00045.x |last=Parker |first= W.

A relatively few animals use five limbs for locomotion. [[Prehensile]] quadrupeds may use their tail to assist in locomotion and when grazing, the kangaroos and other macropods use their tail to propel themselves forward with the four legs used to maintain balance.

Insects generally walk with six legs—though some insects such as [[Nymphalidae|nymphalid butterflies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Butterflies in the Nymphalidae family |url=http://www.bumblebee.org/invertebrates/Lepidoptera1.htm |accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not use the front legs for walking.

[[Arachnid]]s have eight legs.  Most arachnids lack [[extension (kinesiology)|extensor]] muscles in the [[distal]] joints of their appendages. Spiders and [[whipscorpion]]s extend their limbs hydraulically using the pressure of their [[hemolymph]].&lt;ref name=Sensenig2003&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1242/jeb.00182| issn=1477-9145| volume=206| issue=4| pages=771–784| last=Sensenig| first=Andrew T| author2=Jeffrey W Shultz| title=Mechanics of Cuticular Elastic Energy Storage in Leg Joints Lacking Extensor Muscles in Arachnids| journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]]| accessdate=2012-05-18| date=2003-02-15| url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/4/771}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solifuge]]s and some [[harvestmen]] extend their knees by the use of highly elastic thickenings in the joint cuticle.&lt;ref name=Sensenig2003/&gt; [[Scorpion]]s, [[pseudoscorpion]]s and some harvestmen have evolved muscles that extend two leg joints (the femur-patella and patella-tibia joints) at once.&lt;ref name=Shultz2005&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1002/jmor.1052100103| issn=1097-4687| volume=210| issue=1| pages=13–31| last=Shultz| first=Jeffrey W| title=Evolution of locomotion in arachnida: The hydraulic pressure pump of the giant whipscorpion, Mastigoproctus Giganteus (Uropygi)| journal=[[Journal of Morphology]]| date=2005-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shultz1992&gt;{{Cite journal| issn=1477-9145| volume=162| issue=1| pages=313–329| last=Shultz| first=Jeffrey W| title=Muscle Firing Patterns in Two Arachnids Using Different Methods of Propulsive Leg Extension| journal=Journal of Experimental Biology| accessdate=2012-05-19| date=1992-01-01| url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/162/1/313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scorpion ''[[Hadrurus arizonensis]]'' walks by using two groups of legs (left 1, right 2, Left 3, Right 4 and Right 1, Left 2, Right 3, Left 4) in a reciprocating fashion. This alternating tetrapod coordination is used over all walking speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bowerman, R.F.|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|year=1975|volume=100|issue=3|pages=183–196|title=The control of walking in the scorpion|doi=10.1007/bf00614529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centipedes and millipedes have many sets of legs that move in [[metachronal rhythm]].  Some echinoderms locomote using the many [[tube feet]] on the underside of their arms.  Although the tube feet resemble suction cups in appearance, the gripping action is a function of adhesive chemicals rather than suction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hennebert, E. |author2=Santos, R. |author3=Flammang, P. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2012|title=Echinoderms don’t suck: evidence against the involvement of suction in tube foot attachment|journal=Zoosymposia|volume=1|pages=25–32|url=http://www.mapress.com/zoosymposia/content/2012/v7/f/v007p025-032f.pdf|issn=1178-9913}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate.

Many animals temporarily change the number of legs they use for locomotion in different circumstances. For example, many quadrupedal animals switch to bipedalism to reach low-level browse on trees. The genus of ''[[Basiliscus (genus)|Basiliscus]]'' are arboreal lizards that usually use quadrupedalism in the trees.  When frightened, they can drop to water below and run across the surface on their hind limbs at about 1.5&amp;nbsp;m/s for a distance of approximately {{convert|4.5|m}} before they sink to all fours and swim.  They can also sustain themselves on all fours while "water-walking" to increase the distance travelled above the surface by about 1.3 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/11/1116_041116_jesus_lizard.html|title=How "Jesus Lizards" walk on water |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When cockroaches run rapidly, they rear up on their two hind legs like bipedal humans; this allows them to run at speeds up to 50 body lengths/s, equivalent to a "couple hundred miles per hour, if you scale up to the size of humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sanders, R.|year =2012|title=Stealth behavior allows cockroaches to seemingly vanish|url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/06/06/stealth-behavior-allows-cockroaches-to-seemingly-vanish/|publisher=UC Berkeley News Center|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When grazing, kangaroos use a form of pentapedalism (four legs plus the tail) but switch to hopping (bipedalism) when they wish to move at a greater speed.

The Moroccan flic-flac spider (''[[Cebrennus rechenbergi]]'') uses a series of rapid, acrobatic [[flic-flac]] movements of its legs similar to those used by gymnasts, to actively propel itself off the ground, allowing it to move both down and uphill, even at a 40 percent incline.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite book|author=King, R.S.|year=2013|chapter=''BiLBIQ: A Biologically Inspired Robot with Walking and Rolling Locomotion''|title= Biosystems and Biorobotics. 2|publisher=Springer, Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg|ISBN=978-3-642-34681-1|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-34682-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This behaviour is different than other huntsman spiders, such as ''[[Carparachne aureoflava]]'' from the [[Namib Desert]], which uses passive [[cartwheeling]] as a form of locomotion.&lt;ref name=senck&gt;{{cite news|author1=Bröhl, I.  |author2=Jördens, J.|title=The Moroccan flic-flac spider: A gymnast among the arachnids|url=http://www.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=5210&amp;year=2014&amp;kid=2&amp;id=3095|accessdate=23 May 2015|agency=Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung|date=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The flic-flac spider can reach speeds of up to 2&amp;nbsp;m/s using forward or back flips to evade threats.&lt;ref name=scin&gt;{{cite news|author=Prostak, S.|title=Cebrennus rechenbergi: Cartwheeling spider discovered in Morocco|url=http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-cebrennus-rechenbergi-spider-morocco-01903.html|accessdate=October 20, 2016|agency=Sci-News.com|date=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|author=Bhanoo, S.|title=A desert spider with astonishing moves|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/science/a-desert-spider-with-astonishing-moves.html?_r=0|accessdate=October 20, 2016|agency=The New York Times|date=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arboreal locomotion is the locomotion of animals in trees.  Some animals may only scale trees occasionally, while others are exclusively arboreal.

The earliest known [[tetrapod]] with specializations that adapted it for climbing trees, was ''[[Suminia]]'', a [[synapsid]] of the late [[Permian]], about 260 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fröbisch J. |author2=[[Robert R.

''[[Brachiation]]'' (from ''brachium'', Latin for "arm"), is a form of arboreal locomotion in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. During brachiation, the body is alternately supported under each forelimb. This is the primary means of locomotion for the small [[gibbon]]s and [[siamang]]s of southeast Asia. Some New World monkeys such as spider monkeys and muriquis are "semibrachiators" and move through the trees with a combination of leaping and brachiation. Some New World species also practice [[suspensory behavior]]s by using their [[prehensile tail]], which acts as a fifth grasping hand.&lt;ref name="Jurmain_etal2008"&gt;{{Cite book | first1=Robert | last1=Jurmain | first2=Lynn | last2=Kilgore | first3=Wenda | last3=Trevathan | title=Essentials of Physical Anthropology | edition=7 | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2008 | page=109 | isbn=9780495509394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energetics==
Animal locomotion requires [[energy]] to overcome various forces including [[friction]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], [[inertia]] and [[gravity]], although the influence of these depends on the circumstances. In [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]] environments, gravity must be overcome whereas the drag of air has little influence. In aqueous environments, friction (or drag) becomes the major energetic challenge with gravity being less of an influence. Remaining in the aqueous environment, animals with natural [[buoyancy]] expend little energy to maintain a vertical position in a water column. Others naturally sink, and must spend energy to remain afloat. Drag is also an energetic influence in [[flight]], and the [[aerodynamic]]ally efficient body shapes of flying [[bird]]s indicate how they have evolved to cope with this.  Limbless organisms moving on land must energetically overcome surface friction, however, they do not usually need to expend significant energy to counteract gravity.

[[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]] is widely used in the study of animal locomotion: if at rest, to move forwards an animal must push something backwards.  Terrestrial animals must push the solid ground, swimming and flying animals must push against a [[fluid]] (either [[water]] or [[air]]).&lt;ref name="Bie"&gt;Biewener, A. A. 2003. Animal Locomotion. Oxford University Press, USA. {{ISBN|978-0198500223}},  https://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&amp;dq=biomechanics+biewener&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of forces during locomotion on the design of the skeletal system is also important, as is the interaction between locomotion and muscle physiology, in determining how the structures and effectors of locomotion enable or limit animal movement.
The [[Bioenergetics#Bioenergetics|energetics]] of locomotion involves the energy expenditure by animals in moving. Energy consumed in locomotion is not available for other efforts, so animals typically have evolved to use the minimum energy possible during movement.&lt;ref name="Bie"/&gt;  However, in the case of certain behaviors, such as locomotion to escape a predator, performance (such as speed or maneuverability) is more crucial, and such movements may be energetically expensive.  Furthermore, animals may use energetically expensive methods of locomotion when environmental conditions (such as being within a burrow) preclude other modes.

The most common metric of energy use during locomotion is the net [also termed "incremental"] cost of transport, defined as the amount of energy (e.g., [[Joules]]) needed above baseline metabolic rate to move a given distance.  For aerobic locomotion, most animals have a nearly constant cost of transport - moving a given distance requires the same caloric expenditure, regardless of speed.  This constancy is usually accomplished by changes in [[gait]].  The net cost of transport of swimming is lowest, followed by flight, with terrestrial limbed locomotion being the most expensive per unit distance.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book | last=Campbell | first=Neil A. |author2=Reece, Jane B. | title=Biology, 7th Edition | publisher=Pearson - Benjamin Cummings | year=2005 | location=San Francisco | pages=522–523  | isbn=0-8053-7171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because of the speeds involved, flight requires the most energy per unit time.  This does not mean that an animal that normally moves by running would be a more efficient swimmer; however, these comparisons assume an animal is specialized for that form of motion. Another consideration here is [[body mass]]&amp;mdash;heavier animals, though using more total energy, require less energy ''per unit mass'' to move. [[Physiology|Physiologists]] generally measure energy use by the amount of [[oxygen]] consumed, or the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] produced, in an animal's [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]].&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt; In terrestrial animals, the cost of transport is typically measured while they walk or run on a motorized treadmill, either wearing a mask to capture gas exchange or with the entire treadmill enclosed in a metabolic chamber. For small [[rodents]], such as [[Peromyscus|deer mice]], the cost of transport has also been measured during voluntary wheel running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chappell, M.A. |author2=Garland, T. |author3=Rezende, E.L. |author4=Gomes, F.R. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2004|title=Voluntary running in deer mice: Speed, distance, energy costs and temperature effects|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=207|pages=3839–3854|doi=10.1242/jeb.01213 |pmid=15472015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energetics is important for explaining the evolution of foraging economic decisions in organisms; for example, a study of the African honey bee, [[African honey bee|''A. m. scutellata'']], has shown that honey bees may [[trade-off]] the high [[sucrose]] content of viscous [[nectar]] for the energetic benefits of warmer, less concentrated nectar, which also reduces their consumption and flight time.&lt;ref name="Nicolson et al, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nicolson, S. |author2=de Veer, L. |author3=Kohler.

==Passive locomotion==
Passive locomotion in animals is a type of mobility in which the animal depends on their environment for transportation.&lt;ref name=EB /&gt;

===Hydrozoans===
[[File:Physalia physalis1.jpg|thumb|upright|''Physalia physalis'']]
The [[Portuguese man o' war]] (''Physalia physalis'') lives at the surface of the ocean. The gas-filled bladder, or pneumatophore (sometimes called a "sail"), remains at the surface, while the remainder is submerged. Because the Portuguese man o' war has no means of propulsion, it is moved by a combination of winds, currents, and tides.   The sail is equipped with a siphon. In the event of a surface attack, the sail can be deflated, allowing the organism to briefly submerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/printable/portuguese-man-of-war.html |title=Portuguese Man-of-War| publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arachnids===
The [[wheel spider]] (''Carparachne aureoflava'') is a [[huntsman spider]] approximately 20&amp;nbsp;mm in size and native to the [[Namib Desert]] of [[Southern Africa]]. The spider escapes parasitic [[Spider wasp|pompilid wasp]]s by flipping onto its side and [[rotating locomotion in living systems|cartwheeling]] down sand [[dune]]s at speeds of up to 44 turns per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Desert is alive  | work=Living Desert Adventures  | year= 2008  | url=http://www.living-desert-adventures.com/ |accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Armstrong, S.| title=Fog, wind and heat - life in the Namib desert | issue=1725  | date=14 July 1990 | journal=New Scientist | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12717253.800--fog-wind-and-heat--life-in-the-namib-desert-researchers-working-in-one-of-the-worlds-most-hostile-environments-are-discovering-how-scores-of-species-manage-to-survive-but-will-the-research-station-itself-survive-as-namibia-gains-its-independence--.html | accessdate=2008-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the spider is on a sloped dune, its rolling speed may be 1 metre per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|editor=Mark Gardiner |title=Feature creature |newspaper=[[Gobabeb|Gobabeb Times]] |page=3 |date=April 2005 |format=PDF |url=http://www.gobabebtrc.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=3&amp;Itemid=107 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220035431/http://www.gobabebtrc.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=3&amp;Itemid=107 |archivedate=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insects===
The [[larva]] of ''[[Cicindela dorsalis]]'', the eastern beach tiger beetle, is notable for its ability to leap into the air, loop its body into a rotating wheel and roll along the sand at a high speed using wind to propel itself. If the wind is strong enough, the larva can cover up to {{convert|60|m}} in this manner. This remarkable ability may have evolved to help the larva escape predators such as the [[Thynnidae|thynnid wasp]] ''[[Methocha]]''.&lt;ref name=WPWL&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017746 |title=Wind-powered wheel locomotion, initiated by leaping Somersaults, in larvae of the Southeastern beach tiger beetle (''Cicindela dorsalis media'') | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017746 | volume=6 |journal=PLoS ONE |page=e17746|bibcode=2011PLoSO...617746H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the largest subfamily of cuckoo wasps, [[Chrysidinae]], are generally [[kleptoparasite]]s, laying their eggs in host nests, where their larvae consume the host egg or larva while it is still young.  Chrysidines are distinguished from the members of other subfamilies in that most have flattened or concave lower abdomens and can curl into a defensive ball when attacked by a potential host, a process known as conglobation. Protected by hard chitin in this position, they are expelled from the nest without injury and can search for a less hostile host.

[[Flea]]s can jump vertically up to 18&amp;nbsp;cm and horizontally up to 33&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref name=Crosby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/parasites/f/FAQ_fleacycle.htm|author=Crosby, J.T.|title=What is the life cycle of the flea|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, although this form of locomotion is initiated by the flea, it has little control of the jump - they always jump in the same direction, with very little variation in the trajectory between individual jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsp.org/frontier-science/frontier-science-matters/insect-jumping-ancient-question|title=Insect jumping: An ancient question|publisher=Human Frontier Science Program|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton G.P. |author2=Burrows M. |year=2011|title=The biomechanics of the jump of the flea|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=214|pages=836–847|doi=10.1242/jeb.052399|pmid=21307071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crustaceans===
Although [[stomatopod]]s typically display the standard locomotion types as seen in [[shrimp|true shrimp]] and [[lobsters]], one species, ''[[Nannosquilla decemspinosa]]'', has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas.  At low tides, ''N. decemspinosa'' is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for locomotion when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. ''N. decemspinosa'' has been observed to roll repeatedly for {{convert|2|m|ft}}, but they typically travel less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  Again, the animal initiates the movement but has little control during its locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roy L. Caldwell |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=282 |pages=71–73 |year=1979 |title=A unique form of locomotion in a stomatopod – backward somersaulting |doi=10.1038/282071a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v282/n5734/abs/282071a0.html |issue=5734|bibcode=1979Natur.282...71C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal transport===
Some animals change location because they are attached to, or reside on, another animal or moving structure.  This is arguably more accurately termed "animal transport".

====Remoras====
[[File:Echeneis naucrates Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|175px|&lt;center&gt;Some remoras, such as this ''[[Echeneis naucrates]]'', may attach themselves to scuba divers.&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Remora]]s are a family (''Echeneidae'') of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase family | family=Echeneidae | month=April| year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ITIS | id=168567 | taxon=Echeneidae | accessdate=20 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They grow to {{convert|30|–|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} long, and their distinctive first [[dorsal fin]]s take the form of a modified oval, [[sucker (zoology)|sucker-like organ]] with slat-like structures that open and close to create suction and take a firm hold against the skin of larger marine animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2013/january/sharksucker-fishs-strange-disc-explained118235.html |title=Sharksucker fish's strange disc explained |publisher=Natural History Museum |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201194123/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2013/january/sharksucker-fishs-strange-disc-explained118235.html |archivedate=1 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By sliding backward, the remora can increase the suction, or it can release itself by swimming forward.  Remoras sometimes attach to small boats. They swim well on their own, with a sinuous, or curved, motion.  When the remora reaches about {{convert|3|cm|abbr=on}}, the disc is fully formed and the remora can then attach to other animals. The remora's lower jaw projects beyond the upper, and the animal lacks a [[swim bladder]].  Some remoras associate primarily with specific host species. They are commonly found attached to sharks, [[manta ray]]s, whales, turtles, and [[dugong]]s.  Smaller remoras also fasten onto fish such as tuna and [[swordfish]], and some small remoras travel in the mouths or gills of large manta rays, [[ocean sunfish]], swordfish, and [[sailfish]]. The remora benefits by using the host as transport and protection, and also feeds on materials dropped by the host.

====Angler fish====
In some species of [[anglerfish]], when a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an [[enzyme]] that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme [[sexual dimorphism]] ensures, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a one male per female rule.&lt;ref name="doran"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author =Pietsch, T.W. | title=Precocious sexual parasitism in the deep sea ceratioid anglerfish, Cryptopsaras couesi Gill | accessdate=December 17, 2014 | volume=256 | doi=10.1038/256038a0 | journal=Nature | pages=38–40| bibcode=1975Natur.256...38P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes |year=1983 |publisher=W.

====Parasites====
Many [[parasites]] are transported by their hosts. For example, endoparasites such as [[Cestoda|tapeworms]] live in the alimentary tracts of other animals, and depend on the host's ability to move to distribute their eggs. Ectoparasites such as [[flea]]s can move around on the body of their host, but are transported much longer distances by the host's locomotion. Some ectoparasites such as [[lice]] can opportunistically hitch a ride on a fly ([[Phoresis (biology)|phoresis]]) and attempt to find a new host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology and Evolution of Transmission in Feather-feeding Lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera)|author=University of Utah |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUfFjqPoQTEC&amp;pg=PA83 |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |isbn=978-0-549-46429-7 |pages=83–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes between media==
Some animals locomote between different media, e.g., from aquatic to arial.  This often requires different modes of locomotion in the different media and may require a distinct transitional locomotor behaviour.

There are a large number of semi-aquatic animals (animals that spend part of their life cycle in water, or generally have part of their anatomy underwater).  These represent the major taxons of mammals (e.g., beaver, otter, polar bear), birds (e.g., penguins, ducks), reptiles (e.g., anaconda, bog turtle, marine iguana) and amphibians ( e.g., salamanders, frogs, newts).

===Fish===
Some fish use multiple modes of locomotion.  [[Walking fish]] may swim freely or at other times "walk" along the ocean or river floor, but not on land (e.g., the [[flying gurnard]] —which does not actually fly—and batfishes of the family Ogcocephalidae).  [[Amphibious fish]], are fish that are able to leave water for extended periods of time.  These fish use a range of terrestrial locomotory modes, such as [[lateral undulation]], [[tripod]]-like walking (using paired [[fin]]s and [[tail]]), and jumping. Many of these locomotory modes incorporate multiple combinations of [[pectoral fin|pectoral]], [[pelvic]] and tail fin movement. Examples include [[eel]]s, [[mudskippers]] and the [[walking catfish]].  [[Flying fish]] can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators.  The flights of flying fish are typically around 50&amp;nbsp;meters,&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"/&gt; though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flying Fish, Exocoetidae"/&gt; They can travel at speeds of more than {{convert|70|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Maximum altitude is {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} above the surface of the sea.&lt;ref name=fin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fish |first=F. |year=1991 |title=On a fin and a prayer |journal=[[Scholars (journal)|Scholars]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=4–7 |url=http://darwin.wcupa.edu/~biology/fish/pubs/pdf/1991SOnafin.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102103320/http://darwin.wcupa.edu/~biology/fish/pubs/pdf/1991SOnafin.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some accounts have them landing on ships' decks.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Banks |url=http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozlit/pdf/p00021.pdf |title=The Endeavour Journal of Sir Joseph Banks 1768–1771 |year=1997 |publisher=[[University of Sydney Library]] |accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine mammals===
[[File:PacificWhiteSidedDolphine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pacific white-sided dolphins porpoising]]
When swimming, several marine mammals such as dolphins, porpoises and pinnipeds, frequently leap above the water surface whilst maintaining horizontal locomotion.  This is done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save dolphins and porpoises energy as there is less friction while in the air.&lt;ref name=Weihs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weihs|first=D.|title=Dynamics of Dolphin Porpoising Revisited|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|year=2002|volume=42|issue=5|pages=1071–1078|doi=10.1093/icb/42.5.1071|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/5/1071.full|pmid=21680390}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of travel is known as "porpoising".&lt;ref name=Weihs /&gt; Other reasons for dolphins and porpoises performing porpoising include orientation, social displays, fighting, [[non-verbal communication]], entertainment and attempting to dislodge [[parasite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Binns, C.|publisher=LiveScience|year=2006|url=http://www.livescience.com/678-dolphins-spin.html|title=How dolphins spin, and why|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In pinnipeds, two types of porpoising have been identified. "High porpoising" is most often near (within 100 metres) the shore and is often followed by minor course changes; this may help seals get their bearings on beaching or rafting sites.  "Low porpoising" is typically observed relatively far (more than 100 metres) from shore and often aborted in favour of anti-predator movements; this may be a way for seals to maximize sub-surface vigilance and thereby reduce their vulnerability to sharks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/seal_antipred.htm|title=Anti-predatory strategies of Cape fur seals at Seal Island|publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some whales raise their (entire) body vertically out of the water in a behaviour known as "breaching".

===Birds===
Some semi-aquatic birds use terrestrial locomotion, surface swimming, underwater swimming and flying (e.g., ducks, swans). [[Diving birds]] also use diving locomotion (e.g., dippers, aulks).  Some birds (e.g., [[ratites]]) have lost the primary locomotion of flight.  The largest of these, [[ostrich]]es, when being pursued by a predator, have been known to reach speeds over {{Convert|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Davies |first=S.J.J.F.|editor=Hutchins, Michael |encyclopedia=Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia |title= Birds I Tinamous and Ratites to Hoatzins |edition=2 |year=2003 |publisher=Gale Group |volume=8 |location=Farmington Hills, MI|isbn=0-7876-5784-0 |pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can maintain a steady speed of {{Convert|50|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, which makes the ostrich the world's fastest two-legged animal:&lt;ref name=DesertUSA&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.desertusa.com/animals/ostrich.html | title=Ostrich | accessdate=17 February 2011 | last=Desert USA | year=1996 | publisher=Digital West Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart2006"&gt;{{cite web| last=Stewart | first=D. | title=A Bird Like No Other  | work=[[National Wildlife]]| publisher=[[National Wildlife Federation]] | date=2006-08-01 | accessdate=2014-05-30| url=http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/Birds/Archives/2006/A-Bird-Like-No-Other.aspx| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209033650/http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/Birds/Archives/2006/A-Bird-Like-No-Other.aspx| archivedate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ostriches can also locomote by swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Holladay| first = April | title = Ostriches swim! | work = USA Today | date = 23 April 2007 | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/aprilholladay/2007-04-23-ostriches-swim_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called ''tobogganing'', which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.  To get onto land, penguins sometimes propel themselves upwards at a great speed to leap out the water.

==Changes during the life-cycle==
An animal's mode of locomotion may change considerably during its life-cycle.
[[Barnacles]] are exclusively marine and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters.  They have two [[nekton]]ic (active swimming) larval stages, but as adults, they are sessile (non-motile) suspension feeders.  Frequently, adults are found attached to moving objects such as whales and ships, and are thereby transported (passive locomotion) around the oceans.

==Function==
Animals locomote for a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, a suitable microhabitat, or to escape predators.

===Food procurement===
[[File:American paddlefish filter feeding.webm|thumb|260px|thumbtime=0:20|Paddlefish ram suspension-feeding zooplankton in aquarium]]
Animals use locomotion in a wide variety of ways to procure food.  Terrestrial methods include [[Ambush predator|ambush predation]], social predation, [[grazing]]. Aquatic methods include [[Filter feeders|filterfeeding]], grazing, ram feeding, suction feeding, protrusion and pivot feeding.
Other methods include [[parasitism]] and [[parasitoid]]ism.

==Methods of study==

A variety of methods and equipment are used to study animal locomotion:

* '''[[Treadmills]]''' are used to allow animals to walk or run while remaining stationary with respect to external observers. This technique facilitates filming or recordings of physiological information from the animal (e.g., during studies of energetics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Scaling of energy cost of running to body size in mammals | first1=C.

L. |last3=Raab |journal=American Journal of Physiology  | volume=219 | issue= | year=1970 | pages=1104–1107 |url= | postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Motorized treadmills are also used to measure the endurance capacity (stamina) of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Physiological correlates of locomotory performance in a lizard: an allometric approach | first1=Theodore | last1=Garland Jr. |author-link=Theodore Garland Jr. | journal=American Journal of Physiology  | volume=247 | issue= | year=1984 | pages=R806-R815 |url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1984.pdf| postscript= | doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1984.247.5.r806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Endurance capacity of mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running | first1=Thomas H. | last1=Meek | first2=Brian P. | last2=Lonquich | |first3=Robert M. |last3=Hannon |first4=Theodore  |last4=Garland Jr.|author-link4=Theodore Garland Jr. |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology  | volume=212 | issue= 18| year=2009 | pages=2908–2917 |url=http://biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Meek_et_al_2009_endurance.pdf| postscript= | doi=10.1242/jeb.028886 | pmid=19717672}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Racetracks]]''' lined with photocells or filmed while animals run along them are used to measure acceleration and maximal sprint speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Effects of body size and slope on sprint speed of a lizard (''Stellio'' (''Agama'') ''stellio'') | first1=Raymond B. | last1=Huey | first2=Paul E. | last2=Hertz | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology  | volume=97 | issue= | year=1982 | pages=401–409 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/new/HueyHertz82UpDownSpeedJEB.pdf| postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Effects of body size and slope on acceleration of a lizard (''Stellio stellio'') | first1=Raymond B. | last1=Huey | first2=Paul E. | last2=Hertz | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology  | volume=110 | issue= | year=1984 | pages=113–123 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/new/HueyHertz84UpDownAccelJEB.pdf| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Kinematics]]''' is the study of the motion of an entire animal or parts of its body. It is typically accomplished by placing visual markers at particular anatomical locations on the animal and then recording [[video]] of its movement. The video is often captured from multiple angles, with frame rates exceeding 2000 frames per second when capturing high speed movement.  The location of each marker is determined for each video frame, and data from multiple views is integrated to give positions of each point through time.  Computers are sometimes used to track the markers, although this task must often be performed manually. The kinematic data can be used to determine fundamental motion attributes such as velocity, acceleration, joint angles, and the sequencing and timing of kinematic events. These fundamental attributes can be used to quantify various higher level attributes, such as the physical abilities of the animal (e.g., its maximum running speed, how steep a slope it can climb), neural control of locomotion, gait, and responses to environmental variation. These, in turn, can aid in formulation of hypotheses about the animal or locomotion in general.
* '''[[Force platform|Force plates]]''' are platforms, usually part of a trackway, that can be used to measure the magnitude and direction of forces of an animal's step. When used with kinematics and a sufficiently detailed model of anatomy, inverse dynamics solutions can determine the forces not just at the contact with the ground, but at each joint in the limb.
* '''[[Electromyography]]''' (EMG) is a method of detecting the electrical activity that occurs when muscles are activated, thus determining which muscles an animal uses for a given movement. This can be accomplished either by surface electrodes (usually in large animals) or implanted electrodes (often wires thinner than a human hair). Furthermore, the intensity of electrical activity can correlate to the level of muscle activity, with greater activity implying (though not definitively showing) greater force.
* '''[[Sonomicrometry]]''' employs a pair of piezoelectric crystals implanted in a muscle or tendon to continuously measure the length of a muscle or tendon. This is useful because surface kinematics may be inaccurate due to skin movement. Similarly, if an elastic tendon is in series with the muscle, the muscle length may not be accurately reflected by the joint angle.
* '''Tendon force buckles''' measure the force produced by a single muscle by measuring the strain of a tendon. After the experiment, the tendon's elastic modulus is determined and used to compute the exact force produced by the muscle. However, this can only be used on muscles with long tendons.
* '''[[Particle image velocimetry]]''' is used in aquatic and aerial systems to measure the flow of fluid around and past a moving aquatic organism, allowing fluid dynamics calculations to determine pressure gradients, speeds, etc.
* '''[[Fluoroscopy]]''' allows real-time X-ray video, for precise kinematics of moving bones. Markers opaque to X-rays can allow simultaneous tracking of muscle length.

These methods can be combined. For example, studies frequently combine EMG and kinematics to determine ''motor pattern'', the series of electrical and kinematic events that produce a given movement.

'''Baltic 21''' is a plan to cooperate on implementing regional sustainable development. It is managed by the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]] (CBSS).{{r|hist}}

The mission of Baltic 21 is to contribute towards advancing sustainable development in the Baltic Sea Region by coordinating goals and activities, and by serving as a forum for cooperation across borders and between stakeholder groups.

==History==
Initiated by the [[Prime Minister]]s of the [[Baltic Sea]] countries in 1996, '''Baltic 21''' is a regional expression of the global [[Agenda 21]] adopted by the [[United Nations]] “[[Earth Summit]].”&lt;ref name=hist&gt;http://www.cbss.org/sustainable-prosperous-region/egsd-baltic-2030-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the CBSS updated the plan in accordance with UN's ''[[Sustainable Development Goals|Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]''. The CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development created the '''Baltic 2030 Action Plan''', specifically tailored for the BSR to guide macro-regional stakeholders through the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The senior adviser was Krista Kampus.{{r|hist}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balticseafuture.org/-/media/files/balticseafuture/krista-kampus.ashx&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, a presentation of the work involved to archive the targets was given in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seit.ee/file_dl.php?file_id=550&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
As a multinational team, members of Baltic 21 are government ministries and agencies from the 11 Baltic Sea states, the [[European Commission]], numerous intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, academic and financial institutions, as well as local, city and business networks. The Baltic 21 network brings together people who are active in sectors including [[agriculture]], [[education]], [[energy]], [[fisheries]], [[forests]], [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[transport]] and [[spatial planning]].

The Baltic 21 process is steered, coordinated and monitored by the Senior Officials Group (SOG) consisting of representatives of the member countries, organizations and institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3980">'''Biosimulation''' is computer-aided mathematical simulation of biological processes and systems and thus is an integral part of [[systems biology]]. Due to the complexity of biological systems simplified models are often used, which should only be as complex as necessary.

The aim of biosimulations is model-based prediction of the behaviour and the dynamics of biological systems e.g. the response of an organ or a single cell towards a chemical. However the quality of model-based predictions strongly depends on the quality of the model, which in turn is defined by the quality of the data and the profoundness of the knowledge.

==Pharmacy==

Biosimulation is becoming increasingly important for [[drug development]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Bertau, E. Mosekilde, H.V. Westerhoff (Edts.): ''Biosimulation in Drug Development.''
1st Edition Wiley-VCH, Weinheim 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since on average only 11% of all drug candidates
are approved,&lt;ref&gt;I. Kola, J. Landis: ''Can the pharmaceutical industry reduce attrition rates?'' In:''Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.'' Nr. 3, 2004, S.711-715&lt;/ref&gt; it is anticipated that biosimulation may be the tool to predict whether a candidate drug will fail in the development process e.g. in [[clinical trial]]s due to adverse side effects, bad pharmacokinetics or even toxicity. The early prediction if a drug will fail in animals or humans would be a key to reduce both drug development costs and the amount of required animal experiments and clinical trials. The latter is also in line with the so-called "3Rs" which refer to the principle of '''r'''eduction and '''r'''eplacement of animal experiments as well as to the '''r'''efinement of the methodology in cases where animal tests are still necessary.&lt;ref&gt;J. Richmond: ''The 3Rs - Past, Present and Future.'' In:''Scand.J.Lab.Anim.Sci'' Vol. 2(27), 
2000, S. 84-92&lt;/ref&gt; In a future scenario, biosimulation would change the way substances are tested, in which [[in vivo]] and [[in vitro]] tests are substituted by tests [[in silico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/4031248 ''Models that take drugs.'' In:''The Economist (US)'' June 11, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the importance of biosimulation in drug development a number of research projects exist which aim for simulating metabolism, toxicity, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics of a drug candidate. Some of the research projects are listed below:

* [[BioSim]] project; funded by the 6th frame program of the European Union [https://web.archive.org/web/20110307005347/http://biosim-network.eu/]
* NSR Physiome Project [http://www.physiome.org/]
* Hepatosys

Moreover, a few software tools already exist, which aim for predicting the toxicity of a substance or even try to simulate the virtual patient (Entelos). A few of these software tools are listed below:

[[Image:ABO blood type.svg|thumb|right|410px|Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.]]
A '''blood type''' (also called a '''blood group''') is a classification of [[blood]], based on the presence and absence of [[antibodies]] and [[Heredity|inherited]] [[antigen]]ic substances on the surface of [[red blood cell]]s (RBCs). These antigens may be [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[glycoprotein]]s, or [[glycolipid]]s, depending on the blood group system. Some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of [[Cell (biology)#Eukaryotic cells|cell]]s of various [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Several of these red blood cell surface antigens can stem from one [[allele]] (or an alternative version of a gene) and collectively form a blood group system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Maton  | first = Anthea  |author2=Jean Hopkins|author3=Charles William McLaughlin|author4=Susan Johnson|author5=Maryanna Quon Warner|author6=David LaHart|author7=Jill D.

===ABO blood group system===
[[Image:ABO blood group diagram.svg|right|thumb|350px|''ABO blood group system'': diagram showing the carbohydrate chains that determine the ABO blood group]]
{{Main|ABO blood group system}}

The ABO blood group system involves two antigens and two antibodies found in human blood. The two antigens are antigen A and antigen B. The two antibodies are antibody A and antibody B. The antigens are present on the red blood cells and the antibodies in the serum. Regarding the antigen property of the blood all human beings can be classified into 4 groups, those with antigen A (group A), those with antigen B (group B), those with both antigen A and B (group AB) and those with neither antigen (group O). The antibodies present together with the antigens are found as follows:
# Antigen	A	with antibody  B
# Antigen	B	with antibody  A
# Antigen	AB	has no antibodies
# Antigen 	nil (group O) with antibody A and B.

There is an [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] reaction between similar antigen and antibody (for example, antigen A agglutinates the antibody A and antigen B agglutinates the antibody B). Thus, transfusion can be considered safe as long as the serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor.

The ''ABO system'' is the most important blood-group system in human-blood transfusion. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually ''[[immunoglobulin M]]'', abbreviated [[IgM]], antibodies. ABO IgM [[antibodies]] are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, [[bacteria]], and [[virus]]es.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The original terminology used by [[Karl Landsteiner]] in 1901 for the classification was A/B/C; in later publications "C" became "O".&lt;ref name=Oor0&gt;{{Citation | last1  = Schmidt | first1 = P | last2  = Okroi | first2 = M  | title = Also sprach Landsteiner – Blood Group ‘O’ or Blood Group ‘NULL’ | journal = Infus Ther Transfus Med | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 206–8 | year = 2001 | pmid = | doi = 10.1159/000050239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type O is often called ''0'' (''zero'', or ''null'') in other languages.&lt;ref name="Oor0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |title=Your blood&amp;nbsp;– a textbook about blood and blood donation |accessdate=2008-07-15 |format=PDF |work= |page=63 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626184746/http://www.bloddonor.dk/fileadmin/Fil_Arkiv/PDF_filer/Andre/Your_Blood__June_2006.pdf |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rh blood group system===
{{Main|Rh blood group system}}
The Rh system (Rh meaning ''[[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus]]'') is the second most significant blood-group system in human-blood transfusion with currently 50 antigens. The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen, because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main Rh antigens. It is common for D-negative individuals not to have any anti-D IgG or IgM antibodies, because anti-D antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances.  However, D-negative individuals can produce [[IgG]] anti-D antibodies following a sensitizing event: possibly a fetomaternal transfusion of blood from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with D positive [[Red blood cell|RBC]]s.&lt;ref name="Talaro, Kathleen P. 2005 510–1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Talaro, Kathleen P.|title=Foundations in microbiology|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|year=2005|pages=510–1|isbn=0-07-111203-0 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rh disease]] can develop in these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moise KJ|title=Management of rhesus alloimmunization in pregnancy|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=112|issue=1|pages=164–76|date=July 2008|pmid=18591322|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31817d453c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rh negative blood types are much less common in Asian populations (0.3%) than they are in European populations (15%).&lt;ref name="Rh group and its origin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hospital.kingnet.com.tw/activity/blood/html/a.html|title=Rh血型的由來|publisher=Hospital.kingnet.com.tw|accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence or absence of the Rh(D) antigen is signified by the + or − sign, so that, for example, the A− group is ABO type A and does not have the Rh (D) antigen.

===ABO and Rh distribution by country===
{{main|Blood type distribution by country}}

As with many other genetic traits, the distribution of ABO and Rh blood groups varies significantly between populations.

===Other blood group systems===
{{Main|Human blood group systems}}
28 blood-group systems have been identified by the International Society for Blood Transfusion in addition to the common ABO and Rh systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=University Of Vermont
|accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in addition to the ABO antigens and Rh antigens, many other antigens are expressed on the RBC surface membrane. For example, an individual can be AB, D positive, and at the same time M and N positive ([[MNS antigen system|MNS system]]), K positive ([[Kell antigen system|Kell system]]), Le&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; or Le&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; negative ([[Lewis antigen system|Lewis system]]), and so on, being positive or negative for each blood group system antigen. Many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered.

==Clinical significance==

===Blood transfusion===
{{Main|Blood transfusion}}
Transfusion medicine is a specialized branch of [[hematology]] that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a [[blood bank]] to provide a [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed [[physician]] or [[surgeon]]) in a similar way as medicines.

[[File:Main symptoms of acute hemolytic reaction.png|thumb|right|220px|Main symptoms of [[acute hemolytic reaction]] due to blood type mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_1_4x_Possible_Risks_of_Blood_Product_Transfusions.asp Possible Risks of Blood Product Transfusions] from American Cancer Society. Last Medical Review: 03/08/2008. Last Revised: 01/13/2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu/bloodbank/manual/bbch_7/index.html 7 adverse reactions to transfusion] Pathology Department at University of Michigan. Version July 2004, Revised 11/5/08&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Much of the routine work of a [[blood bank]] involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and is as safe as possible.   If a unit of incompatible blood is [[Blood transfusion|transfused]] between a [[Blood donation|donor]] and recipient, a severe [[acute hemolytic reaction]] with [[hemolysis]] (RBC destruction), [[renal failure]] and [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] is likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the [[complement system]] to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.

Patients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a [[transfusion reaction]].  Risks can be further reduced by [[cross-matching]] blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture ''agglutinates'', or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutination]] with a [[microscope]]. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient.  In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a [[barcode]] system known as [[ISBT 128]].

The blood group may be included on [[Dog tag (identifier)|identification tags]] or on [[tattoo]]s worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German [[SS blood group tattoo|Waffen-SS had blood group tattoos]] during [[World War II]].

Rare blood types can cause supply problems for [[blood bank]]s and hospitals. For example, [[Duffy antigen|Duffy]]-negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nickel RG |title=Determination of Duffy genotypes in three populations of African descent using PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotides |journal=Human Immunology |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=738–42 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10439320 |doi=10.1016/S0198-8859(99)00039-7 |author2=Willadsen SA |author3=Freidhoff LR |display-authors=3 |last4=Huang |first4=Shau-Ku |last5=Caraballo |first5=Luis |last6=Naidu |first6=Raana P |last7=Levett |first7=Paul |last8=Blumenthal |first8=Malcolm |last9=Banks-Schlegel |first9=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for these patients.  Similarly for RhD negative people, there is a risk associated with travelling to parts of the world where supplies of RhD negative blood are rare, particularly [[East Asia]], where blood services may endeavor to encourage Westerners to donate blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodcare.org.uk/html/resources_chairman_2001.htm |title=BCF&amp;nbsp;– Members&amp;nbsp;– Chairman's Annual Report |accessdate=2008-07-15 |last=Bruce |first=MG |date=May 2002 |publisher=The Blood Care Foundation |quote=As Rhesus Negative blood is rare amongst local nationals, this Agreement will be of particular value to Rhesus Negative expatriates and travellers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410111425/http://www.bloodcare.org.uk/html/resources_chairman_2001.htm |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)===
{{Main|Hemolytic disease of the newborn}}
[[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] women may carry a [[fetus]] with a blood type which is different from their own. In those cases, the mother can make [[IgG]] blood group antibodies. This can happen if some of the fetus' blood cells pass into the mother's blood circulation (e.g. a small fetomaternal [[bleeding|hemorrhage]] at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention), or sometimes after a therapeutic [[blood transfusion]].  This can cause [[Rh disease]] or other forms of [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]] (HDN) in the current pregnancy and/or subsequent pregnancies.  Sometimes this is lethal for the fetus; in these cases it is called [[hydrops fetalis]].&lt;ref name =Letsky2000&gt;{{cite book |title =Antenatal &amp; neonatal screening |edition = 2nd |chapter = Chapter 12: Rhesus and other haemolytic diseases |author = E.A.

=== Blood products ===
To provide maximum benefit from each blood donation and to extend shelf-life, [[blood bank]]s [[blood fractionation|fractionate]] some whole blood into several products. The most common of these products are packed RBCs, [[Blood plasma|plasma]], [[platelet]]s, [[cryoprecipitate]], and [[Blood plasma#Fresh frozen plasma|fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP).  FFP is quick-frozen to retain the labile [[clotting factor]]s [[Factor V|V]] and [[Factor VIII|VIII]], which are usually administered to patients who have a potentially fatal clotting problem caused by a condition such as advanced [[liver]] disease, overdose of [[anticoagulant]], or [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).

Units of packed red cells are made by removing as much of the plasma as possible from whole blood units.

[[Clotting factors]] synthesized by modern [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] methods are now in routine clinical use for [[hemophilia]], as the risks of infection transmission that occur with pooled blood products are avoided.

===Red blood cell compatibility===
*'''Blood group AB'''  individuals have both A and B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their [[blood plasma]] does not contain any antibodies against either A or B antigen. Therefore, an individual with type AB blood can receive blood from any group (with AB being preferable), but cannot donate blood to any group other than AB.  They are known as universal recipients.
*'''Blood group A'''  individuals have the A antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing [[IgM]] antibodies against the B antigen. Therefore, a group A individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups A or O (with A being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type A or AB.
*'''Blood group B'''  individuals have the B antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the A antigen. Therefore, a group B individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups B or O (with B being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type B or AB.
*'''Blood group O''' (or blood group zero in some countries) individuals do not have either A or B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their blood serum contains IgM anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Therefore, a group O individual can receive blood only from a group O individual, but can donate blood to individuals of any ABO blood group (i.e., A, B, O or AB). If a patient in a hospital situation needs a blood transfusion in an emergency, and if the time taken to process the recipient's blood would cause a detrimental delay, O negative blood can be issued. Because it is compatible with anyone, O negative blood is often overused and consequently is always in short supply.&lt;ref name="AABBfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Association of Blood Banks |author1-link = American Association of Blood Banks |date = 24 April 2014 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Association of Blood Banks |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-association-of-blood-banks/ |accessdate = 25 July 2014}}, which cites

Table note&lt;br /&gt;
1. Assumes absence of atypical antibodies that would cause an incompatibility between donor and recipient blood, as is usual for blood selected by cross matching.
&lt;/small&gt;

An Rh D-negative patient who does not have any anti-D antibodies (never being previously sensitized to D-positive RBCs) can receive a transfusion of D-positive blood once, but this would cause sensitization to the D antigen, and a female patient would become at risk for [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]].  If a D-negative patient has developed anti-D antibodies, a subsequent exposure to D-positive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous transfusion reaction. Rh D-positive blood should never be given to D-negative women of child-bearing age or to patients with D antibodies, so blood banks must conserve Rh-negative blood for these patients. In extreme circumstances, such as for a major bleed when stocks of D-negative blood units are very low at the blood bank, D-positive blood might be given to D-negative females above child-bearing age or to Rh-negative males, providing that they did not have anti-D antibodies, to conserve D-negative blood stock in the blood bank. The converse is not true; Rh D-positive patients do not react to D negative blood.

This same matching is done for other antigens of the Rh system as C, c, E and e and for other blood group systems with a known risk for immunization such as the Kell system in particular for females of child-bearing age or patients with known need for many transfusions.

===Plasma compatibility===
[[File:Plasma donation compatibility path.svg|right|190px|thumb|'''Plasma compatibility chart'''&lt;br /&gt;In addition to donating to the same blood group; plasma from type AB can be given to A, B and O; plasma from types A, B and AB can be given to O.]]
[[Blood plasma]] compatibility is the inverse of red blood cell compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood Component ABO Compatibility Chart Red Blood Cells and Plasma|url=http://www.pathology.med.umich.edu|website=Blood Bank Labsite|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type AB plasma carries neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies and can be transfused to individuals of any blood group; but type AB patients can only receive type AB plasma. Type O carries both antibodies, so individuals of blood group O can receive plasma from any blood group, but type O plasma can be used only by type O recipients.
&lt;!--Please don't switch donor and recipient here without being absolutely sure they're wrong. Check the cited source; any change must match it. It seems a lot of people switch this without actually understanding it, because it's often edited from the correct (AB can donate plasma to all blood groups) to the wrong.--&gt;

1. Assumes absence of strong atypical antibodies in donor plasma
&lt;/small&gt;

Rh D antibodies are uncommon, so generally neither D negative nor D positive blood contain anti-D antibodies.  If a potential donor is found to have anti-D antibodies or any strong atypical blood group antibody by antibody screening in the blood bank, they would not be accepted as a donor (or in some blood banks the blood would be drawn but the product would need to be appropriately labeled); therefore, donor blood plasma issued by a blood bank can be selected to be free of D antibodies and free of other atypical antibodies, and such donor plasma issued from a blood bank would be suitable for a recipient who may be D positive or D negative, as long as blood plasma and the recipient are ABO compatible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Universal donors and universal recipients===

In transfusions of packed red blood cells, individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients. However, these terms are only generally true with respect to possible reactions of the recipient's anti-A and anti-B antibodies to transfused red blood cells, and also possible sensitization to Rh D antigens. One exception is individuals with [[hh antigen system]] (also known as the Bombay phenotype) who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors, because they form antibodies against the H antigen present on all red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Harrison's Principals of Internal Medicine |last=Fauci |first=Anthony S. |author2=Eugene Braunwald|author3=Kurt J. Isselbacher|author4=Jean D. Wilson|author5=Joseph B. Martin|author6=Dennis L. Kasper|author7=Stephen L. Hauser|author8=Dan L. Longo |year=1998 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0-07-020291-5 |page=719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/blood-type-test |title=Universal acceptor and donor groups |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood donors with exceptionally strong anti-A, anti-B or any atypical blood group antibody may be excluded from blood donation. In general, while the plasma fraction of a blood transfusion may carry donor antibodies not found in the recipient, a significant reaction is unlikely because of dilution.

Additionally, red blood cell surface antigens other than A, B and Rh D, might cause adverse reactions and sensitization, if they can bind to the corresponding antibodies to generate an immune response.  Transfusions are further complicated because [[platelet]]s and [[white blood cell]]s (WBCs) have their own systems of surface antigens, and sensitization to platelet or WBC antigens can occur as a result of transfusion.

For transfusions of [[Plasma (blood)|plasma]], this situation is reversed.  Type O plasma, containing both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, can only be given to O recipients.  The antibodies will attack the antigens on any other blood type.  Conversely, AB plasma can be given to patients of any ABO blood group, because it does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies.

==Antibody-free blood typing==
Typically, blood type tests are performed through addition of a blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen. The presence of an antigen on the surface of the blood cells is indicated by [[Hemagglutination|agglutination]]. An alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at [[Imperial College London]] which makes use of [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[molecularly imprinted polymer]] nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Piletsky SS, Rabinowicz S, Yang Z, Piletska EV, Guerreiro A, Piletsky SA |title= Development of molecularly imprinted polymers specific for blood antigens for application in antibody-free blood typing |journal=Chemical Communications |issue=11|year= 2017|doi= 10.1039/C6CC08716G| pages=1793–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these tests, rather than agglutination, a positive result is indicated by decolorization as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution.

==Blood group genotyping==
In addition to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types, the progress in molecular diagnostics allows the increasing use of blood group genotyping. In contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype, genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens. This allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion, which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent allo-immunization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anstee DJ |title=Red cell genotyping and the future of pretransfusion testing |journal=Blood |volume=114|issue=2|year= 2009|doi= 10.1182/blood-2008-11-146860|pmid=19411635| pages=248–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Avent ND |title=Large-scale blood group genotyping: clinical implications |journal=Br J Haematol |volume=144|issue=1|year= 2009|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07285.x|pmid=19016734| pages=3–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Karl Landsteiner, 1920s..jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Landsteiner]]]]
Blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician [[Karl Landsteiner]] working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now [[Medical University of Vienna]]). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes, and not only that some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Landsteiner K |title=Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe |journal=Zentralblatt für Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde und Infektionskrankheiten|volume=27 |issue= |pages=357–362 |year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a two-sentence footnote:

{{Quote|The serum of healthy human beings not only agglutinates animal red cells, but also often those of human origin, from other individuals. It remains to be seen whether this appearance is related to inborn differences between individuals or it is the result of some damage of bacterial kind.&lt;ref name=kantha&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kantha |first1=S.S. |title=The blood revolution initiated by the famous footnote of Karl Landsteiner's 1900 paper |journal=The Ceylon Medical Journal |date=1995 |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=123–125 |pmid=8536328 |url=https://www1.gifu-u.ac.jp/~srikanth/srikantha_library/file/History%20of%20science/Landsteiner%20blood%20revolution%201995.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was the first evidence that blood variation exists in humans. The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landsteiner |first1=Karl |title=On Agglutination of Normal Human Blood |journal=Transfusion |date=1961 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5–8 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.1961.tb00005.x |orig-year=1901 |pmid=13758692| postscript=Originally published in German in ''Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift'', '''46''', 1132–1134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. (C was later renamed to O after the German ''Ohne'', meaning without, or zero, or null.&lt;ref name="farhud"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farhud |first1=D.D. |last2=Zarif Yeganeh |first2=M. |title=A brief history of human blood groups |journal=Iranian Journal of Public Health |date=2013 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |pmid=23514954 |pmc=3595629}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The group AB was discovered a year later by Landsteiner's students Adriano Sturli, and Alfred von Decastello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Decastello |first1=A. |last2=Sturli |first2=A. |title=Concerning isoagglutinins in serum of healthy and sick humans |journal=Munchener Medizinische Wochenschrift |date=1902 |volume=26 |pages=1090–1095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farr1979"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farr AD |title=Blood group serology—the first four decades (1900–1939) |journal=Medical History |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=215–26 |date=April 1979 |pmid=381816 |pmc=1082436 |doi=10.1017/s0025727300051383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Landsteiner, with [[Philip Levine (physician)|Philip Levine]], discovered the [[MN blood group|MN blood group system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landsteiner |first1=K. |last2=Levine |first2=P. |title=A New Agglutinable Factor Differentiating Individual Human Bloods. |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=1927 |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=600–602 |doi=10.3181/00379727-24-3483}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[P antigen system|P system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landsteiner |first1=K. |last2=Levine |first2=P. |title=Further Observations on Individual Differences of Human Blood. |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=1927 |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=941–942 |doi=10.3181/00379727-24-3649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the [[Coombs test]] in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coombs RR, Mourant AE, Race RR |title=A new test for the detection of weak and incomplete Rh agglutinins |journal=Br J Exp Pathol |volume=26 |issue= |pages=255–66 |year=1945 |pmid=21006651 |pmc=2065689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the advent of [[transfusion medicine]], and the understanding of [[ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn]] led to discovery of more blood groups. {{as of|2018}}, the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) recognizes 346 blood group antigens which are assigned to 36 blood groups.&lt;ref name=ISBT16/&gt;

==Society and culture==
{{Main|Blood type personality theory}}
A popular belief in Japan is that a person's ABO blood type is predictive of their [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[moral character|character]], and [[Interpersonal compatibility|compatibility with others]]. This belief is also widespread in [[South Korea]]&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.medbroadcast.com/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=17166&amp;channel_id=1000 |title=Despite scientific debunking, in Japan you are what your blood type is |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MediResource Inc. |accessdate=2011-08-13 |date=2009-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928021954/http://www.medbroadcast.com/channel_health_news_details.asp?news_id=17166&amp;channel_id=1000 |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Taiwan]]. The theory reached Japan in a 1927 psychologist's report, and the government of the time commissioned a study aimed at breeding better soldiers.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; Interest in the theory faded in the 1930s. Ultimately, the discovery of [[DNA]] in the following decades indicated that DNA instead had an important role in both heredity generally and personality specifically.  Interest in the theory was revived in the 1970s by [[Masahiko Nomi]], a broadcaster with a background in law rather than science.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;  The theory is widely accepted in Japanese and South Korean popular culture.&lt;ref name=Nuwer&gt;{{cite web|last=Nuwer|first=Rachel|title=You are what you bleed: In Japan and other east Asian countries some believe blood type dictates personality|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/02/15/you-are-what-you-bleed-in-japan-and-other-east-asian-countries-some-believe-blood-type-dictates-personality/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=16 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''breadwinner model''' is a paradigm of [[family]] centered on a [[wikt:breadwinner|breadwinner]], "the member of a family who earns the money to support the others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/breadwinner|title=breadwinner|encyclopedia=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English|publisher=Pearson ELT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the earner works outside the home to provide the family with income and benefits such as [[health insurance]], while the non-earner stays at home and takes care of children and the elderly.

Since the 1950s, social scientists and feminist theorists have increasingly criticized the gendered division of work and care and the expectation that the breadwinner role should be fulfilled by men. Norwegian government policy has increasingly targeted men as fathers, as a tool of changing [[gender relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bjørnholt | first1 = Margunn | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | year =2014 | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | url = http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295–315 | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have seen a shift in gender norms for the breadwinner role in the U.S. A 2013 Pew Research study found that women were the sole or primary breadwinners in 40% of heterosexual relationships with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Wendy|title=Breadwinner Moms|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/|website=Pew Research Center Social &amp; Demographic Trends|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise==
In Britain, the breadwinner model developed among the emerging middle-class towards the end of the [[industrial revolution]] in the mid-nineteenth-century. Prior to this, in low-income families, a subsistence wage was paid based upon the individual worker's output, with all members of the family expected to contribute to the household upkeep.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was another side to the transformation of wage relations in mid-19th-century Britain involving two closely related changes: first, a shift in the prevailing wage form, from a joint to an individual payment; and second, a shift in the predominant subsistence norm of a living wage, from a family group's income to the ideal of an adult male-breadwinner wage. This is the notion that the wage earned by a husband ought to be sufficient to support his family without his wife and young children having to work for pay.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Seccombe |first=Wally |last2= |first2= |date=Jan 1986 |title=Patriarchy Stabilized: The Construction of the Male Breadwinner Wage Norm in Nineteenth-Century Britain |jstor=4285488|journal=Social History |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=53–76 |doi= 10.1080/03071028608567640}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The increase in wages among skilled labourers and lower-middle-class workers allowed for a far larger number of families being able to support the entire family unit on one wage, and the breadwinner model became an attainable goal for a far wider proportion of society. Within this model, "The division of labour in parenting tasks can also be classified as 'caring about' (breadwinning) and 'caring for' (nurturing) children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strange |first=Julie-Marie |date=December 2012 |title=Fatherhood, Providing and Attachment in Late Victorian and Edwardian Working-Class Families |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8744490&amp;fileId=S0018246X12000404 |journal=The Historical Journal |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=1007–1027 |doi= 10.1017/s0018246x12000404|access-date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
In the United Kingdom, the emergence of the breadwinner norm coincided with and helped to facilitate the removal of children from the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Seccombe&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, approximately 49% of the nation's workforce was under the age of 20. Throughout the century, multiple items of legislation were written in to law limiting the age at which a child could enter work and ensuring mandatory standards of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/childlabour.htm |title=Exhibitions &amp;#124; Citizenship &amp;#124; Struggle for democracy |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, families that rely on the earning power of one parent have had a lower divorce rate than families where both parents are in gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=D'Amico |first=Ronald |last2= |first2= |date=Jun 1983 |title=

==Disadvantages==
One associated disadvantage is that 'male breadwinner regimes make women [[dependant|dependent]] within marriage cohabitation especially when they have young children'.&lt;ref name=Pascall&gt;{{citation  | last = Pascall | first = Gillian | contribution = Male breadwinner model | editor-last1 = Pascall | editor-first1 = Gillian | title = International encyclopedia of social policy | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780415576949 | ref = harv | display-editors=etal}} [http://cw.routledge.com/ref/socialpolicy/male.html Text.]&lt;/ref&gt; In societies where the breadwinner model is present, it is common for the non-earner (predominantly women) to have broken career paths, providing unpaid labour to the family or working part-time. This contributes to the fact that, on average, women obtain lower levels of lifetime earnings than men.&lt;ref name=Pascall/&gt; This [[income disparity]] can often lead to an increase in financial insecurity or poverty – predominantly affecting women – if the [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]] collapses. Another risk that has been identified with this has been a higher exposure to [[domestic violence]], which has been associated with the non-earner's lack of independent resources.&lt;ref name=Pascall/&gt;

==Decline of the male breadwinner==
In 2013 the UK female employment rate reached 67.2 per cent, the highest since the [[Office for National Statistics]]' records began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Dugan | first = Emily | title = Number of women in work in Britain hits record high – but figures show the gender pay gap is growing too | work = [[The Independent]] | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/more-women-have-jobs-in-britain-than-ever-before--but-figures-show-the-gender-pay-gap-is-rising-too-9139154.html | publisher = Independent Print Limited | date = 19 February 2014| accessdate = 30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As women's growing presence in the professional world has risen, as well as support for gender equality, male-female relations in the home have changed, especially the breadwinner paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crompton | first = Rosemary | title = Restructuring gender relations and employment: the decline of the male breadwinner | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780198296089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The breadwinner model was most prevalent during the 20-year period directly after [[World War II]]. During this time the economy relied heavily on men to financially support the family and to provide the main source of income, typically relying on women to stay at home and look after the children and undertaking [[domestic work]]. "Women's support for gender specialisation in marriage began to decline rapidly from the late 1970s through to the mid 1980s, this was followed by an interval of stability until the mid 1990s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cunningham | first = Mick | title = Changing attitudes toward the male breadwinner, female homemaker family model: Influences of women's employment and education over the lifecourse | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 87 | issue = 1 | pages = 299–323 | publisher = Oxford Journals | doi = 10.1353/sof.0.0097 | date = September 2008  | jstor = 20430858 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; "As increasing proportions of women entered the paid labour market during the latter decades of the 20th century, the family model of a male breadwinner and female homemaker came under significant challenge both as a practice and an [[ideology]]".&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sayer | first1 = Liana C. | last2 = Bianchi | first2 = Suzanne M. | last3 = Robinson | first3 = John P. | title = Are parents investing less in children?

{{quote|There is now agreement in most literature that the breadwinner model, in which men take primary responsibility for earning and women for the unpaid work of care, has been substantially eroded.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lewis | first = Jane | title = The decline of the male breadwinner model: The implications for work and care | journal = [[Social Politics]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–170 | publisher = Oxford Journals | doi = 10.1093/sp/8.2.152 | date = Summer 2001 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Nordic countries]] in particular have begun to adopt the dual-breadwinner model, with high employment rates among men and women, and a very small difference between men's and women's hours of work. With the exception of [[Denmark]], research by the [[World Economic Forum]] has shown that all Nordic countries have closed over 80 percent of the [[Gender pay gap|gender gap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report | last= World Economic Forum | author-link = World Economic Forum | date = 2013 | title = Insight Report: The Global Gender Gap Report 2013 | url = http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2013.pdf | publisher = World Economic Forum, Switzerland | page = 103 | accessdate = 19 October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The female breadwinner model, otherwise known as "Breadwinner Moms",&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite report | last1 = Wang | first1 = Wendy | last2 = Parker | first2 = Kim | last3 = Taylor | first3 = Paul |title= Breadwinner moms, mothers are the sole or primary provider in four-in-ten households with children: Public conflicted about the growing trend | date = 29 May 2013 |journal= [[Pew Research Center]] | location = Washington, DC |url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/05/Breadwinner_moms_final.pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place when the female provides the main source of income for the family. Recent data from the US Census stated that "40% of all households with children under the age of 18 include mothers who are either the sole or primary source of income for the family". 37%&lt;ref name=Decline&gt;{{cite report | last = Pew Research Center | author-link = Pew Research Center | title= The decline of marriage and rise of new families |publisher= Pew Research Center|url= http://pewsocialtrends.org/2010/11/18/the-decline-of-marriage-and-rise-of-new-families/ | date = 19 November 2010 |accessdate= 18 October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; of these "Breadwinner Moms"&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt; are married mothers who have a higher income than their husbands, and 63%&lt;ref name=Decline/&gt; are single mothers.

==Issues with the decline of the breadwinner model==
Although there have been problems identified with the breadwinner model, there have also been issues noted in its decline. The decline of the breadwinner model has been accompanied by an erosion of various dimensions – [[sexual division of labour]], the economic support of family members, and the "distribution of time and regulation of marriage and parenthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Creighton | first = Colin | title = The rise and decline of the 'male breadwinner family' in Britain | journal = [[Cambridge Journal of Economics]] | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 519–541 | publisher = Oxford Journals | doi = 10.1093/cje/23.5.519 | jstor = 23599633 | date = September 1999  | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two parents in the workforce, there is a risk that a job could undermine family life, consequently leading to [[breakup|relationship breakdown]] or adversely affecting original family formation.

A recent study has found that "women's gains on the economic front may be contributing to a decline in the formation and stability of marriages". Although one reason for this may be that women with greater earning and [[economic security]] have more freedom to leave bad marriages, another possibility could be that men are more hesitant to this change in [[social norms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Thaler | first = Richard H. | author-link = Richard Thaler | title = Breadwinner wives and nervous husbands | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1 June 2013 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/business/breadwinner-wives-and-nervous-husbands.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; | publisher = [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] | accessdate = 18 October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], the '''Chebyshev center''' of a bounded set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; having non-empty [[Interior (topology)|interior]] is the center of the minimal-radius ball enclosing the entire set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively (and non-equivalently) the center of largest inscribed ball of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BV" /&gt;

In the field of [[parameter estimation]], the Chebyshev center approach tries to find an estimator &lt;math&gt; \hat x &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; given the feasibility set &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\hat x&lt;/math&gt; minimizes the worst possible estimation error for x (e.g. best worst case).

== Mathematical representation ==
There exist several alternative representations for the Chebyshev center.
Consider the set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and denote its Chebyshev center by &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by solving:

: &lt;math&gt; \min_{{\hat x},r} \left\{ r:\left\| {\hat x} - x \right\|^2 \leq r,  \forall x \in Q \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively by solving:

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname*{\arg\min}_{\hat{x}} \max_{x \in Q} \left\| x - \hat x \right\|^2. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="BV"&gt;{{cite book|title=Convex Optimization|first1=Stephen P.|last1=Boyd|first2=Lieven|last2=Vandenberghe|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83378-3|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these properties, finding the Chebyshev center may be a hard [[numerical optimization problem]]. For example, in the second representation above, the inner maximization is [[nonconvex optimization|non-convex]] if the set ''Q'' is not [[convex set|convex]].

== Properties ==
In [[inner product spaces]] and two-dimensional spaces, if &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; is closed, bounded and convex, then the Chebyshev center is in &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the search for the Chebyshev center can be conducted inside &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; without loss of generality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amir|first1=Dan|title=International Series of Numerical Mathematics / Internationale Schriftenreihe zur Numerischen Mathematik / Série internationale d’Analyse numérique|date=1984|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=9783034862530|pages=19–35|chapter=Best Simultaneous Approximation (Chebyshev Centers)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other spaces, the Chebyshev center may not be in  &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt;, even if  &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; is convex. For instance, if &lt;math&gt; Q &lt;/math&gt; is the tetrahedron formed by the [[convex hull]] of the points (1,1,1), (-1,1,1), (1,-1,1) and (1,1,-1), then computing the Chebyshev center using the &lt;math&gt; \ell_{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; norm yields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dabbene|first1=Fabrizio|last2=Sznaier|first2=Mario|last3=Tempo|first3=Roberto|title=Probabilistic Optimal Estimation With Uniformly Distributed Noise|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|date=August 2014|volume=59|issue=8|pages=2113–2127|doi=10.1109/tac.2014.2318092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \operatorname{\arg \min }_{\hat {x}}\max _{x\in Q}\left\|x-{\hat {x}}\right\|_{\infty}^{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Relaxed Chebyshev center ==
Let us consider the case in which the set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as the intersection of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; ellipsoids.

: &lt;math&gt; \min_{\hat x} \max_x \left\{ \left\| {\hat x} - x \right\|^2 :f_i (x) \le 0,0 \le i \le k \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
with
: &lt;math&gt; f_i (x) = x^T Q_i x + 2g_i^T x + d_i  \le 0,0 \le i \le k. \, &lt;/math&gt;

By introducing an additional matrix variable &lt;math&gt;\Delta = x x^T &lt;/math&gt;, we can write the inner maximization problem of the Chebyshev center as:

: &lt;math&gt; \min_{\hat x} \max_{(\Delta ,x) \in G} \left\{ \left\| {\hat x} \right\|^2  - 2{\hat x}^T x + \operatorname{Tr}(\Delta ) \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace operator]] and
: &lt;math&gt; G = \left\{(\Delta ,x):{\rm{f}}_i (\Delta ,x) \le 0,0 \le i \le k,\Delta  = xx^T \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; f_i (\Delta ,x) = \operatorname{Tr}(Q_i \Delta ) + 2g_i^T x + d_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Relaxing our demand on &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; by demanding &lt;math&gt; \Delta \ge xx^T &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\Delta - xx^T  \in S_+&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S_+&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[positive semi-definite matrix|positive semi-definite matrices]], and changing the order of the min max to max min (see the references for more details), the optimization problem can be formulated as:

: &lt;math&gt; RCC = \max_{(\Delta ,x) \in {T}} \left\{ - \left\| x \right\|^2  + \operatorname{Tr}(\Delta ) \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
with 
: &lt;math&gt; {T} = \left\{ (\Delta ,x):\rm{f}_i (\Delta ,x) \le 0,0 \le i \le k,\Delta \ge xx^T  \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

This last '''convex''' optimization problem is known as the '''relaxed Chebyshev center''' (RCC).
The RCC has the following important properties:
* The RCC is an upper bound for the exact Chebyshev center.
* The RCC is unique.
* The RCC is feasible.

== Constrained least squares ==
It can be shown that the well-known [[constrained least squares]] (CLS) problem is a relaxed version of the Chebyshev center.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The original CLS problem can be formulated as:
: &lt;math&gt; {\hat x}_{CLS}  = \operatorname*{\arg\min}_{x \in C} \left\| y - Ax \right\|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
with 
: &lt;math&gt; { C} = \left\{ x:f_i (x) = x^T Q_i x + 2g_i^T x + d_i  \le 0,1 \le i \le k \right\} 
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; Q_i  \ge 0,g_i  \in R^m ,d_i  \in R.  &lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that this problem is equivalent to the following optimization problem:
: &lt;math&gt; \max_{(\Delta ,{{x}}) \in {V}} \left\{ { - \left\| {{x}} \right\|^2  + \operatorname{Tr}(\Delta )} \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
with
: &lt;math&gt; V = \left\{ \begin{array}{c}
 (\Delta ,x):x \in C{\rm{ }} \\ 
 \operatorname{Tr}(A^T A\Delta ) - 2y^T A^T x + \left\| y \right\|^2  - \rho  \le 0,\rm{   }\Delta  \ge xx^T  \\ 
 \end{array} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

One can see that this problem is a relaxation of the Chebyshev center (though different than the RCC described above).

== RCC vs. CLS ==
A solution set &lt;math&gt; (x,\Delta) &lt;/math&gt; for the RCC is also a solution for the CLS, and thus &lt;math&gt; T \in V &lt;/math&gt;.
This means that the CLS estimate is the solution of a looser relaxation than that of the RCC.
Hence the '''CLS is an upper bound for the RCC''', which is an upper bound for the real Chebyshev center.

== Modeling constraints ==
Since both the RCC and CLS are based upon relaxation of the real feasibility set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, the form in which &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is defined affects its relaxed versions. This of course affects the quality of the RCC and CLS estimators.
As a simple example consider the linear box constraints: 
: &lt;math&gt; l \leq a^T x \leq u &lt;/math&gt;
which can alternatively be written as
: &lt;math&gt; (a^T x - l)(a^T x - u) \leq 0. &lt;/math&gt;
It turns out that the first representation results with an upper bound estimator for the second one, hence using it may dramatically decrease the quality of the calculated estimator.

This simple example shows us that great care should be given to the formulation of constraints when relaxation of the feasibility region is used.

== Linear programming problem  ==
This problem can be formulated as a [[linear programming]] problem, provided that the region Q is an intersection of finitely many hyperplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/teaching/lectures/intro_ss11/Exercises/solutionEx11-12.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912204904/http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/teaching/lectures/intro_ss11/Exercises/solutionEx11-12.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''defoliant''' is any [[Herbicide|herbicidal]] chemical sprayed or dusted on plants to cause their [[Leaf|leaves]] to fall off. Defoliants are widely used for the selective removal of weeds in managing croplands and lawns. Worldwide use of defoliants, along with the development of other herbicides and [[Pesticide|pesticides]], allowed for the [[Green Revolution]], an increase in agricultural production in mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invention of Ecocide|last=Zierler|first=David|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2011|isbn=9786613110404|location=Athens, Georgia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoliants have also been used in warfare as a means to deprive an enemy of food crops and/or hiding cover, most notably by the [[United States]] [[Agent Orange|in the Vietnam War]].

== Use and application ==
A primary application of defoliants is the selective killing of plants. Two of the oldest chemical [[Herbicide|herbicides]] used as defoliants are [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T). 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are absorbed by broad-leafed plants, killing them by causing excessive hormonal growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These [[Phenoxy herbicide|phenoxy herbicides]] were designed to selectively kill weeds and unwanted plants in croplands. They were first introduced at the beginning of [[World War II]] and became widespread in use in agriculture following the end of the War.

Defoliants have a practical use in the harvesting of certain crops, particularly [[cotton]], in the [[United States]] as well as a number of other cotton-producing countries. The use of defoliants aids in the effective harvesting of cotton and finer lint quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snipes|first=Charles E.|last2=Cathey|first2=George W.|date=1992|title=Evaluation of defoliant mixtures in cotton|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378429092900185|journal=Field Crops Research|volume=28|issue=4|pages=327–334|doi=10.1016/0378-4290(92)90018-5|issn=0378-4290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of defoliant use in cotton harvesting depends on the type of defoliant(s) used, the number of applications, the amount applied, and environmental variables. Common harvest-aiding chemical defoliants include tribufos, dimethipin, and [[thidiazuron]]. According to a 1998 report by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] (NASS), tribufos and thidiazuron accounted for 60% of crop area that was treated by defoliants during that crop year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Thomas L.|last2=Marti|first2=Luz|last3=Belflower|first3=Sally|last4=Truman|first4=Clint C.|date=2000|title=Multiresidue Analysis of Cotton Defoliant, Herbicide, and Insecticide Residues in Water by Solid-Phase Extraction and GC−NPD, GC−MS, and HPLC−Diode Array Detection|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf9909104|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=4103–4108|doi=10.1021/jf9909104|issn=0021-8561|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASS (1999). ''Agricultural Chemical Usage 1998 Field Crops Summary''. Washington, D.C.: U. S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics and Economic Research Service. pg 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health and environmental effects ==
In 1998, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (U.S. EPA) concluded that the use of agricultural defoliants led to increased risks of water contamination and dangers to freshwater and [[marine life]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; High doses of tribufos were labeled as a possible [[carcinogen]] and a toxin to freshwater and marine [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7603">A '''discontinuity''' in [[geotechnical engineering]] (in geotechnical literature often denoted by '''joint''') is a plane or surface that marks a change in physical or chemical characteristics in a soil or rock mass. A discontinuity can be, for example, a [[Bed (geology)|bedding]], [[schist]]osity, [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]], [[Joint (geology)|joint]], [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage]], [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]], [[Fracture (geology)|fissure]], crack, or [[Fault (geology)|fault]] plane. A division is made between '''mechanical''' and '''integral''' discontinuities. Discontinuities may occur multiple times with broadly the same mechanical characteristics in a '''discontinuity set''', or may be a '''single discontinuity'''. A discontinuity makes a soil or rock mass anisotropic.&lt;ref name=ISRMbluebook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laubscher/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hack/&gt;&lt;ref name=HackPriceRengers/&gt;

==Mechanical==
A '''mechanical discontinuity''' is a plane of physical weakness where the [[tensile strength]] perpendicular to the discontinuity or the [[Shear strength (Discontinuity)|shear strength]] along the discontinuity is lower than that of the surrounding soil or rock material.

==Integral==
An '''integral discontinuity''' is a discontinuity that is as strong as the surrounding soil or rock material. Integral discontinuities can change into mechanical discontinuities due to physical or chemical processes (e.g. [[weathering]]) that change the mechanical characteristics of the discontinuity.

==Set or family==
Various geological processes create discontinuities at a broadly regular spacing. For example, [[Bed (geology)|bedding planes]] are the result of a repeated [[sedimentation]] cycle with a change of sedimentation material or change in structure and texture of the sediment at regular intervals, [[Fold (geology)|folding]] creates [[Joint (geology)|joints]] at regular separations to allow for shrinkage or expansion of the rock material, etc. Normally discontinuities with the same origin have broadly the same characteristics in terms of [[Shear strength (Discontinuity)|shear strength]],&lt;ref name=BartonChoubey/&gt;&lt;ref name=HackPrice1995/&gt; spacing between discontinuities,&lt;ref name=PriestHudson/&gt; roughness, infill, etc. The orientations of discontinuities with the same origin are related to the process that has created them and to the geological history of the rock mass. A '''discontinuity set or family''' denotes a series of discontinuities for which the geological origin (history, etc.), the orientation, spacing, and the mechanical characteristics ([[Shear strength (Discontinuity)|shear strength]], roughness, infill material, etc.) are broadly the same.

==Single==
A discontinuity may exist as a single feature (e.g. fault, isolated joint or fracture) and in some circumstances, a discontinuity is treated as a '''single discontinuity''' although it belongs to a discontinuity set, in particular if the spacing is very wide compared to the size of the engineering application or to the size of the geotechnical unit.

==Characterization==
Various international standards exist to describe and characterize discontinuities in geomechanical terms, such as ISO 14689-1:2003&lt;ref name=ISO2003/&gt; and ISRM.&lt;ref name=ISRMbluebook/&gt;

'''Eating''' (also known as '''consuming''') is the [[ingestion]] of [[food]], typically to provide a heterotrophic [[organism]] with  [[food energy|energy]] and to allow for [[:wikt:growth|growth]]. Animals and other [[heterotroph]]s must eat in order to survive — [[carnivore]]s eat other animals, [[herbivore]]s eat plants, [[omnivore]]s consume a mixture of both plant and animal matter, and [[detritivores]] eat [[detritus]]. Fungi digest organic matter outside their bodies as opposed to animals that digest their food inside their bodies. For humans, eating is an [[Activities of daily living|activity of daily living]]. Some individuals may limit their amount of nutritional intake. This may be a result of a lifestyle choice, due to [[hunger]] or [[famine]], as part of a [[Dieting|diet]] or as religious fasting.

==Eating practices among humans==
[[File:Photo degustation.JPG|thumb|200px|Women eating biscuits in England]]

[[File:Japanese Gothic lolita.jpg|thumb|200px|A girl eating a cake]]
Many homes have a large eating room or outside (in the tropics) kitchen area devoted to preparation of meals and food, and may have a [[dining room]], [[dining hall]], or another designated area for eating. Some trains have a [[dining car]].

Most societies also have [[restaurant]]s, [[food court]]s, and [[street food|food vendors]] so that people may eat when away from home, when lacking time to prepare food, or as a social occasion ([[dining club]]).&lt;ref&gt;John Raulston Saul (1995), "The Doubter's Companion", 155&lt;/ref&gt; At their highest level of sophistication, these places become "theatrical spectacles of [[global cosmopolitanism]] and [[myth]]."&lt;ref&gt;David Grazian (2008), "On the Make: The Hustle of Urban Nightlife", 32&lt;/ref&gt; At [[picnic]]s, [[potluck]]s, and [[food festival]]s, eating is in fact the primary purpose of a social gathering. At many social events, food and beverages are made available to attendees.

Dishware, silverware, [[drinkware]], and [[cookware]] come in a wide array of forms and sizes.

People usually have two or three meals a day regularly. [[Snack]]s of smaller amounts may be consumed between meals. Doctors in the UK, recommend three meals a day ( with between 400-600 kcal per meal),&lt;ref name="smart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Be calorie smart 400-600-600|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/calories.aspx|publisher=nhs.uk|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cut down on your calories|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodfood/Pages/eat-less.aspx#you|date=15 October 2015|publisher=nhs.uk|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with four to six hours between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sen|first1=Debarati|title=How often should you eat?|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/How-often-should-you-eat/articleshow/15616282.cms|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=Times of India|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having three well-balanced meals (thus half of the plate with vegetables,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/vegetables-and-fruits/ Half of plate to be filled with vegetables, according to Harvard School of Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt; 1/4 protein food as meat, ... and 1/4 carbohydrates as pasta, rice, ...) will then account to some 1800–2000 kcal, which is the average requirement for a regular person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iloveindia.com/nutrition/food-facts/calorie-requirement-of-body.html Calorie requirements for regular person estimated at 2000 kcal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[healthy eating]] has long been an important concern to individuals and cultures. Among other practices, [[fasting]], [[dieting]], and [[vegetarianism]] are all techniques employed by individuals and encouraged by societies to increase longevity and health. Some religions promote vegetarianism, considering it wrong to consume animals. Leading nutritionists believe that instead of indulging oneself in three large meals each day, it is much healthier and easier on the metabolism to eat five smaller meals each day (e.g. better digestion, easier on the lower intestine to deposit wastes; whereas larger meals are tougher on the digestive tract and may call for the use of [[laxatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Micheals, Jullian. "FitWatch - Free Online Calorie Counter &amp; Diet Tracker / Weight Loss Tools and Calculators." FitWatch RSS. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, psychiatrists with [[Yale School of Medicine|Yale Medical School]] have found that people who suffer from [[Binge Eating Disorder]] (BED) and consume three meals per day weigh less than those who have meals that are more frequent. Eating can also be a way of making money (see [[competitive eating]]). In jurisdictions under [[sharia law]], it may be proscribed for [[Muslim]] [[adult]]s during the daylight hours of [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharia and Social Engineering: p 143, R.

Newborn babies do not eat adult foods. They survive solely on breast milk or formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to combine breast and bottle feeding|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/combining-breast-and-bottle.aspx|publisher=nhs.uk|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of pureed food are sometimes fed to young infants as young as two or three months old, but most infants do not eat adult food until they are between six and eight months old. Young babies eat pureed [[baby food]]s because they have few teeth and immature digestive systems. Between 8 and 12 months of age, the digestive system improves, and many babies begin eating finger foods. Their diet is still limited, however, because most babies lack molars or canines at this age, and often have a limited number of incisors. By 18 months, babies often have enough teeth and a sufficiently mature digestive system to eat the same foods as adults. Learning to eat is a messy process for children, and children often do not master neatness or eating etiquette until they are 5 or 6 years old.

===Eating positions===
{{expand section|Additional information regarding Far East, Europe and America|date=September 2011}}
Eating positions vary according to the different regions of the world, as culture influences the way people eat their meals.
For example, most of the Middle Eastern countries, eating while sitting on the floor is most common, and it is believed to be healthier than eating while sitting to a table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Middle Eastern American Experience|last=Donovan|first=Sandy|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=2010|isbn=9780761363613|location=United States|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brito|first=Leonardo Barbosa Barreto de|last2=Ricardo|first2=Djalma Rabelo|last3=Araújo|first3=Denise Sardinha Mendes Soares de|last4=Ramos|first4=Plínio Santos|last5=Myers|first5=Jonathan|last6=Araújo|first6=Claudio Gil Soares de|date=2012-12-13|title=Ability to sit and rise from the floor as a predictor of all-cause mortality|url=http://cpr.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/12/10/2047487312471759|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112022009/http://cpr.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/12/10/2047487312471759|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-12|journal=European Journal of Preventive Cardiology|language=en|pages=2047487312471759|doi=10.1177/2047487312471759|issn=2047-4873|pmid=23242910|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compulsive overeating===
{{main|Compulsive overeating}}
Compulsive overeating, or emotional eating, is "the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eldredge | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Agras | first2 = W. S. | year = 1994 | title = Weight and Shape Overconcern and Emotional Eating in Binge Eating Disorder | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-108X(199601)19:1&lt;73::AID-EAT9&gt;3.0.CO;2-T | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 73–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical studies have indicated that anxiety leads to decreased food consumption in people with normal weight and increased food consumption in the obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKenna | first1 = R. J. | year = 1972 | title = Some Effects of Anxiety Level and Food Cues on the Eating Behavior of Obese and Normal Subjects: A Comparison of Schachterian and Psychosomatic Conceptions | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 311–319 | doi=10.1037/h0032925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many laboratory studies showed that overweight individuals are more emotionally reactive and are more likely to overeat when distressed than people of normal weight. Furthermore, it was consistently found that obese individuals experience negative emotions more frequently and more intensively than do normal weight persons.&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lowe | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = E. B. Jr | year = 1983 | title = Emotional Reactivity, Emotional Eating, and Obesity: A Naturalistic Study | url = | journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 135–149 | doi=10.1007/bf00845377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalistic study by Lowe and Fisher compared the emotional reactivity and emotional eating of normal and overweight female college students. The study confirmed the tendency of obese individuals to overeat, but these findings applied only to snacks, not to meals. That means that obese individuals did not tend to eat more while having meals; rather, the amount of snacks they ate between meals was greater. One possible explanation that Lowe and Fisher suggest is obese individuals often eat their meals with others and do not eat more than average due to the reduction of distress because of the presence of other people. Another possible explanation would be that obese individuals do not eat more than the others while having meals due to social desirability. Conversely, snacks are usually eaten alone.&lt;ref name="Lowe"/&gt;

===Hunger and satiety===
{{Further|Hunger (motivational state)}}
There are many physiological mechanisms that control starting and stopping a meal. The control of food intake is a physiologically complex, motivated behavioral system. Hormones such as [[cholecystokinin]], [[bombesin]], [[neurotensin]], [[anorectic|anorectin]], [[calcitonin]], [[enterostatin]], [[leptin]] and [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] have all been shown to suppress food intake.&lt;ref&gt;Geiselman, P.J. (1996). Control of food intake. A physiologically complex, motivated behavioral system. Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am. 1996 Dec;25(4):815-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=164160&amp;rn=1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Initiation====
[[File:German Shepherd puppy eating out of a human hand.jpg|thumb|200px|German Shepherd puppy eating out of a human hand]]
There are numerous signals given off that initiate [[hunger]]. There are environmental signals, signals from the [[gastrointestinal system]], and [[metabolism|metabolic signals]] that trigger hunger. The environmental signals come from the body’s [[senses]]. The feeling of hunger could be triggered by the smell and thought of food, the sight of a plate, or hearing someone talk about food.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Physiology of Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston, MA|pages=412–426}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signals from the stomach are initiated by the release of the [[peptide hormone]] ghrelin. Ghrelin is a hormone that increases appetite by signaling to the brain that a person is hungry.&lt;ref name=Ghrelin&gt;{{cite web|last=Funai, M.D.|first=Edmund|title=Ghrelin, Hormone That Stimulates Appetite, Found To Be Higher In PWS|url=http://www.pwsausa.org/research/ghrelin.htm|accessdate=29 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531141800/http://www.pwsausa.org/research/ghrelin.htm|archivedate=31 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental signals and ghrelin are not the only signals that initiate hunger, there are other metabolic signals as well. As time passes between meals, the body starts to take nutrients from long-term reservoirs.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; When the glucose levels of cells drop (glucoprivation), the body starts to produce the feeling of hunger. The body also stimulates eating by detecting a drop in cellular lipid levels (lipoprivation).&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; Both the brain and the liver monitor the levels of metabolic fuels. The brain checks for glucoprivation on its side of the blood–brain barrier (since glucose is its fuel), while the liver monitors the rest of the body for both lipoprivation and glucoprivation.&lt;ref name=NCBI&gt;{{cite web|last=Berg|first=JM|title=Section 30.2Each Organ Has a Unique Metabolic Profile|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/|work=Biochemistry 5th Edition|publisher=W H Freeman|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Termination====
There are short-term signals of satiety that arise from the head, the stomach, the intestines, and the liver. The long-term signals of satiety come from [[adipose tissue]].&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; The taste and odor of food can contribute to short-term satiety, allowing the body to learn when to stop eating. The stomach contains receptors to allow us to know when we are full. The intestines also contain receptors that send satiety signals to the brain. The hormone [[cholecystokinin]] is secreted by the [[duodenum]], and it controls the rate at which the stomach is emptied.&lt;ref name=CCK&gt;{{cite journal|last=Little|first=TJ|title=Role of cholecystokinin in appetite control and body weight regulation.|work=Obesity Reviews|author2=Horowitz, M |author3=Feinle-Bisset, C.|pmid=16246215|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2005.00212.x|volume=6|pages=297–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hormone is thought to be a satiety signal to the brain. [[Peptide YY]] 3-36 is a hormone released by the [[small intestine]] and it is also used as a satiety signal to the brain.&lt;ref name="Peptide YY 3-36"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Degen|first=L|title=Effect of peptide YY3-36 on food intake in humans.|pmid=16285944|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.09.001|volume=129|journal=Gastroenterology|pages=1430–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin also serves as a satiety signal to the brain. The brain detects [[insulin]] in the blood, which indicates that nutrients are being absorbed by cells and a person is getting full. Long-term satiety comes from the fat stored in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue secretes the hormone [[leptin]], and leptin suppresses appetite. Long-term satiety signals from adipose tissue regulates short-term satiety signals.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

====Role of the brain====
The [[brain stem]] can control food intake, because it contains neural circuits that detect hunger and satiety signals from other parts of the body.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; The brain stem’s involvement of food intake has been researched using rats. Rats that have had the motor neurons in the brain stem disconnected from the neural circuits of the cerebral hemispheres (decerebration), are unable to approach and eat food.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; Instead they have to obtain their food in a liquid form. This research shows that the brain stem does in fact play a role in eating.

There are two peptides in the [[hypothalamus]] that produce hunger, [[melanin concentrating hormone]] (MCH) and [[orexin]]. MCH plays a bigger role in producing hunger. In mice, MCH stimulates feeding and a mutation causing the overproduction of MCH led to overeating and obesity.&lt;ref name=MCH&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimada|first=M|title=MCH (Melanin Concentrating Hormone) and MCH-2 Receptor|url=http://www.phoenixbiotech.net/allobesity/Catalog%20Files/MCH%20Section/MCH.html|work=Mice lacking Melanin-Concentrating Hormone are hypophagic and lean.|accessdate=29 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905145154/http://www.phoenixbiotech.net/allobesity/Catalog%20Files/MCH%20Section/MCH.html|archivedate=5 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orexin plays a greater role in controlling the relationship between eating and sleeping. Other peptides in the hypothalamus that induce eating are neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AGRP).&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

Satiety in the hypothalamus is stimulated by leptin. Leptin targets the receptors on the arcuate nucleus and suppresses the secretion of MCH and orexin. The arcuate nucleus also contains two more peptides that suppress hunger. The first one is [[cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript]] (CART), the second is α-MSH (α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone).&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;

==Disorders==
{{main|Eating disorder}}

Physiologically, eating is generally triggered by [[Hunger (motivational state)|hunger]], but there are numerous physical and psychological conditions that can affect [[appetite]] and disrupt normal eating patterns. These include [[clinical depression|depression]], food [[allergy|allergies]], ingestion of certain chemicals, [[bulimia]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[pituitary gland]] malfunction and other [[endocrine]] problems, and numerous other [[illness]]es and [[eating disorder]]s.

A chronic lack of nutritious food can cause various illnesses, and will eventually lead to [[starvation]]. When this happens in a locality on a massive scale, it is considered a [[famine]].

If eating and [[drinking]] is not possible, as is often the case when recovering from [[surgery]], alternatives are [[Route of administration#Enteral|enteral]]&lt;ref name= Feeding&gt;{{cite web|title=Pediatric Feeding Tube |url=https://pediatricfeeding.com/tube-feeding/|publisher=Feeding Clinic of Santa Monica|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; nutrition and [[parenteral nutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;Heisler, Jennifer.

'''Effective complexity''' is a [[Complex systems|measure of complexity]] defined in a 2003 paper by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Seth Lloyd]] that attempts to measure the amount of non-[[random]] [[information]] in a system.&lt;ref&gt;https://philpapers.org/rec/GELIME&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.5663.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticised as being dependent on the subjective decisions made as to which parts of the information in the system are to be discounted as random.&lt;ref&gt;https://philpapers.org/rec/MCAECA&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1968, '''El Mercado de Los Angeles''' is located in the Boyle Heights district of the city of Los Angeles east of the LA River and adjacent to East Los Angeles (an unincorporated portion of the County of Los Angeles often cited as the heart of the Mexican/American community) on the corner of 1st Street and Lorena Street and is accessible by the Metro Gold Line's [[Indiana (Los Angeles Metro station)|Indiana Station]] located two blocks east.  El Mercado is a three-floor indoor shopping center that offers dining and restaurant services, entertainment with live mariachi bands and shopping from various vendors. Although El Mercado is themed and represents a space that honors [[Mexico]] and [[Mexican culture]], other Latinos from different ethnicities visit and shop there.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/history.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indoor shopping and meeting place, El Mercado also provides economic agency for Latinos as vendors selling music and films, exotic boots, belts, hats, a jewelry store, Mexican handcrafts, toys, cosmetics and services such as travel and sending money to their natal communities.&lt;ref name="Swap meets and Socioeconomic Alternatives"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barros-Nock|first=Magdalena|title=Swap meets and Socioeconomic Alternatives for Mexican Immigrants: The Case of San Joaquin Valley|journal=Human Organization|date=2 September 2009|volume=68|issue=3|pages=307–317|url=http://sfaa.metapress.com/content/6550852777144576/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through selling and bartering Latino vendors engage in market exchanges that give agency to both the buyer and seller. El Mercado de Los Angeles is a place where Latinos can gather together for social purposes and to enjoy cultural experiences through food, music, and other forms of semiotics such as the paintings on the buildings and a mural of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgen de Guadalupe]] that link them to their native lands.

== Cultural de-territorialization and identity ==
In East Los Angeles, Latinos constitute approximately 97.1% of the population.&lt;ref name="East Los Angeles demographic information"&gt;{{cite web|title=East Los Angeles Demographic Data|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/East-Los-Angeles-California.html|publisher=CityData.com|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy population of Latinos in [[Eastside Los Angeles|East Los Angeles]] demonstrates the appropriation of space due to the process of [[deterritorialization|de-territorialization]]. De-territorialization of culture refers to the weakening relationships between culture and place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deterritorialization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, many thought of culture restricted in localized terms, that is cultural was rooted to a particular geographical area, nation, or state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inda|first=Jonathan Xavier|author2=Renato Rosaldo|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|journal=A world in motion|year=2002|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as East Los Angeles proves different, Latinos as cultural subjects, continue to traverse national borders bringing along with them their cultural practices and traditions in different territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inda|first=Jonathan Xavier|author2=Renato Rosaldo|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|journal=A world in motion|year=2002|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Territorialization on the other hand can be more understood as the process of turning a space into a place, as explained by Clara Irazabal and Ramzi Farhart in their article “Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irazábal|first=Clara|author2=Ramzi Farhat|title=Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City|journal=Journal of Planning Literature|year=2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=207|doi=10.1177/0885412207310146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affirmations of belonging and community space ==
El Mercado is place that allows Latinos to assert their identity to foster a sense of belonging and build an intimate community space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guitérrez Nájera|first=Lourdes|title=Hayandose: Zapotex Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging|journal=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday life in Latina/o America|year=2010|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lourdes Gutierrez Nájera explains in her article “Hayandoese: Zapotec Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging” how Yalaltecos communities in Los Angeles affirm their identity and create a sense of ethnic belonging and community through participation in life cycle events and every day practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guitérrez Nájera|first=Lourdes|title=Hayandose: Zapotex Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging|journal=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday life in Latina/o America|year=2010|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article “Swap meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: a community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods”, Jeffrey Edwin Juarez describes swap meets as regular meeting spaces that people treat as recreation places, much like a park, to spend time together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juarez|first=Jeffery Edwin|title=Swap Meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: A community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods|year=2011|page=12|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/69455|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Mercado is a community pace for Latino’s for both local’s and visitors to interact, spend time together and share experiences. One way El Mercado fosters its community space is through its large restaurant located on the third floor popularly known as El Mercadito, which is actually themed in to three different restaurants representing different cities of Mexico that make up the one large restaurant.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"/&gt; El Mercadito restaurant is widely used by families and friends as a community space to make reservations for birthday celebrations, wedding receptions, quincenera receptions, and other banquet purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Mercadito Restaurant Directory|url=http://www.elmercaditorestaurant.com/HTML/reservaciones/reservation.html|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic agency at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles serves a significant economic purpose for Latinos in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles region]]. For the customers at El Mercado, the mercado provides affordable items that make shopping accessible for people across income levels. Also importantly, mercados foster relationships between vendors.&lt;ref name="Sherry 1990 13-30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherry|first=John F.|title=A Sociocultural Analysis of A Midwestern American Flea Market|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=June 1990|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–30|doi=10.1086/208533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between vendors exists, but mercados in general often function as sites of both economic competition and collaboration between vendors within the mercado.&lt;ref name="Sherry 1990 13-30"/&gt; The sense of competition is increased between the relationship between vendor and customer.

At swap meets, or mercados like El Mercado, complex relationships exist between buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name="Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf 1988 457"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf|title=A Naturalistic Inquiry Into Buyer and Seller Behavior at a Swapmeet|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=March 1988|volume=14|issue=4|page=457|doi=10.1086/209128|first1=Russell W.|last2=Sherry, Jr.|first2=John F.|last3=Wallendorf|first3=Melanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercados are less bureaucratic spaces that corporate stores or even independent businesses.&lt;ref name="Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf 1988 457"/&gt; Vendors must apply for a permit at El Mercado, yet the vendors frequently make informal exchanges such as bartering/trading, or bargaining for prices. These informal market exchanges give [[agency (sociology)|agency]] to both the buyer and seller because each have a role in setting the terms of the business transaction. El Mercado de Los Ángeles not only provides cultural significance to the consumers who come to it, but it also provides a space for affordable items and economic negotiation.

== Monetary and cultural remittances at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles offers a variety of services that help send off monetary remittances to [[Latin America]]. The Mercado also provides travel and calling services that help customers participate in the formation of cultural remittances to Latin America.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"/&gt;

=== Monetary remittances at El Mercado ===
El Mercado also serves as an important site of cultural and monetary remittances between the United States and [[México]], specifically. This mercado is a site of cultural that is the product of cultural hybridities. It is also a site that actively constructs cultural hybridities in the United States and México. El Mercado offers services to send money back to México securely as well as offering a [[bureau de change|currency exchange]] between [[peso]]s and United States dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/directory.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers are able to send monetary remittance home to México by using the services at the Mercado. These services also assist vendors at the Mercado send some of the profits that they make at the Mercado to family members or communities abroad. These remittances are often directed at families or [[hometown associations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sana|first=Mariano|title=Growth of Migrant Remittances from the United States to Mexico, 1990-2004|journal=Social Forces|date=March 2008|volume=86|issue=3|page=1001|doi=10.1353/sof.0.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural remittances at El Mercado ===
The Mercado de Los Angeles also facilitates opportunities to create [[cultural remittances]] for Latino migrants. The mercado offers international calling services and a [[travel agency]] that sells international plane tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/directory.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services aid the fluid migratory process that physically transports migrants from their countries of origin to the countries of current residence. Along with the physical transportation, the Mercado specializes in transculturated goods and items. Many of the stores specialize in traditional Mexican clothing, books, or films. Yet, these traditional items are presented in a transculturated context, outside of [[México]] or [[Latin America]]. The mercado becomes a transculturated site that participates in cultural remittance when it facilitates the physical circular migration of migrants returning to their home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flores|first=Juan|title=The Diaspora Strikes Back: Caribeño Tales of Learning and Turning|year=2008|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=0415952611|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants returning home bring cultural remittances to the land that they left, and El Mercado de Los Angeles is an important site of this cultural remittance process in Los Angeles.

== Semiotic meaning-making at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles actively produces and shapes culture through a variety of ways. Semiotics describes a series of processes in which meaning is given to the world around humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken|first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans interpret visual sensory clues about the world, meaning and culture are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken |first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the mercado, mariachi music and visual murals are two principal ways that semiotic processes produce culture.

=== Mariachi at El Mercado ===
The cultural significance of El Mercado is complemented by presence of semiotic cultural elements such as music and the murals present at El Mercado. Semiotics is a process through which visuals, sounds, and other sensory experiences are given meaning and made socially significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken|first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of semiotic meaning-making is present at the mercado, especially through the mariachi restaurants. The third floor of the mercado is composed of three restaurants that are well known for not only the food but the mariachi music that they all play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mariachi at El Mercado|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/mariachi-en.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=1 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolores Inés Casillas, a theorist who writes about cultural semiotics, considers listening to sound a political practice. She views nostalgic sounds from home countries as a means of remembering the home country while constructing space in the land of migration.&lt;ref name="Casillas 2010 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casillas|first=Dolores|chapter=¡Puuurrrooo MÉXICO!|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/6938122/Puuurrrooo_M%C3%89XICO_Listening_to_Transnationalism_on_U.S._Spanish-language_Radio|title=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America|editor1=Gina M. Perez|editor2=Frank A. Guridy|editor3=Adrian Burgos, Jr.|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of political listening supports the idea that El Mercado de Los Angeles is an active sight of cultural production through the visuals and music present at the mercado.

=== Murals at El Mercado ===
The Mercado de Los Angeles website also portrays some of the several [[murals]] that are present at this marketplace. The themed [[mariachi]] restaurants on the third floor provide a visual representation that constructs a cultural space in the heart of [[Los Angeles]]. From the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] inspired dining room to an [[Aztec]] themed dining room, the mercado provides many visions of a traditional ''México lindo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photo Gallery|url=http://www.elmercaditorestaurant.com/HTML/photo%20album/photo_album.html|publisher=El Mercadito Restaurant}}&lt;/ref&gt; These visual forms are not representations of transnational scenes, but of pastoral memories of historical scenes. These pastoral visuals represent an idealized and fond memory of areas throughout Latin America. This space provides meaningful space for the customers of El Mercado de Los Angeles and contributes to the semiotic construction of cultural hybrities at the mercado. The semiotic components of meaning-making affect the Mercado of Los Angeles as a site of economic and cultural significance.

[[Fair trade]] is where a farmer or craftsperson is paid a fair price for their product, one that represents its true worth, not just the lowest price that it is possible to pay. This is a price that covers the cost of production and enables the producer to live with dignity.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Fair Trade New Zealand is an organisation that was launched in 2005 which supports fair trade by ensuring that farmers and workers' rights are not exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/What-is-Fairtrade/Who-we-are "Who We Are"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Oxfam]] New Zealand, there are several companies to support fairly traded goods from, which are exported to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/what-we-do/issues/fair-trade "Fair trade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013-2014 there were 42 Fair Trade Licensees and Traders in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2013/14 Annual Report ''Fair Trade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015-2016 this number rose to 54 Fair Trade Licensees and Traders in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Fair Trade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gwen Green, Oxfam's Engagement Director, says: "when farmers are paid fairly for their products, we see people able to make real improvements to their lives and their communities. Producers who used to struggle to feed their families are able to give their children an education, and communities can build schools and develop businesses. It is one of the smart solutions to poverty".&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/news/kiwis-have-fairtrade-cuppa-give-farmers-fair-go "Kiwis have a Fairtrade cuppa to give farmers a fair go"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Wellington became the first fair trade capital city in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Wellington Fair Trade [https://www.wellingtonfairtrade.org.nz "Fair Trade City"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Whangarei was recognised by the Fair Trade Association of Australia New Zealand as being one of four fair trade councils in New Zealand, and the first fair trade district in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Lambly [http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/northland/91210547/whangarei-becomes-first-fair-trade-district-in-nz "Whangarei becomes first Fair Trade District in New Zealand"] (5 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fair trade and human rights==
[[International human rights law]] is founded on the idea that all human beings have the same set of fundamental rights.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran ''International Human Rights Law'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to equality and non-discrimination provides that human beings, regardless of their status or membership of a particular group, are entitled to the same set of rights.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moeckli, Sangeeta Shah and Sandesh Sivakumaran ''International Human Rights Law'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, United Kingdom, 2014) at 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted in 1948, includes in it protections against discrimination and slavery, and provides for the rights to freedom of association and to form and join trade unions, the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work, to protection against unemployment and the right to equal pay for equal work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justin Nolan and Simon Rice ''The International Law of Human Rights'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2011) at 554.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of equality is reflected in the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights'.

Freedom from slavery and compulsory labour is recognised in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom from slavery and the prohibition of the slave trade refers to the practice of treating human beings as property.&lt;ref&gt;Adam McBeth, Justin Nolan and Simon Rice ''The International Law of Human Rights'' (2nd ed, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 2011) at 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced or compulsory labour is also prohibited under article 8 of the Covenant, although it is subject to exceptions. That is, performance of labour as part of a prison sentence will not breach a state's obligations.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art 8(3)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; The right to employment with just and favourable conditions is recognised in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), and these conditions should provide workers with fair wages and equal pay for work of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand law and standards==
New Zealand law does not generally have extraterritorial effect. The extraterritorial application of human rights regimes can be defined as the existence of a legal obligation to respect rights.&lt;ref&gt;Marko Milanovic ''Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) at 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fair Trading Act 1986]] deals with misleading and deceptive conduct,&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trading Act 1986, s 9&lt;/ref&gt; and despite its title, has no direct legal connection with this particular aspect of fair trade in New Zealand. In New Zealand slavery and forced labour are criminalised. A person is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years who, within or outside New Zealand, sells and purchases, or in any way whatsoever deals with any person as a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1961, ss 98(1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery]] is prohibited by  the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]. Slavery is also not mentioned in the [[Human Rights Act 1993]]. There is currently no law that fair trade products need to be endorsed or supported through both private and public organisations in New Zealand.

==Fair trade labelling laws==
The [[Fairtrade Mark]] indicates that products purchased by consumers are supporting farmers and workers as they work to improve their livelihoods and provide better support to their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/What-is-Fairtrade/What-Fairtrade-does "What Fairtrade Does"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015-2016 79% of New Zealanders recognised the Fairtrade Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Fairtrade By The Numbers''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, recognition of the Fairtrade Mark in New Zealand reached 78% and measured at NZ$89 million.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Strengthening Regional Impact'', at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The total revenue for Fairtrade ANZ has increased by 29% in the 2016 Financial Year.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Australia and New Zealand 2015/16 Annual Report ''Strengthening Regional Impact'', at 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two recognised international fair trade systems - the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO) and [[Fairtrade Labelling Organisations International]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair trade label appears on product packaging and is a consumer guarantee which is awarded to specific products that have been traded according to the International Fair trade labelling standards.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Trade? He Tauhokohoko I Runga I Te Tika?'' (2nd ed, Global Education Centre, Wellington, New Zealand, 2008) at 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the WFTO certifies organisations as fair trade organisations - throughout their entire supply chain.

==Principles of fair trade==
The [[Fair Trade Federation]] is an organisation that recognises and upholds those principles to promote equity in international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Federation [http://www.fairtradefederation.org/fair-trade-federation-principles/ "Fair Trade Federation Principles"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation works with The [[World Fair Trade Organisation]] (WFTO) and subscribes to similar fair trade principles. The organisation has ten principles of fair trade which it follows. These principles listed below are sourced from the WFTO website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://wfto.com/fair-trade/10-principles-fair-trade "Ten Principles of Fair Trade"] (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
#	Opportunities for disadvantaged producers
#	Transparency and accountability
#	Fair trade practices
#	Fair payment
#	No child labour, no forced labour
#	No discrimination, gender equity, freedom of association
#	Good working conditions
#	Capacity building
#	Promote fair trade
#	Respect for the environment

==Fair trade suppliers==
Oxfam New Zealand works with suppliers that sell a range of fair trade products in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxfam New Zealand [https://www.oxfam.org.nz/what-we-do/issues/fair-trade/buy-fairtrade "Buy Fairtrade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Trade Aid, Whittaker's, All Good Bananas, and L'Affare are some suppliers that trade fair trade products.
* Trade Aid is New Zealand's oldest and largest fair trade organisation, which was established in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid New Zealand [https://www.tradeaid.org.nz/our-story/ "Our Story"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The original goal of Trade Aid is to "support the work of self-help organisations through long-term trading relationships based on transparency and fairness".&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid "How fair is fair?" ''Education Series 2''.&lt;/ref&gt; Each year Trade Aid allocates New Zealand Government aid monies - $220,000 in 2012-13 - to fund projects aimed at increasing sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid "Business Matters" ''Education Series 6''.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade Aid sources its products from more than 65 trading partner organisations who buy these products from small groups of farmers and artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Trade Aid New Zealand [https://www.tradeaid.org.nz/about-us/ "About Us"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Whittaker's]] have fair trade certification for two of their chocolate block products, the 5 Roll Refined Creamy Milk and 72% Dark Ghana. The cocoa beans for these blocks come from the Fair trade cooperative [[Kuapa Kokoo]] in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Australia New Zealand [http://fairtrade.org.nz/News/News/Archive/Whittakers-creamiest-block-cream-of-the-crop "Whittaker's Creamiest Block"] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Whittaker's buys all of its cocoa beans through the Ghana Cocoa Board. The Ghana Cocoa Board is the government organisation responsible for marketing the Ghanaian cocoa crop. The Ghana Cocoa Board, in partnership with other organisations, is committed to ensuring that the cocoa industry in Ghana is conducted in a socially responsible manner.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Cocoa Board [https://www.cocobod.gh "GCB"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Whittaker's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation, an organisation that support farmers and communities in cocoa-growing regions in several third world countries.&lt;ref&gt;World Cocoa Foundation [http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/about-wcf/history-mission/ "History and mission"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*All Good Bananas is a 100% New Zealand owned and operated company.&lt;ref&gt;All Good Organics [http://allgoodorganics.co.nz/fairtrade-bananas/ "Fairtrade Bananas"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first fair trade bananas import to New Zealand in 2010, $940,000 has been given back to the El Guabo community in fair trade premium funding.&lt;ref&gt;All Good Organics [http://allgoodorganics.co.nz/about "About"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;
*L'Affare is a coffee business that was established in Wellington, New Zealand in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;L'Affare [http://www.laffare.co.nz/about/ "About"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; L'Affare partners with Trade Aid which supports the imports of fair trade coffee from local communities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laffare.co.nz/coffee/fairtrade/ "Fair Trade and Sustainability"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universities==
There are two universities in New Zealand that have been recognised by the [[Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand]] as fair trade universities. In 2013 the [[University of Otago]] became the first New Zealand university to be granted fair trade accreditation, along with more than 100 universities around the world that have become fair trade institutions.&lt;ref&gt;University of Otago [http://www.otago.ac.nz/otagobulletin/news/otago057741.html "Otago Becomes New Zealand's First Fairtrade University"] (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Vice Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne says: "I am proud of the effort staff and students have gone to make this happen and look forward to a long and meaningful association with Fairtrade. We now have Fairtrade products available at all seven outlets on campus and 90 per cent of residential students have access to Fairtrade products in their colleges". In July 2017, the [[University of Canterbury]] was also granted fair trade accreditation, becoming the first entirely fair trade campus in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The fair trade criteria for accreditation is that 50 per cent of products should be fair trade, where that option is available.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The supporting of fair trade products at University of Canterbury means that the campus uses fair trade coffee, tea and hot drinking chocolate, as well as selling Trade Aid chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.sustain.canterbury.ac.nz/fairtrade/ "Fair Trade"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Chair of the UC Fair Trade Committee Dr John Hopkins stated "by the time we applied for accreditation, UC purchases for tea and coffee had reached 80 per cent, and are still rising". Professor Ian Wright from the University of Canterbury says: "our staff and students can be proud that their commitment will have far-reaching impacts, not only in raising awareness in the local community, but in directly benefiting producers, growers and workers in developing countries".&lt;ref&gt;University of Canterbury [http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news/2017/university-of-canterbury-recognised-as-a-fair-trade-university.html "Canterbury Recognised As A Fairtrade University"] (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fern sports''' are plants that show marked change from the normal type or parent stock as a result of mutation. The term [[Morphotype]] is also used for any of a group of different types of individuals of the same species in a population. Fern [[frond]]s in sports are typically altered in several ways, such as the frond apex divided and [[Pinnate|pinna]]e similarly duplicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardenseeker.com/roses/rose-plant-sports.htm Plants Sports] Retrieved : 2011-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The frond of a sport may be branched at the tip and at the tips of the pinna, the colour may vary, and variegation may occur; fronds generally remain bilaterally symmetrical. Ferns sports remain normal in certain respects, such as viability with [[Sorus|sori]] and [[Indusium|indusia]] appearing normal. The frond stipe may be a different colour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferns.rogergolding.co.uk/ferngenus/athyrium/filixfemina.html Male Fern] Retrieved : 2011-07-23&lt;/ref&gt;

;Misidentification
[[File:Fern sports - insect damage.jpg|200px|thumb|Typical asymmetric frond resulting from likely insect damage.]]
Galls on ferns and other physical damage to fern fronds can be mistaken as sports, however this is usually asymmetric, ferns generally being bilaterally symmetrical. In ''Athyrium'' and ''Dryopteris'' species white maggots of ''Chirosia betuleti'' create mop-head galls on fern frond tips that look somewhat like fern sports, however this is physical damage and not a growth form.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Page 288&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rarity==
Ferns sports particularly suffered during the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] [[Pteridomania]] ('Fern-Fever') [[Social mania|craze]], when over collecting of fern species included over collecting unusual fern varieties.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt;

[[File:Firdeusi Institute Logo.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Seal of Firdeusi Institute for Persian Studies]]

Firdeusi (eng: Ferdowsi) Institute for Iranian and Persian Studies is a non-for-profit and non-governmental organisation, which scientific and research activity is conducted autonomously, and is not based on political or religious matters. The Institute has been established in the form of “Center” (with no membership) by two founders: [[Marin Barleti University]] and Iranian Cultural Foundation “Saadi Shirazi” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.iranalbania.ir|title=Official web-site of Saadi Shirazi Cultural Foundation|work= iranalbania.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to the Cooperation agreement held in October 6, 2010. The ceremony of launching was held  on 29 October 2010, initiating the functioning of the first research institute for Persian studies in Albania, at University level.

The '''Institute name''' “Firdeusi” (eng: Ferdowsi) comes the greatest Persian poets, thinkers and writers, Abul-Kasim Hasan Pur-Ali Tusi Ferdowsi, known otherwise as the Father of the Iranology Studies worldwide. The choice came also as a tribute to the “Ferdowsi [[Shahnameh]] Millenium” proclaimed by [[UNESCO]]  in 2010.
The Institute Logo has been inspired by the poet’s name and is interwoven with calligraphy elements from the [[Persian language]]. Logo represents an open book, being a metaphor of the scientific character of the Institute.

==Persian studies in Albania==
Iranian studies in Albania although not academically pursued, have always enjoyed Albanian people interest. The diffusion of Persian literature and culture in Albania is closely linked with the presence of Ottoman Empire in Albania and with the heavy influence Persian culture exerted on the Ottoman administration and Turkish culture of the era. Another key factor in the popularisation of Persian culture among Albanians is the expansion of Islam in the territories lived in by Albanians during the 16th and 17th centuries. Meanwhile, during the 19th century, the Persian language was widely used among Albanian intellectuals.

Naim and Sami Frashëri were among the most prominent scholars of oriental and Iranian studies in Albania. Naim Frashëri published two books in Persian: the first, ''Grammar of the Persian Language'' was published in 1871, while the second one, a compilation of poems in Persian, ''Tehajjulat''" was published in 1885. These represented the cornerstone of Persian literature and culture in Albania.

Other personalities of Iranology in Albania include: Vexhi Buharaja, translator into Albanian language of many Persian books (such as “Gjylistani dhe Bostani” “3500 verses from Shahname”, etc.), [[Tahir Dizdari]], author of “Persian words in Albanian language”, Hafiz Ali Korca and Fan Noli, with his  translation of Omar Khajam’s famous “quatrains”, Dalan Shapllo, scholar, writer and translator of Hafiz Shirazi’s mystical poems and many more contemporaneous Albanian linguists, scholars and writers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4837">{{distinguish|text=[[Form of life]], a technical term in biology, although it bears what Wittgenstein calls a [[Family resemblance]] to the biological term}}
{{tone|date=March 2016}}
{{Wittgenstein|Later}}
'''Form of life''' ({{lang-de|Lebensform}}) is a technical term used by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and others in the [[continental philosophy]] and [[philosophy of science]] traditions. Wittgenstein himself used the term consistently in his works ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' and ''[[On Certainty]]'', but other writers have sometimes used it in very different and often mutually incompatible ways.

==Description==
Comments about a form of life are not explanations meant to comprehend the concept as a whole. The view that stringing together simple, non-controversial statements of ordinary understanding will illuminate something that is supposedly already understood is, in Wittgenstein's view, quite nonsensical. The concept of 'form of life' itself, for example, is extremely difficult to get right, as is indicated by the widely divergent things that have been said about it since Wittgenstein introduced it in the books cited above.

In response to a question from an imagined interlocutor, Wittgenstein notes the following:

: "So you are saying that human agreement decides what is false and what is true?" – It is what human beings ''say'' that is false and true; and they agree in the ''language'' they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life. (Wittgenstein, ''Philosophical Investigations'', para. 241 [emphasis not in original])

Ordinarily, humans do not step away from their activities in order to justify how or why they say and do what they say and do. However, their activities, when investigated in an historical way, will be found to reflect a particular form of life.

When such questions do arise, a philosophical investigation will involve reminding the questioner of certain things he or she takes for granted and which, when noted, can help dissolve the question. We do what we do because we assume a given form of life, which gives our actions, ourselves, and the world meaning. Form of life is what makes meaning itself possible.

==Use by Agamben==
Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] takes up the intersecting concepts of form-of-life, rule-following and use, but besides attempting to deconstruct what Wittgenstein meant, traces these concepts genealogically, in the manner of Stirner or Rousseau. In ''The Highest Poverty – Monastic Rules and Form-of-Life'', Agamben looks at the emerging genre of written rules starting in the 9th century, and its development into both law and something beyond law in the Franciscan form-of-life, in which the Franciscans replaced the idea that we possess our life (or objects generally) with the concept of 'usus', that is 'use'. Agamben finds earlier versions of form-of-life in monastic rules, developing from 'vita vel regula', 'regula et vita', 'forma vivendi', and 'forma vitae'. Thus Agamben takes Wittgenstein's concepts and applies them to the history of Western monasticism in order to rethink the consequences of these concepts for doing (contemporary) politics — the main goal of his ''Homo Sacer''-project, which started with ''[[Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life]]'' and to which ''The Highest Poverty'' belongs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">[[File:Hamburger Druckschrift ab 2011.jpg|thumb|Hamburg's block letters]]

'''Grundschrift''' (''base [[font]]'', literally ''ground script'') is a simplified form of [[handwriting]] adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools, and it is currently endorsed by the German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian - [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

If nationally adopted, it would replace the three different German [[cursive]]s currently being taught in schools: the [[:de:Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift]] (introduced in 1953), the [[:de:Schulausgangsschrift|Schulausgangsschrift]] (1968), and the [[:de:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift]] (1969), providing a standardized system of handwriting in German school systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de Grundschrift - Schreibschrift: Verlust oder Gewinn?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grundschrift letters are written separately as [[block letters]] as opposed to cursive script, in which letters are conjoined together in a flowing motion.

== Reception ==
One of the most important critics of the Grundschrift is Ute Andresen. The former president of the German Society for Reading and Writing (1999 to 2002) argues that "children can not teach themselves to write."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/reform-der-lehrplaene-die-schreibschrift-stirbt-aus-12932933.html - Schreibschrift stirbt aus]&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of the basic inscription would mean abolishing cursive handwriting. This is "putting a cultural technique at risk, the ability to write a common readable font ". Andresen contradicts in the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] interview the statement of the Grundschulverband that the Grundschrift is a connected spelling. "That's wrong. The basic inscription is a modular font, which means the letters are juxtaposed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://handschriftlich.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/kinder-konnen-sich-das-schreiben-nicht-selbst-beibringen/ - Kinder können sich das Schreiben nicht selbst beibringen]&lt;/ref&gt; Andresen is et al. supported by the writer Cornelia Funke. "To master a non-cursive handwriting does not suffice as a script, in my opinion. It does not flow like cursive and is therefore much slower. A flowing script, on the other hand, promotes the flow of thought - and at the same time is so individual that one is completely at one's own."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/cornelia-funke-die-handschrift-soll-gedanken-fliegen-lassen-12933060.html - Die Handschrift soll Gedanken fliegen lassen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles for the taz, Andresen already pointed out that learning a bound script is a fundamental learning process for every child.  Failing to learn a script increases the risk of bad education. In this way, it occupies the position of Wilhelm Topsch against the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}}. The Oldenburger education scientist has proven in 1996 that there were no other scientific reports for the introduction of these in the 1970s than those of their inventor Heinrich Grünewald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/zurueck-zur-guten-handschrift/ - Zurück zur guten Handschrift]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/gutachter-lobbyisten-und-autoren/ - Gutachter, Lobbyisten und Autoren]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Topsch: Das Ende einer Legende.

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandated by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) standard 24 CFR Part 1330 (a) (4),  '''Lead-Safe Work Practices''' provide those performing remodeling tasks in homes built before 1978 with guidelines on procedures they should be using to prevent creating a [[lead]] hazard.

[[Lead poisoning]] remains a major environmental health concern, and while we most often associate the disease with childhood, high levels of lead exposure are linked to serious adult health conditions, such as high blood pressure and dementia.

Workers who remodel or renovate older homes where the likelihood of [[lead paint]] is high are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure. Their work creates contaminated dust which they then inhale. They can also put their families at risk by bringing contaminated dust home on their work clothes.

The [[National Safety Council]] emphasizes that everyone should be aware of the potential presence of lead paint in homes built prior to 1978, and notes that…”such awareness is particularly important for those engaged in the building trades, as well as [[DIY|do-it-yourselfers]], to learn how to perform their work in a lead-safe manner.”

Effective April 22, 2010, under its Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Rule, the EPA mandates that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in pre-1978 homes, child care facilities, and schools be certified by the EPA and that they use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices. Individuals can become certified renovators by taking an approved training course.

Anyone performing RRP projects in pre-1978 homes and child-occupied facilities, must learn how to use lead-safe work practices and follow these three simple procedures:

*Contain the work area.
*Minimize dust.
*Clean up thoroughly.

'''Markovian discrimination''' in spam filtering is a method used in [[CRM114 (program)|CRM114]] and other spam filters to model the statistical behaviors of spam and nonspam more accurately than in simple [[Bayesian spam filtering|Bayesian methods]].  A simple Bayesian model of written text contains only the dictionary of legal words and their relative probabilities.  A Markovian model adds the relative transition probabilities that given one word, predict what the next word will be. It is based on the theory of [[Markov chain]]s by [[Andrey Markov]], hence the name.  In essence, a Bayesian filter works on single words alone, while a Markovian filter works on phrases or entire sentences.

There are two types of [[Markov models]]; the visible Markov model, and the [[hidden Markov model]] or HMM.
The difference is that with a visible Markov model, the current word is considered to contain the entire state of the language model, while a hidden Markov model hides the state and presumes only that the current word is probabilistically related to the actual internal state of the language.

For example, in a visible Markov model the word "the" should predict with accuracy the following word, while in
a hidden Markov model, the entire prior text implies the actual state and predicts the following words, but does
not actually guarantee that state or prediction.  Since the latter case is what's encountered in spam filtering,
hidden Markov models are almost always used.  In particular, because of storage limitations, the specific type
of hidden Markov model called a [[Markov random field]] is particularly applicable, usually with a clique size of
between four and six tokens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3332">'''Martin Anstey''' was a [[Chronology of the Bible|Bible Chronologer]] significant for his contribution to [[Biblical Literalism]] for successfully resolving the apparent time gaps contained within the Bible's internal chronology. In 1913 Anstey's thesis, 'The Romance of Bible Chronology' was published, explaining how subtle pieces of information within the Bible text resolve these apparent chronological gaps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preteristarchive.com/Books/1913_anstey_romance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the brother of [[John Anstey]] and also a keen 'Anstey' genealogist, mapping many of the early branches of the Devon Ansteys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=ANSTEY: Our True Surname Origin and Shared Medieval Ancestry|last=Anstey|first=G.M. and T.J.|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== The Romance of Bible Chronology ==
Anstey identified five apparent chronological gaps within the Bible text, that had been attempted to be resolved with varying degrees of success by previous Bible chronologers.

The five apparent chronological gaps that Anstey identified were:

1. The Noah-Shem connection, which determines the exact age of [[Noah]] at the birth of Shem, (which Anstey calculated to be 502 years).

2. The Terah-Abraham connection, which determines the exact age of Terah at the birth of [[Abraham]], (which Anstey calculated to be 130 years).

3. The Joseph-Moses connection, which determines the exact number of years which elapsed between the death of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], with which the Chronology of the book of Genesis ends (Gen. 50:26), and the birth of [[Moses]], with which the Chronology of the book of Exodus begins (Exodus 7:7), (which Anstey calculated to be 64 years).

4. The Joshua-Judges connection, which determines the number of years that elapsed during the administration of [[Joshua]] and the Elders that survived him, between the division of the land at the end of the Seven Years' War of Conquest, with which the Chronology of the Book of Joshua ends (Joshua 14:7,10 with Numbers 10:11,12; 13:17,20), and the oppression of Cushan-Rishathaim of Mesopotamia, with which the Chronology of the Book of Judges begins (Judges 3:8), (which Anstey calculated to be 13 years).

5. The Eli-Saul connection, which determines the number of years that elapsed between the death of Eli and the beginning of the reign of Saul, (which Anstey calculated to be 20 years). This is given in the summary of I Samuel 7:2.

== Contribution to Biblical Literalism ==
Having resolved the apparent chronological gaps in the Bible text, Anstey was able to argue that the Bible provided a coherent yet select historical record of human civilization. Anstey's thesis also critiqued other chronological records for their chronological errors compared to the Bible text. While archaeological discoveries during the twentieth and twenty-first century have in some instances dated the arguments and data presented in Anstey's thesis, his original chronological calculations and observations remain accurate.

A '''mechanical powder press''' is a [[machine press]] designed to compress powders, commonly used in the [[Ceramic forming techniques#Technical ceramics|production of technical ceramics]].

==Function-Principles of mechanical presses in the field of Technical Ceramics==
The function principles of the mechanic press machines differ in how to ensure the upper punch–main movement by cams, spindles-and friction drives, [[Eccentric (mechanism)| eccentric]], knuckle-joints or by the round table principle, independent if the die-or lower punch movement is realized by cams- or eccentric systems or other mechanically or hydraulically combined systems.
The executions of auxiliary movements are also not decisive for a term-classification.
These auxiliary movements can also base on pneumatic and hydraulic principles.
In comparison to hydraulic press machines the maximum compaction forces of mechanical [[Powder metallurgy | powder presses]] are limited and are placed in the range &lt;/= 5000 kN.
For the requirements of wet-and dry pressing techniques in the field of Technical Ceramics cams-, eccentric-, knuckle joint- as well as round table presses have proved and tested, whereas cam-presses especially used for wet-press-techniques of pourable materials.
The range of compaction force of mechanical presses for products of the Technical Ceramics is
&lt; 2500 kN, what is caused from the less density of the ceramic materials.
Normally the upper punch-, lower punch- and die systems of mechanical presses don’t work on base of multi-subdivided punches.

==Application-Advantages in the field of Technical Ceramics==
Adaptable cam-executions, which can be made suitable individually to the concerned products, will meet especially the requirements of wet-press-technique of pourable compounds, while applications of eccentric-, knuckle-joint and round table presses are particularly related on the dry-press-technique of compounds with gliding characteristics.
The sinusoidal movement of eccentric presses offers advantages especially for bigger strokes &lt; 100 strokes per minute and the distorted sinusoidal movement of the knuckle joint is especially used for products, which need a longer time for deairing in the phase of compaction and a longer time for decompression after the bottom dead centre.
For this kind of compaction technology the strokes are limited &lt; 35 strokes per minute, but in contrast to that the compaction speed of round table presses for small and simple shaped products are especially high and quantities &lt; 30,000 pcs per minute can be realized.

==Context between ceramic compaction technology and design principles of the mechanical presses==
The unit of product–technology–press machine / tooling is characterizing the context between the ceramic compaction technology and the design principles of the mechanical presses.
Distinctions of the die- withdrawal- and the ejection technology of the uniaxial dry- and wet-press- technique in the technical ceramics influence the approachable quality of the compactions in depending of the geometric shape of the products and in depending of the selected type of press.
Because the achievement of a speed-proportional compaction relation with pure mechanical presses is very difficult to realize and high mechanical investments are necessary, more and more combined mechanic-hydraulic function principles on base of subdivided punches will win a higher signification, because the requirements of the high-accuracy-pressing can be met better.
The design principles of particularly mechanical powder presses, explained in a [http://www.fromos.de/en/cooperation-china/dissertation-mechanical-presses.html dissertation of Dr.B.Froherz] offer some base confrontation of advantages and disadvantages related to technology and presses especially for tool designers.

[[File:1600 Himmelsscheibe von Nebra sky disk anagoria.jpg|thumb|Another photograph, at the [[Pergamon Museum]] ]]

The '''Nebra sky disk''' is a [[bronze]] disk of around {{convert|30|cm|in|sp=us}} diameter and a weight of {{convert|2.2|kg|lb}}, with a blue-green [[patina]] and inlaid with gold symbols. These are interpreted generally as a sun or full moon, a lunar crescent, and stars (including a cluster interpreted as the [[Pleiades]]). Two golden arcs along the sides, marking the angle between the [[solstice]]s, were added later. A final addition was another arc at the bottom surrounded with multiple strokes (of uncertain meaning, variously interpreted as a [[Solar Deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|Solar Barge]] with numerous oars, as the [[Milky Way]], or as a [[rainbow]]).

The disk is attributed to a site near [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], in Germany, and [[Archaeological association|associatively]] [[Chronological dating|dated]] to {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1600 BC. It has been associated with the [[European Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] [[Unetice culture]].

The style in which the disk is executed was unlike any artistic style then known from the period, with the result the object was initially suspected of being a [[forgery]], but it is now widely accepted as authentic.

The Nebra sky disk features the oldest concrete depiction of the [[cosmos]] yet known from anywhere in the world. In June 2013 it was included in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] and termed "one of the most important archaeological finds of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-6/nebra-sky-disc/ | work=Unesco memory of the World  | title=Nebra Sky Disc | date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The disk, two bronze swords, two hatchets, a chisel, and fragments of spiral bracelets were discovered in 1999 by Henry Westphal and Mario Renner while they were treasure-hunting with a metal detector. Archaeological artifacts are the property of the state in Saxony-Anhalt. The hunters were operating without a license and knew their activity constituted looting and was illegal. They damaged the disk with their spade and destroyed parts of the site. The next day, Westphal and Renner sold the entire hoard for 31,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] to a dealer in [[Cologne]]. The hoard changed hands within Germany over the next two years, being sold for up to a million&amp;nbsp;DM. By 2001 knowledge of its existence had become public. In February 2002 the state archaeologist Harald Meller acquired the disk in a police-led sting operation in [[Basel]] from a couple who had put it on the black market for 700,000&amp;nbsp;DM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meller, H.|date=January 2004|title=Star search|journal=National Geographic|pages=76–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original finders were eventually traced. In a plea bargain, they led police and archaeologists to the discovery site. Archaeologists opened a dig at the site and uncovered evidence that supports the looters' claims. There are traces of bronze artifacts in the ground, and the soil at the site matches soil samples found clinging to the artifacts. The disk and its accompanying finds are now held at the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory|State Museum of Prehistory]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

The two looters received sentences of four months and ten months, respectively, from a [[Naumburg]] court in September 2003. They appealed, but the appeals court raised their sentences to six and twelve months, respectively.

The discovery site is a [[prehistoric enclosure]] encircling the top of a {{convert|252|m}} elevation in the [[Ziegelroda Forest]], known as ''Mittelberg'' ("central hill"), some 60&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Leipzig]]. The surrounding area is known to have been settled in the [[Neolithic]] era, and Ziegelroda Forest contains approximately 1,000 [[tumulus|barrows]].

The enclosure is oriented in such a way that the sun seems to set every [[solstice]] behind the [[Brocken]], the highest peak of the [[Harz]] mountains, some 80&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west. The treasure-hunters claimed the artifacts were discovered within a pit inside the bank-and-ditch enclosure.

==Dating==
[[Image:Nebra Schwerter.jpg|thumb|The [[Bronze Age sword|swords]] found with the disk]]
[[Image:Nebra Hort.jpg|thumb|Other associated finds: chisel, axeheads, bracelets]]
The precise [[Chronological dating|dating]] of the Nebra sky disk depended upon the dating of a number of Bronze Age weapons, which were offered for sale with the disk and said to be from the same site. These axes and swords can be dated typologically to the mid 2nd millennium BC. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of a birchbark particle found on one of the swords to between 1600 and 1560 BC confirmed this estimate. This corresponds to the date of burial, at which time the disk had likely been in existence for several generations.

==Origin of the metals==
According to an initial analysis of trace elements by [[x-ray fluorescence]] by E. Pernicka, then at the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|University of Freiberg]], the copper originated at [[Bischofshofen]] in Austria, while the [[gold]] was thought to be from the [[Carpathian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Pernicka, E.|author2= Wunderlich, C-H.|last-author-amp= yes|title=Naturwissenschaftliche Untersuchungen an den Funden von Nebra|journal=Archäologie in Sachsen-Anhalt|volume=1/02|pages=24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent analysis found that the gold used in the first phase was from the [[river Carnon]] in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Ehser&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ehser|first=Anja |first2=Gregor|last2=Borg |first3=Ernst|last3=Pernicka |title=Provenance of the gold of the Early Bronze Age Nebra Sky Disk, central Germany: geochemical characterization of natural gold from Cornwall|journal=European Journal of Mineralogy|date=2011|volume=23|issue=6|pages=895–910|doi=10.1127/0935-1221/2011/0023-2140|url=http://eurjmin.geoscienceworld.org/content/23/6/895.short|accessdate=12 November 2013|bibcode=2011EJMin..23..895E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tin present in the bronze was also of Cornish origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4754.2010.00515.x | volume=52 | title=Tin isotopy: a new method for solving old questions | year=2010 | journal=Archaeometry | pages=816–832 | last1 = Haustein | first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The disk as preserved was developed in four stages (Meller 2004):
# Initially the disk had thirty-two small round gold circles, a large circular plate, and a large crescent-shaped plate attached. The circular plate is interpreted as either the [[Sun]] or the [[full Moon]], the crescent shape as the [[Lunar phase|crescent Moon]] (or either the Sun or the Moon undergoing [[eclipse]]), and the dots as [[star]]s, with the cluster of seven dots likely representing the [[Pleiades]].
# At some later date, two arcs (constructed from gold of a different origin, as shown by its chemical impurities) were added at opposite edges of the disk. To make space for these arcs, one small circle was moved from the left side toward the center of the disk and two of the circles on the right were covered over, so that thirty remain visible. The two arcs span an angle of 82°, correctly indicating the angle between the positions of sunset at summer and winter [[solstice]] at the latitude of the Mittelberg (51°N)&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lost Treasures; Civilization's Great Riches Rediscovered | publisher=Carlton Books | author=McIntosh, Jane | year=2010 | location=London | pages=16 | isbn=9781847322999}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Given that the arcs relate to solar phenomena, it is likely the circular plate represents the Sun not the Moon.
# The final addition was another arc at the bottom, the "[[solar barge|sun boat]]", again made of gold from a different origin.
# By the time the disk was buried it also had thirty-nine holes punched out around its perimeter, each approximately 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Significance==
The disk may be an [[archaeoastronomy|astronomical]] instrument as well as an item of [[prehistoric religion|religious]] significance. The blue-green patina of the bronze may have been an intentional part of the original artifact.&lt;ref name=meller2002&gt;{{cite journal|author=Meller, H|date=2002|title=Die Himmelsscheibe von Nebra – ein frühbronzezeitlicher Fund von außergewohnlicher Bedeutung|journal=Archäeologie in Sachsen-Anhalt|volume=1/02|pages=7–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The find is regarded as reconfirming that the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the people of the [[European Bronze Age]] included close observation of the yearly course of the [[Sun]], and the angle between its rising and setting points at the summer and winter [[solstice]]s. While much older [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] and [[megalithic]] [[astronomical complex]]es such as the [[Goseck circle]] and [[Stonehenge]] had already been used to mark the solstices, the disk is the oldest known "portable instrument" to allow such measurements. Pásztor, however, sees no evidence that the disk was a practical device for solar measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Emilia | last = Pásztor | author-link = | editor-last = Ruggles | editor-first = Clive L. N. | chapter = Nebra Disk | title = Handbook of Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy | date = 2015 | pages = 1349–1356 | place = New York | publisher = Springer Science+Business Media | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4614-6141-8_128 | isbn = 978-1-4614-6140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euan MacKie]] suggests that the Nebra disk may be linked to the solar calendar reconstructed by [[Alexander Thom]] from his analysis of standing stone alignments in Britain.&lt;ref name="MacKie2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=MacKie, E|date=2006|chapter=New evidence for a professional priesthood in the European Early Bronze Age?|title=Viewing the Sky Through Past and Present Cultures: Selected Papers from the Oxford VII International Conference on Archaeoastronomy|editor=Todd W. Bostwick|editor2=Bryan Bates|series= [[Pueblo Grande Ruin and Irrigation Sites|Pueblo Grande Museum]] Anthropological Papers |volume=15|publisher=City of Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department|pages=343–362|isbn=1-882572-38-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
There were initial suspicions that the disk might be an [[archaeological forgery]]. Peter Schauer of the University of Regensburg, Germany, argued in 2005 that the Nebra disk was a fake and that he could prove that the patina of the disk could have been created with urine, hydrochloric acid and a blow torch within a short amount of time. He had to admit in court that he had never held the disk in his own hands, unlike eighteen scientists who had actually examined the disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/RubCD175863466D41BB9A6A93D460B81174/Doc~E4115FE522E3C4CDD89890E5C3B4A9106~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Himmelsscheibe von Nebra - Eine Komödie der Irrungen|date=March 17, 2005|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |language=German|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Harrison, professor of European prehistory at the [[University of Bristol]] and an expert on the [[Beaker people]], allowed his initial reaction to be quoted in a [[BBC]] documentary:&lt;ref name=BBC2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2004/stardisctrans.shtml|title=BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Secrets of the Star Disc|date=2004|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"When I first heard about the Nebra Disc I thought it was a joke, indeed I thought it was a forgery. Because it’s such an extraordinary piece that it wouldn’t surprise any of us that a clever forger had cooked this up in a backroom and sold it for a lot of money."
Although Harrison had not seen the skydisk when he was interviewed, his skepticism was reasonable at that point, but the disk is widely accepted now as authentic and is dated to roughly 1600 BC on grounds of typological classification of the associated finds.
As the item was not excavated using archaeological methods, even its claimed provenance could have been fictitious - hence its authentication has depended on microphotography of corrosion crystals,&lt;ref name=BBC2008 /&gt; which has produced images of structures that could not be reproduced by a faker.
[[Image:SkyDiscVisitorsCentre.JPG|thumb|The Sky Disc Visitor Center near Nebra]]

Harald Meller, lecturing to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in April 2008, gave a list of facts supporting the authenticity of the disc, and for its having been found at the site on the Mittelberg. The most persuasive of the latter was the discovery by the archaeologists — in the pit in which the looters said they had found the metalwork — of a fragment of gold leaf exactly fitting the gap present in the gold leaf covering of the 'sun' symbol when it was originally recovered.

==Exhibition==
The disk was the center of an exhibition entitled ''Der geschmiedete Himmel'' (German "The [[smithing|smithied]] sky"), showing 1,600 Bronze Age artifacts, including the [[Trundholm sun chariot]], shown at [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] from 15 October 2004 to 22 May 2005, from 1 July to 22 October 2005 in [[Copenhagen]], from 9 November 2005 to 5 February 2006 in [[Vienna]], from 10 March to 16 July 2006 in [[Mannheim]], and from 29 September 2006 to 25 February 2007 in [[Basel]].

On 20 June 2007 a multimedia visitor center was opened near the discovery site at Nebra.

The disk is part of the permanent exhibition in the [[Halle State Museum of Prehistory|Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte (State Museum of Prehistory)]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

==Legal issues==
The [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] has registered the disk as a [[trademark]], which has resulted in two lawsuits. In 2003, Saxony-Anhalt successfully sued the city of [[Querfurt]] for depicting the disk design on souvenirs. Saxony-Anhalt also successfully sued the publishing houses [[Piper Verlag|Piper]] and Heyne over an abstracted depiction of the disk on book covers.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelsscheibe von Nebra {{cite web |url=http://www.kalkriese.de/Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719051336/http://www.kalkriese.de/Himmelsscheibe_von_Nebra.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magdeburg]] court assessed the case's relevance according to [[German copyright law]]. The defenders argued that as a cultic object, the disk had already been "published" in the Bronze Age, and that consequently, all protection of [[intellectual property]] associated with it has long expired. The plaintiff on the other hand, argued that the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the disk is recent, and according to German law protected for 25 years, until 2027. Another argument concerned the question whether a notable work of art may be registered as a trademark in the first place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">{{use dmy dates|date=May 2016}} The '''Organ Reform Movement''' or '''''Orgelbewegung''''' (also called the '''Organ Revival Movement)''' was a mid-20th-century trend in [[pipe organ]] building, originating in Germany. The movement was influential in the United States in the 1930s through 1970s, and began to wane in the 1980s. It arose with early interest in [[historical performance]] and was strongly influenced by [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s championing of historical instruments by [[Gottfried Silbermann]] and others, as well as by Schweitzer's declaration that the criterion for judging an organ is its fitness to perform with clarity the polyphonic [[Baroque]] music of [[J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). Concert organist [[E. Power Biggs]] was a leading popularizer of the movement in the United States, through his many recordings and radio broadcasts. The movement ultimately went beyond the "Neo-Baroque" copying of old instruments to endorse a new philosophy of [[organ building]], "more Neo than Baroque".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZL4IAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PA56 |title=Deutsche und französische Orgelbaukunst und Orgelkunst |year=1906 |first=Albert |last=Schweitzer |publisher=Breitkopf &amp; Härtel |language=German |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phelps&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence I. |last=Phelps |title=A Short History of the Organ Revival |journal=Church Music |publisher=Concordia |url=http://LawrencePhelps.com/Documents/Articles/Phelps/ashorthistory.shtml |date=Spring 1967 |volume=67 |issue=1 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ambrosino&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Ambrosino |title=Present Imperfect |journal=The Tracker |publisher=Organ Historical Society |url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2384349/ambrosino/words-writings.html |date=Spring 1999 |volume=43 |issue=2 |accessdate=23 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304065215/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2384349/ambrosino/words-writings.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosales.com/instruments/op11/ |title=Rosales Opus 11: The Trinity Cathedral Organ |first=Barbara |last=Owen |publisher=Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (Portland, Oregon) |date=1987 |accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement arose in opposition to the excesses of [[symphonic organ]] building, and eventually symphonic organs regained popularity after the reform movement brought excesses of its own.

The Organ Reform Movement sought to turn away from many of the perceived excesses of [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll|Romantic]] or [[Symphonic organ]] building and repertoire, in favor of organs understood to be more similar to those of the Baroque Era in Northern Germany, especially those built by [[Arp Schnitger]]. This took the form of a "vertical" style of [[registration (organ)|tonal registration]] in which ensembles were ideally built up with no pitch being duplicated in the same octave, and then the ensembles were crowned with high-pitched [[Mixture (music)|mixture stops]]. The movement endorsed the so-called ''Werkprinzip'', in which each division of the instrument's pipework was based on a [[Flue pipe#Diapasons|principal]]-scale rank of a different octave.&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

Organ voicers strove for an articulate pipe speech characterized by a short burst of "chiff" sound at the start of each note, and avoided "nicking" the pipe edges and other techniques of achieving symphonic-style "smoothness". Low wind pressures were revived. Casework was sometimes eschewed in favor of open standing pipework, and shuttered [[Expression pedal|swell boxes]] became less common.&lt;ref name=Ambrosino/&gt;

In Europe the movement was indelibly connected with [[tracker action]] (mechanical instruments). In North America this was not the case, and many US and Canadian instruments characteristic of the Organ Reform Movement had [[electro-pneumatic]] or [[direct electric action]].&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

Some of the leading organ-builders of the movement were:&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;
* (in Northern Europe) [[Rudolf von Beckerath]], [[Dirk Andries Flentrop]], [[Frobenius Orgelbyggeri]], [[Marcussen &amp; Søn]];

== Reversals ==
A common criticism of the Organ Reform Movement was that its principles were often taken to extremes that became more dogmatic than musical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles |last=Hendrickson |title=Nicking |journal=The American Organist |publisher=American Guild of Organists |url=http://www.enchamade.com/hendricksonorgan/wb/pages/articles/nicking.php |date=1976 |volume=10 |issue= |accessdate=9 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024634/http://www.enchamade.com/hendricksonorgan/wb/pages/articles/nicking.php |archivedate=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ruining many fine symphonic organs and disappointing many listeners.&lt;ref name=Gerber/&gt; Some of the alterations that the movement executed on pre-movement instruments have since been reversed to support a wider range of repertoire, such as on the notable pipe organs of [[Auckland Town Hall#Organ|Auckland Town Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restored Auckland Town Hall organ ready to sing|date=7 March 2010|journal=City Scene|publisher=[[Auckland City Council]]|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University Chapel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mander-organs.com/princeton-university-chapel/|title=Princeton University Chapel|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Mander Organs|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chicago's [[Rockefeller Chapel]].&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Gerber |first=James |date=May 2012 |title=Ernest M.

The '''performance gap''' is a term commonly used to denote the disparity that is found between the energy use predicted and carbon emissions in the design stage of buildings and the energy use of those buildings in operation. Research in the UK suggests that actual carbon emissions from new homes can be 2.5 times the design estimates, on average.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J; Godoy-Shimizu, D; Tilson, A; Mawditt, I. 2016. Building Performance Evaluation Programme: Findings from domestic projects - Making reality match design. London: Innovate UK. Page 18&lt;/ref&gt; For non-domestic buildings, the gap is even higher - actual carbon emissions as much as 3.8 times the design estimates, on average.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, J; Terry, N; Armitage, P. 2016. Building Performance Evaluation Programme: Findings from non-domestic projects - Getting the best from buildings. London: Innovate UK. Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

There are established tools for reducing the performance gap, by reviewing project objectives, outline and detailed design drawings, design calculations, implementation of designs on site, and post-occupancy evaluation. NEF's Assured Performance Process (APP) is one such tool, which is being used extensively on different sites that form part of East Hampshire's Whitehill and Bordon new town development, one of the largest regeneration projects anywhere in the UK, with high ambitions for both environmental performance and health.

==Classification of factors that contribute to the performance gap==
The performance gap is produced mainly due to uncertainties. Uncertainties are found in any “real-world” system, and buildings are no exception. As early as 1978, Gero and Dudnik wrote a paper presenting a methodology to solve the problem of designing subsystems ([[HVAC]]) subjected to uncertain demands. After that, other authors have shown an interest in the uncertainties that are present in building design; Ramallo-González classified uncertainties in building design/construction in three different groups:&lt;ref&gt;Ramallo-González, A.P. 2013. Modelling Simulation and Optimisation of Low-energy Buildings. PhD. University of Exeter.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Environmental. Uncertainty in weather prediction under changing climate; and uncertain weather data information due to the use of synthetic weather data files: (1) use of synthetic years that do not represent a real year, and (2) use of a synthetic year that has not been generated from recorded data in the exact location of the project but in the closest weather station.

Differences between the design and the real building: Conductivity of [[thermal bridges]], conductivity of [[insulator (electricity)|insulation]], value of infiltration or U-Values of walls and windows.

===Type 1: Environmental uncertainties===
The type 1 from this grouping, have been divided here into two main groups: one concerning the uncertainty due to climate change; and the other concerning uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files. Concerning the uncertainties due to climate change: buildings have long life spans, for example, in England and Wales, around 40% of the office blocks existing in 2004 were built before 1940 (30% if considered by floor area).&lt;ref&gt;ODPM, 2005. Age of Commercial and Industrial Stock: Local Authority Level 2004. London: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;/ref&gt; and, 38.9% of English dwellings in 2007 were built before 1944.&lt;ref&gt;CLG, 2007. English House Condition Survey 2007, Annual report. Communities and Local Government&lt;/ref&gt; This long life span makes buildings likely to operate with climates that might change due to global warming. De Wilde and Coley showed how important is to design buildings that take into consideration climate change and that are able to perform well in future weathers.&lt;ref&gt;de Wilde, P. &amp; Coley, D., 2012. The implications of a changing climate for buildings. Building and Environment, 55, pp.1-7&lt;/ref&gt;
Concerning the uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files: Wang et al. showed the impact that uncertainties in weather data (among others) may cause in energy demand calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, L., Mathew, P. &amp; Pang, X., 2012. Uncertainties in energy consumption introduced by building operations and weather for a medium-size office building. Energy and Buildings, 53, pp.152-158&lt;/ref&gt; The deviation in calculated energy use due to variability in the weather data were found to be different in different locations from a range of (-0.5% – 3%) in San Francisco to a range of (-4% to 6%) in Washington D.C. The ranges were calculated using TMY  as the reference. These deviations on the demand were smaller than the ones due to operational parameters. For those, the ranges were (-29% – 79%) for San Francisco and (-28% – 57%) for Washington D.C. The operation parameters were those linked with occupants’ behaviour. The conclusion of this paper is that occupants will have a larger impact in energy calculations than the variability between synthetically generated weather data files.
The spatial resolution of weather data files was the concern covered by Eames et al.&lt;ref&gt;Eames, M., Kershaw, T. &amp; Coley, D., 2011. The appropriate spatial resolution of future weather files for building simulation. Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 5, pp.1-12&lt;/ref&gt; Eames showed how a low spatial resolution of weather data files can be the cause of disparities of up to 40% in the heating demand.

===Type 2: Workmanship===
In the work of Pettersen, uncertainties of group 2 (workmanship and quality of elements) and group 3 (behaviour) of the previous grouping were considered (Pettersen, 1994).  This work shows how important occupants’ behaviour is on the calculation of the energy demand of a building. Pettersen showed that the total energy use follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when the uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and of around 4.0% when considering those generated by the properties of the building elements. 
A large study was carried out by Leeds Metropolitan at Stamford Brook. This project saw 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield, J., Bell, M., Miles-Shenton, D., South, T. &amp; Lowe, B., 2011. Evaluating the impact of an enhanced energy performance standard on load-bearing masonry domestic construction, Understanding the gap between designed and real performance: Lessons from Stamford Brook. London: Department for Communities and Local Government&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this project show a significant gap between the energy used expected before construction and the actual energy use once the house is occupied. The workmanship is analysed in this work. The authors emphasise the importance of thermal bridges that were not considered for the calculations, and how those originated by the internal partitions that separate dwellings have the largest impact on the final energy use. The dwellings that were monitored in use in this study show a large difference between the real energy use and that estimated using SAP, with one of them giving +176% of the expected value when in use.

Hopfe has published several papers concerning uncertainties in building design that cover workmanship. A more recent publication at the time of writing &lt;ref&gt;Hopfe, C.J. &amp; Hensen, J.L.M., 2011. Uncertainty analysis in building performance simulation for design support. Energy and Buildings, 43, pp.2798-2805&lt;/ref&gt; looks into uncertainties of group 2 and 3. In this work the uncertainties are defined as normal distributions. The random parameters are sampled to generate 200 tests that are sent to the simulator (VA114), the results from which will be analysed to check the uncertainties with the largest impact on the energy calculations. This work showed that the uncertainty in the value used for infiltration is the factor that is likely to have the largest influence on cooling and heating demands. 
Another study performed by de Wilde and Wei Tian,&lt;ref&gt;de Wilde, P. &amp; Tian, W., 2009. Identification of key factors for uncertainty in the prediction of the thermal performance of an office building under climate change. Building Simulation, 2, pp.157-174&lt;/ref&gt; compared the impact of most of the uncertainties affecting building energy calculations taking into account climate change. De Wilde and Tian used a two dimensional Monte Carlo Analysis to generate a database obtained with 7280 runs of a building simulator. A sensitivity analysis was applied to this database to obtain the most significant factors on the variability of the energy demand calculations. Standardised Regression Coefficients and Standardised Rank Regression Coefficients were used to compare the impacts of the uncertainties. 

De Wilde and Tian agreed with Hopfe on the impact of uncertainties in the infiltration over energy calculations, but also introduced other factors, including uncertainties in: weather, U-Value of windows, and other variables related with occupants’ behaviour (equipment and lighting). Their paper compares many of the uncertainties with a good sized database providing a realistic comparison for the scope of the sampling of the uncertainties. 
The work of Schnieders and Hermelink &lt;ref&gt;Schnieders, J. &amp; Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants’ satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171&lt;/ref&gt; showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus).

===Type 3: Occupants===
The work of Schnieders and Hermelink &lt;ref&gt;Schnieders, J. &amp; Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants’ satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171&lt;/ref&gt; showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same specification (Passivhaus). Although the passivhaus standard has a very controlled, high quality workmanship, large differences have been seen in energy demand in different houses.
 
Blight and Coley &lt;ref&gt;Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA&lt;/ref&gt; showed that that variability can be occasioned due to variance in occupant behaviour (it should be noted that the use of windows and doors was included in this work). The work of Blight and Coley proves two things: (1) Occupants have a substantial influence on energy use; and (2) The model they used to generate occupants’ behaviour is accurate for the creation of behavioural patterns of inhabitants. 
 
The method used in the previous paper &lt;ref&gt;Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA&lt;/ref&gt; to generate accurate profiles of occupants’ behaviour was the one developed by Richardson et al.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, I., Thomson, M. &amp; Infield, D., 2008. A high-resolution domestic building occupancy model for energy demand simulations. Energy and Buildings, 40, pp.1560-1566&lt;/ref&gt; The method was developed using the Time-Use Survey (TUS) of the United Kingdom as a reference of real behaviour of occupants, this database was elaborated after recording the activity of more than 6000 occupants in 24-hours diaries with a 10 minutes resolution . Richardson’s paper shows how the tool is able to generate behavioural patterns that correlate with the real data obtained from the TUS.
The availability of this tool allows scientist’s to model the uncertainty of occupants’ behaviour as a set of behavioural patterns that have been proven to correlate with real occupants’ behaviour. 
There have been works published to take into account occupancy in optimisation using the so called robust optimisation &lt;ref&gt;Ramallo-González, A. P., Blight, T., Coley, D. A. 2015, New optimisation methodology to uncover robust low energy designs that accounts for occupant behaviour or other unknowns, Journal of Building Engineering. 2 pp. 59-68, doi:10.1016/j.jobe.2015.05.001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plasma gasification is in commercial use''' as a Waste-to-Energy system that converts municipal solid waste (MSW), tires, hazardous waste, and sewage sludge into synthesis gas (syngas) containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide that can be used to generate power. Municipal-scale waste disposal plasma arc facilities have been in operation in Japan and China since 2002. No commercial implementations in Europe and North America have succeeded so far. The technology is characterized by the potential of very high level of destruction of the incoming waste, but low or negative net energy production and high operational costs.

Plasma gasification is used commercially for waste disposal at five locations worldwide representing a design capacity of 200 tonnes of waste per day in total, of which 100 tonnes per day is biomass waste.

== Existing facilities ==

=== National Cheng Kung University - Tainan City, Taiwan (PEAT International) ===
PEAT International constructed a plasma arc waste disposal facility at [[National Cheng Kung University]] (NCKU) in [[Tainan City]], [[Taiwan]], which uses its proprietary Plasma Thermal Destruction Recovery method.  The facility is able to handle {{convert|3|-|5|MT|ST}} of waste per day from a variety of waste streams, including incinerator [[fly ash]], [[medical waste]], organic industrial process waste and inorganic sludges. It can also process waste consumer [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and other materials, including [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] sludges, and refinery [[catalyst]]s (waste streams that would generate valuable metal [[alloy]]s). The facility was constructed as part of a comprehensive [[resource recovery]] facility funded by the [[Government of the Republic of China|Taiwanese government]], marking the first time the Government of Taiwan committed financial and technical resources to the utilization of plasma technology.  It was commissioned in November 2004 and received its operating permit in January, 2005. PEAT has been an active participant in the operations and maintenance of the facility on behalf of NCKU for its research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peat.com/national_cheng.html |title=National Cheng Kung University - Tainan, Taiwan |publisher=PEAT International |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mihama-Mikata, Japan (Hitachi Metals Ltd.) ===
In 1999 a {{convert|166|ST|MT|adj=on}} per day "pilot" plant was built in [[Yoshii, Gunma|Yoshii]], co-developed by [http://www.hitachi-metals.co.jp/e/ '''Hitachi Metals Ltd.'''] and [http://www.westinghouse-plasma.com/ '''Westinghouse Plasma''']. It was certified after a demonstration period in 1999–2000. The Yoshii pilot plant was decommissioned when the pilot program ended in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/plasma-converter4.htm How Plasma Converters Work] from the Howstuffworks website&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{convert|165|ST|MT|adj=on}} per day plant was completed in 2002 in [[Utashinai, Hokkaidō|Utashinai City]]. It took over 5 years to start it up due to problems with size of the bottom of the reactor, carryover of sticky particulate, and the wrong choice of refractory.  As a result, it lost its waste supply contracts and did not meet its design heat and material balance, so Hitachi Metals shut it down in 2013.

In 2002 a {{convert|28|ST|MT|adj=on}} per day plant was commissioned in the twin cities of [[Mihama, Fukui|Mihama]] and [[Mikata, Fukui|Mikata]].&lt;ref name=williams2003&gt;{{Citation

===Pune, Maharashtra, India (Maharashtra Enviro Power Limited)===
SMS Infrastructures Limited (SMSIL), Central India's largest civil engineering and infrastructure development company, constructed a 72 tonne-per-day hazardous waste-to-energy plant, located in Pune, India. It was commissioned in 2008 and use Westinghouse Plasma Corporation's (WPC) plasma technology and reactor vessel design. It processes hazardous waste. The produced gas is immediately combusted in a steam boiler feeding a stream turbine producing up to 1.6 MW (net) of electricity. The facility is the largest plasma gasification WTE plant in the world processing hazardous waste.

=== Wuhan, China (Wuhan Kaidi/Alter NRG, demonstration plant) ===
In January 2013, Alter NRG announced that Wuhan Kaidi had successfully commissioned a Westinghouse plasma gasification unit at a demonstration facility located in Wuhan, China.  The plasma gasification unit was designed to process approximately 100 tons per day of biomass waste and convert it to clean syngas.  The clean syngas is then to be converted into diesel fuel and other transportation fuels at the Kaidi facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alternrg.com/press_release_94553 |title=Alter NRG Announces Commissioning of Biomass Gasifier at Waste To Liquids Facility in China |publisher=Alter NRG |accessdate=2013-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307175931/http://www.alternrg.com/press_release_94553 |archivedate=2013-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Swindon, Wiltshire, England, UK, (Advanced Plasma Power) ===
In 2015 Advanced Plasma Power has been awarded 11 million GBP of funding from the Department of Transport and 6 million GBP from [[Ofgem]] to develop and erect the first commercial gasification facility based on the Gasplasma process. The process consists of gasification, plasma gas treatment, syngas polishing and gas engine power generation. It will be designed to produce gas for powering vehicles, power, heat and aggregate glass from processing 7500 tonnes of [[refuse-derived fuel]] annually. Construction is expected to start during 2016

This includes a plasma gasification plant combined with advanced [[anaerobic digestion]] to divert municipal solid waste from the landfill. Enviroparks are currently collaborating with partner [[Europlasma]] of Bordeaux to provide the plasma gasification unit to the park.

As much as £60 million is being put into the project by EnviroParks Ltd and its partners, to establish organic waste and mixed waste treatment facilities next to the Tower Colliery at Hirwaun. The Hirwaun site itself is large enough for the processing of over {{convert|250000|MT|ST}} of non-hazardous waste a year. Initially, though, an anaerobic digestion plant will be designed to handle {{convert|50000|MT|ST}} of organic wastes a year.  According to the web site, as of early 2013 "...we hope to be receiving waste on the 20 acre site by 2014.". As of November 2016 the delayed gasification plant were still in the design phase according to EnviroParks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Enviroparks Update November 2016 |publisher=Enviroparks |date=November 2016 | access-date=2017-01-07 |url=http://www.bestassetmanagement.com/enviroparks-update-november-2016/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each plant used the "world's largest gasifier" to date, but neither was able to run, as the technology had not been proven at scale.  Commissioning on the first phase was started in late 2014.  By late 2015, Air Products halted construction on the second phase until it fixed the issues.

=== Ottawa, Ontario, Canada (Plasco Energy Group Inc.) ===
A new and different type of plasma arc waste conversion that uses plasma to refine gases produced during waste conversion. [[Plasco Energy Group]] completed a  demonstration plant in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]] at the Trail Road Landfill, to process {{convert|85|MT|ST}} per day of [[municipal solid waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zerowasteottawa.com/en/About-Project/ |title=About the Project |publisher=A Partnership for a Zero Waste Ottawa |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420003312/http://www.zerowasteottawa.com/en/About-Project/ |archivedate=2009-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasco Energy Group's process does not use plasma to destroy waste, but rather to refine gases produced during waste conversion, in order to allow them to be used to run an internal combustion gas engine. On 24 October 2007, the Plasco Trail Road facility began delivering power to the grid.

In an update to local area residents on 6 December 2008, Plasco president [[Rod Bryden]] said delays at its facility were caused by malfunctioning machinery, not problems with the waste-to-energy technology.&lt;ref name="clark2008"&gt;{{citation
 |first=Laura |last=Czekaj |title=Mechanical problems plague Plasco |newspaper=[[Ottawa Sun]] |publication-date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike conventional plasma gasification, the Plasco approach was to demonstrate the technology as an integrated plant at commercial scale at its own expense.  This resulted in enormous investment cost, but a proven product.

In December 2012, Plasco concluded a contract with the city of Ottawa for the construction of a three train commercial plant.  The plant would process up to 405 tonnes/day of municipal solid waste, producing 0.9 MW-hrs of net electrical power, 300 liters of water suitable for irrigation, and 150&amp;nbsp;kg of non-leachable aggregate for each tonne of waste processed.

On 28 August 2013, an article in the Ottawa Citizen reported that the Ottawa City Council had voted for the second time to extend a deadline by which Plasco was required to have arranged the $200 million required to construct the commercial scale plasma gasification facility near the Trail Road landfill.  The company now had until December 2014 to arrange financing.&lt;ref name="reevely201308"&gt;{{citation
 |first=David |last=Reevely |title=City extends Plasco Energy Group's financing deadline |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |publication-date=2013-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Black &amp; Veatch declared the technology suitable for commercialization, as it had demonstrated net power generation through GE Jenbacher IC engines, commercially acceptable availability, and pristine environmental performance.  In December of the same year, the New Economy Magazine awarded Plasco a prize as "the world's best waste management technology".

Despite this, having failed to receive expected government aid, the investors chose not to pursue the construction of the Ottawa plant and put the company into creditor protection in 2015.  It was purchased out of creditor protection later that year, and is currently marketing its advanced technology.  Plasco Energy has since changed its business model from Build Own Operate and limited it to supply of equipment and services {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}.

=== Hurlburt Field, Florida, USA (PyroGenesis Canada Inc.) ===
On April 26, 2011, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) inarguated its Transportable Plasma Waste to Energy System (TPWES) facility, located at Hurlburt Field, near Fort Walton Beach Florida, USA.  The facility was designed, constructed and commissioned by Montreal-based PyroGenesis Canada Inc., and the unit deployed at the facility was based on the company’s Plasma Resource Recovery System (PRRS) technology.  The plant was designed to process 10.5 metric tons per day of municipal solid waste, as well as hazardous and biomedical waste.  The syngas generated by the process was fed to an internal combustion engine to produce electricity, while the inorganic fraction of the waste feed was converted into an inert, vitrified slag which could allegedly be used for building materials. The system was designed to be energy neutral and transportable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afsoc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123253735 |title=AFSOC makes 'green' history while investing in future |publisher=US Air Force Special Operations Command |accessdate=2011-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509083529/http://www.afsoc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123253735 |archivedate=2011-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant, which cost $7.4 million to construct,&lt;ref&gt;http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/5745/pyrogenesis-perfecting-plasma&lt;/ref&gt; was closed and sold at a government liquidation auction in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govliquidation.com/auction/view?auctionId=6241220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rewmag.com/dod-gasification-auction-pyrogenesis.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018222036/http://www.rewmag.com/dod-gasification-auction-pyrogenesis.aspx |archivedate=2014-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening bid was $25.  The winning bid was sealed.

=== East Luther / Grand Valley, Ontario, Canada (Navitus Plasma Inc) ===
Navitus Plasma Inc. proposed the installation of a system named "DEEP" "Dufferin Eco Energy Park" within East Luther Grand Valley located in the County of Dufferin (approximately 45 minutes north of [[Toronto]]) and planned to take all municipal garbage for the county to this facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Residents Air DEEP Concerns

&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2016 no more recent traces of project DEEP was found on the public internet.

=== St. Lucie County, Florida, USA (GeoPlasma) ===
The first plasma-based waste disposal system in the USA was announced in 2006 in [[St. Lucie County, Florida]].  The county stated that it hopes to not only avoid further landfill, but completely empty its existing landfill — {{convert|4300000|ST|MT}} of waste collected since 1978 — within 18&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="FlaTrash"&gt;{{cite news |last=Skoloff |first=Brian |title=Florida county plans to vaporize landfill trash |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2006-09-10 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2006-09-10-vaporized-garbage_x.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was originally scheduled to come into operation in 2009, but experienced several setbacks.  Backers originally announced that the facility would produce {{convert|600|ST|kg}} of solid rubble from around {{convert|3000|ST|kg}} of waste per day at {{convert|5500|C|-2}}, but uncertainties arose regarding the safety of such a facility.  The public health and environmental threats from incinerators coupled with the uncertainty of the community's ability to produce such large quantities of waste on a consistent basis have led GeoPlasma to submit a new proposal for a much smaller facility that would convert {{convert|200|ST|MT}} of waste per day.  Plans were to begin building the $120 million facility in 2011.&lt;ref name="WasteDisp"&gt;{{cite news |title=Turning garbage into gas |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2011-02-03 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18061104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2012, St. Lucie officials announced that they had terminated the contract with GeoPlasma thereby ending the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Lucie officials decide to terminate Geoplasma contract |url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2012/apr/17/st-lucie-officials-to-decide-today-whether-to/|publisher=TCPalm.com|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tallahassee, Florida, USA (Green Power Systems) ===
The city of [[Tallahassee, Florida]] has signed the largest plasma arc waste to energy contract (35&amp;nbsp;MW) to date with Green Power Systems to process {{convert|1000|ST|MT}} daily from the city and several surrounding counties.  Completion of the project was scheduled for October 2010, but canceled in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyjustice.net/map/displayfacilityadvanced-74211.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (Plasco Energy Group Inc.) ===
A proposed Plasma arc gasifier has been planned for the Metro Vancouver area. However residents of the area have protested. Metro Vancouver is currently conducting an RFP process to determine a long-term solution for waste management. Plasco is not proposing that Metro Vancouver discontinue the RFP process, but rather to establish an interim solution that can quickly address the shortfall in landfill capacity, while also providing a facility that will allow Metro Vancouver to closely scrutinize and evaluate this new technology as part of its long-term decision making process.  In 2008, the EPC Task Force recommended against the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final report of the EPC Task Force on Waste to Energy Feasibility Study at Barnet Landfill Site |url=http://www.portmoody.ca/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=2691|publisher=Port Moody|accessdate=7 October 2008|date=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Port Hope, Ontario, Canada (Sunbay Energy Corporation) ===
Utilizing technology licensed from Europlasma, the plasma arc facility proposed for lands in the vicinity of Wesleyville in [[Port Hope, Ontario]] (approximately 45 minutes east of [[Toronto]]) will handle {{convert|400|ST|MT}} per day of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and Tire Derived Fuel (TDF). Sunbay Energy is currently obtaining the required approvals from Provincial authorities and intends to have the facility operational during the 4th Quarter of 2009.  This project appears to have subsequently chosen an approach other than plasma gasification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Port Hope Group Wants Gasification Plant Plans Stopped |url=http://www.northumberlandnews.com/news/article/1541973--port-hope-group-wants-gasification-plant-plans-stopped|publisher=Northumberland News|accessdate=23 November 2012|date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson, Georgia, USA (PR Power Company)===
PR Power Co. plans to open a plant south of [[Atlanta]], near [[Jackson, Georgia]], that will use a "plasma torch" to vaporize tires down to their natural elements — mainly hydrocarbons and scrap steel. The gases will be converted to electricity for sale to electric utilities and the scrap steel will be sold at an estimated $50 a ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Credeur | first = Mary Jane | title = Start-up will turn tires into electricity | work = Atlanta Business Chronicle |date=2003-06-14 |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2002/06/17/story4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Deer, Alberta, Canada (Plasco Energy Group Inc.)===
Plasco was preparing to start construction on a commercial-scale facility in [[Red Deer, Alberta]] in the Summer of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/02-05-2009/0004967195&amp;EDATE= |title=Plasco forms R&amp;D partnership |date=2009-02-05 |work=[[PR Newswire]] |accessdate=2009-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322114932/http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F02-05-2009%2F0004967195&amp;EDATE= |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This facility, which was to be the company's first commercial plant, was expected to be completed by the end of 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.albertalocalnews.com/reddeeradvocate/news/local/Plasco_moving_on_schedule_46631062.html|title=Plasco moving on schedule|date=2009-06-01|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in February 2012 it was announced that because the city would only give the plant 10% of its garbage Plasco pulled out of the project, effectively killing it.  Red Deer MP and supporter of the Plasco project, [[Bob Mills (politician)|Bob Mills]] ([[Conservative Party of Canada]]), criticized the city saying "and so, the project died due to a lack of garbage."&lt;ref name="reddeeradvocate"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= February 22, 2012|url = http://www.reddeeradvocate.com/news/With_Plasco_gone_whats_next__140101583.html|title = With Plasco gone, what’s next?|publisher = Red Deer Advocate| accessdate = February 5, 2013 | last=Cowley | first= Paul |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, Spain ([[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas]]) ===
The regional government of [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]], Spain, announced in 2008 the installation of a plasma-based waste disposal system in the city of [[Alcalá de Henares]]. The plan would have treated 220,000 tons of waste per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alcalá instala una incineradora en una zona con protección ambiental|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2008/08/08/madrid/1218194655_850215.html|publisher=Diario El País|date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public health and environmental threats from incinerators, coupled with the fact that the place was environmentally protected led to the revision of the whole project, changing the emplacement and choosing an approach different than plasma gasification &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Comunidad de Madrid instalará una incineradora en Loeches|url=http://madrid.tomalaplaza.net/2013/07/18/la-comunidad-de-madrid-instalara-una-incineradora-en-loeches/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===‘Re-invent the Toilet’===
[[Delft University]] (TUD) participated in a contest by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], 'Re-invent the toilet'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates challenges research team to reinvent the toilet |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/video/bill-gates-challenges-research-team-to-reinvent-the-toilet/1009445.article|publisher=The Engineer|accessdate=20 July 2012|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution proposed by TUD included a self-contained toilet that used microwaves to create plasma and gasify human waste. The toilet was intended for use in India &lt;ref&gt;http://www.io.tudelft.nl/en/research/research-programmes/technology-transformation/design-for-sustainability-emerging-markets/sub-theme-3-emerging-markets/reinvent-the-toilet/&lt;/ref&gt; and other parts of the world where a reliable source of water is not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gates Foundation Launches Effort to Reinvent the Toilet|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/press-releases/Pages/safe-affordable-sanitation-110719.aspx|publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma based proposal was not among the three awarded when the challenge was concluded in 2012 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates Names Winners of the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge|url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/press-releases/2012/08/bill-gates-names-winners-of-the-reinvent-the-toilet-challenge|publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Park Peterborough, England, UK (Tetronics)===
Energy Park Peterborough - the UK’s First Green Energy Park, which was to be managed by Peterborough Renewable Energy was granted consent by the Government Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in November 2009. It should take in mixed waste and – through a combination of recycling, gasification and plasma-enhanced waste recovery – recycle and remanufacture it, producing reusable products and renewable energy in the process. Tetronics was to supply the Plasma Hazardous Waste Treatment Technology. The technology should have turned the Air Pollution Control (APC) residue generated from the Biomass Power Plant into bricks and tiles for the building industry, thereby; ensuring close to zero residues to be landfilled.  Construction was scheduled to begin in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenenergyparks.co.uk/energy-park-peterborough/what-is-it |title=EnergyPark Peterborough - What is it |publisher=GreenEnergyParks|accessdate=2013-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Parks plans in Peterborough were scrapped in November 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After three years and £3 million, curtain finally drawn on controversial Peterborough energy parks project|url=https://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/after-three-years-and-3-million-curtain-finally-drawn-on-controversial-peterborough-energy-parks-project-1-7086658|publisher=Peterborough Telegraph|date=2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology''' (PCMA; {{lang-pl|Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej im. [[Kazimierz Michałowski|Kazimierza Michałowskiego]] UW}}) operates as an independent research institute of the [[University of Warsaw]] under the present name since 1990. It is dedicated to organizing, implementing and coordinating archaeological research, both excavations and study projects, as well as conservation, reconstruction and restoration projects, in [[North Africa|northeastern Africa]], the [[Near East]] and [[Cyprus]]. Projects include sites covering a broad chronological spectrum from the dawn of civilization (prehistoric times) through all the historic periods of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations to Late Antiquity and early Islam. Tasks beside fieldwork include comprehensive documentation of finds, archives management and publication of the results in keeping with international research standards. The PCMA manages the [[Research Centre in Cairo, Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw|Research Centre in Cairo]].

== History ==
The PCMA draws on the pioneering archaeological work of Polish archaeologist and egyptologist Prof. [[Kazimierz Michałowski]], who established in 1959 the Research Station of Mediterranean Archaeology in Cairo, the first Polish institution dedicated to archaeological research in the [[Nile]] Valley.

== Research projects and teams ==
The PCMA currently runs '''28 archaeological projects and teams''' (data for 2012). Detailed information on the scope of the projects are presented on the Center’s home page, including an online scientific Newsletter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">A '''potash works''' ({{lang-de|Aschenhaus}}, ''Aschenhütte'' or ''Potaschhütte'') was a subsidiary operation of a [[glassworks]] in the [[Early Modern Period]]. The latter needed [[potash]], as well as [[quartz]] and [[calcium carbonate|lime]] as [[raw material]]s for the manufacture of [[glass]]. Potash acted as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in the production process, that is by mixing it with [[quartz sand]] it significantly reduced the [[melting point]] of the latter. To make potash the glassworks built potash huts or works in the vicinity, in which [[wood ash]] and [[vegetable ash]] was gathered by [[ash burner]]s and initially washed in water and then vaporized; the whole process being known as [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]].

Contemporary witness, teacher and local historian, Lukas Grünenwald, recorded the recollections from his youth in [[Dernbach (Pfalz)|Dernbach]] in the [[Palatinate region]]:&lt;ref name="helmutseebach-2"&gt;Helmut Seebach: ''Altes Handwerk und Gewerbe in der Pfalz.'' Vol. 3: ''Pfälzerwald. Waldbauern, Waldarbeiter, Waldprodukte- und Holzwarenhandel, Waldindustrie und Holztransport.'' Bachstelz-Verlag, Annweiler-Queichhambach et al., 1994, {{ISBN|3-924115-13-3}}, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''These [[potash hut]]s were small, rectangular stone houses with a parlour and kitchen and a wood store above them. In the corner of the kitchen a large, round iron cauldron used for potash boiling stood on the brick stove and a chimney rose from there up to the [[gabled roof]]. In the three walls opposite the entrance were small windows. &lt;br&gt; The requisite [[wood ash]] was bought in all the villages far and wide and often laboriously carried home in sacks on hand carts and wagons on the then still poor roads. In the hut the ashes were first stored cold in grey [[wicker]] baskets, lined with linen, and stood on top of leaching vats. Water was poured over the ashes and they were thoroughly soaked until they were completely leached. &lt;br&gt; The [[mother liquour]] was then boiled on the stove, until only the valuable, white potash was left. This was sold for a high price to the glassworks.''|Lukas Grünenwald, 1875}}

The consumption of wood in the process of making potash was extremely high, which is why the glassworks were frequently established in areas of extensive forest (hence the term [[forest glass]]). For example, the documents of the forest glassworks of [[Spiegelberg]] in the [[Swabian-Franconian Forest]], which was in operation from 1705 to 1822, had an annual demand for potash of approximately 800 [[centner]]s. Because one [[cubic metre]] of wood (750 kg) only produced 1 kg of potash, this glassworks thus needed around 40,000 cubic metres of wood per year.

Even today the names of some settlements still recall the former potash works. For example, two hamlets in the municipality of [[Mainhardt]], Germany, are called ''Aschenhütte''.

In its most general sense, the '''practice of law''' involves giving [[legal advice]] to clients, drafting legal documents for clients, and representing clients in legal [[negotiation]]s and [[court]] proceedings such as [[lawsuit]]s, and is applied to the professional services of a [[lawyer]] or attorney at law, [[barrister]], [[solicitor]], or [[civil law notary]]. However, there is a substantial amount of overlap between the practice of law and various other professions where clients are represented by  [[Agency (law)|agents]]. These professions include [[real estate]], [[banking]], [[accounting]], and [[insurance]]. Moreover, a growing number of [[legal document assistant]]s (LDAs) are offering services which have traditionally been offered only by lawyers and their employee paralegals. Many documents may now be created by [[computer]]-assisted drafting libraries, where the clients are asked a series of questions that are posed by the [[software]] in order to construct the [[Legal instrument|legal documents]].

In the [[United States]], the practice of law is conditioned upon [[Admission to practice law|admission to practice of law]], and specifically [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] of a particular [[U.S. state|state]] or other territorial [[jurisdiction]]. The [[American Bar Association]] and the [[American Law Institute]] are among the organizations that are concerned with the interests of lawyers as a profession and the promulgation of uniform standards of professionalism and ethics, but regulation of the practice of law is left to the individual states, and their definitions vary.&lt;ref name="ABA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf |title=State Definitions of the Practice of Law |format=PDF |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114222449/https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/model-def/model_def_statutes.authcheckdam.pdf|archivedate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unauthorized practice of law===

"Unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) is an act sometimes prohibited by [[statute]], [[regulation]], or court rules.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;

====Definition====
The definition of "unauthorized practice of law" is variable, and is often conclusory and [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]],&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Garner, Bryan A. ed. |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=7th |place=St. Paul MN |publisher=West |pages=1191–1192 |authorlink=Bryan A. Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''i.e.'', it is the doing of a lawyer's or [[counsel]]or's work by a non-lawyer for money.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  There is some agreement that appearing in a legally constituted court in a legal proceeding to represent clients (particularly for a fee) is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; But other variations are subject to interpretation and conflicting regulation, particularly as to the scope and breadth of the prohibition.&lt;ref name="ABA"/&gt;  ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines unauthorized practice of law as "The practice of law by a person, typically a nonlawyer, who has not been licensed or admitted to practice law in a given jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

The [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement]] (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The definitions and tests employed by courts to delineate unauthorized practice by non-lawyers have been vague or conclusory, while jurisdictions have differed significantly in describing what constitutes unauthorized practice in particular areas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain activities, such as the representation of another person in litigation, are generally proscribed.  Even in that area, many jurisdictions recognize exceptions for such matters as small-claims and landlord-tenant tribunals and certain proceedings in administrative agencies.  Moreover, many jurisdictions have authorized law students and others not locally admitted to represent indigent persons or others as part of clinical legal education programs. . . .&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"&gt;{{cite book |title=Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers |publisher = American Law Institute|year=1998 |edition=4 cmt c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is more controversial is out-of-court activities, particularly drafting of documents and giving advice, and whether that is considered to be unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"/&gt; Some states have defined the "practice of law" to include those who appear as a representative in arbitration or act as arbitrators in disputes.&lt;ref name="Spector"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |format=PDF |title=Arbitration and The Unauthorized Practice of Law |journal=[[ARIAS Quarterly U.S.]] |publisher=AIDA Reinsurance &amp; Insurance Arbitration Society |date=First Quarter 2006 |volume=13 |pages=16–19 |first1=David M. |last1=Spector |first2=Jessica |last2=Romero |accessdate=May 18, 2011 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725085329/http://www.schiffhardin.com/binary/spector-arbitration.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there is a growing conflict between the multijurisdictional practice of law in arbitration proceedings in the financial service industry and state regulation of lawyers.&lt;ref name="BNA"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uslawwatch.com/2010/08/16/finance/bna-insights-state-regulation-unauthorized-practice-law-arbitration-mediation-trend-permitting-multijurisdictional-practice-alternative-dispute-resolution/  |title=BNA INSIGHTS: State Regulation of Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arbitration and Mediation: The Trend Toward Permitting Multijurisdictional Practice in Alternative Dispute Resolution |date=August 16, 2010 |work=Securities Regulation &amp; Law Report |publisher=[[Bureau of National Affairs]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a few exceptions, the general rule is that an appearance at an arbitration does not constitute the practice of law.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfRtIxtVG48C&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q=arbitration%20as%20unauthorized%20practice%20of%20law&amp;f=false |title=Arbitration: essential concepts |first1=Steven C. |last1=Bennett |pages= 175–178 |place=New York |date=May 2002 |publisher=Incisive Media, LLC |isbn= 978-0-9705970-8-3}} {{ISBN|0-9705970-8-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States bankruptcy court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee|Eastern District of Tennessee]] has held that "providing clients with explanations or definitions of such legal terms of art ... is, by itself, giving legal advice."&lt;ref name=software/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt; The [[North Carolina State Bar]] has held that "definition of lien law terms, warnings regarding time requirements, and reminders about sending out preliminary notices within five to ten days of beginning work, when combined with its preparation of legal documents [in the manner described], constitute providing legal advice."&lt;ref name=software&gt;{{cite news|title=Can Software Practice Law?

[[Texas]] law generally prohibits a person who is not an attorney from representing a client in a personal injury or property damage matter, and punishes a violation as a misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.123.  Chapter 38 of the penal code, containing 38.122 and 38.123] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501190606/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/PE/content/htm/pe.008.00.000038.00.htm |date=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states also criminalize the separate behavior of falsely claiming to be lawyer (in Texas, for example, this is a felony).&lt;ref&gt;Tex. Gov’t Code sec. 38.122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enforcement====
Criminal laws and enforcement of "Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)" statutes is the organized bar's preferred method. In Florida, the unauthorized practice of law is a third degree felony,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0400-0499/0454/Sections/0454.23.html §454.23 Fla. Stat.] (2016)("Any person not licensed or otherwise authorized to practice law in this state who practices law in this state or holds himself or herself out to the public as qualified to practice law in this state ... commits a felony of the third degree."&lt;/ref&gt; which is punishable by up to six months in prison&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.082.html §775.082(3)(e) Fla. Stat.](2016)&lt;/ref&gt; and $5000 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0700-0799/0775/Sections/0775.083.html §775.083(1)(c) Fla. Stat.] (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]] has a law which makes it a “[[Disorderly conduct|disorderly person]]s offense” to knowingly to engage in the unauthorized practice of law, and a “crime in the fourth degree” to commit UPL if one (a) creates a false impression that one is a lawyer; (b) derives a benefit from UPL, or (c) causes an injury by UPL.&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=21|section=22|citeonly=true}} In a 2015 survey by the American Bar Association, Florida had the largest budget—$1.8 million—nationwide for prosecuting the unauthorized practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Draper|first1=Lindsay|title=2015 Survey of Unlicensed Practice of Law Committees|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/2015_upl_report_final.authcheckdam.pdf|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=17 December 2016|date=September 2015|quote=The Florida Bar continues to lead the country in funding UPL enforcement, spending approximately $1.8 million annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the state's interest in protecting the public and so-called "learned professions" from having unschooled persons practising them, and the state's insistence on enforcing a [[monopoly]], the existence of laws governing (or defining) "unauthorized practice of Law" does not, ''ipso facto'' mean that they will be enforced.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Unauthorized+Practice |title=Unauthorized practice |publisher=Free Dictionary |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History and future====
The American Bar Association proposed model rules regarding the unauthorized practice of law, which Judge [[Richard Posner]] characterized as an attempt to perpetuate a monopoly to the disadvantage of consumers.&lt;ref name="Federalist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fed-soc.org/publications/detail/the-abas-attack-on-unauthorized-practice-of-law-and-consumer-choice |title=The ABA's Attack on "Unauthorized" Practice of Law and Consumer Choice |date=May 1, 2003 |first1=George W.C. |last1=McCarter |publisher=[[The Federalist Society|The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies]] |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge observed that the legal profession is “a cartel of providers of services relating to society’s laws” which cartel's focus is to restrict entry. "Modern economists call it '[[Rent-seeking|rent seeking]]', but throughout recorded history, skilled crafts and professions have tried to raise their members’ incomes by using the power of the state to limit entry."&lt;ref name="Federalist"/&gt;

The practice of law was not formally regulated in [[Arizona]] for a time. However, the Arizona Supreme Court found independent inherent authority to regulate the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Creasy'', 198 Ariz. 539 (2000). See generally Jonathan Rose, "Unauthorized Practice of Law in Arizona: A Legal and Political Problem That Won't Go Away", 34 Ariz. St. L.J. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona's statute criminalizing unauthorized practice of law was allowed to lapse from a [[Sunset provision|sunset law]] in 1985. Rose suggests that legislative proposals to recriminalize the unauthorized practice of law have heretofore failed because of anti-lawyer sentiment in Arizona politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 593.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rose asserts that resentment lingers from an unpopular interpretation of the old statute in ''State Bar v. Arizona Land Title &amp; Trust Co.'', 90 Ariz. 76 (1961). This ruling imposed sanctions on a title and realty company engaged in drafting contracts. Rose says, "Throughout the country, various jurisdictions have developed numerous tests for defining the practice of law. But none is broader nor more all-encompassing than that articulated in ''Arizona Title''."&lt;ref&gt;Rose at 588.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attorney participation====
In the United States, the rules of professional conduct generally prohibit an attorney from assisting a non-attorney from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. An attorney therefore may not partner with or split fees with a non-attorney in the performance of any sort of legal work. Furthermore, an attorney may not employ a disbarred or suspended attorney in a legal practice where former clients of the disbarred or suspended attorney will be represented. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

'''Spacecraft propulsion''' is any [[propulsion|method used to accelerate]] [[spacecraft]] and artificial [[satellite]]s. There are many different methods. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a [[rocket engine nozzle|supersonic de Laval nozzle]]. This sort of [[engine]] is called a [[rocket engine]].

All current spacecraft use chemical rockets ([[bipropellant rocket|bipropellant]] or [[solid rocket|solid-fuel]]) for launch, though some (such as the [[Pegasus rocket]] and [[SpaceShipOne]]) have used [[air-breathing engine]]s on their [[Multistage rocket|first stage]]. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often [[monopropellant rocket]]s) or [[resistojet rocket]]s for [[orbital station-keeping]] and some use [[momentum wheel]]s for [[attitude control]]. Soviet bloc satellites have used [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used [[ion thruster]]s and [[Hall effect thruster]]s (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.

==Requirements==
{{Further|Escape velocity}}
Artificial satellites must be [[Rocket launch|launched]] into [[orbit]] and once there they must be placed in their nominal orbit. Once in the desired orbit, they often need some form of [[attitude control]] so that they are correctly pointed with respect to [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], and possibly some [[astronomy|astronomical]] object of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Spacecraft designed to travel further also need propulsion methods.  They need to be launched out of the Earth's atmosphere just as satellites do.  Once there, they need to leave orbit and move around.

For [[interplanetary travel]], a spacecraft must use its engines to leave Earth orbit.  Once it has done so, it must somehow make its way to its destination.  Current interplanetary spacecraft do this with a series of short-term trajectory adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |date=April 24, 2007 |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/mission/cruise.html |title=Interplanetary Cruise |publisher=NASA |work=2001 Mars Odyssey |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802071234/http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/mission/cruise.html |archivedate=August 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In between these adjustments, the spacecraft simply [[freefall|falls freely]] along its trajectory.  The most fuel-efficient means to move from one circular orbit to another is with a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]: the spacecraft begins in a roughly circular orbit around the Sun.  A short period of [[thrust]] in the direction of motion accelerates or decelerates the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around the Sun which is tangential to its previous orbit and also to the orbit of its destination.  The spacecraft falls freely along this elliptical orbit until it reaches its destination, where another short period of thrust accelerates or decelerates it to match the orbit of its destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Doody | title=Chapter 4.

[[File:Ssunsail.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's concept of a solar sail]]
Some spacecraft propulsion methods such as [[solar sail]]s provide very low but inexhaustible thrust;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anonymous |year=2007 |url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/innovative_technologies/solar_sailing/facts.html |title=Basic Facts on Cosmos 1 and Solar Sailing |publisher=The Planetary Society |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703052531/http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/innovative_technologies/solar_sailing/facts.html |archivedate=July 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an interplanetary vehicle using one of these methods would follow a rather different trajectory, either constantly thrusting against its direction of motion in order to decrease its distance from the Sun or constantly thrusting along its direction of motion to increase its distance from the Sun. The concept has been successfully tested by the Japanese [[IKAROS]] solar sail spacecraft.

Spacecraft for [[interstellar travel]] also need propulsion methods.  No such spacecraft has yet been built, but many designs have been discussed. Because interstellar distances are very great, a tremendous velocity is needed to get a spacecraft to its destination in a reasonable amount of time.  Acquiring such a velocity on launch and getting rid of it on arrival will be a formidable challenge for spacecraft designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Effectiveness==

When in space, the purpose of a [[propulsion system]] is to change the velocity, or ''v'', of a spacecraft. Because this is more difficult for more massive spacecraft, designers generally discuss [[momentum]], ''mv''. The amount of change in momentum is called [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zobel |first=Edward A. |year=2006 |url=http://id.mind.net/~zona/mstm/physics/mechanics/momentum/introductoryProblems/momentumSummary2.html |title=Summary of Introductory Momentum Equations |publisher=Zona Land |accessdate=2007-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025532/http://id.mind.net/~zona/mstm/physics/mechanics/momentum/introductoryProblems/momentumSummary2.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So the goal of a propulsion method in space is to create an impulse.

When launching a spacecraft from Earth, a propulsion method must overcome a higher [[gravity drag|gravitational]] pull to provide a positive net acceleration.&lt;ref name="beginners_guide"&gt;{{cite web
 | last = Benson | first = Tom
 | url=http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/guided.htm

In orbit, &lt;!-- the spacecraft tangential velocity provides a centrifugal --&gt;&lt;!--- it's centrifugal here because the spacecraft is in a non-inertial reference frame which rotates around the center of the planet and the force is *outwards*- the only centripetal force is *inwards* and is *gravity* here---&gt; &lt;!--acceleration that counteracts the acceleration due to gravity at a given path (which is actually the orbit path) so that --&gt; any additional impulse, even very tiny, will result in a change in the orbit path.

The rate of change of [[velocity]] is called [[acceleration]], and the rate of change of [[momentum]] is called [[force]].  To reach a given velocity, one can apply a small acceleration over a long period of time, or one can apply a large acceleration over a short time.  Similarly, one can achieve a given impulse with a large force over a short time or a small force over a long time.  This means that for maneuvering in space, a propulsion method that produces tiny accelerations but runs for a long time can produce the same impulse as a propulsion method that produces large accelerations for a short time.  When launching from a planet, tiny accelerations cannot overcome the planet's gravitational pull and so cannot be used.

Earth's surface is situated fairly deep in a [[gravity well]]. The [[escape velocity]] required to get out of it is 11.2 kilometers/second. As human beings evolved in a gravitational field of 1g (9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s²), an ideal propulsion system would be one that provides a continuous acceleration of '''1g''' (though human bodies can tolerate much larger accelerations over short periods). The occupants of a rocket or spaceship having such a propulsion system would be free from all the ill effects of [[free fall]], such as nausea, muscular weakness, reduced sense of taste, or [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] of calcium from their bones.

The law of [[conservation of momentum]] means that in order for a propulsion method to change the momentum of a space craft it must change the momentum of something else as well.  A few designs take advantage of things like magnetic fields or light pressure in order to change the spacecraft's momentum, but in free space the rocket must bring along some mass to accelerate away in order to push itself forward.  Such mass is called [[reaction mass]].

In order for a rocket to work, it needs two things: reaction mass and energy.  The impulse provided by launching a particle of reaction mass having mass ''m'' at velocity ''v'' is ''mv''.  But this particle has kinetic energy ''mv''²/2, which must come from somewhere. In a conventional [[solid rocket|solid]], [[liquid rocket|liquid]], or [[hybrid rocket]], the fuel is burned, providing the energy, and the reaction products are allowed to flow out the back, providing the reaction mass.  In an [[ion thruster]], electricity is used to accelerate ions out the back. Here some other source must provide the electrical energy (perhaps a [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]] or a [[nuclear reactor]]), whereas the ions provide the reaction mass.&lt;ref name="beginners_guide" /&gt;

When discussing the efficiency of a propulsion system, designers often focus on effectively using the reaction mass.  Reaction mass must be carried along with the rocket and is irretrievably consumed when used.  One way of measuring the amount of impulse that can be obtained from a fixed amount of reaction mass is the [[specific impulse]], the impulse per unit weight-on-Earth (typically designated by &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt;). The unit for this value is seconds. Because the weight on Earth of the reaction mass is often unimportant when discussing vehicles in space, specific impulse can also be discussed in terms of impulse per unit mass.  This alternate form of specific impulse uses the same units as velocity (e.g. m/s), and in fact it is equal to the effective exhaust velocity of the engine (typically designated &lt;math&gt;v_{e}&lt;/math&gt;).  Confusingly, both values are sometimes called specific impulse.  The two values differ by a factor of [[standard gravity|''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]], the standard acceleration due to gravity 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s² (&lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp} g_\mathrm{n} = v_{e}&lt;/math&gt;).

A rocket with a high exhaust velocity can achieve the same impulse with less reaction mass.  However, the energy required for that impulse is proportional to the exhaust velocity, so that more mass-efficient engines require much more energy, and are typically less energy efficient.  This is a problem if the engine is to provide a large amount of thrust.  To generate a large amount of impulse per second, it must use a large amount of energy per second.  So high-mass-efficient engines require enormous amounts of energy per second to produce high thrusts.  As a result, most high-mass-efficient engine designs also provide lower thrust due to the unavailability of high amounts of energy.

==Methods==
Propulsion methods can be classified based on their means of accelerating the reaction mass.  There are also some special methods for launches, planetary arrivals, and landings.

===Reaction engines===
{{Main|Reaction engine}}
A '''reaction engine''' is an engine which provides propulsion by expelling [[reaction mass]], in accordance with [[Newton's third law of motion]]. This law of motion is most commonly paraphrased as: "For every action there is an equal, and opposite, reaction".

Examples include both [[duct engine]]s and [[rocket engine]]s, and more uncommon variations such as [[Hall effect thruster]]s, [[ion drive]]s and [[mass drivers]]. Duct engines are obviously not used for space propulsion due to the lack of air; however some proposed spacecraft have these kinds of engines to assist takeoff and landing.

====Delta-v and propellant====
[[File:Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation.svg|thumb|right|Rocket [[mass ratio]]s versus final velocity, as calculated from the rocket equation]]
Exhausting the entire usable propellant of a spacecraft through the engines in a straight line in free space would produce a net velocity change to the vehicle; this number is termed ''[[delta-v]]'' (&lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt;).

If the exhaust velocity is constant then the total &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; of a vehicle can be calculated using the rocket equation, where ''M'' is the mass of propellant, ''P'' is the mass of the payload (including the rocket structure), and &lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[effective exhaust velocity|velocity of the rocket exhaust]]. This is known as the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta v = v_e \ln \left(\frac{M+P}{P}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

For historical reasons, as discussed above, &lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes written as

:&lt;math&gt; v_e = I_\text{sp} g_0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific impulse]] of the rocket, measured in seconds, and &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational acceleration]] at sea level.

For a high delta-v mission, the majority of the spacecraft's mass needs to be reaction mass. Because a rocket must carry all of its reaction mass, most of the initially-expended reaction mass goes towards accelerating reaction mass rather than payload. If the rocket has a payload of mass ''P'', the spacecraft needs to change its velocity by &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt;, and the rocket engine has exhaust velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', then the reaction mass ''M'' which is needed can be calculated using the rocket equation and the formula for &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; M = P \left(e^\frac{\Delta v}{v_e} - 1\right).&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; much smaller than ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', this equation is roughly [[linear]], and little reaction mass is needed. If &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; is comparable to ''v&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', then there needs to be about twice as much fuel as combined payload and structure (which includes engines, fuel tanks, and so on).  Beyond this, the growth is exponential; speeds much higher than the exhaust velocity require very high ratios of fuel mass to payload and structural mass.

For a mission, for example, when launching from or landing on a planet, the effects of gravitational attraction and any atmospheric drag must be overcome by using fuel. It is typical to combine the effects of these and other effects into an effective mission [[delta-v]]. For example, a launch mission to low Earth orbit requires about 9.3–10&amp;nbsp;km/s delta-v. These mission delta-vs are typically numerically integrated on a computer.

Some effects such as [[Oberth effect]] can only be significantly utilised by high thrust engines such as rockets; i.e., engines that can produce a high [[g-force]] (thrust per unit mass, equal to delta-v per unit time).

====Power use and propulsive efficiency====
For all [[reaction engine]]s (such as rockets and ion drives) some energy must go into accelerating the reaction mass. Every engine will waste some energy, but even assuming 100% efficiency, to accelerate an exhaust the engine will need energy amounting to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} \dot{m} v_e^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=sutton1&gt;equation 19-1 Rocket propulsion elements 7th edition- Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

This energy is not necessarily lost- some of it usually ends up as kinetic energy of the vehicle, and the rest is wasted in residual motion of the exhaust.

[[File:Rocket propulsion efficiency.svg|thumb|right|Due to energy carried away in the exhaust, the energy efficiency of a reaction engine varies with the speed of the exhaust relative to the speed of the vehicle, this is called [[propulsive efficiency]]]]
Comparing the rocket equation (which shows how much energy ends up in the final vehicle) and the above equation (which shows the total energy required) shows that even with 100% engine efficiency, certainly not all energy supplied ends up in the vehicle - some of it, indeed usually most of it, ends up as kinetic energy of the exhaust.

The exact amount depends on the design of the vehicle, and the mission. However, there are some useful fixed points:

*if the &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt; is fixed, for a mission delta-v, there is a particular &lt;math&gt;I_\text{sp}&lt;/math&gt; that minimises the overall energy used by the rocket. This comes to an exhaust velocity of about ⅔ of the mission delta-v (see [[#Energy|the energy computed from the rocket equation]]). Drives with a specific impulse that is both high and fixed such as Ion thrusters have exhaust velocities that can be enormously higher than this ideal for many missions.
*if the exhaust velocity can be made to vary so that at each instant it is equal and opposite to the vehicle velocity then the absolute minimum energy usage is achieved. When this is achieved, the exhaust stops in space {{Ref|frames}} and has no kinetic energy; and the propulsive efficiency is 100%- all the energy ends up in the vehicle (in principle such a drive would be 100% efficient, in practice there would be thermal losses from within the drive system and residual heat in the exhaust). However, in most cases this uses an impractical quantity of propellant, but is a useful theoretical consideration. Anyway, the vehicle has to move before the method can be applied.

Some drives (such as [[variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket|VASIMR]] or [[electrodeless plasma thruster]]) actually can significantly vary their exhaust velocity. This can help reduce propellant usage or improve acceleration at different stages of the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the exhaust velocity is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] drives usually have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15000&amp;nbsp;m/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about [[Delta-v budget#Delta-vs between Earth, Moon and Mars|4000{{nbsp}}m/s]]).

It might be thought that adding power generation capacity is helpful, and although initially this can improve performance, this inevitably increases the weight of the power source, and eventually the mass of the power source and the associated engines and propellant dominates the weight of the vehicle, and then adding more power gives no significant improvement.

For, although [[solar energy|solar power]] and nuclear power are virtually unlimited sources of ''energy'', the maximum ''power'' they can supply is substantially proportional to the mass of the powerplant (i.e. [[power-to-weight ratio|specific power]] takes a largely constant value which is dependent on the particular powerplant technology).  For any given specific power, with a large &lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt; which is desirable to save propellant mass, it turns out that the maximum acceleration is inversely proportional to &lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the time to reach a required delta-v is proportional to &lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the latter should not be too large.

====Energy====
[[File:Average propulsive efficiency of rockets.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a vehicle accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency]]
In the ideal case &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; is useful payload and &lt;math&gt;m_0-m_1&lt;/math&gt; is reaction mass (this corresponds to empty tanks having no mass, etc.). The energy required can simply be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}(m_0 - m_1)v_\text{e}^2&lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to the kinetic energy the expelled reaction mass would have at a speed equal to the exhaust speed. If the reaction mass had to be accelerated from zero speed to the exhaust speed, all energy produced would go into the reaction mass and nothing would be left for kinetic energy gain by the rocket and payload. However, if the rocket already moves and accelerates (the reaction mass is expelled in the direction opposite to the direction in which the rocket moves) less kinetic energy is added to the reaction mass. To see this, if, for example, &lt;math&gt;v_e&lt;/math&gt;=10&amp;nbsp;km/s and the speed of the rocket is 3&amp;nbsp;km/s, then the speed of a small amount of expended reaction mass changes from 3&amp;nbsp;km/s forwards to 7&amp;nbsp;km/s rearwards. Thus, although the energy required is 50 MJ per kg reaction mass, only 20 MJ is used for the increase in speed of the reaction mass. The remaining 30 MJ is the increase of the kinetic energy of the rocket and payload.

In general:

:&lt;math&gt;
  d\left(\frac{1}{2}v^2\right) =
  vdv = vv_\text{e}\frac{dm}{m} =
  \frac{1}{2}\left[v_\text{e}^2 - \left(v - v_\text{e}\right)^2 + v^2\right]\frac{dm}{m}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the specific energy gain of the rocket in any small time interval is the energy gain of the rocket including the remaining fuel, divided by its mass, where the energy gain is equal to the energy produced by the fuel minus the energy gain of the reaction mass. The larger the speed of the rocket, the smaller the energy gain of the reaction mass; if the rocket speed is more than half of the exhaust speed the reaction mass even loses energy on being expelled, to the benefit of the energy gain of the rocket; the larger the speed of the rocket, the larger the energy loss of the reaction mass.

We have
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta \epsilon =  \int v\, d (\Delta v)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the specific energy of the rocket (potential plus kinetic energy) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; is a separate variable, not just the change in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of using the rocket for deceleration; i.e., expelling reaction mass in the direction of the velocity, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; should be taken negative.

The formula is for the ideal case again, with no energy lost on heat, etc. The latter causes a reduction of thrust, so it is a disadvantage even when the objective is to lose energy (deceleration).

If the energy is produced by the mass itself, as in a chemical rocket, the [[fuel value]] has to be &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{v_\text{e}^2/2}&lt;/math&gt;, where for the fuel value also the mass of the oxidizer has to be taken into account. A typical value is &lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; = 4.5&amp;nbsp;km/s, corresponding to a fuel value of 10.1{{nbsp}}MJ/kg. The actual fuel value is higher, but much of the energy is lost as waste heat in the exhaust that the nozzle was unable to extract.

The required energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}m_1\left(e^\frac{\Delta v}{v_\text{e}} - 1\right)v_\text{e}^2&lt;/math&gt;

Conclusions:

*for &lt;math&gt;\Delta v \ll v_e&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;E \approx \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_\text{e} \Delta v&lt;/math&gt;
*for a given &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt;, the minimum energy is needed if &lt;math&gt;v_\text{e} = 0.6275 \Delta v&lt;/math&gt;, requiring an energy of
:&lt;math&gt;E = 0.772 m_1(\Delta v)^2&lt;/math&gt;.
:In the case of acceleration in a fixed direction, and starting from zero speed, and in the absence of other forces, this is 54.4% more than just the final kinetic energy of the payload. In this optimal case the initial mass is 4.92 times the final mass.

These results apply for a fixed exhaust speed.

Due to the [[Oberth effect]] and starting from a nonzero speed, the required potential energy needed from the propellant may be ''less'' than the increase in energy in the vehicle and payload. This can be the case when the reaction mass has a lower speed after being expelled than before – rockets are able to liberate some or all of the initial kinetic energy of the propellant.

Also, for a given objective such as moving from one orbit to another, the required &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; may depend greatly on the rate at which the engine can produce &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; and maneuvers may even be impossible if that rate is too low. For example, a launch to [[Low Earth orbit]] (LEO) normally requires a &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; of ca. 9.5&amp;nbsp;km/s (mostly for the speed to be acquired), but if the engine could produce &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; at a rate of only slightly more than [[g-force|''g'']], it would be a slow launch requiring altogether a very large &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; (think of hovering without making any progress in speed or altitude, it would cost a &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; of 9.8&amp;nbsp;m/s each second). If the possible rate is only &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; or less, the maneuver can not be carried out at all with this engine.

The [[power (physics)|power]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{1}{2} m a v_\text{e} = \frac{1}{2}F v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the thrust and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the acceleration due to it. Thus the theoretically possible thrust per unit power is 2 divided by the specific impulse in m/s. The '''thrust efficiency''' is the actual thrust as percentage of this.

If, e.g., [[solar power]] is used, this restricts &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;; in the case of a large &lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; the possible acceleration is inversely proportional to it, hence the time to reach a required delta-v is proportional to &lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;; with 100% efficiency:
*for &lt;math&gt;\Delta v \ll v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;t\approx \frac{m v_\text{e} \Delta v}{2P}&lt;/math&gt;

Examples:
*power, 1000{{nbsp}}W; mass, 100&amp;nbsp;kg; &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; = 5&amp;nbsp;km/s, &lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; = 16&amp;nbsp;km/s, takes 1.5 months.
*power, 1000{{nbsp}}W; mass, 100&amp;nbsp;kg; &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; = 5&amp;nbsp;km/s, &lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; = 50&amp;nbsp;km/s, takes 5 months.

Thus &lt;math&gt;v_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; should not be too large.

====Power to thrust ratio====
The power to thrust ratio is simply:&lt;ref name=sutton1/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{F} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} {\dot m v^2}}{\dot m v} = \frac{1}{2} v &lt;/math&gt;
Thus for any vehicle power P, the thrust that may be provided is:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{P}{\frac{1}{2} v} = \frac{2 P} v&lt;/math&gt;

====Example====

Suppose a 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg space probe will be sent to Mars. The required &lt;math&gt;\Delta v&lt;/math&gt; from [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] is approximately 3000&amp;nbsp;m/s, using a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]. For the sake of argument, assume the following thrusters are options to be used:

Observe that the more fuel-efficient engines can use far less fuel; their mass is almost negligible (relative to the mass of the payload and the engine itself) for some of the engines. However, note also that these require a large total amount of energy. For Earth launch, engines require a thrust to weight ratio of more than one. To do this with the ion or more theoretical electrical drives, the engine would have to be supplied with one to several gigawatts of power, equivalent to a major metropolitan [[electricity generation|generating station]]. From the table it can be seen that this is clearly impractical with current power sources.

Alternative approaches include some forms of [[laser propulsion]], where the [[reaction mass]] does not provide the energy required to accelerate it, with the energy instead being provided from an external laser or other [[beam-powered propulsion]] system. Small models of some of these concepts have flown, although the engineering problems are complex and the ground-based power systems are not a solved problem.

Instead, a much smaller, less powerful generator may be included which will take much longer to generate the total energy needed. This lower power is only sufficient to accelerate a tiny amount of fuel per second, and would be insufficient for launching from Earth. However, over long periods in orbit where there is no friction, the velocity will be finally achieved. For example, it took the [[SMART-1]] more than a year to reach the Moon, whereas with a chemical rocket it takes a few days. Because the ion drive needs much less fuel, the total launched mass is usually lower, which typically results in a lower overall cost, but the journey takes longer.

Mission planning therefore frequently involves adjusting and choosing the propulsion system so as to minimise the total cost of the project, and can involve trading off launch costs and mission duration against payload fraction.

====Rocket engines====
{{Main|Rocket engine}}
[[File:SpaceX engine test fire.jpg|thumb|right|[[SpaceX]]'s [[Kestrel (rocket engine)|Kestrel engine]] is tested]]
Most rocket engines are [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] [[heat engines]] (although non combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature reaction mass, as a hot gas. This is achieved by combusting a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio [[de Laval nozzle|nozzle]]. This bell-shaped nozzle is what gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10 times the speed of sound at sea level are common.

Rocket engines provide essentially the highest specific powers and high specific thrusts of any engine used for spacecraft propulsion.

Ion propulsion rockets can heat a plasma or charged gas inside a [[magnetic bottle]] and release it via a [[magnetic nozzle]], so that no solid matter need come in contact with the plasma.  Of course, the machinery to do this is complex, but research into [[nuclear fusion]] has developed methods, some of which have been proposed to be used in propulsion systems, and some have been tested in a lab.

See [[rocket engine]] for a listing of various kinds of rocket engines using different heating methods, including chemical, electrical, solar, and nuclear.

====Electromagnetic propulsion====
[[File:Ion Engine Test Firing - GPN-2000-000482.jpg|thumb|right|250pix|This test engine accelerates ions using electrostatic forces]]
{{Main|Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion}}
Rather than relying on high temperature and [[fluid dynamics]] to accelerate the reaction mass to high speeds, there are a variety of methods that use electrostatic or [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] forces to accelerate the reaction mass directly.  Usually the reaction mass is a stream of [[ion]]s.  Such an engine typically uses electric power, first to ionize atoms, and then to create a voltage gradient to accelerate the ions to high exhaust velocities.

The idea of electric propulsion dates back to 1906, when [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] considered the possibility in his personal notebook.&lt;ref name="choueiri"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] published the idea in 1911.

For these drives, at the highest exhaust speeds, energetic efficiency and thrust are all inversely proportional to exhaust velocity. Their very high exhaust velocity means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with practical power sources provide low thrust, but use hardly any fuel.

For some missions, particularly reasonably close to the Sun, [[solar energy]] may be sufficient, and has very often been used, but for others further out or at higher power, nuclear energy is necessary; engines drawing their power from a nuclear source are called [[nuclear electric rocket]]s.

With any current source of electrical power, chemical, nuclear or solar, the maximum amount of power that can be generated limits the amount of thrust that can be produced to a small value.  Power generation adds significant mass to the spacecraft, and ultimately the weight of the power source limits the performance of the vehicle.

Current nuclear power generators are approximately half the weight of solar panels per watt of energy supplied, at terrestrial distances from the Sun. Chemical power generators are not used due to the far lower total available energy. Beamed power to the spacecraft shows some potential.

Some electromagnetic methods:
* [[Ion thrusters]] (accelerate ions first and later neutralize the ion beam with an electron stream emitted from a cathode called a neutralizer)
**[[Electrostatic ion thruster]]
**[[Field-emission electric propulsion]]
**[[Hall effect thruster]]
**[[Colloid thruster]]
* Electrothermal thrusters (electromagnetic fields are used to generate a plasma to increase the [[heat]] of the bulk propellant, the thermal energy imparted to the propellant gas is then converted into kinetic energy by a [[nozzle]] of either physical material construction or by magnetic means)
**[[Arcjet rocket|DC arcjet]]
**[[Arcjet rocket|microwave arcjet]]
**[[Helicon Double Layer Thruster]]
* Electromagnetic thrusters (ions are accelerated either by the [[Lorentz Force]] or by the effect of electromagnetic fields where the electric field is not in the direction of the acceleration)

In electrothermal and electromagnetic thrusters, both ions and electrons are accelerated simultaneously, no neutralizer is required.

===Without internal reaction mass===

[[File:Solarsail msfc.jpg|right|thumb|NASA study of a solar sail. The sail would be half a kilometer wide.]]

The [[Conservation law (physics)|law of conservation]] of [[momentum]] is usually taken to imply that any engine which uses no reaction mass cannot accelerate the center of mass of a spaceship (changing orientation, on the other hand, is possible). But space is not empty, especially space inside the Solar System; there are gravitation fields, [[magnetic field]]s, [[electromagnetic waves]], [[solar wind]] and solar radiation.  Electromagnetic waves in particular are known to contain momentum, despite being massless; specifically the momentum flux density '''P''' of an EM wave is quantitatively 1/c^2 times the [[Poynting vector]] '''S''', i.e. '''P''' = '''S'''/c^2, where c is the velocity of light.  [[Field propulsion]] methods which do not rely on reaction mass thus must try to take advantage of this fact by coupling to a momentum-bearing field such as an EM wave that exists in the vicinity of the craft. However, because many of these phenomena are diffuse in nature, corresponding propulsion structures need to be proportionately large.{{original research inline|date=January 2017}}

There are several different space drives that need little or no reaction mass to function. A [[tether propulsion]] system employs a long cable with a high tensile strength to change a spacecraft's orbit, such as by interaction with a planet's magnetic field or through momentum exchange with another object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave |last=Drachlis |title=NASA calls on industry, academia for in-space propulsion innovations |publisher=NASA |date=October 24, 2002 |url=http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/news/news/releases/2002/02-269.html |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206095134/http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/news/news/releases/2002/02-269.html |archivedate=December 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar sail]]s rely on [[radiation pressure]] from electromagnetic energy, but they require a large collection surface to function effectively. The [[magnetic sail]] deflects charged particles from the [[solar wind]] with a magnetic field, thereby imparting momentum to the spacecraft. A variant is the [[mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion]] system, which uses a small cloud of plasma held in a magnetic field to deflect the Sun's charged particles. An [[E-sail]] would use very thin and lightweight wires holding an electric charge to deflect these particles, and may have more controllable directionality.

As a proof of concept, [[NanoSail-D]] became the first nanosatellite to orbit [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://inhabitat.com/nasas-nanosail-d-becomes-the-first-solar-sail-spacecraft-to-orbit-the-earth/ NASA's Nanosail-D Becomes the First Solar Sail Spacecraft to Orbit the Earth | Inhabitat - Green Design Will Save the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} There are plans to add them{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} to future Earth orbit satellites, enabling them to de-orbit and burn up once they are no longer needed. Cubesail will be the first mission to demonstrate solar sailing in low Earth orbit, and the first mission to demonstrate full three-axis attitude control of a solar sail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Vehicle Control|url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/ssc/research/space_vehicle_control/cubesail/news/index.htm|website=University of Surrey|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan also launched its own solar sail powered spacecraft [[IKAROS]] in May 2010. [[IKAROS]] successfully demonstrated propulsion and guidance and is still flying today.

A satellite or other space vehicle is subject to the [[law of conservation of angular momentum]], which constrains a body from a [[net force|net change]] in [[angular velocity]]. Thus, for a vehicle to change its [[relative orientation]] without expending reaction mass, another part of the vehicle may rotate in the opposite direction.  Non-conservative external forces, primarily gravitational and atmospheric, can contribute up to several degrees per day to angular momentum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Accordingly, many spacecraft utilize [[reaction wheels]] or [[Control Moment Gyroscope|control moment gyroscopes]] to control orientation in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[gravitational slingshot]] can carry a [[space probe]] onward to other destinations without the expense of reaction mass. By harnessing the gravitational energy of other celestial objects, the spacecraft can pick up kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2004 | pages = 619–000 | doi = 10.1119/1.1621032| last2 =   Cacioppo| last3 =   Gangopadhyaya| first1 = J.

[[Beam-powered propulsion]] is another method of propulsion without reaction mass.  Beamed propulsion includes sails pushed by [[Laser propulsion|laser]], microwave, or particle beams.

===Launch-assist mechanisms===
{{Main|Space launch}}


There have been many ideas proposed for launch-assist mechanisms that have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of getting into orbit. Proposed [[non-rocket spacelaunch]] launch-assist mechanisms include:

*[[Skyhook (structure)|Skyhook]] (requires reusable suborbital launch vehicle, not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials)
*[[Space elevator]] (tether from Earth's surface to geostationary orbit, cannot be built with existing materials)
*[[Launch loop]] (a very fast enclosed rotating loop about 80&amp;nbsp;km tall)
*[[Space fountain]] (a very tall building held up by a stream of masses fired from its base)
*[[Orbital ring]] (a ring around Earth with spokes hanging down off bearings)
*[[Mass driver|Electromagnetic catapult]] ([[railgun]], [[coilgun]]) (an electric gun)
*[[Rocket sled launch]]
*[[Space gun]] ([[Project HARP]], [[ram accelerator]]) (a chemically powered gun)
*[[Beam-powered propulsion]] rockets and jets powered from the ground via a beam
*[[High-altitude platform]]s to assist initial stage

===Air-breathing engines===
{{Main|Jet engine|Air-breathing electric propulsion}}
Studies generally show that conventional air-breathing engines, such as [[ramjets]] or [[turbojets]] are basically too heavy (have too low a thrust/weight ratio) to give any significant performance improvement when installed on a launch vehicle itself. However, launch vehicles can be [[air launch]]ed from separate lift vehicles (e.g. [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29]], [[Pegasus rocket|Pegasus Rocket]] and [[Scaled Composites White Knight|White Knight]]) which do use such propulsion systems.  Jet engines mounted on a launch rail could also be so used.

On the other hand, very lightweight or very high speed engines have been proposed that take advantage of the air during ascent:

* [[Liquid air cycle engine]] - a hydrogen fuelled jet engine that liquifies the air before burning it in a rocket engine
* [[Scramjet]] - jet engines that use supersonic combustion
* [[Shcramjet]] - similar to a scramjet engine, however it takes advantage of shockwaves produced from the aircraft in the combustion chamber to assist in increasing overall efficiency.

Normal rocket launch vehicles fly almost vertically before rolling over at an altitude of some tens of kilometers before burning sideways for orbit; this initial vertical climb wastes propellant but is optimal as it greatly reduces airdrag. Airbreathing engines burn propellant much more efficiently and this would permit a far flatter launch trajectory, the vehicles would typically fly approximately tangentially to Earth's surface until leaving the atmosphere then perform a rocket burn to bridge the final [[delta-v]] to orbital velocity.

For spacecraft already in very low-orbit, [[air-breathing electric propulsion]] would use residual gases in the upper atmosphere as propellant. Air-breathing electric propulsion could make a new class of long-lived, low-orbiting missions feasible on Earth, [[Mars]] or [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World-first firing of air-breathing electric thruster|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/World-first_firing_of_air-breathing_electric_thruster|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=Space Engineering &amp; Technology|publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://erps.spacegrant.org/uploads/images/2015Presentations/IEPC-2015-271_ISTS-2015-b-271.pdf Conceptual design of an air-breathing electric propulsion system].

===Planetary arrival and landing===
[[File:Pathfinder Air Bags - GPN-2000-000484.jpg|thumb|right|A test version of the MARS Pathfinder airbag system]]
When a vehicle is to enter orbit around its destination planet, or when it is to land, it must adjust its velocity.  This can be done using all the methods listed above (provided they can generate a high enough thrust), but there are a few methods that can take advantage of planetary atmospheres and/or surfaces.

* [[Aerobraking]] allows a spacecraft to reduce the high point of an elliptical orbit by repeated brushes with the atmosphere at the low point of the orbit. This can save a considerable amount of fuel because it takes much less delta-V to enter an elliptical orbit compared to a low circular orbit. Because the braking is done over the course of many orbits, heating is comparatively minor, and a heat shield is not required. This has been done on several Mars missions such as [[Mars Global Surveyor]], [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]] and [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]], and at least one Venus mission, [[Magellan probe|Magellan]].
* [[Aerocapture]] is a much more aggressive manoeuver, converting an incoming hyperbolic orbit to an elliptical orbit in one pass.  This requires a heat shield and much trickier navigation, because it must be completed in one pass through the atmosphere, and unlike aerobraking no preview of the atmosphere is possible. If the intent is to remain in orbit, then at least one more propulsive maneuver is required after aerocapture—otherwise the low point of the resulting orbit will remain in the atmosphere, resulting in eventual re-entry. Aerocapture has not yet been tried on a planetary mission, but the [[Skip reentry|re-entry skip]] by [[Zond 6]] and [[Zond 7]] upon lunar return were aerocapture maneuvers, because they turned a hyperbolic orbit into an elliptical orbit. On these missions, because there was no attempt to raise the perigee after the aerocapture, the resulting orbit still intersected the atmosphere, and re-entry occurred at the next perigee.
* A [[ballute]] is an inflatable drag device.
* [[Parachute]]s can land a probe on a planet or moon with an atmosphere, usually after the atmosphere has scrubbed off most of the velocity, using a [[Atmospheric reentry|heat shield]].
* [[Airbag]]s can soften the final landing.
* [[Lithobraking]], or stopping by impacting the surface, is usually done by accident. However, it may be done deliberately with the probe expected to survive (see, for example, [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)]]), in which case very sturdy probes are required.

==Table of methods==
Below is a summary of some of the more popular, proven technologies, followed by increasingly speculative methods.

Four numbers are shown.  The first is the [[specific impulse|effective exhaust velocity]]: the equivalent speed that the propellant leaves the vehicle.  This is not necessarily the most important characteristic of the propulsion method; thrust and power consumption and other factors can be. However:
* if the delta-v is much more than the exhaust velocity, then exorbitant amounts of fuel are necessary (see the section on calculations, above)
* if it is much more than the delta-v, then, proportionally more energy is needed; if the power is limited, as with solar energy, this means that the journey takes a proportionally longer time

The second and third are the typical amounts of thrust and the typical burn times of the method.  Outside a gravitational potential small amounts of thrust applied over a long period will give the same effect as large amounts of thrust over a short period. (This result does not apply when the object is significantly influenced by gravity.)

The fourth is the maximum delta-v this technique can give (without staging). For rocket-like propulsion systems this is a function of mass fraction and exhaust velocity. Mass fraction for rocket-like systems is usually limited by propulsion system weight and tankage weight. For a system to achieve this limit, typically the payload may need to be a negligible percentage of the vehicle, and so the practical limit on some systems can be much lower.

==Testing==
Spacecraft propulsion systems are often first statically tested on Earth's surface, within the atmosphere but many systems require a vacuum chamber to test fully. Rockets are usually tested at a [[rocket engine test facility]] well away from habitation and other buildings for safety reasons. [[Ion drive]]s are far less dangerous and require much less stringent safety, usually only a large-ish vacuum chamber is needed.

Famous static test locations can be found at [[Rocket engine test facility#Rocket ground test facilities|Rocket Ground Test Facilities]]

Some systems cannot be adequately tested on the ground and test launches may be employed at a [[rocket launch site|Rocket Launch Site]].

==Speculative methods==
[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception of a warp drive design]]
A variety of hypothetical propulsion techniques have been considered that require a deeper understanding of the properties of 
space, particularly [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames]] and the [[vacuum state]].  To date, such methods are highly speculative and include:

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
#{{note|frames}} With things moving around in orbits and nothing staying still, the question may be quite reasonably asked, stationary relative to what? The answer is for the energy to be zero (and in the absence of gravity which complicates the issue somewhat), the exhaust must stop relative to the ''initial'' motion of the rocket before the engines were switched on. It is possible to do calculations from other reference frames, but consideration for the kinetic energy of the exhaust and propellant needs to be given. In Newtonian mechanics the initial position of the rocket is the [[centre of mass frame]] for the rocket/propellant/exhaust, and has the minimum energy of any frame.

'''Split-brain''' is a lay term to describe the result when the [[corpus callosum]] connecting the two [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres of the brain]] is severed to some degree. It is an association of symptoms produced by disruption of or interference with the connection between the hemispheres of the brain. The surgical operation to produce this condition ([[corpus callosotomy]]) involves transection of the corpus callosum, and is usually a last resort to treat refractory [[epilepsy]]. Initially, partial callosotomies are performed; if this operation does not succeed, a complete callosotomy is performed to mitigate the risk of accidental physical injury by reducing the severity and violence of [[epileptic seizures]]. Before using callosotomies, epilepsy is instead treated through pharmaceutical means. After surgery, neuropsychological assessments are often performed.

After the right and left brain are separated, each hemisphere will have its own separate perception, concepts, and impulses to act. Having two "brains" in one body can create some interesting dilemmas. When one split-brain patient dressed himself, he sometimes pulled his pants up with one hand (that side of his brain wanted to get dressed) and down with the other (this side did not). He also reported to have grabbed his wife with his left hand and shaken her violently, at which point his right hand came to her aid and grabbed the aggressive left hand. However, such conflicts are very rare. If a conflict arises, one hemisphere usually overrides the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Psychology Gateways to Mind and Behavior|publisher = |year = |isbn = 9781111833633|location = |pages = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When split-brain patients are shown an image only in the left half of each eye's visual field, they cannot vocally name what they have seen. This is because the image seen in the left visual field is sent only to the right side of the brain (see [[optic tract]]), and most people's speech-control center is on the left side of the brain. Communication between the two sides is inhibited, so the patient cannot say out loud the name of that which the right side of the brain is seeing. A similar effect occurs if a split-brain patient touches an object with only the left hand while receiving no visual cues in the right visual field; the patient will be unable to name the object, as each cerebral hemisphere of the primary [[somatosensory cortex]] only contains a tactile representation of the opposite side of the body. If the speech-control center is on the right side of the brain, the same effect can be achieved by presenting the image or object to only the right visual field or hand.

The same effect occurs for visual pairs and reasoning. For example, a patient with split brain is shown a picture of a chicken foot and a snowy field in separate visual fields and asked to choose from a list of words the best association with the pictures. The patient would choose a chicken to associate with the chicken foot and a shovel to associate with the snow; however, when asked to reason why the patient chose the shovel, the response would relate to the chicken (e.g. "the shovel is for cleaning out the chicken coop").&lt;ref&gt;http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_bleu06.html&lt;/ref&gt;


== History ==

In the 1950's, research on people with certain brain injuries made it possible to suspect that the "language center" in the brain was commonly situated in the left hemisphere. One had observed that people with lesions in two specific areas on the left hemisphere lost their ability to talk, for example. [[Roger Sperry]] and his colleague pioneered research. In his early work on animal subjects, Sperry made many noteworthy discoveries.  The results of these studies over the next thirty years later led to Roger Sperry being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981. Sperry received the prize for his discoveries concerning the functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres. With the help of so-called "split brain" patients, he carried out experiments, and for the first time in history, knowledge about the left and right hemispheres was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Split Brain Experiments|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/split-brain/background.html|publisher=Nobel Media|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s Sperry was later joined by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] a psychobiology Ph.D. student in his work on split-brain research at [[Caltech]] in Pasadena, California. Even though Sperry is considered the founder of split-brain research, Gazzaniga's clear summaries of their collaborative work are consistently cited in psychology texts. In Sperry and Gazzaniga's "The Split Brain in Man" experiment published in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1967 they wanted to explore the extent to which two halves of the human brain were able to function independently and whether or not they had separate and unique abilities. They wanted to examine how perceptual and intellectual skills were affected in someone with a split-brain. At Caltech, Gazzaniga worked with Sperry on the effects of split-brain surgery on perception, vision and other brain functions. The surgery, which was a treatment for severe epilepsy, involved severing the corpus callosum, which carries signals between the left-brain hemisphere, the seat of speech and analytical capacity, and the right-brain hemisphere, which helps recognize visual patterns. At the time this article was written, only ten patients had undergone the surgery to sever their corpus callosum ([[corpus callosotomy]]). Four of these patients had consented to participate in Sperry and Gazzaniga's research. After the corpus callosum severing, all four participants' personality, intelligence, and emotions appeared to be unaffected. However,the testing done by Sperry and Gazzaniga showed the subjects demonstrated unusual mental abilities. The researchers created three types of tests to analyze the range of cognitive capabilities of the split-brain subjects. The first was to test their visual stimulation abilities, the second test was a tactile stimulation situation and the third tested auditory abilities.

=== Visual test ===

The first test started with a board that had a horizontal row of lights. The subject was told to sit in front of the board and stare at a point in the middle of the lights, then the bulbs would flash across both the right and left visual fields. When the patients were asked to describe afterward what they saw, they said that only the lights on the right side of the board had lit up. Next when Sperry and Gazzaniga flashed the lights on the right side of the board on the subjects left side of their visual field, they claimed to not have seen any lights at all. When the experimenters conducted the test again, they asked the subjects to point to the lights that lit up. Although subjects had only reported seeing the lights flash on the right, they actually pointed to all the lights in both visual fields. This showed that both brain hemispheres had seen the lights and were equally competent in visual perception. The subjects did not say they saw the lights when they flashed in the left visual field even though they did see them because the center for speech is located in the brain’s left hemisphere. This test supports the idea that in order to say one has seen something, the region of the brain associated with speech must be able to communicate with areas of the brain that process the visual information.

=== Tactile test ===

In a second experiment Sperry and Gazzaniga placed a small object in the subject's right or left hand, without being able to see (or hear) it. Placed in the right hand, the isolated left hemisphere perceived the object and could easily describe and name it. However, placed in the left hand, the isolated right hemisphere could not name or describe the object. Questioning this result, the researchers found that the subjects ''could'' later match it from several similar objects; tactile sensations limited to the right hemisphere were accurately perceived but could not be verbalized. This further demonstrated the apparent location (or lateralization) of language functions in the left hemisphere.

=== Combination of both tests ===

In the last test the experimenters combined both the tactile and visual test. They presented subjects with a picture of an object to only their right hemisphere, and subjects were unable to name it or describe it. There were no verbal responses to the picture at all. If the subject however was able to reach under the screen with their left hand to touch various objects, they were able to pick the one that had been shown in the picture. The subjects were also reported to be able to pick out objects that were related to the picture presented, if that object was not under the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gazzaniga|first=Michael|title=The Split Brain in Man|journal=Scientific American|year=1967|volume=217|issue=2|pages=24–29|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1038/scientificamerican0867-24|accessdate=28 April 2014|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0867-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sperry and Gazzaniga went on to conduct other tests to shed light on the language processing abilities of the right hemisphere as well as auditory and emotional reactions as well. The significance of the findings of these tests by Sperry and Gazzaniga were extremely telling and important to the psychology world. Their findings showed that the two halves of the brain have numerous functions and specialized skills. They concluded that each hemisphere really has its own functions. One's left hemisphere of the brain is thought to be better at writing, speaking, mathematical calculation, reading, and is the primary area for language. The right hemisphere is seen to possess capabilities for problem solving, recognizing faces, symbolic reasoning, art, and spatial relationships.

Roger Sperry continued this line of research up until his death in 1994. Michael Gazzaniga still is researching the split-brain. Their findings have been rarely critiqued and disputed, however a popular belief that some people are more "right-brained" or "left-brained" has developed. In the mid 1980s Jarre Levy, a psychobiologist at the University of Chicago, had set out and been in the forefront of scientists who wanted to dispel the notion we have two functioning brains. She believes that because each hemisphere has separate functions that they must integrate their abilities instead of separating them. Levy also claims that no human activity uses only one side of the brain. In 1998 a French study by Hommet and Billiard was published that questioned Sperry and Gazzaniga's study that severing the corpus callosum actually divides the hemispheres of the brain. They found that children born without a corpus callosum demonstrated that information was being transmitted between hemispheres, and concluded that subcortical connections must be present in these children with this rare brain malformation. They are unclear about whether these connections are present in split-brain patients though. Another study by Parsons, Gabrieli, Phelps, and Gazzaniga in 1998 demonstrated that split-brain patients may commonly perceive the world differently from the rest of us. Their study suggested that communication between brain hemispheres is necessary for imaging or simulating in your mind the movements of others.  Morin's research on inner speech in 2001 suggested that an alternative for interpretation of [[commissurotomy]] according to which split-brain patients exhibit two uneven streams of self-awareness: a "complete" one in the left hemisphere and a "primitive" one in the right hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hock|first=Roger R.|title=Forty Studies that Changed Psychology: Explorations into the History of Research|publisher=Upper Saddle River|isbn=0-13-114729-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hemispheric specialization ==

The two hemispheres of the [[cerebral cortex]] are linked by the corpus callosum, through which they communicate and coordinate actions and decisions. Communication and coordination between the two hemispheres is essential because each hemisphere has some separate functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Juliet|title=The Neuroscience of Mindfulness|url=http://www.mindfulnet.org/page25.htm|publisher=Midfulnet|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right hemisphere of the cortex excels at nonverbal and spatial tasks, whereas the left hemisphere is more dominant in verbal tasks, such as speaking and writing. The right hemisphere controls the primary sensory functions of the left side of the body. In a cognitive sense the right hemisphere is responsible for recognition of objects and timing, and in an emotional sense it is responsible for empathy, humour and depression. On the other hand, the left hemisphere controls the primary sensory functions of the right side of the body and is responsible for scientific and maths skills, and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witelson|first=Sandra F|author2=Wazir Pallie|title=Left Hemisphere Specialization for Language in the Newborn|journal=Neuroanatomical Evidence of Asymmetry|year=1973|volume=96|issue=3|pages=641–646|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/context/96/3/641.extract|accessdate=28 April 2014|doi=10.1093/brain/96.3.641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of specialised brain function by an area remains under investigation. It is claimed that the difference between the two hemispheres is that the left hemisphere is "analytic" or "logical" while the right hemisphere is "holistic" or "intuitive".&lt;ref&gt;http://bama.ua.edu/~st497/pdf/rightorleftbrain.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many simple tasks, especially comprehension of inputs, require functions that are specific to both the right and left hemispheres and together form a one direction systematised way of creating an output{{clarify|date=June 2016}} through the communication and coordination that occurs between hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borod|first=Joan|author2=Fani Andelman |author3=Loraine K Obler |author4=James Tweedy |author5=Joan Wilkowitz |title=Right Hemisphere Specialization for the Identification of Emotional Words and Sentences|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1992|volume=30|issue=9|pages=827–844|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(92)90086-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of the corpus callosum ===

The corpus callosum is a structure in the brain along the [[longitudinal fissure]] that facilitates much of the communication between the two hemispheres and its main function is in allowing for communication between the brain's right and left hemispheres. This structure is composed of [[white matter]]: millions of [[axon]]s that have their [[dendrite]]s and [[terminal button]]s projecting in both the right and left hemisphere. However, there is evidence that the corpus callosum may also have some inhibitory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Shea R. P. | authorlink2 = Michael Corballis, Corballis  | year = 2003 | title = Binocular rivalry in split-brain observers | url = http://journalofvision.org/3/10/3 | journal = Journal of Vision | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 610–615 | doi=10.1167/3.10.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-mortem research on human and monkey brains show that the corpus callosum is functionally organised. It proves that the right hemisphere is superior for detecting faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mooshagian|first=Eric|title=Anatomy of the Corpus Callosum reveals its Function|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=2008|volume=28|issue=7|pages=1535–1536|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5426-07.2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organisation results in modality-specific regions of the corpus callosum that are responsible for the transfer of different types of information. Research has revealed that the anterior midbody transfers motor information, the posterior midbody transfers somatosensory information, the isthmus transfers auditory information and the splenium transfers visual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Risse GL, Gates J, Lund G, Maxwell R, Rubens A | year = 1989 | title = Inter-hemispheric transfer in patients with incomplete section of the corpus callosum: anatomic verification with magnetic resonance imaging | url = | journal = Arch Neurol | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 437–43 | doi=10.1001/archneur.1989.00520400097026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although much of the interhemispheric transfer occurs at the corpus callosum, there are trace amounts of transfer via subcortical pathways.

Studies of the effects on the visual pathway on split-brained patients has revealed that there is a redundancy gain (the ability of target detection to benefit from multiple copies of the target) in simple reaction time. In a simple response to visual stimuli, split-brained patients experience a faster reaction time to bilateral stimuli than predicted by model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Corballis M. C. |author2=Corballis P. M. |author3=Fabri M. | year = 2003 | title = Redundancy gain in simple reaction time following partial and complete callosotomy | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 71–81 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(03)00152-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A model proposed by Iacoboni et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iacoboni M. |author2=Fried I. |author3=Zaidel E. | year = 1994 | title = Callosal transmission time before and after partial commissurotomy | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 2521–2524 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199412000-00029}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests split-brained patients experience asynchronous activity that causes a stronger signal, and thus a decreased reaction time. Iacoboni also suggests there exists dual attention in split-brained patients, which is implying that each cerebral hemisphere has its own attentional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Arguin M. |author2=Lassonde M. |author3=Quattrini A. |author4=Del Pesce M. |author5=Foschi N. |author6=Papo I. | year = 2000 | title = Divided visuo-spatial attention systems with total and anterior callosotomy | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 283–291 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(99)00077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach taken by Reuter-Lorenz et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reuter-Lorenz P.

It is important to note that the simple reaction time in split-brained patients, even with enhanced redundancy gain, is slower than the reaction time of normal adults.

=== Functional plasticity ===

Following a stroke or other injury to the brain, functional deficiencies are common. The deficits are expected to be in areas related to the part of the brain that has been damaged; if a stroke has occurred in the motor cortex, deficits may include paralysis, abnormal posture, or abnormal movement synergies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nudo R. J. |author2=Plautz E. J. |author3=Frost S. B. | year = 2001 | title = Role of adaptive plasticity in recovery of function after damage to motor cortex. [Review] | url = | journal = Muscle &amp; Nerve | volume = 24 | issue = 8| pages = 1000–1019 | doi=10.1002/mus.1104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant recovery occurs during the first several weeks after the injury. However, recovery is generally thought not to continue past 6 months. If a specific region of the brain is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be transferred and taken over by a neighbouring region. There is little functional plasticity observed in partial and complete callosotomies; however, much more plasticity can be seen in infant patients receiving a [[hemispherectomy]], which suggests that the opposite hemisphere can adapt some functions typically performed by its opposite pair. In a study done by Anderson, it proved a correlation between the severity of the injury, the age of the individual and their cognitive performance. It was evident that there was more neuroplasticity in older children, even if their injury was extremely severe, than infants who suffered moderate brain injury.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005 1374–1382"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Vicki|author2=Cathy Catroppa |author3=Sue Morse |author4=Flora Haritou |author5=Jeffrey Rosenfeld |title=Functional Plasticity or Vulnerability after Early Brain Injury|journal=Pediatrics|year=2005|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1374–1382|doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some incidents of any moderate to severe brain injury, it mostly causes developmental impairments and in some of the most severe injuries it can cause a profound impact on their development that can lead to long-term cognitive effects. In the aging brain, it is extremely uncommon for neuroplasticity to occur; "olfactory bulb and hippocampus are two regions of the mammalian brain in which mutations preventing adult neurogenesis were never beneficial, or simply never occurred" (Anderson, 2005).&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005 1374–1382"/&gt;

=== Corpus callosotomy ===

[[Corpus callosotomy]] is a surgical procedure that sections the corpus callosum, resulting in either the partial or complete disconnection between the two hemispheres. It is typically used as a last resort measure in treatment of intractable [[epilepsy]]. The modern procedure typically involves only the anterior third of the corpus callosum; however, if the epileptic seizures continue, the following third is lesioned prior to the remaining third if the seizures persist. This results in a complete callosotomy in which most of the information transfer between hemispheres is lost.

Due to the functional mapping of the corpus callosum, a partial callosotomy has less detrimental effects because it leaves parts of the corpus callosum intact. There is little functional plasticity observed in partial and complete callosotomies on adults, the most neuroplasticity is seen in young children but not in infants.&lt;ref name="Concha 2006 1090–1099"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Concha|first=Luis|author2=Donald Gross |author3=Matt Wheatley |author4=Christian Beaulieu |title=Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Time-Dependent Axonal and Myelin Degradation after Corpus Callosotomy in Epilepsy Patients|journal=NeuroImage|year=2006|volume=32|issue=3|pages=1090–1099|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.04.187 |pmid=16765064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that when the corpus callosum is severed during an experimental procedure, the experimenter can ask each side of the brain the same question and receive two different answers. When the experimenter asks the right visual field/left hemisphere what they see the participant will respond verbally, whereas if the experimenter asks the left visual field/right hemisphere what they see the participant will not be able to respond verbally but will pick up the appropriate object with their left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raven|first=Peter|title=Biology|year=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780073383071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===

It is known that the right and the left hemisphere have different functions when it comes to memory. The right hemisphere is better at being able to recognise objects and faces, recall knowledge that the individual has already learned, or recall images already seen. The left hemisphere is better at mental manipulation, language production, and semantic priming but was more susceptible to memory confusion than the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe 1995 157–164"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metcalfe|first=Janet|author2=Margaret Funnell |author3=Michael Gazzanuga |title=Right-Hemisphere Memory Superiority:Studies of Split-brain Patient|journal=Psychological Science|year=1995|volume=6|issue=3|pages=157–164|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1995.tb00325.x|jstor=40063008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main issue for individuals that have undergone a callosotomy is that because the function of memory is split into two major systems, the individual is more likely to become confused between knowledge they already know and information that they have only inferred.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe 1995 157–164"/&gt;

In tests, memory in either hemisphere of split-brained patients is generally lower than normal, though better than in patients with amnesia, suggesting that the forebrain commissures are important for the formation of some kinds of memory. This suggests that posterior callosal sections that include the hippocampal commissures cause a mild memory deficit (in standardised free-field testing) involving recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Tramo MJ, Baynes K, Fendrich R, Mangun GR, Phelps EA, Reuter- Lorenz PA, Gazzaniga MS (1995): Hemispheric specialization and interhemispheric integration: Insights from experiments with commissurotomy patients. In: Epilepsy and the Corpus Callosum 2. Reeves AG, Roberts DW, eds. New York: Plenum, pp. 263-295&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control ===

In general, split-brained patients behave in a coordinated, purposeful and consistent manner, despite the independent, parallel, usually different and occasionally conflicting processing of the same information from the environment by the two disconnected hemispheres. When two hemispheres receive competing stimuli at the same time, the response mode tends to determine which hemisphere controls behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Levy J, Trevarthen C (IC)76: Metacontrol of hemispheric function in human split-brain patients. J Exp Psvchol (HP&amp;P) 2:299-312 Reeves AG, Roberts DW, eds. (1995): Epilepsy and the Corpus Callosum 2. New York: Plenum&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, split-brained patients are indistinguishable from normal adults. This is due to the compensatory phenomena; split-brained patients progressively acquire a variety of strategies to get around their interhemispheric transfer deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Mark L|title=Other Multiplicity|url=http://www.legiontheory.com/split-brain.html|publisher=Dr. Mark and Rana Manning|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue that can happen with their body control is that one side of the body is doing the opposite of the other side called the intermanual effect.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017|reason=Behavioural Brain Research

=== Attention ===

== Case studies of split-brain patients ==

=== Patient W.J. ===
Patient W.J.&lt;ref&gt;Eldridge, A. D. (n.d.). Discovering the unique individuals behind split-brain patient anonymity. Doctoral dissertation, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Wilmington, NC. Retrieved from http://people.uncw.edu/puente/405/PDFpapers/Split-brain%20Patients.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was the first patient to undergo a full corpus callosotomy in 1962, after experiencing fifteen years of convulsions resulting from [[grand mal seizure]]s. He was a World War II paratrooper who was injured at 30 years old during a bombing raid jump over the Netherlands, and again in a prison camp following his first injury. After returning home, he began to suffer from blackouts in which he would not remember what he was doing or where, and how or when he got there. At age 37, he suffered his first generalised [[convulsion]]. One of his worst episodes occurred in 1953, when he suffered a series of convulsions lasting for many days. During these convulsions, his left side would go numb and he would recover quickly, but after the series of convulsions, he never regained complete feeling on his left side.

Before his surgery, both hemispheres functioned and interacted normally, his sensory and motor functions were normal aside from slight [[hypesthesia]], and he could correctly identify and understand visual stimuli presented to both sides of his visual field. During his surgery in 1962, his surgeons determined that no [[massa intermedia]] had developed, and he had undergone [[atrophy]] in the part of the right frontal lobe exposed during the procedure. His operation was a success, in that it led to decreases in the frequency and intensity of his seizures.

Complete sectioning of the corpus callosum has been confirmed by MRI.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gazzaniga|first=M. S.|last2=Holtzman|first2=J. D.|last3=Deck|first3=M.

One of the experiments involving JW attempted to determine each hemisphere's ability to perform simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. On each trial, an arithmetic problem was presented in the center of the screen followed by a central cross hair. After studying the problem, a number posing as the answer was presented to each hemisphere exclusively by JW's vision fixated on a central cross hair. Probes (stimuli) were then presented for 150 ms to either the left visual field/right hemisphere (LVF/RH) or to the right visual field/left hemisphere (RVF/LH). The position of the probe fell outside any zone of naso-temporal overlap (binocular vision) to ensure that stimuli were perceived only by the hemisphere [[contralateral]] to the visual field of the stimuli. JW was instructed to press a certain key if the probe was the correct solution and another key if the probe was the incorrect solution. Results showed that the effects of visual field was significant with performance of the left hemisphere being better than that of the right hemisphere; the left hemisphere correctly chose the correct answer on all four arithmetic operations approximately 90% of the time while the right hemisphere was at chance. These results suggest left hemisphere specialisation for calculation.

J.W. was further tested to determine after-effects on his [[self-recognition]] and familiar facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Turk D. J. |author2=Heatherton T.

These images were ranging from 0–100% "JW", with the 0% images being of Dr. Michael Gazzaniga, and the 100% images being of J.W. himself. What researchers found supported the idea that there are cortical networks in the left hemisphere that play an important role in execution of the self-recognition process.

=== Patient VP ===

Patient VP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Funnell M. G. |author2=Corballis P. M. |author3=Gazzaniga M.

Although the callosotomy was reported to be complete, follow-up MRI in 1984 revealed spared fibers in the rostrum and splenium. The spared rostral fibers constituted approximately 1.8% of the total cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum and the spared splenial fibers constituted approximately 1% of the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; VP's postsurgery intelligence and memory quotients were within normal limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gazzaniga MS, Nass R, Reeves A, Roberts D | year = 1984 | title = Neurologic perspectives on right hemisphere language following surgical section of the corpus callosum | url = | journal = Semin Neurol | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 126–35 | doi=10.1055/s-2008-1041542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the experiments involving VP attempted to investigate systematically the types of visual information that could be transferred via VP's spared splenial fibers. The first experiment was designed to assess VP's ability to make between-field perceptual judgements about simultaneously presented pairs of stimuli. The stimuli were presented in varying positions with respect to the horizontal and vertical midline with VP's vision fixated on a central crosshair. The judgements were based on differences in colour, shape or size. The testing procedure was the same for all three types of stimuli; after presentation of each pair, VP verbally responded "yes" if the two items in the pair were identical and "no" if they were not. The results show that there was no perceptual transfer for colour, size or shape with binomial tests showing that VP's accuracy was not greater than chance.

A second experiment involving VP attempted to investigate what aspects of words transferred between the two hemispheres. The set up was similar to the previous experiment, with VP's vision fixated on a central cross hair. A word pair was presented with one word on each side of the cross-hair for 150 ms. The words presented were in one of four categories: words that looked and sounded like rhymes (e.g. tire and fire), words that looked as if they should rhyme but did not (e.g. cough and dough), words that did not look as if they should rhyme but did (e.g. bake and ache), and words that neither looked nor sounded like rhymes (e.g. keys and fort). After presentation of each word pair, VP responded "yes" if the two words rhymed and "no" if they did not. VP's performance was above chance and she was able to distinguish among the different conditions. When the word pairs did not sound like rhymes, VP was able to say accurately that the words did not rhyme, regardless of whether or not they looked as if they should rhyme. When the words did rhyme, VP was more likely to say they rhymed, particularly if the words also looked as if they should rhyme.

Although VP showed no evidence for transfer of colour, shape or size, there was evidence for transfer of word information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gazzaniga M. S. | year = 2000 | title = Cerebral specialization and interhemispheric communication | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 7| pages = 1293–1326 | doi = 10.1093/brain/123.7.1293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the speculation that the transfer of word information involves fibres in the ventroposterior region of the [[splenium]]—the same region in which V.P. had callosal sparing. V.P. is able to integrate words presented to both visual fields, creating a concept that is not suggested by either word. For example, she combines "head" and "stone" to form the integrated concept of a tombstone.

He was born on November 11, 1951 with an enlarged head, [[encephalocele]], a malformed cerebellum, and an absence of a corpus callosum and both the anterior and posterior commissures. He was able to memorize over 9,000 books, and information from approximately 15 subject areas. These include: world/American history, sports, movies, geography, actors and actresses, the Bible, church history, literature, classical music, area codes/zip codes of the United States, television stations serving these areas, and step by step directions within any major U.S. city. Despite these abilities, he had an IQ of 87, was not diagnosed as autistic, and was unable to button his shirt, and had difficulties performing everyday tasks. The missing structures of his brain have yet to be linked to his increased abilities, but they can be linked to his ability to read pages of a book in 8–10 seconds. He was able to split his vision &lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;Brogaard, B. (2012, November 6). The superhuman mind: Split brains. Retrieved April 26, 2014, from Psychology Today website: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/split-brains&lt;/ref&gt; so that each eye reads its corresponding page, allowing him to read both pages at once. He also had developed language areas in both hemispheres, something very uncommon in split-brain patients. [[Language]] &lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt; is processed in areas of the temporal lobe, most commonly on the left side of the head, and involves a [[contralateral]] transfer of information before the brain can process what is being read. In Peek's case, there was no transfer ability—this is what led to his development of language centers in each hemisphere. Many believe this is the reason behind his extremely fast reading capabilities.

While Peek did not undergo corpus callosotomy, he is considered a natural split-brain patient and is critical to understanding the importance of the corpus callosum. Kim Peek died in 2009.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

The '''Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences''' is the heart of the undergraduate program and grants the majority of [[Stanford University]]'s degrees. The School has 23 departments and
20 interdisciplinary degree-granting programs. The School was officially created in 1948, from the merger of the Schools of Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences.  Those schools date from the mid-1920s when the university first organized individual departments into schools.&lt;ref name=histoverall&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Schools of the University|url=http://histsoc.stanford.edu/su_schools.shtml|publisher=Stanford Historical Society|accessdate=18 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120133812/http://histsoc.stanford.edu/su_schools.shtml|archivedate=20 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departments==

The school is divided into three divisions: Humanities and Arts, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences.

=== Humanities and Arts ===

* Art &amp; Art History - One of the original University departments under the name Drawing (1891), Drawing and Painting (1892-1900), back to Drawing (1901–1907), Graphic Arts (1908–1910), Graphic Art (1911–1913, 1927–1947), then Art and Architecture (1948–1969), Art (1970-?) and finally its current name.&lt;ref name="histoverall"/&gt;
* Classics - Stanford started with separate departments for Latin and Greek but these were merged in 1921
* Drama - Started as Public Speaking in 1927 became Speech and Drama in 1937 and Drama in 1971
* East Asian Languages and Cultures
* English - one of the original departments but under the name English Language and Literature
* History - one of the original departments
* Linguistics - established in 1971
* Music - established in 1936
* Philosophy - established sometime in the 1890s
* Religious Studies - started in 1941 as the department of Religion

Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages
* Comparative Literature
* French and Italian - one of the original departments under the name Romance Languages which became Romanic Languages.  Became French and Italian in 1963.
* German Studies - one of the original departments under the name Germanic Languages
* Iberian &amp; Latin American Cultures
* Slavic Languages and Literature - established in 1926

=== Natural Sciences ===

* Applied Physics - established in 1969
* Biology
* Chemistry - one of the original departments
* Mathematics - one of the original departments
* Physics - one of the original departments
* Statistics - established in 1936

The current Biology department was formed by merging Botany, Zoology, Entomology, and Physiology to form Biological Sciences.  The name of this department was changed to Biology in 2009.

=== Social Sciences ===

* Anthropology
* Communication - established in 1927 as Journalism
* Economics - established in 1892 as Economics and Social Sciences
* Political Science
* Psychology - one of the original departments with [[Frank Angell]] serving as its first chair. From 1922 to 1942, [[Lewis Terman]] served as its chair.&lt;ref name="psychhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://psychology.stanford.edu/historyofdepartment |title=History of the Psychology Department |newspaper=Https: |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, it was ranked as #1 in the country among all psychology graduate programs in the United States.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/psychology-rankings |title=Best Psychology Programs |newspaper=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sociology

Stanford was set up with a Political Science department but that was almost immediately renamed Economics and Social Science.  The forerunner of the current Political Science department was established in 1918.

Sociology and Anthropology were originally one department established in 1948.  They split in 1957.  Anthropology itself was split into Anthropological Sciences and Cultural and Social Anthropology from
1999 to 2007 but merged again.

Notable faculty in these departments other than those mentioned above include:
*[[Albert Bandura]] (1925-), David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science 
*[[Carol Dweck]] (1946-), Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology (2004-)
*[[Phillip Zimbardo]] (1933-), professor of Psychology (1968-200), known for the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]]
*[[Joseph Greenberg]] (1915-2001), Ray Lyman Wilbur Professor of Social Science, known for his classification of the [[Niger–Congo languages]]

==Core courses==
At times Stanford has required undergraduate students to take core courses in various subjects in the humanities and sciences.  Some of the core courses include
* Western Culture (1980-1988) - freshmen took courses in  both European and non-European cultures with  “a substantial historical dimension” and include works by women and minorities.&lt;ref name=st37-2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomew|first1=Karen|title=25 years ago (1988)|journal=Sandstone &amp; Tile|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://historicalsociety.stanford.edu/pdfST/ST37no1.pdf|page=22|date=2013|accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cultures, Ideas and Values (CIV) (1988-2000)&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt;
* Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) (2000-2012),&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt; a core freshman  course sequence which consisted of one fall-quarter course followed by a 2-quarter pair of courses during the winter and spring quarters. Fall quarter courses were interdisciplinary while winter-spring focused on a specific disciplinary area.
* Thinking Matters (2012–2016)&lt;ref name=st37-2/&gt;
* Ways of Thinking / Ways of Doing (2016–present)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/ways|title=Stanford Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Contrainte resistance 2d proche.svg|thumb|300px|Probability density of stress S (red, top) and resistance R (blue, top), and of equality (m = R - S = 0, black, bottom).]]

[[File:Contrainte resistance 3d proche.svg|thumb|300px|Distribution of stress S and strength R: all the (R, S) situations have a probability density (grey level surface). The area where the margin m = R - S is positive is the set of situation where the system is reliable (R &amp;gt; S).]]

'''Stress–strength analysis''' is the analysis of the strength of the materials and the interference of the stresses placed on the materials, where "materials" is not necessarily the raw goods or parts, but can be an entire system.  Stress-Strength Analysis is a tool used in [[reliability engineering]].

Environmental stresses have a [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] with a [[mean]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\mu_x\right)&lt;/math&gt; and a [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;\left(s_x\right)&lt;/math&gt; and component strengths have a distribution with a mean &lt;math&gt;\left(\mu_y\right)&lt;/math&gt; and a standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\left(s_y\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The overlap of these distributions is the probability of failure &lt;math&gt;\left(Z\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  This overlap is also referred to stress-strength interference.

== Reliability ==
If the distributions for both the stress and the strength both follow a Normal distribution, then the reliability (R) of a component can be determined by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tersmette|first=Trevor|title=Mechanical Stress/Strength Interference Theory|url=http://www.theriac.org/DeskReference/PDFs/4Q2003.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;math&gt;R = 1 - P(Z)&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;Z = -\frac{\mu_y - \mu_x}{\sqrt{ s_x^2 + s_y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

P(Z) can be determined from a [[Standard normal table|Z table]] or a statistical software package.

'''''The Godfather Effect''''' is a 2012 critically acclaimed study of the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' films - as well as [[Mario Puzo]]'s novel - and their effect on [[American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywoods-influence-analyzed-292682&amp;ct=ga&amp;cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAsb-d-gRIAVgBYgJlbg&amp;cd=s8mCdalV8lI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJG9D_h1eztLSAjzYPPlqgSrv-wQ Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577180912290622798?mod=googlenews_wsj ''Wall Street Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; Written by biographer [[Tom Santopietro]], the book demonstrates how ''[[The Godfather]]'' was a turning point in American cultural consciousness. With its emphasis on proud ethnicity, ''The Godfather'' changed not just the way [[Italian-Americans]] saw themselves, but how Americans of all backgrounds viewed their individual and national self-identities, their possibilities, and attendant disappointments.&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 83; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Godfather Effect'' had a broader philosophical dimension, as well. As noted by Santopietro, "what Puzo delivered - brilliantly - was nothing less than a disquisition on the madness, glory, and failure of the [[American dream]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 7; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the novel, [[Amerigo Bonasera]] declares “I believe in America.” The novel then depicts a nation where Mafia and [[big business]] are two sides of the same coin: both are corrupt, tell the truth selectively, and do exactly as they wish.&lt;ref&gt;''The Godfather Effect'', p. 81; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-250-00513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Godfather Effect'' was widely reviewed, and well received by the press. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it "a beautiful narrative of the way pop culture shapes our self-image."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywoods-influence-analyzed-292682&amp;ct=ga&amp;cad=CAcQAhgAIAAoATABOAFAsb-d-gRIAVgBYgJlbg&amp;cd=s8mCdalV8lI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFJG9D_h1eztLSAjzYPPlqgSrv-wQ Hollywood Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' declared that "part memoir, part devotional film essay and part reflection on the meaning of ethnicity in American life, ''The Godfather Effect'' defines how the ''Godfather'' movies, along with the 1969 Mario Puzo novel from which they were adapted, reflected the madness, glory and failure of the American dream. By exploring that dream in distinctly Italian-American terms, the movies succeeded in delivering nothing less than the Italianization of American culture. In other words, they were so cool that everyone wanted to seem a little Italian."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577180912290622798?mod=googlenews_wsj Wall Street Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsday]]'' appreciated the personal dimension in Santopietro's book, noting, "In the end, it's the personal moments, such as Santopietro taking his aging dad to revisit the field where he played baseball as a child, that are most rewarding. The films make up the shell of ''The Godfather Effect'', but it's the connections with family that give it a center as sweet as cannoli cream."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/books/the-godfather-effect-by-tom-santopietro-1.3552803 Newsday]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New York Journal of Books'' found that Santopietro “capably weaves together the memoirist elements, the history, and the analyses of the formal and thematic aspects of the films.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/godfather-effect-changing-hollywood-america-and-me ''New York Journal of Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was recognized for its historical value by ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'', the official publication of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html ''Smithsonian Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Reef Ball Foundation''', Inc. is a [[501(c)(3)]] publicly supported non-profit organization that functions as an international environmental [[Non-governmental organization]]. The foundation uses '''Reef Ball''' [[artificial reef]] technology, combined with [[coral]] propagation, [[Transplanting|transplant]] technology, public education and community training to build, restore and protect [[coral reef]]s.  The foundation has established "Reef Ball [[reef]]s" in 59 countries, and ongoing projects increase the number to more than 70. Over 550,000 Reef Balls have been deployed in more than 4,000 projects.

==History==


&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Unsettled reefballs.jpg|frame|right|150px|A cluster of reef balls in [[Curaçao]].]] --&gt;

The Reef Ball Foundation was founded in 1993 by Todd Barber, who also founded the Reef Ball Development Group INC. with a goal of helping to preserve and protect coral reefs for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref name="cnn2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/03/06/heroes.barber/index.html |title=Reef restoration provides passion for diver |date=2008-03-07 |work=CNN Heroes |publisher=Cable News Network |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber witnessed his favorite coral reef on [[Grand Cayman]] destroyed by [[Hurricane Gilbert]], and wanted to do something to help increase the [[resilience (ecology)|resiliency]] of eroding coral reefs. Barber and his father [[patent]]ed&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|5564369A|Reef Ball patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of building reef substrate modules with a central inflatable bladder, so that the modules would be [[buoyancy|buoyant]], making them easy to deploy by hand or with a small boat, rather than requiring heavy machinery.

Over the next few years, with the help of research colleagues at [[University of Georgia]], Nationwide Artificial Reef Coordinators and the [[Florida Institute of Technology]], Barber, his colleagues and business partners worked to perfect the design. Reef balls can be found in almost every coastal state in the United States, and on every continent including Antarctica.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Foundation has expanded the scope of its projects to include coral rescue, propagation and transplant operations, beach restorations, [[mangrove]] restorations and [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] development. Reef Ball also participates in education and outreach regarding environmental [[stewardship]] and coral reefs.

In 2001, The Reef Ball Foundation took control of the Reef Ball Development Group, and now operates all aspects of the business as a [[non-profit]] organization. By 2007, the foundation had deployed 550,000 reef balls worldwide.&lt;ref name="wsj2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119334933043772085 |title=From Balls of Concrete To Habitats for Sea Life |last=Naik |first=Gautam |date=2007-10-26 |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reef Ball Foundation manufactures reef balls for open ocean deployment in sizes from {{convert|30|cm|ft|sigfig=1}} in diameter and {{convert|15|kg|lb}}, up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} and {{convert|3500|kg|sigfig=1}}. Reef balls are hollow, and typically have several [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|convex-concave]] holes of varying sizes to most closely approximate natural coral reef conditions by creating [[whirlpool]]s.  Reef balls are made from [[pH]]-balanced [[Silica fume|microsilica]] [[concrete]], and are treated to create a rough surface texture, in order to promote settling by marine organisms such as [[coral]]s, [[algae]], [[coralline algae]] and [[sponge]]s.

Over the last decade, research has been conducted with respect to the ability of artificial reefs to produce or attract [[biomass]],&lt;!-- [http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/AR_BACI_ostenberg_stmary.pdf] dead link 404 on 2009-09-18 --&gt;&lt;ref name="pickering1997"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Helen |last1=Pickering |first2=David |last2=Whitmarsh |year=1997 |title=Artificial reefs and fisheries exploitation |journal=Fisheries Research |issue=31 |pages=39–59 |issn=0165-7836 |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/AR_atr_vs_prod.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-09-18|doi=10.1016/s0165-7836(97)00019-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;the effectiveness of reef balls in replicating natural habitat,&lt;ref name="nyanti2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lee |last1=Nyanti |first2=Nazzatul Asyikin Mohd |last2=Najib |year=2005 |title=Distribution and Diversity of Fishes at Artificial Reef Balls Around Talang-Talang Islands, Sematan |journal=RIMC Research Update |publisher=Universiti Malaysia Sarawak |volume=2 |issue=1 |issn=1675-5820 |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/sarawakresults.htm |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sherman2002"&gt;{{cite journal |first=RL |last=Sherman, |year=2002 |title=Artificial reef design: void space, complexity, and attractants |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |publisher=International Council for the Exploration of the Sea |volume=59 |pages=196–200 |issn=1054-3139 |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/reefball_voids.pdf |format=pdf |doi=10.1006/jmsc.2001.1163 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mitigating disasters.&lt;ref name="quinn2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/Hypothesis-based%20Restoration%20Study%20For%20Mitigation%20of%20a%20Damaged%20SE%20Florida%20Coral%20Reef%20A%20Work%20in%20Progress.htm |title=Hypothesis-based Restoration Study For Mitigation of a Damaged SE Florida Coral Reef |first1=TP |last1=Quinn |first2=EA |last2=Glynn |first3=RE |last3=Dodge |first4=K |last4=Banks |first5=L |last5=Fisher |first6=RE |last6=Spieler |date=2005-08-12 |publisher=National Coral Reef Institute |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of reef balls as [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s and for beach stabilization has been extensively studied.&lt;ref name="miami2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/FSMiami.pdf |format=pdf |title=Miami Beach, Florida |date=September 2004 |work=National Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program (Section 227) |publisher=U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harris2003"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Harris |first=Lee E |date=June 2003 |title=Artificial Reef Structures for Shoreline Stabilization and Habitat Enhancement |conference=Proceedings of the 3rd International Surfing Reef Symposium, Raglan, New Zealand |pages=176–8 |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/Lee%20Harris_ASR_RBBW.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harris2005b"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Lee E |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/CancunHotelRBstability.htm |title=Stability analysis performed for the proposed submerged artificial reef breakwater |date=2005-08-12 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Antigua]], undertaking 4,700 modules were deployed around the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reefinnovations.com/projects/western-atlantic/caribbean-reef-balls/antigua|title=Antigua|website=Reef Innovations|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Malaysia]], 5,000 reef balls were deployed around protected [[sea turtle]] nesting islands to deter netting, successfully increasing nesting numbers.
* In [[Campeche]], [[Mexico]], over 4,000 reef balls deployed by local [[fishing]] communities to enhance [[fisheries|fishery]] resources.
* In [[Tampa Bay]], USA, reef balls were installed beneath [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s, in front of [[sea wall]]s, and as a submerged breakwater to create oyster reefs.
* In [[Phuket, Thailand]], reef balls were planted with corals after the [[Boxing Day Tsunami]] to help restore [[tourism]].
* In [[Indonesia]], locals and [[Newmont Mining|P.T. Newmont]] used reef balls to [[Environmental mitigation|mitigate]] damage from [[mining]] operations and restore thousands of coral heads.
* In Australia, reef balls have been used to enhance fisheries in New South Wales.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Designed artificial reefs===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}

The trend in artificial reef development has been toward the construction of designed artificial reefs, built from materials specifically designed to function as reefs. Designed systems (such as reef balls) can be modified to achieve a variety of goals. These include coral reef [[wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], fishery enhancement, [[snorkeling]] and [[Scuba diving|diving]] trails, beach erosion protection, [[surfing]] enhancement, [[spawn (biology)|fish spawning]] sites, planters for [[mangrove]] replanting, enhancement of [[lobster]] [[fishery|fisheries]], creation of oyster reefs, estuary [[land rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], and even exotic uses such as deep water ''[[Oculina]]'' coral replanting.  Designed systems can overcome many of the problems associated with "materials of opportunity" such as stability in [[storms]], durability, biological fit, lack of potential [[pollution]] problems, availability, and reduction in long term artificial reef costs.

Designed reefs have been developed specifically for coral reef rehabilitation, and can therefore be used in a more specific [[Ecological niche|niche]] than materials of opportunity. Some examples of specialized adaptations which "designed reefs" can use include: specialized surface textures, coral planting attachment points, specialized pH-neutral surfaces (such as neutralized concrete, [[ceramic]]s or [[mineral|mineral accretion]] surfaces), fissures to create [[Ocean current|currents]] for corals, and avoidance of materials such as [[iron]] (which may cause [[algae]] to overgrow coral).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Other types of designed systems can create [[aquaculture]] opportunities for lobsters, create oyster beds, or be used for a large variety of other specialized needs.

The '''theological veto''' is the [[concept]] in [[philosophy of religion]] that [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] are impious and that [[God]], not [[reason]], is sovereign.&lt;ref name="ferre"&gt;[[Frederick Ferré]], ''Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2013}} This concept is held as true by some [[Theism|theists]], especially [[Religious fundamentalism|religious fundamentalists]].

The idea is derived from a belief that mankind is [[Total depravity|depraved]], and its [[intellect]] is a flawed product of this [[Fall of man|fallenness]]. In this view [[religious conversion|conversion]], not reason, is the way to the truth; [[preaching]], not [[argument]], is the way to [[persuasion|persuade]]; and [[divine grace|grace]], not [[evidence]] is the way [[belief]] is confirmed. In this view, natural reason is so profoundly hostile to the divine that holding it above [[faith]] is tantamount to worshiping a sinful creature as an [[idolatry|idol]]. Even the use of [[reason]] on behalf of faith is rejected under the theological veto, as it shows faithlessness. It presupposes by practice that faith can be benefited by reason.

==Usage==
An early use of the phrase is reported from a 1925 critique of opponents of [[evolution]]: "They meet the accumulating evidences of the descent of man with a theological veto. They set the limit to science by the quotation of a verse from the creation legend "Genesis.""&lt;ref&gt;American Ethical Union, ''The Ethical Outlook'', Volume 12, 1925, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rejecting the theological veto ==
There are several reasons put forth by those who reject the theological veto. One way to reject the theological veto is to assert that one cannot isolate reason from faith. Intelligible use of language is claimed to commit one to [[consistency]], so to reject reason is to refuse to make sense. This argument asserts that even the theological veto itself must be consistent with itself and inconsistent with reason. Another way the theological veto is rejected is to assert that rejection of critical control over one's beliefs, as for instance by the requirement of evidence, lowers the barrier against [[bigotry]], [[fanaticism]], and [[persecution]]. While its high aspiration is to warn against human [[pride]], some say its supporters are guilty of what they themselves claim is the highest form of pride: They claim that they know the mind of God.&lt;ref name="ferre" /&gt;

'''Urban Agricultural Architecture (UAA)''' is the practice of integrating [[Organic farming|organic]], [[hydroponic]], [[aeroponic]] or [[aquaponic]] [[Agricultural science|farming technologies]] into buildings of all types.  An example can be as small as building a lean-to-[[greenhouse]] on a single-family home and using it as a [[kitchen garden]].  Examples of large-scale projects are the hydroponic greenhouses of [[Lufa Farms]], the rooftop farms of [[Brooklyn Grange]] Rooftop Farm,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.growingagreenerworld.com/episode322/&lt;/ref&gt; and the vertical farms of Sky Greens.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nFQOkzEjxQ&lt;/ref&gt;  Building types that can incorporate food growing technologies include: single-family home, multi-family housing, mixed-use buildings, schools,&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/nyc/photos-fifth-street-farm-unveils-new-rooftop-farm-designed-by-michael-arad-at-the-east-village-earth-school/&lt;/ref&gt; restaurants,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/photo/rosemary-s-rooftop-farm-/218685.html&lt;/ref&gt; institutional buildings,&lt;ref&gt;http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/am2/publish/General_University_News_2/rooftop_farm.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; vertical farms, hoop houses and greenhouses that are designed to urban conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://popupcity.net/top-5-of-the-greatest-urban-rooftop-farms/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vertical Farm Video".

'''Vensim''' is [[simulation software]] developed by Ventana Systems. It primarily supports [[continuous simulation]] ([[System Dynamics|system dynamics]]), with some [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] and [[agent-based model]]ling capabilities. It is available commercially and as a free "Personal Learning Edition".

== Modeling environment ==

Vensim provides a graphical modeling interface with [[stock and flow]] and [[causal loop diagram]]s, on top of a text-based system of equations in a [[declarative programming]] language. It includes a patented method for interactive tracing of behavior through causal links in model structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vensim.com/causal-tracing/|title=Vensim Causal Tracing™|website=Vensim - Ventana Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/EP0527907A1?cl=en&amp;dq=causal+tracing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVhI3i2ZbOAhWLKCYKHbilAGkQ6AEIHjAA|title=Simulation system employing causal tracing. US Patent Application EP19910909851, Feb. 26 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/5428740|title=Applying successive data group operations to an active data group. Patent # 5,428,740|website=Justitia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a language extension for automating quality control experiments on models called Reality Check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sdr.4260100205/pdf|title=Reality check: A bridge between systems thinking and system dynamics|first1=David W.|last1=Peterson|first2=Robert L.|last2=Eberlein|journal=System Dynamics Review|volume=10|issue=2–3|pages=159–174|year=1994|doi=10.1002/sdr.4260100205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modeling language supports arrays (subscripts) and permits mapping among dimensions and aggregation. Built-in allocation functions satisfy constraints that are sometimes not met by conventional approaches like [[logit]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://vensim.com/allocation-by-priority-alloc-p/ Vensim Allocation by Priority]&lt;/ref&gt; It supports discrete delays, queues and a variety of stochastic processes.

There are multiple paths for cross sectional and time-series data import and export, including text files, spreadsheets and ODBC. Models may be calibrated against data using optimization, [[Kalman Filter]]ing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/27424|title=Hypothesis, estimation, and validation of dynamic social models : energy demand modeling|last1=Peterson|first1=David Walter|year=1975|type=Ph.D.|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods. Sensitivity analysis options provide a variety of ways to test and sample models, including Monte Carlo simulation with Latin Hypercube sampling.

Vensim model files can be packaged and published in a customizable read-only format that can be executed by a freely available Model Reader. This allows sharing of interactive models with users who do not own the program and/or who the model author does not wish to have access to the model's code base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vensim.com/vensim-model-reader/|title=Vensim Model Reader|website=Vensim - Ventana Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[forestry]], '''windthrow''' or '''blowdown''' refers to [[tree]]s uprooted or broken by [[wind]]. 
Breakage of the tree [[bole (botany)|bole]] (trunk) instead of uprooting is sometimes called '''windsnap'''.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Douglas C.|title=Identifying Trees at Risk from Ice and Wind|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/lands_forests_pdf/icewind.pdf|publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|date=1999|quote=Damage such as this often renders a tree bole susceptible to “windsnap” at the point of injury.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Windthrow is common in all forested parts of the world that experience storms or high wind speeds. The risk of windthrow to a tree is related to the tree's size (height and diameter), the 'sail area' presented by its crown, the anchorage provided by its roots, its exposure to the wind, and the local wind climate. A common way of quantifying the risk of windthrow to a forest area is to model the probability or 'return time' of a wind speed that would damage those trees at that location. Tree [[senescence]] can also be a factor, where multiple factors contributing to the declining health of a tree reduce its anchorage and therefore increase its susceptibility to windthrow. The resulting damage can be a significant factor in the development of a forest.

Windthrow can also increase following [[logging]], especially in young [[Forest management|forests managed]] specifically for [[timber]]. The removal of trees at a forest's edge increases the exposure of the remaining trees to the wind.

Trees that grow adjacent to lakes or other natural forest edges, or in exposed situations such as hill sides, develop greater rooting strength through growth feedback with wind movement, i.e. 'adaptive' or 'acclimative' growth. If a tree does not experience much wind movement during the [[stem exclusion]] phase of [[forest dynamics|stand succession]], it is not likely to develop a resistance to wind. Thus, when a fully or partially developed stand is bisected by a new road or by a [[clearcutting|clearcut]], the trees on the new edge are less supported by neighbouring trees than they were and may not be capable of withstanding the higher forces which they now experience.

Trees with heavy growths of [[ivy]], [[wisteria]], or [[kudzu]] are already stressed and may be more susceptible to windthrow, as the additional foliage increases the tree's sail area.

Trees with decayed trunk, [[fungus]]-induced [[canker]]s and [[woodboring beetle|borer]] damages are more susceptible to "windsnap".&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;

== Ecological effects ==
Windthrow disturbance generates a variety of unique ecological resources on which certain forest processes are highly dependent. Windthrow can be considered a cataclysmic [[abiotic factor]] that can generate an entire new chain of [[Seral community|seral plant succession]] in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 ''Abiotic factor''. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment]. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt; Windthrow can also be considered to act as a rejuvenating process whereby regeneration is made possible with new resource availability.

Severe uprooting opens bare patches of mineral soil that can act as seed sinks. These patches have been shown, in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States, to have higher [[biodiversity]] than the surrounding forest floor. Additionally, the gap created in the forest canopy when windthrow occurs yields an increase in light, moisture, and nutrient availability in near proximity to the disturbance.

Toppled trees have the potential of becoming [[nurse log]]s, nurturing habitats for other forest organisms.
