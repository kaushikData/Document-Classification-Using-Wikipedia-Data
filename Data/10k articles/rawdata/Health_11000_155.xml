The '''2020 Vision Initiative''' in an initiative of the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI).&lt;ref name="ifpri.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpri.org/book-753/ourwork/program/2020-vision-food-agriculture-and-environment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715093814/http://www.ifpri.org/book-753/ourwork/program/2020-vision-food-agriculture-and-environment |archivedate=2010-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IFPRI launched the 2020 Vision Initiative in 1993; the primary goal of the initiative is to reach sustainable [[food security]] for all by 2020. The Initiative also supports the goals set at the [[Food security|World Food Summit]] in 1996, to halve the number of chronically undernourished people on the Earth by the year 2015.

The 2020 Vision Initiative has two primary objectives:

*To develop and promote a shared vision and consensus for action for meeting [[food]] needs while reducing [[poverty]] and protecting [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]]; and
*To generate information and encourage debate to influence action by national governments, [[nongovernmental organization]]s, the private sector, international development institutions, and other elements of civil society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">'''3D Indiana''' is a commercial [[Educational software]] for teaching and [[research]] on the [[human anatomy]]. The name is an [[acronym]] for [[3D computer graphics|Three-Dimensional]] [[Interactive]] [[Digital data|Digital]] [[Human anatomy|Anatomy]]. This software is based &lt;ref&gt;[http://eruditesays.blogspot.com/2008/05/3d-indiana-virtual-human-body.html Virtual Human Body] (Retrieved on 14 Oct 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; on the principles of ''volumetric anatomy'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indmedica.com/journals.php?journalid=8&amp;issueid=95&amp;articleid=1300&amp;action=article Jerome Kalister, ''Volumetric Anatomy–An introduction'', J of Anatomical Soc of India,  Vol. 56, No. 1 (2007-01 - 2007-06)]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses three intersecting coordinate planes to locate the organs of the human body based on mathematical calculations. This is in contrast to the traditional method of describing the location of the organs in relation to one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/13/stories/2008101354640300.htm 'Demonstration on interactive digital anatomy'], ''The Hindu'', 13 October 2008 (Retrieved on 14 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The Gall bladder is traditionally described thus: 'It is situated on the right side of the body closely in contact with the inferior surface of the liver, along the right edge of the quadrate lobe in a shallow fossa extending from the right edge of the porta hepatis to the inferior lobe of the liver'.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://volumetricanatomy.com/] (Retrieved on 16 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
This [[patent|patent-pending]] software was designed by the Kalister Foundation led by Jerome Kalister, an alumnus of TD Medical College, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdmedicos.com/ TD Medical College, Alappuzha ] (Retrieved on 14 Oct 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alapuzha]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]. A team of about fifteen professionals of the Foundation worked for nearly three years to create the software. It was formally unveiled at TD Medical College by Jerome Kalister on 13 October 2008 before an audience of more than a thousand students and staff of various medical colleges in [[Kerala]].&lt;ref name="News"&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080609/jsp/nation/story_9385445.jsp 'An ‘Indiana’ for doctors',] ''Telegraph'', 9 June 2008(Retrieved on 14 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/14/stories/2008101454380700.htm, 'World’s first virtual human body unveiled',] ''The Hindu'', 14 October 2008 (Retrieved on 14 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
According to its creators, 3D Indiana is a [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[human body]] and its use would be complementary to the conventional mode of [[anatomy]] studies. Eventually this software may replace the human [[cadaver]]s in anatomical studies. Without any additional programming, a researcher could elicit normal body responses from this [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[human|body]]. This gives the package the potential as a tool for doing [[clinical trials]] of [[drug]]s and [[chemical]]s in it.
 
Every named structure in the body is [[Digital data|digital]]ly recreated in detail and deployed in their true anatomical positions in the body. By clicking on any part of the body using a computer mouse, the user can get the name of the part displayed and can zoom in, rotate or isolate the part for further details.

== Endorsements ==
The 3D Indiana package has been already endorsed by the Anatomical society of India.&lt;ref&gt;For more about Anatomical Society of India : [http://www.jpgmonline.com/text.asp?2002/48/3/243/89 History of Anatomy in India, Journal of Postgraduate Medicine Vol. 48.3 Jul-Sep 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kalister Foundation is in discussion with the National Rural Health Mission for its endorsement of 3D Indiana as an educational software suitable for application in medical colleges.&lt;ref name="News"/&gt;

'''4-Chloro-''o''-toluidine''' ('''4-COT''', '''4-chloro-2-methylaniline''') is the [[organic compound]] with the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It is a colorless solid.  The compound is produced as an intermediate to the pesticide [[chlordimeform]] and a precursor to some azo dyes. Production has declined after it was shown to be highly [[carcinogen]]ic.

== Production and use ==
It is produced by the [[chlorination reaction]] of N-aceyl[[toluidine]] followed by deprotection and separation from the 6-chloro isomer.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Bowers, "Toluidines" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a27_159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of 4-chloro-''o''-toluidine began in [[Germany]] in 1924. In [[Switzerland]], 4-COT and its salts were produced between 1956 and 1976.  Production and distribution ceased in 1979 in the US and in 1986 in Germany.

In nature, 4-COT is found in plants and animals as a [[metabolism|metabolic product]] of [[chlordimeform]].&lt;ref&gt;IARC Monograph Vol. 48, p-Chloro-o-Toluidine and its strong salts&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental carcinogenicity and toxic effects in man ==
In chronic feeding studies ([[mice]] of both sexes), 4-COT induces [[hemangiosarcoma]]s and [[hemangioendothelioma]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Weisburger E.K. et al., Testing of twenty-one environ. aromatic amines or derivatives for long-term toxicity or carcinogenicity, J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol., 1987, 2, 326-356&lt;/ref&gt;

4-COT becomes covalently bound to [[DNA]] of [[rat]]s and mice [[liver]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley P. et al., Species differences in the toxicity of p-chloro-o-toluidine to rats and mice. Covalent binding to [[hepatic]] [[macromolecule]]s and hepatic non-[[parenchyma]]l cell DNA, Chem.-biol. Interact., 1986, 57, 27-40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inhalation]] or skin contact with 4-COT produces [[Acute toxicity|acute]] [[toxicity|toxic]] effects, initially appearing as macroscopic or microscopic [[hematuria|haematuria]]. Further symptoms include [[dysuria]], reduced [[urinary bladder|bladder]] capacity and pain the lower [[abdomen]]. [[Hemorrhagic cystitis|Haemorrhagic cystitis]] is the main symptom of acute toxicity, with [[Methemoglobinemia|methaemoglobinaemia]] was observed in 50% of poisoning cases.&lt;ref&gt;Stasik M.J., Urinary bladder cancer after 4-chloro-o-toluidine. Dtsch. med. Wschr., 1991, 116, 1444-1447 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiological studies of cancer ==
No urinary bladder cancer was found in two of the earlier [[epidemic|epidemiological]] reports of workers exposed to 4-COT in Switzerland and in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Uebelin F., Pletscher A., [[etiology (medicine)|Aetiology]] and [[prophylaxis]] of industrial [[tumor]]s in the dye industry, Schweiz. med. Wschr., 1954, 84, 917-928 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ott M.G., Langner R.R., A mortality survey of men engaged in the manufacture of organic dyes, J. Occupational Medicine, 1983, 225, 763-768&lt;/ref&gt;

Stasik ''et al.'' obtained similar results in their previous mortality study carried out on a [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] of 335 male employees exposed to 4-COT at plants in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;Stasik M.J. et al., A historic cohort study of 4-chloro-2-methylaniline workers, Proceedings of the MEDICHEM Meeting, Bahia, Brazil, 1985, London, ICI plc, 2-11&lt;/ref&gt;

A subcohort of 116 subjects in the 4-COT cohort, engaged in the synthesis of 4-COT at the old production plant with presumably higher level of exposure to this monocyclic arylamine, was separated from the Frankfurt cohort of 335 men, for further research.

Stasik then conducted a retrospective study of the incidence of bladder cancer among workers restricted to this subcohort. His investigation revealed eight subjects in whom bladder [[carcinoma]]s were diagnosed between 1967 and 1985. Two of them had already died. The standardized incidence rate for bladder carcinomas in the 4-COT subcohort was 73 times higher than expected.

[[Histology|Histologically]], all tumor cases were [[urothelium|urothelial]] carcinomas.&lt;ref&gt;Stasik M.J., Carcinomas of the urinary bladder in a 4-chloro-o-toluidine cohort, Int. Arch. Occup. Environ. Health, 1988, 60, 21-24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation of carcinogenic risk to man ==
The [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (German Research Council) defined 4-COT as a human carcinogen (III A1). Besides Germany, 4-COT is listed as a carcinogen in [[Finland]] and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;DFG Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Council), Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the Work Area, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Further in 1990 the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) classified 4-COT as a probable human carcinogen (2A).

Both assessments were based on the results of the subcohort incidence study.

== Further studies of cancer ==
Also in [[China]] an increased incidence of bladder cancer among farm workers exposed to chlordimeform has been reported in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Xue S. et al., The risk assessment of occupational exposure to chlordimeform, 23rd Intern. Congress on Occupational Health, 1990, Montreal&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Popp, Norpoth ''et al.'' found seven persons suffering from bladder cancer among 49 workers involved in the synthesis of chlordimeform from 4-COT in another German plant.&lt;ref&gt;Popp W. et al., Incidence of bladder cancer in cohort of workers exposed to 4-chloro-o-toluidine while synthesizing chlordimeform, Br. J. Ind. Med., 1992, 49, 529-531&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later Stasik carried out a follow-up study of the same 4-COT subcohort studied by him previously. His re-investigations revealed a cluster of four new cases of [[bladder tumor]]s in this group. So the total evidence of bladder cancer in the 4-COT subcohort increased to 12 cases, which makes 10% of all members of this particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Stasik M.J., Current studies of 4-chloro-o-toluidine and chlordimeform carcinogenicity, 26th Intern. Congress on Occupational Health, 2000, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships''' (APPS, 33 U.S.C. §§1905-1915) is a [[United States]] law that implements the provisions of [[MARPOL]] and the annexes to which the United States is a party. The most recent U.S. action concerning MARPOL occurred in April 2006, when the [[U.S. Senate]] approved Annex VI, which regulates [[air pollution]] (Treaty Doc. 108-7, Exec. Rept. 109-13). Following that approval, in March 2007, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] approved legislation to implement the standards in Annex VI (H.R. 802), through regulations to be promulgated by [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] in consultation with the [[U.S. Coast Guard]].

APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged [[ships]] anywhere in the world and to all [[flag of convenience|foreign-flagged]] vessels operating in [[navigability|navigable]] waters of the United States or while at port under U.S. jurisdiction. The [[Coast Guard]] has primary responsibility to prescribe and enforce regulations necessary to implement APPS in these waters. The regulatory mechanism established in APPS to implement MARPOL is separate and distinct from the [[Clean Water Act]] and other federal [[environmental law]]s.

The H.R. 6665 [[legislation]] was passed by the 96th U.S. Congressional session and signed by the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|39th President of the United States]] Jimmy Carter on October 21, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=45342 |title=Jimmy Carter: "Act to Prevent Pollution From Ships Statement on Signing H.R. 6665 Into Law. ," October 21, 1980 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8833">The '''Barangay Health Volunteer''', also known as '''Barangay Health Worker''', is a category of [[health care provider]]s in the [[Philippines]]. They undergo a basic training program under an accredited government or non-government organization, and render [[primary care]] services in the community. They provide services such as first aid, maternal, neonatal, and child health, and community-based interventions including immunization clinics for [[barangay]]s (local neighborhoods).&lt;ref name="Red Cross"&gt;Red Cross. [http://www.redcross.ca/article.asp?id=1021&amp;tid=001 Philippines: Health.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512031056/http://www.redcross.ca/article.asp?id=1021&amp;tid=001 |date=May 12, 2012 }} Accessed 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
With the decentralization of healthcare through the 1991 Local Government Code, the responsibility of delivery of primary health services were transferred from the central government to locally elected provincial, city, and municipal governments. Health services were previously funded and managed by the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] but were transferred to the local governments after the devolution of the healthcare system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lakshminarayanan|first=Rama|date=May 2003|title=Decentralisation and its implications for reproductive health: the Philippines experience|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|volume=11|issue=21|pages=96–107|issn=0968-8080|pmid=12800707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and practice==
Barangay Health Workers are accredited to function as such by the local health board in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Philippines Department of Health]], as defined in Sec. 3 of Republic Act No. 7883.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doh.gov.ph/ra7883.htm  Philipinnes Department of Health.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122054937/http://doh.gov.ph/ra7883.htm |date=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This act, also known as "Barangay Health Workers' Benefits and Incentives Act of 1995", recognizes the need for primary health care and organizes health workers to promote health empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcw.gov.ph/law/republic-act-7883|title=Republic Act 7883 {{!}} Philippine Commission on Women|website=pcw.gov.ph|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barangay health workers are a type of [[community health worker]]s and act as health advocates and educators within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inobaya|first=Marianette T.|last2=Chau|first2=Thao N.|last3=Ng|first3=Shu-Kay|last4=MacDougall|first4=Colin|last5=Olveda|first5=Remigio M.|last6=Tallo|first6=Veronica L.|last7=Landicho|first7=Jhoys M.|last8=Malacad|first8=Carol M.|last9=Aligato|first9=Mila F.|date=January 2018|title=Mass drug administration and the sustainable control of schistosomiasis: Community health workers are vital for global elimination efforts|journal=International journal of infectious diseases: IJID: official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases|volume=66|pages=14–21|doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2017.10.023|issn=1878-3511|pmid=29128644}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live in the communities they serve and receive about five weeks of training, ranging from administering immunizations, weighing children, birthing services, etc. They provide information, education and motivation services for primary health care, [[Maternal health|maternal]] and [[child health]], [[Children's rights movement|child rights]], [[family planning]] and [[nutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;Basics Support for Institutionalizing Child Survival Project. [http://www.basics.org/documents/pdf/NEWBORN_HEALTH-PHILIPPINES.pdf ''Newborn Health in the Philippines''.] Arlington, Virginia, June 2004. Accessed 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, each Volunteer is expected to work with around 20 families in their community.&lt;ref name="Red Cross"/&gt; However the scarcity of trained individuals has narrowed down the number of volunteers, especially in some remote areas, where now one or two volunteers service an entire barangay.

== Research ==

Research by Fe Espino at the [[Research Institute for Tropical Medicine]] on dengue prevention in the Philippines shows how community trust of the BHV is vital to the success of behavior change programs. In 2010, the number of dengue cases in the Philippines rose from 37,101 in 2006 to 118,868. Dengue fever is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes which are born in still water. Due to water shortages, households are forced to store water throughout the year. Espino’s research team engaged the local Barangay Health Workers (BHWs) to introduce a household water container management system to control dengue in 2 communities in "Masagana City" in Metro Manila.

In both village ‘A’ and ‘B’, BHWs were trained to teach households to inspect water containers for immature mosquitoes. An instructional guide was provided along with a container management checklist, collected during monthly visits. The team also provided a video of dengue control techniques. Village A, however, encountered many problems and there was a poor response to the program. In Village B participants reported not only that the visits made residents more aware of dengue control, but they were more inclined to take action. Although behaviour change results have not yet been reported, it appears the difference is that the BHWs in Village B were more active and more trusted by the community. This shows that when engaging change agents, it’s important to understand both how the community feels about them and how they feel about their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodwin|first1=Nicholas|title=Change agents make residents feel safer about dengue fever in the Philippines|url=http://tulodo.com/2014/07/02/change-agents-make-residents-feel-safer-about-dengue-fever-in-the-philippines/|website=Tulodo|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Despite the efforts of barangay health volunteers, they are constrained within the political leadership of local government units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Espino|first=Fe|last2=Marco|first2=Jesusa|last3=Salazar|first3=Nelia P.|last4=Salazar|first4=Ferdinand|last5=Mendoza|first5=Ysadora|last6=Velazco|first6=Aldwin|date=December 2012|title=Community-based dengue vector control: experiences in behavior change in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines |journal=Pathogens and Global Health|volume=106|issue=8|pages=455–461|doi=10.1179/2047773212Y.0000000061 |pmc=3541901|pmid=23318237}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a perception that barangay health stations provide low-quality health services and have low-client satisfaction. With funding limitations, barangay health stations struggle with lack of medicines supplies, long wait times, declines in quality of facility infrastructure, and lack of proper training and staffing.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Filipino Report Card on Pro-poor Services|last=World Bank|first=|publisher=East Asia and the Pacific Region Report Number 22181 - PH, Environment and Social Development Sector Unit|year=2001|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rural poor are the most susceptible to poor sanitation, malnutrition, and lack of hygiene efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Allen G.

Volunteers may often be limited in knowledge due to new advances in medicine and lack of proper training. Training is crucial for barangay health workers to improve their health knowledge and competency and provide the best quality care.

They (or their [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] or components) are isolated from [[life|living]] sources—human, animal, plant, fungal, or microbial.

Terminology surrounding biopharmaceuticals varies between groups and entities, with different terms referring to different subsets of therapeutics within the general biopharmaceutical category. Some [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]] use the terms ''biological medicinal products'' or ''therapeutic biological product'' to refer specifically to engineered [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] products like protein- and [[nucleic acid]]-based [[drug]]s, distinguishing them from products like blood, blood components, or vaccines, which are usually extracted directly from a biological source.&lt;ref name="pmid18612293"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rader RA | title = (Re)defining biopharmaceutical | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 743–51 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18612293 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0708-743 | url = http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v26/n7/box/nbt0708-743_BX3.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194516.htm|title=Drugs@FDA Glossary of Terms|date=2 Feb 2012|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|access-date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walsh| first = Gary| name-list-format = vanc | year = 2003 | title = Biopharmaceuticals: Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Second Edition| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd| location =| isbn = 978-0-470-84326-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Specialty drugs]], a recent classification of pharmaceuticals, are high-cost drugs that are often biologics.&lt;ref name="ncbi_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gleason PP, Alexander GC, Starner CI, Ritter ST, Van Houten HK, Gunderson BW, Shah ND | title = Health plan utilization and costs of specialty drugs within 4 chronic conditions | journal = Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy | volume = 19 | issue = 7 | pages = 542–8 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23964615 | doi = 10.18553/jmcp.2013.19.7.542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_2015_07_16"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/business/specialty-pharmacies-proliferate-along-with-questions.html | title=Specialty Pharmacies Proliferate, Along With Questions | publisher=New York Times | date=15 July 2015 | access-date=5 October 2015 | author1=Thomas, Kate | author2=Pollack, Andrew |location=Sinking Spring, Pa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UofW"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://courses.washington.edu/pharm542/Week4/slidesSpecialty%20Pharmacy%20%20Managed%20Care%20Strategies%200410.pdf | title=Specialty Pharmacy Managed Care Strategies | access-date=24 September 2015 | last = Murphy | first = Chad O. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Medicines Agency]] uses the term ''advanced therapy medicinal products'' (ATMPs) for medicines for human use that are "based on genes, cells, or tissue engineering",&lt;ref name="EMA_CAT"&gt;{{Citation |author=European Medicines Agency |author-link=European Medicines Agency |title=Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/about_us/general/general_content_000266.jsp |access-date=2017-05-15 |section=tooltip definition of advanced therapy medicinal products |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; including gene therapy medicines, somatic-cell therapy medicines, tissue-engineered medicines, and combinations thereof.&lt;ref name="EMA_ATMPs"&gt;{{Citation |author=European Medicines Agency |author-link=European Medicines Agency |title=Advanced therapy medicinal products |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/general/general_content_000294.jsp |access-date=2017-05-15 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within EMA contexts, the term ''advanced therapies'' refers specifically to ATMPs, although that term is rather nonspecific outside those contexts.

Gene-based and cellular biologics, for example, often are at the forefront of [[biomedical]] research, and may be used to treat a variety of medical conditions for which no other treatments are available.&lt;ref name="FDA_FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194516.htm | title = What is a biological product? | access-date = 2014-02-09 | author = Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research | date = 2010-04-01 | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some jurisdictions, biologics are regulated via different pathways than other small molecule drugs and [[medical devices]].&lt;ref name="pmid18958946"&gt;{{cite journal | author = United States Food and Drug Administration | title = Supplemental applications proposing labeling changes for approved drugs, biologics, and medical devices.

The term '''biopharmacology''' is sometimes used to describe the branch of pharmacology that studies biopharmaceuticals.

==Major classes==
[[File:FreshFrozenPlasma.JPG|thumb|right|120px|[[Blood plasma]] is a type of biopharmaceutical directly extracted from living systems.]]

===Extracted from living systems===
Some of the oldest forms of biologics are extracted from the bodies of animals, and other humans especially. Important biologics include:

* [[Whole blood]] and other blood components
* [[organ transplantation|Organs]] and [[tissue transplant]]s
* [[Stem cell therapy]]
* [[Antibodies]] for [[passive immunization]] (e.g., to treat a [[virus]] infection)
* [[Breast milk|Human breast milk]]
* [[Fecal microbiota transplant|Fecal microbiota]]
* [[Human fertilization|Human reproductive cells]]

Some biologics that were previously extracted from animals, such as insulin, are now more commonly produced by [[recombinant DNA]].

===Produced by recombinant DNA===
{{see also|Biologics for immunosuppression}}

As indicated the term "biologics" can be used to refer to a wide range of biological products in medicine. However, in most cases, the term "biologics" is used more restrictively for a class of therapeutics (either approved or in development) that are produced by means of biological processes involving [[recombinant DNA]] technology. These medications are usually one of three types:
# Substances that are (nearly) identical to the body's own key signalling proteins. Examples are the blood-production stimulating protein [[erythropoetin]], or the growth-stimulating hormone named (simply) "[[growth hormone]]" or biosynthetic human [[insulin]] and its analogues.
# [[Monoclonal antibodies]]. These are similar to the antibodies that the human immune system uses to fight off bacteria and viruses, but they are "custom-designed" (using [[hybridoma]] technology or other methods) and can therefore be made specifically to counteract or block any given substance in the body, or to target any specific cell type; examples of such monoclonal antibodies for use in various diseases are given in the table below.
# Receptor constructs ([[fusion protein]]s), usually based on a naturally occurring receptor linked to the [[immunoglobulin]] frame. In this case, the receptor provides the construct with detailed specificity, whereas the immunoglobulin-structure imparts stability and other useful features in terms of [[pharmacology]]. Some examples are listed in the table below.

Biologics as a class of medications in this narrower sense have had a profound impact on many medical fields, primarily [[rheumatology]] and [[oncology]], but also [[cardiology]], [[dermatology]], [[gastroenterology]], [[neurology]], and others. In most of these disciplines, biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which no effective therapies were available, and others where previously existing therapies were clearly inadequate. However, the advent of biologic therapeutics has also raised complex regulatory issues (see below), and significant pharmacoeconomic concerns, because the cost for biologic therapies has been dramatically higher than for conventional (pharmacological) medications. This factor has been particularly relevant since many biological medications are used for the treatment of [[chronic diseases]], such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of otherwise untreatable cancer during the remainder of life. The cost of treatment with a typical monoclonal antibody therapy for relatively common indications is generally in the range of €7,000–14,000 per patient per year.

Older patients who receive biologic therapy for diseases such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], or [[ankylosing spondylitis]] are at increased risk for life-threatening infection, adverse cardiovascular events, and [[malignancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr LD | title = The use of biologic agents in the geriatric population | journal = J Musculoskel Med | volume = 27 | pages = 175–180 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.musculoskeletalnetwork.com/arthritis/content/article/1145622/1562177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic "human" [[insulin]] made via [[recombinant DNA]]. Sometimes referred to as rHI, under the [[trade name]] [[Humulin]], was developed by [[Genentech]], but licensed to [[Eli Lilly and Company]], who manufactured and marketed it starting in 1982.

Major kinds of biopharmaceuticals include:
*Blood factors ([[Factor VIII]] and [[Factor IX]])
*Thrombolytic agents ([[tissue plasminogen activator]])
*[[Hormones]] ([[insulin]], glucagon, growth hormone, gonadotrophins)
*Haematopoietic growth factors ([[Erythropoietin]], [[colony stimulating factors]])
*[[Interferons]] (Interferons-α, -β, -γ)
*[[Interleukin]]-based products (Interleukin-2)
*[[Vaccines]] ([[Hepatitis B]] surface [[antigen]])
*[[Monoclonal antibodies]] (Various)
*Additional products ([[tumour necrosis factor]], therapeutic enzymes)

Research and development investment in new medicines by the biopharmaceutical industry stood at $65.2 billion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many vaccines are grown in tissue cultures.

===Gene therapy===
[[Viral gene therapy]] involves artificially manipulating a [[virus]] to include a desirable piece of genetic material.

==Biosimilars==
{{Main article|Biosimilars}}

With the expiration of numerous [[patents]] for [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster biologics]] between 2012 and 2019, the interest in biosimilar production, i.e., follow-on biologics, has increased.&lt;ref name=biosimilars&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calo-Fernández B, Martínez-Hurtado JL | title = Biosimilars: company strategies to capture value from the biologics market | journal = Pharmaceuticals | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = 1393–408 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 24281342 | pmc = 3816668 | doi = 10.3390/ph5121393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[small molecules]] that consist of chemically identical [[active ingredients]], biologics are vastly more complex and consist of a multitude of subspecies. Due to their heterogeneity and the high process sensitivity, originators and follow-on biosimilars will exhibit variability in specific variants over time, however the safety and clinical performance of both originator and biosimilar biopharmaceuticals must remain equivalent throughout their lifecycle.&lt;ref name="pmid21478841"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiestl M, Stangler T, Torella C, Cepeljnik T, Toll H, Grau R | title = Acceptable changes in quality attributes of glycosylated biopharmaceuticals | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 310–2 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21478841 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamanna WC, Holzmann J, Cohen HP, Guo X, Schweigler M, Stangler T, Seidl A, Schiestl M | title = Maintaining consistent quality and clinical performance of biopharmaceuticals | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 369–379 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29285958 | doi = 10.1080/14712598.2018.1421169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Process variations are monitored by modern analytical tools (e.g., [[liquid chromatography]], [[immunoassays]], [[mass spectrometry]], etc.) and describe a unique design space for each biologic.

Thus, biosimilars require a different regulatory framework compared to small-molecule generics. Legislation in the 21st century has addressed this by recognizing an intermediate ground of testing for biosimilars. The filing pathway requires more testing than for small-molecule generics, but less testing than for registering completely new therapeutics.&lt;ref name="biosimilars2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nick C | title = The US Biosimilars Act: Challenges Facing Regulatory Approval | url = http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26030/The_US_Biosimilars_Act__Challenges_Facing.1.aspx | journal = Pharm Med | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 145–152 | year = 2012 | doi=10.1007/bf03262388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[European Medicines Agency]] introduced an adapted pathway for biosimilars, termed [[biosimilar|''similar biological medicinal products'']]. This pathway is based on a thorough demonstration of "comparability" of the "similar" product to an existing approved product.&lt;ref name="EMA1"&gt;{{cite web | url =  http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Medicine_QA/2009/12/WC500020062.pdf | title = Questions and answers on biosimilar medicines (similar biological medicinal products) | access-date = 2014-10-11 | author = EMA | date = 2008-10-30 | publisher = European Medicines Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product.&lt;ref name=" biosimilars2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="urlwww.gpo.gov"&gt;{{Federal Register|75|61497}}; {{cite web | url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-10-05/pdf/2010-24853.pdf | title = Approval Pathway for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products | author = United States Food and Drug Administration | work = Public Hearing; Request for Comments | date = 2010-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major hope linked to the introduction of biosimilars is a reduction of costs to the patients and the healthcare system.&lt;ref name = biosimilars /&gt;

==Commercialization==
When a new biopharmaceutical is developed, the company will typically apply for a [[patent]], which is a grant for exclusive manufacturing rights. This is the primary means by which the developer of the drug can recover the investment cost for development of the biopharmaceutical. The [[United States patent law|patent laws]] in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] differ somewhat on the requirements for a patent, with the European requirements are perceived as more difficult to satisfy. The total number of patents granted for biopharmaceuticals has risen significantly since the 1970s. In 1978 the total patents granted was 30. This had climbed to 15,600 in 1995, and by 2001 there were 34,527 patent applications.&lt;ref name="scientific_thomson_2006"&gt;{{cite web | first=Luke |last=Foster| title=Patenting in the Biopharmaceutical Industry&amp;mdash;comparing the US with Europe| url=http://scientific.thomson.com/free/ipmatters/pii/8180019/| access-date=2006-06-23 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060316164416/http://scientific.thomson.com/free/ipmatters/pii/8180019/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archive-date = 2006-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the US had the highest IP (Intellectual Property) generation within the biopharmaceutical industry, generating 37 percent of the total number of granted patents worldwide, however, there is still a large margin for growth and innovation within the industry. Revisions to the current IP system to ensure greater reliability for R&amp;D (research and development) investments is a prominent topic of debate in the US as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growth and Policies Behind Biopharmaceutical Innovation|url=https://www.phrma.org/press-release/new-report-reveals-growth-trajectories-and-top-policy-factors-affecting-biopharmaceutical-innovation-and-growth|website=phrma.org|publisher=PhRMA|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood products and other human derived biologics like breast milk, have highly regulated or very hard to access markets, therefore, customers generally face a supply shortage for these products due to their nature and often institutions housing these biologics, designated as 'banks', cannot distribute their product to customers effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erincarlyle/2012/06/27/blood-money-the-guys-who-trade-your-blood-for-profit/#2ec937e46884|title=The Guys Who Trade Your Blood For Profit|last=Carlyle|first=Erin|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, banks for reproductive cells are much more widespread and available due to the ease of which [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] and [[egg cell]]s are able to be used for fertility treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spermdonorsaustralia.com.au/|title=Sperm Donors Australia {{!}} Donate Sperm|website=www.spermdonorsaustralia.com.au|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Large-scale production ==
Biopharmaceuticals may be produced from microbial cells (e.g., [[Escherichia coli|recombinant ''E. coli'']] or yeast cultures), mammalian cell lines (see [[cell culture]]) and plant cell cultures (see [[plant tissue culture]]) and [[moss]] plants in [[bioreactor]]s of various configurations, including [[photo-bioreactors]].&lt;ref name="pmid17701058"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Decker EL, Reski R | title = Current achievements in the production of complex biopharmaceuticals with moss bioreactors | journal = Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–9 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17701058 | doi = 10.1007/s00449-007-0151-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Important issues of concern are cost of production (low-volume, high-purity products are desirable) and microbial contamination (by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[mycoplasma]]). Alternative platforms of production which are being tested include whole plants ([[plant-made pharmaceuticals]]).

=== Transgenics ===
{{main article|Pharming (genetics)}}
A potentially controversial method of producing biopharmaceuticals involves [[transgenic]] organisms, particularly plants and animals that have been [[genetically modified]] to produce drugs. This production is a significant risk for the investor, due to production failure or scrutiny from regulatory bodies based on perceived risks and ethical issues. Biopharmaceutical crops also represent a risk of cross-contamination with non-engineered crops, or crops engineered for non-medical purposes.

One potential approach to this technology is the creation of a transgenic mammal that can produce the biopharmaceutical in its milk, blood, or urine. Once an animal is produced, typically using the [[Microinjection#Pronuclear injection|pronuclear microinjection]] method, it becomes efficacious to use cloning technology to create additional offspring that carry the favorable modified genome.&lt;ref name="pmid11017040"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dove A | title = Milking the genome for profit | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 18 | issue = 10 | pages = 1045–8 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11017040 | doi = 10.1038/80231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such drug manufactured from the milk of a genetically modified [[goat]] was [[ATryn]], but marketing permission was blocked by the [[European Medicines Agency]] in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Phillip B. C. Jones | title=European Regulators Curdle Plans for Goat Milk Human Antithrombin | url=http://www.isb.vt.edu/articles/apr0603.htm | access-date=2006-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was reversed in June 2006 and approval was given August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5041298.stm |title=Go-ahead for 'pharmed' goat drug |access-date=2006-10-25 |format= | work=BBC News | date=2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==

===European Union===

In the [[European Union]], a '''biological medicinal product'''&lt;ref name="urlec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2003_63/dir_2003_63_en.pdf | title = Commission Directive 2003/63/EC amending Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use | author = The Commission of the European Communities | work = Official Journal of the European Union | date = 2003-06-25 | page = L 159/62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the active substance(s) produced from or extracted from a biological (living) system, and requires, in addition to physico-chemical testing, biological testing for full characterisation. The characterisation of a biological medicinal product is a combination of testing the active substance and the final medicinal product together with the production process and its control. For example:
* Production process – it can be derived from biotechnology or from other technologies. It may be prepared using more conventional techniques as is the case for blood or [[Blood plasma|plasma]]-derived products and a number of vaccines.
* Active substance – consisting of entire microorganisms, mammalian cells, nucleic acids, proteinaceous, or [[polysaccharide]] components originating from a microbial, animal, human, or plant source.
* Mode of action – therapeutic and immunological medicinal products, [[Horizontal gene transfer|gene transfer]] materials, or [[cell therapy]] materials.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], biologics are licensed through the biologics license application (BLA), then submitted to and regulated by the FDA's [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]] (CBER) whereas drugs are regulated by the [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]]. Approval may require several years of [[clinical trials]], including trials with human volunteers. Even after the drug is released, it will still be monitored for performance and safety risks. The manufacture process must satisfy the FDA's "Good Manufacturing Practices", which are typically manufactured in a [[clean room]] environment with strict limits on the amount of airborne particles and other microbial contaminants that may alter the efficacy of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kingham|first1=Richard|last2=Klasa|first2=Gabriela|last3=Carver|first3=Krista | name-list-format = vanc |title=Key Regulatory Guidelines for the Development of Biologics in the United States and Europe|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|pages=75-88|url=https://www.cov.com/-/media/files/corporate/publications/2013/10/chapter4_key_regulatory_guidlines_for_the_development_of_biologics_in_the_united_states_and_europe.pdf|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black gill disease''' is a disease of [[crustaceans]].

==Occurrence==
It has been observed in spiny lobsters (''[[Panulirus ornatus]]'') in Vietnam,&lt;ref name="nha"&gt;V. V. H. Nha, D.T. and L.V. Khoa (2009).

==Causes==
There are multiple sources known to cause black gill disease. Poor pond conditions can cause debris to build up in the gills turning them black. Certain kinds of bacteria and the fungus genus Fusarium are also known causes.&lt;ref&gt;4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
With extra care taken to the health of the shrimp, it is possible to prevent cases of black gill disease. The water should have 10-20 parts per thousand parts salinity and filtered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">In human psychology, the '''breaking point''' is a moment of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] in which a person breaks down or a situation becomes critical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=breaking+point&amp;i=0&amp;h=00#c Wordnet.Princeton.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensity of environmental stress necessary to bring this about varies from individual to individual.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Kimble, ''Psychology'' (1996) p. 1oo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interrogation==

Getting someone to confess to a crime during an [[interrogation]] – whether innocent or guilty – means the suspect has been broken. The key to breaking points in interrogation has been linked to changes in the victim's concept of self&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Gudjonsson, ''The Psychology of Interrogation and Confession'' (2003) p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; – changes which may be precipitated by a sense of helplessness,&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; by lack of preparedness or an underlying sense of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]],&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 122-5&lt;/ref&gt; as well (paradoxically) as by an inability to acknowledge one's own vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (1994) p. 116-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[Psychoanalyst]]s like [[Ronald Fairbairn]] and [[Neville Symington]] considered that everybody has a potential breaking point in life, with vulnerability particularly intense at early developmental stages.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (2000) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychoanalysts say that rigid personalities may be able to endure great stress before suddenly cracking open.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a legal penalty in '''[[Lebanon]]''', though it has not been used since 2004.

Capital crimes in Lebanon include [[murder]]; [[espionage]]; [[treason]]; [[terrorism]]; collaborating with Israeli forces and if the crime is especially heinous enough; [[rape]]; [[pedophilia]]; gang-[[robbery]] or gang-[[assault]]; [[arson]] against certain types of structures or sabotage of communications, transportation or industrial facilities causing death; [[aggravated assault]]; gang-[[assault]] involving torture; life-eligible crimes with recidivism; importing nuclear/toxic wastes; polluting rivers or waterways with harmful substances and some military offences (e.g. [[desertion]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyworldwide.org/country-search-post.cfm?country=Lebanon |title=The Death Penalty in Lebanon |publisher=Death Penalty Worldwide |accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The methods prescribed by law are [[hanging]] and [[firing squad]], although hanging has been the predominant method throughout Lebanese history. In the Lebanese Republic, the President has the sole authority to pardon an inmate and all execution orders must be ratified by him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZeU2jNQ2c&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5666">The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|1978 Spanish Constitution]] bans '''capital punishment in Spain'''. Spain completely abolished [[capital punishment]] for all offenses, including during wartime conditions, in October 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iberianature.com/spain_culture/culture-and-history-of-spain-d/death-penalty-in-spain/ |title=The death penalty in Spain – iberianature – Spanish history and culture |publisher=Iberianature.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Last use of capital punishment in Spain|last executions]] were carried out on September 27, 1975 when five members of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] and [[Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front]] (FRAP) were executed by [[firing squad]] for [[murder]] following a much-publicised trial in which a number of the convicted (including a pregnant woman) were given clemency by General [[Francisco Franco]], and the sentences of the remaining five, due to the unavailability of executioners versed in the use of the [[garrote]], were carried out by shooting. [[Strangulation]] by garotte had been portrayed as a draconian act by the publicity after its last use in 1974, when [[Salvador Puig Antich]] was executed in [[Barcelona]] and [[Heinz Chez]] in [[Tarragona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnistiacatalunya.org/edu/es/historia/pm-espana.html |title=Historia de la pena de muerte |publisher=Amnistiacatalunya.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Capital punishment was common in the Spanish kingdom, and methods used included [[decapitation]] (especially for nobility). In 1820 [[Ferdinand VII]] replaced all other methods with the garrote, which was used mainly since then, including for the [[Liberalism|liberal]] freedom fighter [[Mariana de Pineda Muñoz]] and the assassin of six-time [[Prime Minister of Spain]] [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]]. According to a pamphlet published anonymously by Crown Prince [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar Bernadotte]], Spain was the most frequent executioner of the Western world in the early 1800s, followed by his native [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Bernadotte, ''Om Straff och Straffanstalter'' (1840), unknown page&lt;/ref&gt; The penalty was abolished by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in 1932 but restored two years later in the midst of social and political turmoil for a few major offences, not including murder.
[[File:Exécution des anarchistes de Xérès.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Issue of [[Le Progres]] depicting the executions of [[anarchist]]s in [[Xeres]] in 1892 by use of the [[garrote]].]]

===Francoist Spain===
Capital punishment in [[Francoist Spain]] was restored fully on decree in 1938. From 1940 to 1975, 165 judicial executions are reported to have been carried out, although precise numbers from the years following the [[Spanish Civil War]] are vague. Among the most relevant executed from this period there is [[Lluís Companys]], [[President of the Generalitat of Catalonia]].

As Franco's regime was consolidated, use of the death penalty became more scarce; between 1950 and 1959 some 58 Spaniards (including two women) were executed by garrote and nine by firing squad. In the 1960s, the total number of executions dropped to six; two in 1960, two in 1963 and two in 1966 (less than in neighbouring France, although several of the convictions were considered political). Due to criticism, a six-year stay followed, broken when [[Pedro Martínez Exposito]] was shot in 1972 for homicide and robbery. The next executions, of Salvador Puig Antich and Heinz Chez in 1974, were allegedly held on the same day to deliberately confuse public sentiments and equalize the execution of a political opponent - both were convicted of killing [[Guardia Civil]] members - with that of a common murderer.&lt;ref&gt;List of persons executed in Spain since 1812: http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/garottel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Last use of capital punishment in Spain|last five]] death sentences were carried out simultaneously in [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Burgos]] on September 27, 1975, prompting Swedish Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]] - amongst other harsh condemnations - to denounce the regime as "devilish murderers" the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.se/arkiv/ledare/kolumnper-ahlmark-vilka-tyranner-var-satans-mordare |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |title=Kolumn/Per Ahlmark: Vilka tyranner var "satans mördare" |trans-title=Column/Per Ahlmarks: What tyrants were "devilish murderers" |first=Per |last=Ahlmark |author-link=Per Ahlmark |date=6 March 2001 |access-date=10 September 2015 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imposition of the death penalty for terrorism followed its own logic during Franco's dictatorship. Sometimes it was not swiftly carried out, such as in the case of [[Andrés Ruiz Márquez]] ''(Coronel Montenegro)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/ppc/bolinfFIJLE/bolinfFIJLE_a1964m8n3.pdf FIJLE: Boletin de Informacion - El "Caso Montenegro"]&lt;/ref&gt; a member of a [[Spanish National Liberation Front]] (FELN) commando who had set up a string of small bombs in Madrid. He was arrested by the Spanish police in 1964 and condemned to death but saw his sentence commuted to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.march.es/ceacs/biblioteca/proyectos/linz/Ficha.asp?Reg=r-13543 Archivo Linz - El terrorista Andrés Ruiz Márquez fue detenido por la policia en la calle de Serrano]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50068">: ''For a description of catastrophic injuries that do not apply to the central nervous system, see [[Major trauma]]''.

A '''catastrophic injury''' is a severe [[injury]] to the [[Vertebral column|spine]], [[spinal cord]], or [[Human brain|brain]],{{sfn|Winterstein|2009|p=85}} and may also include skull or [[spinal fracture]]s.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Mangus|2008|p=6}} This is a subset of the definition for the legal term ''[[catastrophic injury (law)|catastrophic injury]]'', which is based on the definition used by the [[American Medical Association]].

The [[National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research]] in the United States classifies catastrophic injuries based on the three outcomes associated with them: fatality, those causing permanent severe functional disability, and those causing severe head or neck trauma with no permanent disability.{{sfn|McKeag|Moeller|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Winterstein|2009|p=85}} A fatal injury may be a direct result of trauma sustained during an activity, or may occur indirectly. Indirect nonfatal catastrophic injury may occur as a result of systemic failure from exertion during an activity, such as from cardiovascular conditions, [[heat illness]], exertional [[hyponatremia]], or [[dehydration]],{{sfn|Boden|2005}} or a complication to a nonfatal injury.{{sfn|Winterstein|2009|p=85}}{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Mangus|2008|p=6}} Indirect fatalities are usually caused by cardiovascular conditions, such as [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] and [[coronary artery disease]].{{sfn|Boden|2005}}

Fatal injury may reveal an unknown "underlying anatomical or physiological abnormality".{{sfn|McIntosh|McCrory|2005}} Individuals with certain anatomical anomalies should not participate in some activities. For example, [[contact sport]]s are [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] for individuals with an anomalous [[Dens (anatomy)|odontoid process]], as any violent impact may result in a catastrophic injury.{{sfn|Schenck|1999|p=214}} This is because a malformed odontoid process may lead to instability between the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] and [[Axis (anatomy)|axis]] (the C1 and C2 [[cervical vertebrae]]). Those with [[Atlanto-occipital joint|atlanto-occipital fusion]] should also avoid contact sports.{{sfn|Schenck|1999|p=214}}

==By activity==
Participation in any sport or recreational activity may result in a catastrophic [[sports injury]], particularly if unsupervised or if engaged with little or no protection. Direct fatalities in sport are rare, as most sport fatalities are indirect and associated with non-sport cardiovascular problems.{{sfn|Fuller|2007|p=6}}

In the United States, [[American football]] has the greatest incidence of catastrophic injury per population,{{sfn|Winterstein|2009|p=85}} whereas [[cheerleading]] is associated with the greatest incidence of direct catastrophic injury{{sfn|Winterstein|2009|p=87}} at both the interscholastic and intercollegiate levels.

Cervical spine trauma is most common in sports and activities involving contact and collision, particularly American football, [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[ice hockey]], [[gymnastics]], [[skiing]], [[wrestling]], and [[Diving (sport)|diving]].{{sfn|Rakel|Rakel|2011|p=29}} A 2005 report by the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research in the United States stated that sports requiring attention for potential catastrophic injuries are American football, ice hockey, [[baseball]], wrestling, gymnastics, and [[track and field]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Mangus|2008|p=6}}

The incidence of catastrophic injury is four times higher in college than in high school in the United States.{{sfn|Baker|O'Neill|Ginsburg|Li|1992|p=94}} Sport accounts for between 5% and 10% of all cervical spine and [[spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] in the United States, and 15% in Australia.{{sfn|Fuller|2007|p=7}} The incidence of catastrophic injury for all sports is low, less than 0.5 per 100,000 participants.{{sfn|Cantu|Mueller|2009}}

A study in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]] based on [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] data from 1986, 1989, 1992, and 1995{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=8}} states that the greatest incidence of catastrophic injuries occurred in [[Snowmobile|snowmobiling]], [[cycling]], ice hockey, and [[skiing]].{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=32}} Of the 2,154 reported catastrophic injuries, 1,756 were sustained by males and 368 by females. The only activity in the study in which female casualties outnumbered males was [[equestrianism]].{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=22}} The study also stated that [[Playing field|field]] and floor sports had a relatively low incidence of catastrophic injury,{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=29}} and that July had the highest incidence of injury.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=32}} [[Drowning]] was the  cause of 357 fatalities, and there were 640 head and 433 spine injuries.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=39}}

The study found 79.2% of the injuries were preventable; from over 1,500 responses, 346 involved [[Short-term effects of alcohol|alcohol consumption]], and 1,236 were not supervised.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=39}} Most alcohol-related injuries were sustained in snowmobiling (124), [[fishing]] (41), diving (40), boating excluding canoeing (31), swimming (31), riding an [[all-terrain vehicle]] (24), and cycling (23).{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=47}} Other studies have concluded that alcohol consumption is a common [[risk factor]] "associated with all types of exposure" (that is, activities) for [[traumatic brain injury]].{{sfn|Silver|McAllister|Yudofsky|2011|p=8}}

===Classification of sports by contact===
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has classified sports based on the likelihood of collision and contact. It recommends against participation in [[boxing]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Mangus|2008|p=13}}

Those classified as ''contact and collision'' sports include [[basketball]], boxing, diving, [[field hockey]], football, ice hockey, [[lacrosse]], [[martial arts]], [[rodeo]], rugby, [[ski jumping]], [[soccer]], [[team handball]], [[water polo]], and wrestling.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Mangus|2008|p=13}}

Those classified as ''limited contact'' include baseball, [[bicycling]], cheerleading, whitewater [[Whitewater canoeing|canoeing]] and [[Whitewater kayaking|kayaking]], [[fencing]], [[floor hockey]], [[flag football]], gymnastics, [[Team handball|handball]], [[horseback riding]], [[racquetball]], skating ([[ice skating]], [[inline skating]], [[roller skating]]), [[skiing]] ([[cross-country skiing]], [[downhill skiing]], [[water skiing]]), [[skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]], [[softball]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate frisbee]], [[volleyball]], and [[windsurfing]] or [[surfing]], and the track and field events [[high jump]] and [[pole vaulting]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Mangus|2008|p=13}}

Sports classified as ''non-contact'' include [[archery]], [[badminton]], [[body building]], [[bowling]], flatwater [[canoeing]] and [[kayaking]], [[curling]], [[dance|dancing]], [[golf]], [[orienteering]], [[power lifting]], [[race walking]], [[Shooting sport|riflery]], [[Skipping rope|rope jumping]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[running]], [[sailing]], [[scuba diving]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[table tennis]], [[tennis]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] and [[weight training]], the track and field events [[discus]], [[javelin]], and [[shot put]] and all track events.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Mangus|2008|p=13}}

===American football===
From 1945 to 2005, there were 497 fatalities, of which 69% were a result of brain injury and 16% from spinal cord injury.{{sfn|McIntosh|McCrory|2005}} Today, the most common catastrophic injury in American football is cervical spinal cord injury,{{sfn|Rakel|Rakel|2011|p=29}} which is also the "second leading cause of death attributable to football".{{sfn|Rakel|Rakel|2011|p=29}} The 84% reduction in head injuries and 74% reduction in fatalities is directly attributable to the implementation of [[National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment|NOCSAE]] standards for [[football helmet]]s and rule changes for tackling.{{sfn|McIntosh|McCrory|2005}}

Football has the highest incidence of cervical spinal cord injuries in the United States{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=243}} per population. From 1977 to 2001, the incidence of cervical spinal cord injury amongst high school, college, and professional participants was 0.52, 1.55, and 14 per 100,000 participants, respectively.{{sfn|Rakel|Rakel|2011|p=29}}

From 1982 to 1988, 75% of direct fatalities and 40% of indirect fatalities in college sports were associated with football; for high school athletes, the rates were 75% and 33%, respectively.{{sfn|Baker|O'Neill|Ginsburg|Li|1992|p=94}} Indirect fatalities were usually caused by [[Heart failure|cardiac failure]] or heat exhaustion.{{sfn|Baker|O'Neill|Ginsburg|Li|1992|p=93–94}} Indirect fatalities in high school and college football have been attributed to [[heat stroke]], heart-related conditions, [[viral meningitis]], and even [[lightning]] strikes.{{sfn|Winterstein|2009|p=85}}

The most common mechanism for catastrophic cervical spinal cord injury in American football is axial loading or compression{{sfn|Nahum|Melvin|2001|p=348}} resultant from [[Spearing (gridiron football)|spear tackling]], in which a player uses the crown of the helmet as the initial point of contact for striking another player.{{sfn|Rakel|Rakel|2011|p=29}} This form of tackling was banned in 1976 for high school and college football,{{sfn|Safran|McKeag|van Camp|1998|p=568}} resulting in a significant reduction in catastrophic injuries of this type. For example, incidence of [[quadriplegia]] decreased from 2.24 and 10.66 per 100,000 participants in high school and college football in 1976, to 1.30 and 2.66 per 100,000 participants in 1977.{{sfn|Rakel|Rakel|2011|p=29}} Since 1977, about 67% of all catastrophic injuries in football were the result of a player making a tackle.{{sfn|ScienceDaily|2012}}

In the paper ''Catastrophic Football Injuries: 1977-1998'' published in 2000 by the journal ''[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]]'', Robert Cantu and Frederick Mueller recommend that "players should use the shoulder for blocking and tackling" instead of "using the head as a battering ram".{{sfn|Cantu|Mueller|2000|p=29}} The purpose of rules against spearing, ramming, and butting is to protect both the tackler and the opponent from head trauma or catastrophic injury.{{sfn|Hoerner|1997|p=24}} Mueller also suggests that coaches remove players from a game if they exhibit symptoms of [[concussion]], such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, or sensitivity to light.{{sfn|ScienceDaily|2012}}

===Baseball===
[[Baseball]] has a high incidence of catastrophic injury, the most common being cranial injuries usually sustained during a collision between a [[Baserunning|baserunner]] diving head first and a fielder, resulting in an axial compression injury to the baserunner.{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=243}} Other causes included collisions, such as between a [[catcher]] and baserunner, or being struck by a pitched or thrown ball.{{sfn|Mueller|2001}}

===Canoeing===
In the Ontario study, all catastrophic injuries recorded for recreational [[canoeing]] were fatal, and accounted for 4.3% of all sport and recreation fatalities in the province.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=131}} Of the 27 cases, 24 fatalities resulted from drowning, and the others from cerebral contusions, cerebral lacerations, and skull fractures. Canoeing drowning fatalities are "often correlated with alcohol consumption",{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=134}} as it increases the probability of submersion and decreases the probability of recovery from submersion. They are often associated with young males inexperienced in canoeing.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=136}}

===Cheerleading===
[[File:Cheerleader tossed aloft.jpg|thumb|right|alt=On a basketball court with a net and crowd in the background, four men in red shirts and white shorts look up, ready to catch a woman who is upside down about 3.5 metres (12 feet) in the air above them. A similar group can be partially seen behind them.|Cheerleading tosses and vaults, particularly when performed over a hard surface, are a high-risk activity]]
The primary cause of increased incidence of catastrophic injuries to cheerleaders is the "evolution of cheerleading to a gymnastic-like activity".{{sfn|Winterstein|2009|p=87}} It is the leading cause of catastrophic injuries to females, representing over 65% of the catastrophic injuries occurring in high school and college female athletes in the United States.{{sfn|LiveScience|2008}}

High-risk activities include the construction of pyramids, which result in several catastrophic injuries each year,{{sfn|Baker|O'Neill|Ginsburg|Li|1992|p=94}} the 'basket toss',{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=243}} and tumbling, all of which are usually performed over hard surfaces.{{sfn|Dahl|2010}} Cheerleader pyramids are banned in [[Minnesota]] and [[North Dakota]].{{sfn|Baker|O'Neill|Ginsburg|Li|1992|p=94}}

Other causes include inadequate supervision, poorly trained coaches, and the equipment used.{{sfn|University of Michigan Health System|2009}}

===Fishing===
In the Ontario study, fishing resulted in 126 catastrophic injuries, of which 117 were fatal, 110 from drowning. Of these, 119 events were associated with males, of which 112 were fatalities.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=170}} Fishing had the highest rate of catastrophic injuries to all injuries for any activity in Ontario, as 2.54% of all fishing injuries were catastrophic.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=170–172}}

Catastrophic injuries in fishing may be related to equipment, fish, alcohol, or the environment. Equipment issues generally involve penetrative injuries from the use of [[Fish hook|hooks]] and [[harpoon]]s, but may also be caused by the [[fishing rod]], [[Fishing lure|lure]], [[Sinker (fishing)|sinker]], or [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]]. Fish-related injuries result from mishandling, poisoning, and contamination from consumption. Environmental causes may include [[Health effects of sun exposure|overexposure to solar radiation]], lightning strikes, [[hypothermia]] during [[ice fishing]], [[snakebite]]s, and viral [[infection]] spread by [[mosquito]]es.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=173}}

===Gymnastics===
Gymnastics has a relatively low incidence of catastrophic injury, that is the number of catastrophic injuries with respect to the number of participants.{{sfn|Caine|Harmer|Schiff|2009|p=154}} In the United States from 1982 to 2007, nineteen catastrophic injuries were reported from 147 million high school and 8 million college participants.{{sfn|Caine|Harmer|Schiff|2009|p=155}}

Club-level injury surveillance data in Australia indicate no catastrophic injury to elite participants from 1983 to 1993.{{sfn|Caine|Harmer|Schiff|2009|p=154}} Elite gymnast catastrophic injuries to the spinal cord have been recorded in China, Japan, and the United States,{{sfn|Caine|Harmer|Schiff|2009|p=154}} the most notable being to [[Sang Lan]] and [[Julissa Gomez]]. There is an "absence of research reporting rate data" for catastrophic injury to club-level gymnasts in the United States.{{sfn|Caine|Maffulli|2005|p=36}}
&lt;!--
This source contradicts itself, or does not consider nonfatal injuries catastrophic:
"In comparison to other sports, direct injury rates for nonfatal (i.e., permanent, severe functional disability such as quadriplegia) were highest for male and female gymnasts at both the high-school and college levels."{{sfn|Caine|Harmer|Schiff|2009|p=154}}
--&gt;

===Ice hockey===
The most common catastrophic injury occurring in [[ice hockey]] is cervical spinal cord injury, which most often occur at [[Cervical vertebra 5|C5]], [[Cervical vertebra 6|C6]], or [[Vertebra prominens|C7]].{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=242}} The most common cause is [[Penalty (ice hockey)#List of infractions|checking from behind]].{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=242}} Such checking was banned from hockey in 1985, which has resulted in a decreased incidence of catastrophic spinal injuries{{sfn|Kliff|2010}} and a reduction of head and neck injuries.{{sfn|Watson|Singer|Sproule|1996}}

Increased standards for [[hockey helmet]]s and the requirement that they be worn in competitive play has resulted in a decrease of serious head injury and fatalities.{{sfn|McIntosh|McCrory|2005}} Although full facial protection (helmet with cage) did not reduce the incidence of catastrophic injuries or concussion compared to a standard helmet, it reduced the incidence of facial injuries and lacerations.{{sfn|Asplund|Bettcher|Borchers|2009}}

===Porting===
[[Porter (carrier)|Porters]] who carry loads on their heads are subjected to axial strains that exacerbate degenerative change in the cervical spine,{{sfn|Jäger|Gordon-Harris|Mehring|Goetz|1997}} and has an [[etiology|etiological]] role in [[spondylosis]].{{sfn|Jumah|Nyame|1994}}

In a 1968 study, Laurence Levy recorded six catastrophic injuries to porters at Harare Central Hospital in [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]]. Of these, one died instantaneously, and five became quadriplegic, one as a result of a herniated intervertebral disc and four from fractures or fracture-dislocations.{{sfn|Levy|1968|p=16}}

===Rugby===
[[File:ST vs Gloucester - Match - 23.JPG|thumb|right|alt=|Rugby scrums are high-risk activities for catastrophic injury]]
For [[rugby union]], the incidence of catastrophic injury from 1952 to 2005 in England was 0.84 per 100,000 per year. In all other countries, from 1970 to 2007 the incidence was 4.6 per 100,000 per year. For [[rugby league]], it was 2 per 100,000 per year.{{sfn|Fuller|2007|p=4}} In [[rugby union in France]], the incidence of catastrophic cervical spine injuries decreased from 2.1 per 100,000 in the 1996–1997 season to 1.4 per 100,000 in the 2005–2006 season, which has been attributed to rule changes regarding the [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]].{{sfn|Bohu|Julia|Bagate|Peyrin|2009}}

The most common causes are the [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]], the [[Rugby union gameplay#Ruck|ruck]] or [[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]], and the [[Tackle (football move)#Rugby football|tackle]].{{sfn|Fuller|2007|p=7}} Research from Australia states that injury prevention in youth rugby should focus on the scrum and the tackle, and that risk factors are level of play (age group) and [[Rugby union positions|player position]].{{sfn|McIntosh|McCrory|Finch|Wolfe|2010}} It also indicated that "neck injuries in the scrum and to the front row are of great concern".{{sfn|McIntosh|McCrory|Finch|Wolfe|2010}}

The use of a [[scrum cap]] or other padded headgear does not reduce the incidence of concussion{{sfn|McIntosh|McCrory|2005}} or other head or neck trauma.

===Skiing and snowboarding===
In a survey of scientific literature from 1990 to 2004, 24 studies covering 10 countries indicated an increasing incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury amongst [[alpine skiing|alpine skiers]] and [[snowboarding|snowboarders]].{{sfn|Ackery|Hagel|Provvidenza|Tator|2007}} The most common cause of death is head injuries, which can be mitigated by 22–60% by the use of [[Ski helmet|helmets]].{{sfn|Ackery|Hagel|Provvidenza|Tator|2007}} The increased incidence coincides "with the development and acceptance of acrobatic and high-speed activities".{{sfn|Ackery|Hagel|Provvidenza|Tator|2007}}

Most deaths are attributed to massive head, neck, or thoracoabdominal injury, of which TBI accounted for between 50% and 88% and spinal cord injury between 1% and 13%. Ski fatalities occur between 0.050 and 0.196 per 100,000 participants. Head injuries represent 28.0% of all injuries in skiers and 33.5% for snowboarders.{{sfn|Ackery|Hagel|Provvidenza|Tator|2007}}

===Snowmobiling===
In the Ontario study, snowmobiling had the highest incidence and prevalence of recreational catastrophic injuries of any activity (290 incidents, 120 fatalities).{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=27}} It had the second-highest incidence of catastrophic injury per participant (88.2 per 100,000), the greatest incidence per 100,000 population (0.706), and the greatest incidence of fatality per 100,000 population (0.292).{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=53–54}} It was also the activity in which alcohol consumption was most prevalent in catastrophic events (124), representing more than one third of all events for which alcohol was a factor.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=47}} Other contributing factors include "poor lighting, young age and inappropriate terrain".{{sfn|Reid|Saboe|1989}}

===Track and field===
The majority of [[track and field]]-related fatalities in the United States is associated with [[pole vaulting]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Mangus|2008|p=6}} Other fatalities and catastrophic injuries in track and field occur by a participant or bystander being struck by a discus, shot put, or javelin.{{sfn|Mueller|2001}}

===Water sports===
Most catastrophic injuries related to diving and swimming in the United States occur when an individual dives into shallow water. It is the cause of 2.6% of all cervical spine injury admissions,{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=243}} and are chiefly sustained by recreational divers. The most common cause is diving into shallow water, inexperience, inadequate supervision, and alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=243}}

Catastrophic swimming injuries in the Ontario study were four times as prevalent in males than females.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=202}} The incidence of catastrophic injury in [[Swimming (sport)|competitive swimming]] is very low, and almost all such injuries occur in recreational and non-competitive swimming.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=202}}

===Wrestling===
From 1981 until 1999 in the United States, 35 catastrophic injuries related to wrestling were reported, one in college and the others in high school, an incidence of 1 per 100,000 per year.{{sfn|Boden|Lin|Young|Mueller|2002}} They were caused by three positions: defensive position during takedown (74%), down position (23%), and lying position (3%).{{sfn|Boden|Lin|Young|Mueller|2002}} Most occurred in the lower [[Wrestling weight classes|weight classes]], and 80% were incurred during a match.{{sfn|Boden|Lin|Young|Mueller|2002}} In [[Iran]] from 1998 to 2005, the incidence of catastrophic injury was 1.99 per 100,000 participants per year.{{sfn|Kordi|Akbarnejad|Wallace|2010}}

Most injuries were cervical fracture or major cervical ligament injuries. One of the athletes died, one third became [[Tetraplegia|tetraplegic]], one [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]], and six others suffered residual neurologic deficit.{{sfn|Boden|Lin|Young|Mueller|2002}}

Catastrophic wrestling injuries are preventable, and associated risk factors include incorrectly performing a manoeuvre, lack of supervision by the coach, and inappropriate injury management.{{sfn|Kordi|Akbarnejad|Wallace|2010}}

===Other activities===
In the United Kingdom, the incidence of catastrophic injury per year for work-related situations is 0.9 per 100,000.{{sfn|Fuller|2007|p=2}} The incidence is highest in agriculture (6.0 per 100,000) and construction (6.0 per 100,000), and lowest in the service sector (0.4).

The incidence is 3.7 per 100,000 for pedestrians, 2.9 per 100,000 for automobile occupants, and 190 per 100,000 for motorcyclists.{{sfn|Fuller|2007|p=4}}

Vehicular accidents account for 43% of catastrophic spinal injury in the United States and 45% in Australia.{{sfn|Fuller|2007|p=7}}

In the Ontario study, recreational catastrophic injuries were most prevalent in snowmobiling (290 incidents, 120 fatalities), bicycling (289 incidents, 67 fatalities), fishing (126 incidents, 117 fatalities), boating (excluding canoeing, 112 incidents, 72 fatalities), diving (105 incidents, 5 fatalities) and swimming (100 incidents, 86 fatalities).{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=27}} The greatest incidence per participant was recorded for diving (511.0 per 100,000), snowmobiling (88.2 per 100,000), [[parachuting]] (62.9 per 100,000), [[toboggan]]ing or sledding ( 37.7 per 100,000), [[hang gliding]] (29.4 per 100,000), [[water polo]] (24.5 per 100,000), scuba diving (12.2 per 100,000), [[hunting]] (12.2 per 100,000), [[horseback riding]] (11.6 per 100,000), [[archery]] (11.1 per 100,000), and fishing (11.0  per 100,000).{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=53}} The greatest incidence per 100,000 population were recorded for snowmobiling (0.706), cycling (0.701), ice hockey (0.462), fishing (0.307), boating excluding canoeing (0.273), diving (0.256), swimming (0.243) and baseball (0.217). The greatest incidence of fatality per 100,000 population were recorded for snowmobiling (0.292), fishing (0.285), swimming (0.200), boating excluding canoeing (0.175), cycling (0.163), canoeing (0.066), riding an all-terrain vehicle (0.039), hunting (0.037), and horseback riding (0.024).{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=54}} Catastrophic cycling injuries were most prevalent in cities, particularly [[Toronto]] (64), [[Ottawa]] (21), and [[London, Ontario|London]] (7).{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=115}} Drowning represented more than half of sport and recreation fatalities in the Ontario study.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=119–121}}

In the United States, the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC) recorded nearly 1,000 fatalities between 1967 and 1987 as a result of riding an all-terrain vehicle, more than half of which were individuals less than 16 years old.{{sfn|Kitzes|1989}} This led to a filing of an action per the [[Consumer Product Safety Act]] in 1987, which effectively ended the sale of three-wheeled ATVs. Since then, 35% of deaths were individuals less than 16 years old.{{sfn|Brown|Koepplinger|Mehlman|Gittelman|2002}} The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] and CPSC recommend that individuals less than 16 years old should not ride ATVs.{{sfn|Brown|Koepplinger|Mehlman|Gittelman|2002}}

==Effects and management==
The types of acute catastrophic spinal injuries are those associated with unstable fractures and dislocations, [[intervertebral disc]] herniation, and transient [[quadriplegia]].{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=243}} These most commonly affect the cervical spine, but also affect the thoracolumbar spine (the [[thoracic vertebrae|thoracic]] and [[lumbar vertebrae]]) and [[Epiphyseal plate|physis]], or cause cervical cord [[Neuropraxia#Prevalence in collision sports|neuropraxia]] and sometimes [[spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality]] ([[List of medical abbreviations: S|SCIWORA]]).{{sfn|Karantanas|2011|p=243—252}}

Response to a non-fatal catastrophic spinal cord injury by the patient varies by "social, economic, and educational background".{{sfn|Frymoyer|Wiesel|2004|p=624}}

The most common initial response is [[Depression (mood)|depression]].{{sfn|Frymoyer|Wiesel|2004|p=624}} About 6% of patients with a spinal cord injury commit [[suicide]], usually in the years immediately after sustaining the injury. By ten years after an injury, the rate of suicide is similar to that of the general population.{{sfn|Frymoyer|Wiesel|2004|p=625}}

Many patients recover only partially from their injury, and must cope with [[paralysis]] or [[Mental retardation|mental deficiency]], usually requiring lifetime medical care.{{sfn|ScienceDaily|2012}}

About 90% of patients who are single when injured are still single five years after the injury. There is a high incidence of divorce and separation after an injury, though this decreases beyond the first year after injury.{{sfn|Frymoyer|Wiesel|2004|p=625}}

Many catastrophic spinal cord injury patients improve their education. Immediately after injury, the average level of education is below that of the general population; fifteen years after injury, it is above that of the general population.{{sfn|Frymoyer|Wiesel|2004|p=625}}

Survivors of catastrophic injury may also have catastrophic facial injuries, such as fractured facial bones, particularly those from events associated with ice hockey, cycling, and snowmobiling.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=127}}

===Medical problems===
Numerous secondary medical problems are associated with catastrophic spinal cord injury. These include cardiovascular complications, such as [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[bradycardia]], [[autonomic dysreflexia]], altered [[Thermoregulation#Thermoregulation in humans|thermoregulation]], and changes to cardiac function as a result of injury to the [[sympathetic nervous system]].{{sfn|Frymoyer|Wiesel|2004|p=625–626}}

Other problems may include pulmonary and gastrointestinal problems, [[heterotopic ossification]], [[osteoporosis]], and other pathologic fractures.{{sfn|Frymoyer|Wiesel|2004|p=626–627}} [[Pneumonia]] is a common cause of death among patients with spinal cord injuries.{{sfn|Frymoyer|Wiesel|2004|p=626}}

A skull fracture occurs when a bone in the skull breaks, and may penetrate the brain, tearing [[artery|arteries]], [[vein]]s, or [[meninges]], leading to the functional impairment of walking, communication, thinking, or feeling.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=124}} [[Cerebral laceration]]s (tearing of brain tissue) or [[cerebral contusion]]s (bruising of brain tissue) usually damage the [[cerebral cortex]], resulting in permanent neurological deficits.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=124}}

===Life care plan===
A [[life care plan]] is established for the patient to address the patient's needs.{{sfn|Mpofu|Oakland|2009|p=298}} It is an individualized document describing the services, support, equipment, and ancillary requirements for the patient that is updated to reflect changes in the patient's condition. It usually contains target outcomes, dates, and timelines.{{sfn|Mpofu|Oakland|2009|p=300}}

Components of the life care plan may include:{{sfn|Mpofu|Oakland|2009|p=299—300}}

*architectural renovations to the patient's home, including tub, toilet, and ingress and egress
*transportation, such as an adaptive van
*[[assistive technology]] and [[adaptive equipment]], including [[wheelchair]]s
*case management
*supervisory care and nursing
*medication, medical supplies (such as [[catheter]]s), and medical equipment
*facility care and services
*home care and services

This is in addition to information regarding surgical intervention and treatment, diagnostic testing, therapeutic interventions (speech therapy, rehabilitation, etc.), counselling, and dealing with complications.{{sfn|Mpofu|Oakland|2009|p=299—300}} It may also include educational and vocational services.

In the United States, 2.55% of hospitalized catastrophic injury patients enroll in [[Medicaid]] to cover their medical bills.{{sfn|Zaloshnja|Miller|Coben|Steiner|2012}} In ''Catastrophic Injuries in Sports and Recreation: Causes and Prevention : A Canadian Study'', Charles Tator states that the average case of non-fatal catastrophic injury costs about $7.5 million (Canadian dollars, normalized to 2006) in lost earnings, lifetime care, and rehabilitation services, and cost the economy of Ontario about $2.125 billion annually.{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=74}}

==Prevention==
One paradigm used in [[injury prevention]] is the [[Haddon Matrix]]{{sfn|Baker|O'Neill|Ginsburg|Li|1992|p=94}} developed by William Haddon Jr. of the [[National Highway Safety Bureau]] in the late 1960s. The matrix was designed to categorize highway safety phenomena, and applied a [[public health]] model to traffic-related [[epidemiology]].{{sfn|National Highway Traffic Safety Administration}} It consists of ten strategies that are implemented based on temporality, that is pre-event strategies (primary prevention), event strategies (secondary prevention), and post-event strategies (tertiary prevention).{{sfn|Queensland Health}} The purpose of injury prevention is to decrease the "burden of injury to the individual and to society",{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=59}} which includes [[Mortality rate|mortality]], [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]], [[disability]], and economic cost.

The ten strategies are:{{sfn|Baker|O'Neill|Ginsburg|Li|1992|p=94—97}}

*pre-event strategies
**prevent the creation of the hazard
**reduce the amount of hazard
**prevent the release of the hazard
**modify the rate or distribution of release of the hazard
*event strategies
**separate the potential victims from the hazard, in time or space
**separate the potential victims from the hazard with a barrier
**modify the hazard
**improve individual resistance to the hazard
*post-event strategies
**counter incurred damage
**stabilize, treat, and rehabilitate the injured individual

In ''Catastrophic Head Injuries in High School and Collegiate Sports'', Frederick Mueller states that the frequency of catastrophic injuries may be reduced by:{{sfn|Mueller|2001}}

*requiring all participants to submit medical histories and have an obligatory pre-participation examination
*requiring all schools, colleges, and universities to have a certified athletic trainer on faculty
*enforcement of game rules by officials and coaches, and player education about head contact
*removing a player exhibiting symptoms of concussion or head trauma from a game
*educating players, parents, coaches about the symptoms of head injury and dangers of recurrent injury
*athletic trainer must be prepared to respond to a catastrophic injury event

Preparation for a catastrophic injury event includes a written emergency plan, which should incorporate an evacuation, transportation and communication plan, as well as notifying hospital emergency departments about game and practice schedules for teams and clubs.{{sfn|Mueller|2001}} Response to a catastrophic injury event should reduce its severity, such as via the administration of [[first aid]].{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=59}} In ''Catastrophic Injuries in Sports and Recreation: Causes and Prevention : A Canadian Study'', Charles Tator states that effective injury prevention programs involve education, engineering, and rule enforcement. Education is intended to inform the participants of potential dangers of risky behaviour in the activity, and engineering "involved modifying the environment to create safer surroundings",{{sfn|Tator|2008|p=59}} such as maintaining playing fields or improving the design of equipment.

==Response==
Sports organizations, leagues, and associations have integrated a catastrophic injury plan as part of their [[Emergency procedure|emergency action]] and [[emergency management]] plans,{{sfn|Casa|2011|p=243}} and have also changed rules to prevent or reduce the incidence of catastrophic injuries. Such plans include a notification system, which may be used to contact the family of the injured athlete, athletic coordinators, officials, legal and risk management offices, and institutional insurance carriers.{{sfn|Casa|2011|p=243}} It may also include the formation of a catastrophic injury team, which may include athletic directors, head athletic trainer, team physicians, legal counsel, and media relations.{{sfn|Casa|2011|p=243}}

In 1985, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] created an insurance plan for member institutions to provide benefits for student athletes who sustain a catastrophic injury, in response to an increase in [[workers' compensation]] claims filed by students.{{sfn|Wong|2010|p=101}} This was designed to protect member institutions "against the sudden and substantial costs of injury benefits",{{sfn|Wong|2010|p=101}} typically obtained by the student via worker's compensation claims and litigation. The injured student receives benefits immediately and does not incur litigation costs, but retains the right to litigation in cases of negligence by the institution.{{sfn|Wong|2010|p=151}} In 2005, 25% of funds for insurance claim payouts were associated with cheerleading.{{sfn|LiveScience|2008}}

The National Federation of High School Associations instituted a medical plan for high school athletic associations and their member schools and districts. This allows a catastrophically injured student athlete to receive "medical, rehabilitation, and work-loss benefits"{{sfn|Wong|2010|p=151}} until death by waiving rights to litigation. The institution thereby need not invest the human and financial resources associated with litigation, in addition to a potential award to the plaintiff, and the student receives immediate and lifelong benefits.{{sfn|Wong|2010|p=151}}

Athletic associations, organizations, and leagues update their rules based on research regarding catastrophic injuries. The amount of enforcement of the rules may explain variations in incidence of catastrophic injuries between jurisdictions.{{sfn|Kliff|2010}}

==Litigation==
In Canada, as of May 2012 the largest award to a plaintiff of a catastrophic brain injury was $18.4 million, and the largest award to a plaintiff of a catastrophic spinal cord injury was $12.33 million.{{sfn|Pinsent|2012}}

In [[South Africa]], the largest malpractice settlement for the [[Medical Protection Society]] as of 2011 was for [[South African rand|R]]17 million, awarded to a patient who suffered catastrophic neurological damage as a result of a surgical procedure.{{sfn|Bateman|2011}}

{{distinguish|Code of ethics|Code of conduct|Standard of practice}}
A '''Code of practice''' can be a document that complements occupational health and safety laws and regulations to provide detailed practical guidance on how to comply with legal obligations, and should be followed unless another solution with the same or better health and safety standard is in place,&lt;ref name="Safework SA" /&gt; or may be a document for the same purpose published by a self-regulating body to be followed by member organisations.&lt;ref name="CMAS scientific CoP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMCA D014" /&gt;

Codes of practice published by governments do not replace the occupational health and safety laws and regulations, and are generally issued in terms of those laws and regulations. They are intended help understand how to comply with the requirements of regulations. A workplace inspector can refer to a code of practice when issuing an improvement or prohibition notice, and they may be admissible in court proceedings. A court may use a code of practice to establish what is reasonably practicable action to manage a specific risk. Equivalent or better ways of achieving the required work health and safety may be possible, so compliance with codes of practice is not usually mandatory, providing that any alternative systems used provide a standard of health and safety equal to or better than those recommended by the code of practice.&lt;ref name="Safework NSW" /&gt;

Organisational codes of practice do not have the same authority under law, but serve a similar purpose. Member organisations generally undertake to comply with the codes of practice as a condition of membership and may lose membership if found to be in violation of the code.

==United Kingdom==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2018}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] disability benefits are covered by [[Department for Work and Pensions]], and include:

* [[Disability Living Allowance]]
* [[Disability pension|Attendance Allowance]]
* [[Personal Independence Payment]]
* [[Carer's Allowance]]
* [[Employment and Support Allowance]]

==United States==
In the [[United States]], disability benefits for most Americans are covered and paid for by the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Administration]] (a government agency). There are two main programs administered by the SSA; Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI) and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. There is also a specific program for children with disabilities.

[[Social Security Disability Insurance]] provides benefits to individuals who have worked and paid Social Security taxes. Insurance eligibility is dependent upon Quarters of Coverage (QCs), commonly called "work credits". These are allotted based on the earnings for each [[Calendar year#Quarters|quarter]] the individual has worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quarter of Coverage |url=https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/QC.html |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work credits ensure  coverage until they "expire" on the individual's Date Last Insured (DLI). Medical evidence must prove that the onset of disability was before their DLI to receive benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Program Operations Manual System (POMS): DI 25501.320 - Date Last Insured (DLI) and the Established Onset Date (EOD) |url=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0425501320 |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSDI recipients become eligible for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] after two years of SSDI eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Original Medicare (Part A and B) Eligibility and Enrollment |url=https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Eligibility-and-Enrollment/OrigMedicarePartABEligEnrol/ |website=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services |language=en-us |date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) provides benefits to low-income individuals who are disabled and unable to work, regardless of whether they have worked in the past. Individuals must meet income and resource requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI Eligibility |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-eligibility-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSI also provides benefits to children under 18 years old, who are disabled and whose parents or guardians have limited income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI for Children |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-child-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly SSI payment is calculated based upon the Federal Benefit Rate (FBR), and the individual's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI Income |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-income-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most SSI recipients are immediately eligible for [[Medicaid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Disability &amp; Medicaid coverage |url=https://www.healthcare.gov/people-with-disabilities/ssi-and-medicaid/ |website=HealthCare.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SNAP Special Rules for the Elderly or Disabled |url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/snap-special-rules-elderly-or-disabled |website=Food and Nutrition Service |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though program requirements vary by state. 

Some individuals are eligible for both SSI and SSDI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Red Book - Overview of Our Disability Programs |url=https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==


In Canada, there are a variety of public [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/disability.html Disability Benefit Programs]. The largest programs are the [[Canada Pension Plan]] and Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, and provincial [[workers' compensation]] and [[social assistance]] programs. Some individuals, in addition, have private disability insurance coverage, purchased either individually, or through an employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/disability-benefits.html|title=Disability benefits  - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Financial Consumer Agency of|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different programs use different rules to decide whether or not someone is eligible for benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/disability-benefits.html|title=Disability benefits  - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Financial Consumer Agency of|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada Pension Plan (CPP) / Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) Disability Benefits ====

To access [[Canada Pension Plan]] or the Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, an individual needs to have a disability that is "severe and prolonged", and which prevents them from working on a regular basis. As of 2018, CPP disability benefits are a minimum of $485.20 a month. Individuals who have contributed more to CPP or QPP during their working career receive higher benefits. The average monthly CPP disability benefit was $971.23 in 2018 and the maximum monthly amount was $1,335.83.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit/benefit-amount.html|title=Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit – How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

People receiving CPP disability benefits may earn up to $5,500 a year without losing their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit/while-receiving.html |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits stop when an individual has the ability to work regularly, or is no longer disabled. When an the individual reaches the age of 65, CPP Disability Benefits are replaced by a [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp.html Retirement Pension].

==== Employment Insurance Sickness Benefit (EI Insurance) ====
[https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html Employment Insurance] is a benefit plan that offers temporary financial assistance to those individuals who cannot work due to sickness, injury, or quarantine. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Overview - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be eligible to receive EI sickness benefits:

* The individual’s earnings have been reduced by at least 40% 
* He/She is employed in insurable employment
* A minimum of 600 hours has been accumulated in the qualifying period &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|date=|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People are only eligible for these benefits if they are unable to work due to their sickness, injury, or quarantine, but would be able to work otherwise. To receive EI sickness benefit a medical certificate signed by the doctor is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify for EI you must have a required amount of insurable employment hours, which are used to calculate your benefit period, these insurable employment hours must be accumulated throughout the qualifying period. 

The qualifying period: 

* 52 week period before the EI claim date 
* Start date of previous EI benefit period to the start of the new date &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that each individual’s case is different and requirements may vary from case to case. But a general way of calculating EI benefits is 55% of the average insurable weekly earnings. The maximum amount you can be eligible for as of January 1 2018 is $51,700. Typically EI sickness benefits can only be paid for up to 15 weeks, but can vary depending on how long the individual is unable to work. 

Weekly EI sick benefits are calculated based on income before its been deducted during the individuals “best weeks”. Best weeks are the weeks in which the individual earned the most amount of amount, including any tips and commissions, the best weeks are chosen out of the qualifying period. 

In Canada areas with high rates of unemployment will use the best 14 weeks, and in areas with low unemployment rates will use the best 22 weeks. 

The weekly amount is calculated: 

* Calculating total earnings amount from the accumulated best weeks 
* Based on the region the individual is in the number of best weeks to use will be decided 
* Divide the total earnings by the number of best weeks 
* The result is multiplied by 55% to get the weekly benefit &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/benefit-amount.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If you are considered a low income family you may be eligible to receive the EI Family Supplement. An individual can be considered to be a part of this category if the yearly family net income is $25, 921 or less, has children, and if the individual or their spouse receives Canada child tax benefit. If both the individual and their spouse claims EI sickness benefits only one of them can be eligible for the family supplement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/benefit-amount.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr Elizabeth''' "'''Dorothea'''" '''Chalmers Smith''' ''née'' Lyness (1874 – 1944) was a pioneer doctor and a militant Scottish [[suffragette]]. She was imprisoned for eight months for breaking and entering, and attempted arson, where she went on hunger strike.

== Early life ==
Chalmers Smith graduated from medicine from the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1894, and worked at the [[Royal Samaritan Hospital for Women]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ygXwlK_mj50C&amp;pg=PT1777&amp;lpg=PT1777&amp;dq=Dorothea+Chalmers+Smith&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MyWOnQxKVv&amp;sig=YJnGk2GFcvtapT_xhZznNPsmtkc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi64KyExqHZAhWGCSwKHeOFD78Q6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Dorothea%20Chalmers%20Smith&amp;f=false|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928|last=Crawford|first=Elizabeth|date=2003-09-02|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135434018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalmers Smith married Reverend William Chalmers Smith, minister of Calton Church, Glasgow in 1901. They had six children born between 1900 and 1911.

== Political Activity ==
Chalmers Smith joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) in 1912, but her enthusiasm for extreme militancy was not welcomed by her husband, who believed adamantly that a woman's place was in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8Ng3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT501&amp;lpg=PT501&amp;dq=Dorothea+Chalmers+Smith&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ga134outnV&amp;sig=w3qc6ftm5z4lZ6M69qkJDU0iEpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi64KyExqHZAhWGCSwKHeOFD78Q6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Dorothea%20Chalmers%20Smith&amp;f=false|title=Rise Up Women!: The Remarkable Lives of the Suffragettes|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|date=2018-02-08|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781408844069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cat and Mouse Act Poster - 1914.jpg|thumb|WSPU poster 1914 - Museum of London]]
Chalmers Smith, alongside artist [[Ethel Moorhead]], attempted to set fire to a house at 6 Park Gardens in Glasgow on 23 July 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSDC09|title=TheGlasgowStory:  1830s to 1914: Learning and Beliefs: Women's Suffrage|last=ABACUS|first=Scott Graham -|website=www.theglasgowstory.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were caught red-handed by multiple witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scan.org.uk/education/suffrage/source3c.html|title=Introduction to Women's Suffrage in Scotland|website=www.scan.org.uk|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one room firefighters found matches, firelighters, six flasks of paraffin, candles,  and a postcard bearing the words: 'A protest against Mrs Pankhurst's re-arrest'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8Ng3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT501&amp;lpg=PT501&amp;dq=Dorothea+Chalmers+Smith&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ga134outnV&amp;sig=w3qc6ftm5z4lZ6M69qkJDU0iEpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi64KyExqHZAhWGCSwKHeOFD78Q6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Dorothea%20Chalmers%20Smith&amp;f=false|title=Rise Up Women!: The Remarkable Lives of the Suffragettes|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|date=2018-02-08|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781408844069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scan.org.uk/education/suffrage/source3c.html|title=Introduction to Women's Suffrage in Scotland|website=www.scan.org.uk|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was tried in the High Court at Jail Square and hundreds of Suffragettes attended the trial. Chalmers Smith and Moorhead both conducted their own defence and refused to plead. Moorhead interrupted the Judge saying "We do not want to hear any more. We refused to listen to you. Please sentence us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8Ng3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT501&amp;lpg=PT501&amp;dq=Dorothea+Chalmers+Smith&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ga134outnV&amp;sig=w3qc6ftm5z4lZ6M69qkJDU0iEpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi64KyExqHZAhWGCSwKHeOFD78Q6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Dorothea%20Chalmers%20Smith&amp;f=false|title=Rise Up Women!: The Remarkable Lives of the Suffragettes|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|date=2018-02-08|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781408844069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When both women were sentenced to eight-months imprisonment, the women rose from all sections of the court and protested, crying out "Pitt Street, Pitt Street" whilst others starting throwing apples at the Judge and counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12629283.A_nation_aflame_with_passion/|title=A nation aflame with passion|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both women went on hunger strike immediately. When they became physically weak they were released from prison under the [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|Cat and Mouse Act]], which was introduced in April 1913, and allowed for the re-arrest of prisoners once their health improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12629283.A_nation_aflame_with_passion/|title=A nation aflame with passion|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detectives were posted on the door of her house to make sure that she did not escape. She managed to escape on occasion by dressing up in her younger sister's school uniform.

== Later life ==
Chalmers Smith and her husband divorced after the [[World War I|First World War]], at a time that it was difficult for a Church of Scotland minister to do so. She left with her three daughters, but she was not allowed to see her three sons again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8Ng3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT501&amp;lpg=PT501&amp;dq=Dorothea+Chalmers+Smith&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ga134outnV&amp;sig=w3qc6ftm5z4lZ6M69qkJDU0iEpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi64KyExqHZAhWGCSwKHeOFD78Q6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Dorothea%20Chalmers%20Smith&amp;f=false|title=Rise Up Women!: The Remarkable Lives of the Suffragettes|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|date=2018-02-08|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781408844069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Great War, Chalmers Smith worked in the newly established child welfare clinics in Glasgow. She did pioneering work in child-care and raised her daughters to be doctors. She died in 1944, and her silver WSPU Hunger Strike medal was donated to the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] by one of her daughters. These medals were first presented by the WSPU at a ceremony in August 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://womanandhersphere.com/2012/08/11/collecting-suffrage-the-hunger-strike-medal/|title=Collecting Suffrage: The Hunger Strike Medal|date=2012-08-11|work=Woman and her Sphere|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Suffrage Oak on Kelvinway]] was planted in 1918 to celebrate women’s first opportunity to vote in a general election and stands as a memorial to the likes of [[Helen Crawfurd]], Dorothea Chalmers Smith, [[Jessie Stephen]] and [[Frances McPhun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stirlingnews.co.uk/news/15474112.Thanks_for_the_memories__Glasgow_women_who_blazed_a_trail/|title=Thanks for the memories: Glasgow women who blazed a trail|website=Stirling News|language=en|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1950 family planning was introduced by medical volunteers and social workers. In 1965 the [[Government of Pakistan]] started family planning program in [[East Pakistan]]. In 1976 the government of Bangladesh declared rapid population growth rate as the nations number one problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-264090|title=Controlling the population boom|date=2013-01-07|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangladesh]] has experienced rapid population growth since its independence. This was a result of high fertility rate, increased life expectancy, and decreasing mortality rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1975 the total fertility rate was 6.3 which by 2011 was reduced to 2.3 from the data collected by Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The survey found most women have two or more children. It also found that the majority of women in Bangladesh would prefer to have two or less Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/unfpa-supplement/every-pregnancy-wanted-124069|title=Every Pregnancy is Wanted|date=2015-08-09|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 the total fertility rate has remained at 2.3, according to the [[International Conference on Family Planning]], family planning in Bangladesh has not made progress since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/editorial/family-planning-stuck-208324|title=Family planning stuck|date=2016-01-28|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infant mortality fell from 160,300 in 2000 to 83,100 by 2015 according to ''[[The Lancet]]''.

==Underage marriage==
According to official government estimates in Bangladesh 65% of girls are married off before their 18th birthday.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2016/jan/26/bali-conference-calls-higher-investments-family-planning|title=Bali conference calls for higher investments in family planning {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=archive.dhakatribune.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 60 percent of child brides have children by the time they are 19 and 10 percent of them have children by the time they are 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2016/11/10/rakibul-hasan-wins-120-40-award/|title=Rakibul Hasan wins 120 Under 40 award {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|date=2016-11-10|work=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh's Penal Code places the age of consent at 14, through sex before marriage is frowned upon socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/2017/03/11/bangladesh-age-consent/|title=Does Bangladesh have an age of consent? {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|date=2017-03-11|work=Dhaka Tribune|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Food Standards Agency''' is a [[non-ministerial government department]] of the [[Her Majesty's Government|Government of the United Kingdom]]. It is responsible for protecting [[public health]] in relation to [[food]] in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It is led by a board appointed to act in the [[public interest]]. Its headquarters are in [[London]], with offices in York, Wales and Northern Ireland&lt;ref name="contact-fsa" /&gt;. The agency had a national office in [[Scotland]] until April 2015 when it was replaced by [[Food Standards Scotland]].

==History==
The Agency was created in 2001 based on a report by Professor James,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/maffdh/fsa/preface.htm |title=The Food Standards Agency - Preface by the Prime Minister |publisher=Archive.official-documents.co.uk |date=1998-01-14 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued after several high-profile outbreaks and deaths from foodborne illness.  It was felt that it was inappropriate to have one government department, the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]], responsible for both the health of the [[farming]] and food processing industries and for [[food safety]].

Uniquely for a UK Government department, the Food Standards Act gave the Agency the statutory right to publish the advice it gives to Ministers - and as a signal of its independence it declared that it would invariably do so. From its inception, the Agency declared that it would take no decisions about [[food policy]] except in open Board meetings accessible to the public. Since 2003, these meetings have been webcast live, enabling consumers to see the decision-making process in action. Each Board meeting concludes with a Q&amp;A session in which web viewers can question the Board or its Executive directly.

In 2006, the Wine Standards Board merged with the FSA to take over responsibility for enforcing the EU wine regime in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/jul/winemerge  |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120206100416/http://food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/jul/winemerge |title=Wine Standards Board merges with FSA |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=13 May 2006|archivedate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly an executive agency of the FSA, the Meat Hygiene Service merged with the FSA in April 2010 to form a new operations group. The operations group has responsibility for the delivery of official controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2010/mar/ogroup |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130418135509/http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2010/mar/ogroup |archivedate=18 April 2013|title=New Operations Group for the Agency  |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Certain aspects of food labelling policy in England were transferred from the Food Standards Agency to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on 1 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2010/sep/labelgov |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130418155451/http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2010/sep/labelgov |archivedate=18 April 2013 |title=Government food labelling changes |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the Agency retains responsibility for food safety-related labelling issues, whereas the devolved Food Standards Agency offices in Wales and Northern Ireland are still responsible for all labelling and standards policy.

Nutrition policy, including nutrition labelling, in England and Wales was transferred from the Food Standards Agency to the Department of Health in England and to the Assembly Government in Wales on 1 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2010/sep/nutrition |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130418183421/http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2010/sep/nutrition |archivedate=18 April 2013 |title=Transfer of nutrition policy to health departments |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Food Standards Agency offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland have retained their responsibilities for nutrition policy.

Plans to create a new food standards body in Scotland were announced by Ministers in June 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-18608383 |title=New Scottish food standards body planned |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and in January 2015 this new body was established through primary legislation. [[Food Standards Scotland]] took over from the FSA on 1 April 2015 as the public body responsible for food safety, food standards, nutrition, food labelling and meat inspection in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/about-us/new-scotland | title=About us: A new food body for Scotland |publisher=Food Standards Agency |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Sir [[John Krebs]] was the first Chair of the Food Standards Agency, until 2005. Dame [[Deirdre Hutton]] was Chair between 2005 and July 2009, followed by
[[Jeff Rooker]] until July 2013. Tim Bennett, the former Deputy Chair, was appointed as interim Chair whilst a permanent appointment was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2014/jan/reappointment |title=Appointment extension for FSA Chair |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heather Hancock was appointed the new Chair on 1 April 2016, for a three-year term. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2016/14953/fsa-chair-appointment |title=FSA chair appointment|publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agency is advised by a number of independent expert committees, including: the General Advisory Committee on Science, the [[Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food]], the Committee on Toxicity, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes and the Social Science Research Committee.

==Events==
===Recalls and contamination===
In February 2005, the agency announced the discovery of the [[dye]] [[Sudan I]] in [[Worcestershire sauce|Worcester sauce]], prompting a mass recall of over 400 products that used the sauce as a flavouring. 

On 31 March 2006, it published its "Survey of benzene levels in soft drinks", which tested 150 products and found that four contained benzene levels above the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) guidelines for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/mar/benzenesurvey |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120206100416/http://food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2006/mar/benzenesurvey |archivedate=6 February 2012 |title=Survey of benzene levels in soft drinks |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=31 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agency asked for these to be removed from sale.

The Food Standards Agency also imposed restrictions on the [[sheep]] trade because of the consequences of the 1986 [[Chernobyl accident|Chernobyl catastrophe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/science/surveillance/radiosurv/chernobyl/ |title=Post-Chernobyl monitoring and controls survey reports |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were repealed in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/newsarchive/2012/mar/chernobyl |title=Post Chernobyl sheep controls to be removed |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's advertising===
The FSA pushed for stricter rules on TV advertising to children of foods high in salt, sugar and fat and devised a nutritional profiling system to measure the balance of benefit and detriment in individual food products. In 2007, the UK TV regulator [[Ofcom]] introduced restrictions on advertising of products that scored poorly under the scheme.

===Food poisoning===
In June 2002, and re-released in June 2006, the FSA conducted an advertising campaign on British television, highlighting the danger of food poisoning caused by [[barbecue]]s. The advert, intended to shock viewers, shows sausages sizzling on a barbecue, looking to the viewer as if they are cooked. However, when a pair of tongs pick up one of these sausages, it falls apart, and reveals pink, uncooked meat in the middle. To emphasize the risk of [[diarrhoea]] and [[vomiting]] caused by food poisoning, the song "[[When Will I See You Again]]" by [[The Three Degrees]] is played in the background.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.food.gov.uk - FSA website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dean Review===
In 2005, [[Brenda Dean, Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde|Brenda Dean]] carried out an independent review of the Food Standards Agency. The report made 22 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the Food Standards Agency board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/aboutus/how_we_work/historyfsa/deanreview |title=Dean Review |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=2005-03-21 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014001552/http://www.food.gov.uk/aboutus/how_we_work/historyfsa/deanreview |archivedate=14 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dean concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My overwhelming impression, having undertaken this Review, is of an organisation that has been extremely conscious of the importance of fulfilling the very serious responsibilities of changing both the perception and the reality of food safety in the UK.

It has done well in taking forward the experiences, good and bad, of the previous regime, to begin building its own reputation.

Most stakeholders agreed that the Agency has made significant progress towards improving food safety, gaining public confidence in food safety, and creating a modern culture in which it is the norm for procedures, information, consultation and decision-making to be in the public domain and to involve external stakeholders.

There was overwhelming support for the Agency’s policy of basing decisions on scientific evidence, and for this policy to be maintained and developed further. The vast majority of stakeholders believe the Agency to be independent and to act independently, with general recognition that decisions are based on scientific evidence.

There was general support for the Agency amongst all stakeholder groups, both in terms of the objectives of the Agency, and the way in which the Agency has approached and undertaken its responsibilities.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One principal criticism, identified in the report, was (Recommendation 20):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baroness Brenda Dean |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/deanreviewfinalreport.pdf |title=2005 Review of the Food Standards Agency |format=PDF |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724222208/http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/deanreviewfinalreport.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that many stakeholders believe the Agency has already made policy decisions on GM foods and organic foods and is not open to further debate. The Agency must address the perceptions of these stakeholders who have now formed views of the Agency founded on their belief that the basis upon which the Agency’s policy decisions were made was flawed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==={{anchor|FHRS}}Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS)===
A food hygiene rating scheme has been deployed by the Food Safety Agency for all food businesses. Ratings are available at the business premises and online. Following a meeting in Cardiff, the FSA plans to make audit reports as widely available as possible for the public. According to Terence Collins, FSA’s Director of communication, the reason behind this decision is to make ratings simple and easily understood for every single business.

Apart from Scotland which is under a very simple Food Hygiene Information Scheme, the FSA’s Food Hygiene Rating Scheme will be tested throughout United Kingdom. As a result, ratings will range from 0 (improvement urgently needed) to 5 (very good), and may be displayed on a certificate. This information will also be made available online. Rating primary meat processing plants is the next step forward for the FSA, as meat audit are currently only available through Freedom of Information requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wrelearning.co.uk/blog/simple-certification-of-food-hygiene-ratings/|title=Simple certification of food hygiene ratings|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local authority in [[Rutland]] is believed to the only one which has not accepted the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Battle of Rutland: Why the council refuses to sign up to the FSA food hygiene rating scheme|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/the-battle-of-rutland-why-the-council-refuses-to-sign-up-to-the-fsa-food-hygiene-rating-scheme-10467609.html|accessdate=23 August 2015|publisher=Independent|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7131">'''Georges Vicaire''' (8 December 1853 – 4 November 1921) was a French bibliophile and bibliographer. The son of {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri Vicaire|fr}} (1802-1865), General Director of forests, and Marthe Vicaire Blais, Georges Vicaire was the father of Jean Vicaire and {{Interlanguage link multi|Marcel Vicaire|fr}} (1893–1976), an orientalist painter.

== Biography ==
Georges Vicaire was responsible for special work on the preparation of the printed catalogs of the [[Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal]], then was attached to the [[Bibliothèque Mazarine]]. In 1909, the [[Institut de France]] appointed curator of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Hôtel Spoelberch de Lovenjoul|fr|3=Hôtel Spoelberch de Lovenjoul|lt=Bibliothèque Lovenjoul}}, created by {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles de Spoelberch de Lovenjoul|fr}} and located in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], next to the [[Musée Condé]], which houses the very large Library of [[Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale]]. He was also correspondent to the [[Vatican Library]]. He had hence access to funds from both institutions.

Vicaire is the author of bibliographies of [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[José-Maria de Heredia]], [[George Sand]], [[Stendhal]], [[Victor Hugo]] and gastronomic literature and a very important work in 8 volumes on the literature of the nineteenth century, [http://notices.bnf.fr/AfficherNoticeServlet?idNotice=36584974 ''Le Manuel de l'amateur de livres du XIX°siècle'' ; 8 volumes available online]. "This work, which will remain one of the monuments of the bibliography, has among other merits that of fending for the first time the issue long overlooked by first editions of the great romantic" and earned its author in 1906, the Botta prize of the [[Académie française]] and twice, in 1900 and 1912, the Brunet prize awarded by the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]].

From 1896 until his death, Georges Vicaire was director of the Bulletin du bibliophile with which he worked since 1890. From 1898 to 1902, he was secretary of the "Amis de l'eau forte" and in 1900, a member of the organizing committee of the retrospective section of book at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]] and a committee member of the International Congress of libraries. On 27 February 1901, he was elected a member of the "Société des bibliophiles françois", established in 1820. At seat XII, he succeeded [[Jean Hély d'Oissel]], [[Félix-Sébastien Feuillet de Conches]], Count Charpin-Feugerolles, Mme Standish-Noailles. In 1890, he had published to her attention, "''Rôti-cochon"'' ("roast-pig") and was preparing for her an important and erudite study which was published in 1901 in the ''Almanach du bibliophile'' with which he collaborated since 1898.

In 1903, appeared '''''Jeunesse de Balzac''''' by [[Gabriel Hanotaux]] and Georges Vicaire. A new edition, augmented of the correspondence between Balzac and Madame de Berny, published shortly after the death of Georges Vicaire, of which Gabriel Hanotaux could write, in the afterword dated November 8, 1921: "He did not have the satisfaction to see this book published and, after twenty-five years of cordial collaboration, I have the pain of losing at the time of realization, this incomparable friend. This book comes from him, it is him. I send it back to his memory. It will include on each page, the marks of his conscience, his flawless erudition and worship he professed for beautiful literature".

Knowledgeable about food and culinary arts, his copious [[Text annotation|annotation]]s have generated exceptional interest for both the [[culinary art]] and [[bibliophily]]. His work ''Bibliographie gastronomique'' "should be considered as the most important bibliographic contribution in this area" ([[André Simon (wine)|André-Louis Simon]]). [[Katherine Bitting]] states "This work is considered the most erudite and valuable existing bibliography on culinary topics."

'''Gonadotropin-releasing hormone''' ('''GnRH''') '''insensitivity''' is a rare [[autosomal recessive]] [[genetic disorder|genetic]] and [[endocrine disease|endocrine]] [[syndrome]] which is characterized by inactivating [[genetic mutation|mutation]]s of the [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor]] (GnRHR) and thus an insensitivity of the receptor to [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH), resulting in a partial or complete loss of the ability of the [[gonad]]s to synthesize the [[sex hormone]]s. The condition manifests itself as [[isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] (IHH), presenting with symptoms such as [[delayed puberty|delayed, reduced, or absent puberty]], low or complete lack of [[libido]], and [[infertility]], and is the predominant cause of IHH when it does not present alongside [[anosmia]].&lt;ref name="pmid21645587"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chevrier L, Guimiot F, de Roux N | title = GnRH receptor mutations in isolated gonadotropic deficiency | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 346 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 21–8 |date=October 2011 | pmid = 21645587 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2011.04.018 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0303-7207(11)00226-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22229029"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beate K, Joseph N, Nicolas de R, Wolfram K | title = Genetics of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: role of GnRH receptor and other genes | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 2012 | issue = | pages = 1–9 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22229029 | pmc = 3249753 | doi = 10.1155/2012/147893 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17161329"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Roux N | title = GnRH receptor and GPR54 inactivation in isolated gonadotropic deficiency | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research.

'''Haralampie Manchev''' ({{lang-mk|Харалампие Манчев}}) ([[Kocani]], March 3, 1898 – [[Skopje]], January 14, 1974) was the first [[ethnic Macedonian|Macedonian]] medical research scientist who studying the child [[pathology]], found some important specifics.

Manchev studied medicine in [[Vienna]] and graduated in [[Belgrade]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manu.edu.mk/prilozi/2012_2/20d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; immediately after the First World War, but could not work in the hospital institution after the one-year medical internship. Got a place as outpatient doctor in dispensaries social diseases of the Hygiene Institute in Skopje, after a number of cases of [[malaria]] in all shapes, child malnutrition, infectious childhood diseases protracted convalescence.

During the Second World War go to specialization in pediatric clinic in Sofia, where he met with Dr. Asparuh Panov, who showed his own material [[haematological]] changes in anemia of Kulej. Manchev started to investigate the incidence of Mediterranean anemia Kulej, where asking for malarial parasites found strange formation ([[leishmaniasis]]) in punktatite children with huge spleens and livers. Revealing [[leishmaniasis]] epidemic in Macedonia gave impetus to many researchers to detect leishmaniasis in other areas. More than 100 children were quickly diagnosed him and treated with specific [[chemotherapy]] with [[antiparasitic]] activity and clinical, a kind ex juvantibus.

He was associate professor of environmental theme of [[Kala-azar]] (KA). Dr. Haralmpie Manchev, who first described this [[parasitosis]] in children in Macedonia, a disease caused by [[leishmaniasis]], the vector of the parasite from infected animals ([[dog]]s, ferrets and other tropical beasts) with gnat known to us as [[papatachi]] (ph. [[Flebotomus paptacei]]).

Haralampie Manchev is the first head of the department at Children's Hospital in Skopje Temporal (1946), first director of the Children's Clinic (1947) and then worked as a doctor in the Special Clinic for lung diseases in children "Kozle". He was the first editor of a medical expert scientific journal Macedonian medical examination issued by the Macedonian Medical Association and the first president of the Association of pediatricians of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

Manchev died after a long illness on 14 January 1974 in Skopje.

'''Ibn Zuhr''' ({{lang-ar|{{larger|ابن زهر}}}}; 1094&amp;ndash;1162), traditionally known by his [[Latinization of names|Latinized name]] of '''Avenzoar''', was an [[Arab]] [[Islamic medicine|physician]], [[surgeon]], and [[poet]]. He was born at [[Seville]] in [[Al-Andalus|medieval Andalusia]] (present-day [[Spain]]), was a contemporary of [[Averroes]] and [[Ibn Tufail]], and was the most well-regarded physician of his era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azar|2008|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly known for his emphasis on a more rational, empiric basis of medicine. His major work, ''Al-Taysīr fil-Mudāwāt wal-Tadbīr'' ("Book of Simplification Concerning Therapeutics and Diet"), was translated into Latin and Hebrew and was influential to the progress of surgery. He also improved surgical and medical knowledge by keying out several diseases and their treatments.

Ibn Zuhr performed the first experimental [[tracheotomy]] on a goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Missori|first=Paolo|author2=Brunetto, Giacoma M. |author3=Domenicucci, Maurizio |title=Origin of the Cannula for Tracheotomy During the Middle Ages and Renaissance|journal=World Journal of Surgery|date=7 February 2012|volume=36|issue=4|pages=928–934|doi=10.1007/s00268-012-1435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is thought to have made the earliest description of [[bezoar]] stones as medicinal items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=Joseph P.|title=Encyclopedia of the Black Death|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1598842536|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
His full name is '''Abū-Marwān ʻAbd al-Malik ibn Abī al-ʻAlāʼ Ibn Zuhr''' ({{lang|ar|{{larger|أبو مروان عبد الملك بن أبي العلاء بن زهر}}}}). His name was Latinized  as '''Avenzoar''', '''Abumeron''', '''Abhomeron''', '''Alomehَn''' or '''Abhomjeron'''.

==Biography==
Avenzoar was born in [[Seville]] in 1094, to the notable Banu Zuhr family who were members of the [[Arab]] tribe of Iyad.&lt;ref&gt;Selin, Helaine (1997). Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Westen Cultures. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; The family has since the early 10th century produced six consecutive generations of [[physicians]], and included jurists, poets, viziers or courtiers, and midwives who served under rulers of Al-Andalus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Azar|2008|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/islamic_medical/islamic_13.html The Art as a Profession], [[United States National Library of Medicine]]&lt;/ref&gt; Avenzoar started his education by studying religion and literature, as was the custom in medieval Muslim socialites. He later studied medicine with his father, Abu'l-Ala Zuhr (d.1131)&lt;ref&gt;Arvide Cambra, L.M. (2015), "Abu l-'Ala' Zuhr, The Quack of Al-Andalus", International Journal of Humanities, Social Sciences and Education (IJHSSE), vol. 2, no. 10, pp. 99-102.&lt;/ref&gt; at an early age. According to Avenzoar himself, his father introduced him to the works of [[Galen]] and [[Hippocrates]], and asked him to swear the [[Hippocratic Oath]] while still a youth.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F.; Livesey, Steven; Wallis, Faith (2014). Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia. Routledge. p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avenzoar started his medical career as court physician for the [[Almoravid|Almoravid dynasty]]. However, for some undisclosed reason, he later fell out of favour with the [[Almoravid|Almoravid ruler]], 'Ali bin Yusuf bin Tashufin, and fled from Seville. He was however, apprehended and jailed in [[Marrakesh]] in 1140. This experience left a bad resentment in him as alluded from his writing. Later in 1147 when the [[Almohad dynasty]] conquered Seville, he returned and devoted himself to medical practice. He died in Seville in 1162.

According to [[Leo Africanus]], ibn Zuhr heard Averroes lecture, and learned physic from him. He was a great admirer of [[Galen]], and in his writings he protests emphatically against [[quackery]] and the superstitious remedies of [[astrology|astrologers]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Avenzoar|volume=3|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
===Kitab al-Iqtisad===
"The book of moderation," this was a treatise on general therapy written in his youth for the [[Almoravid]] prince Ibrahim Yusuf ibn Tashfin. The book is a summary of various different diseases, therapeutics and general hygiene. It is also noted for its advice regarding cosmetics and physical beauty. Ibn Zuhr even recommended [[plastic surgery]] to alter acquired features such as big noses, thick lips or crooked teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F.; Livesey, Steven; Wallis, Faith (2014). Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia. Routledge. p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kitab al-Aghdhiya===
The book of foods, as its name indicates, is a manual on foods and [[regimen]] which contains guidelines for a healthy life. Ibn Zuhr wrote the book shortly after he went out of jail for his new patron, [[Almohad]] leader [[Abd al-Mu'min]]. The book contains classification of different kinds of dishes and foods like bread, meat, beverages, fruits and sweats. When he talks about the meat, Ibn Zuhr  mentions different kinds of animals' fleshes, even unusual ones like those of [[gazelles]], [[lions]] and [[snakes]], classifying them based on their taste, usefulness and digestibility. He also recommends specific foods for each season of the year. For example, during winter, digestion is accelerated, so the amount of food consumed should also be increased. Moreover, the food should also be warmer and drier, as temperatures are lower and humidity is higher.

===Kitab al-Taysir===
Kitab al-Taysir seems to be the last book of Ibn Zuhr before his death. As mentioned in the introduction, the book was authored at the request of his friend, [[Averroes]], to act as a compendium to his medical encyclopedia [[Colliget]] which focused more on general topics of [[medicine]]. The two books were later translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]], where they used to be printed as a single book and remained popular as late as the 18th century.

The book, which contains 30 chapters, provides clinical descriptions and diagnosis of diseases starting from the head. Ibn Zuhr provided an accurate description of the [[esophageal cancer|esophageal]], [[stomach cancer|stomach]] and [[Mediastinal tumor|mediastinal]] cancers, as well as other [[lesions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tweel|first=Jan G.|author2=Taylor, Clive R.|title=A brief history of pathology|journal=Virchows Archiv|date=25 May 2010|volume=457|issue=1|pages=3–10|doi=10.1007/s00428-010-0934-4|pmid=20499087|pmc=2895866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"2 Early concepts of cancer", 2000, Cancer and metastasis reviews, vol. 19, no. 3, pp. 205-205.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed feeding enemas to keep alive patients with stomach cancer. He was also the first to give pathological descriptions of inflammations like [[otitis media]] and [[pericarditis]].

Ibn Zuhr is also credited with providing one of the earliest recorded evidence of the [[Scabies]] mite, which contributed to the scientific advancement of [[microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Microbiology in islam  http://www.diwanalarab.com/spip.php?article34512&lt;/ref&gt; In his Kitab al-Taysir, he wrote the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are lice under the hand, ankle and foot like worms, and sores affecting the same areas. If the skin is removed, there appears from various parts of it, a very small animal which can hardly be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, David (2014). Tapeworms, Lice, and Prions: A Compendium of Unpleasant Infections. OUP Oxford. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perhaps Ibn Zuhr's greatest contribution to medicine was his application of experimental method by introducing animal testing.

An '''intestinal parasite infection''' is a condition in which a [[parasite]] infects the [[gastro-intestinal tract]] of humans and other animals. Such parasites can live anywhere in the body, but most prefer the intestinal wall. 

Routes of exposure and infection include ingestion of undercooked meat, drinking infected water, [[fecal-oral transmission]] and skin absorption. 

Some types of [[helminths]] and [[protozoa]] are classified as intestinal parasites that cause infection—those that reside in the [[intestines]]. These infections can damage or sicken the host (humans or other animals). If the intestinal parasite infection is caused by helminths, the infection is called [[helminthiasis]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms depend on the type of infection. Intestinal parasites produce a variety of symptoms in those affected, most of which manifest themselves in gastrointestinal complications and general weakness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/intestinal_worms/more/en/|title=Intestinal worms|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gastrointestinal complications include diarrhea, nausea, [[dysentery]], and abdominal pain. These symptoms negatively impact nutritional status, including decreased absorption of [[micronutrient]]s, loss of appetite, weight loss, and intestinal blood loss that can often result in [[anemia]]. It may also cause physical and mental disabilities, [[delayed growth]] in children, and skin irritation around the anus and vulva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashtiani|first=M. T.

The prevalence of intestinal parasites is the  highest among children that are  living in the poorest communities in developing nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most common causes of intestinal parasites are through consumption of contaminated water, infected soil, inadequate sanitation and hygiene, and improper hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziegelbauer|first=Kathrin|last2=Speich|first2=Benjamin|last3=Mäusezahl|first3=Daniel|last4=Bos|first4=Robert|last5=Keiser|first5=Jennifer|last6=Utzinger|first6=Jürg|date=2012-01-24|year=|title=Effect of Sanitation on Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001162|journal=PLOS Medicine|volume=9|issue=1|pages=e1001162|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001162|issn=1549-1676|pmc=3265535|pmid=22291577|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, lack of access to facilities for safe disposal of human waste can result in intestinal parasites and disease.

Parasites can get into the intestine by going through the mouth from uncooked or unwashed food, contaminated [[water]] or hands, or by [[skin]] contact with [[larva]] infected [[soil]]; they can also be transferred by the sexual act of [[anilingus]] in some cases.
When the organisms are swallowed, they move into the intestine, where they can reproduce and cause symptoms. Children are particularly susceptible if they are not thoroughly cleaned after coming into contact with infected soil that is present in environments that they may frequently visit such as sandboxes and school playgrounds. People in developing countries are also at particular risk due to drinking water from sources that may be contaminated with parasites that colonize the gastrointestinal tract.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Cryptosporidium muris.jpg|thumb|Cryptosporidium muris]]
Due to the wide variety of intestinal parasites, a description of the symptoms rarely is sufficient for diagnosis. Instead, medical personnel use one of two common tests: they search stool samples for the parasites, or apply an adhesive to the [[anus]] to search for eggs.
===Types===
Major groups of parasites include [[protozoan]]s (organisms having only one cell) and [[helminths|parasitic worm]]s (helminths). Of these, protozoans, including [[cryptosporidium]], [[microsporidia]], and [[isospora]], are most common in [[HIV]]-infected persons. Each of these parasites can infect the digestive tract, and sometimes two or more can cause infection at the same time.

==Prevention and intervention==
Good hygiene is necessary to avoid reinfection. [[The Rockefeller Foundation]]'s hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s was extremely effective at eliminating hookworm from humans with the use of [[anthelmintic]]s. However, preventative measures were not adequately introduced to the people that were treated. Therefore, the rate of reinfection was extremely high and the project evaluated through any sort of scientific method was a marked failure. More education was needed to inform the people of the importance of wearing shoes, using [[latrines]] (better access to [[sanitation]]), and good hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Birn, Anne-Emanuelle|author2=Armando Solórzano|year=1999|title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=49|issue=9|pages=1197–1213|pmid=10501641|doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intestinal parasite prevention methods are not isolated to specific geographical areas; however, many of the research-based interventions have primarily taken place in underdeveloped countries and regions, where sanitation is a large concern for spreading disease.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}Current best practice behaviors that prevent intestinal parasites include: using proper hand washing practices, using correctly-built latrines with ample ventilation, having a piped water source, and wearing shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelaw|first=Aschalew|last2=Anagaw|first2=Belay|last3=Nigussie|first3=Bethel|last4=Silesh|first4=Betrearon|last5=Yirga|first5=Atnad|last6=Alem|first6=Meseret|last7=Endris|first7=Mengistu|last8=Gelaw|first8=Baye|date=2013-01-01|year=|title=Prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections and risk factors among schoolchildren at the University of Gondar Community School, Northwest Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-13-304|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=13|pages=304|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-304|issn=1471-2458|pmc=3621079|pmid=23560704|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abossie|first=Ashenafi|last2=Seid|first2=Mohammed|date=2014-01-01|year=|title=Assessment of the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis and associated risk factors among primary school children in Chencha town, Southern Ethiopia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-166|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=14|pages=166|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-166|issn=1471-2458|pmc=3933408|pmid=24528627|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in some parts of Ethiopia where disease prevalence is high, up to 80% of people in a population lack access to washing facilities. While this is high, 93% did have access to a latrine, but only 29.2% of those latrines had proper construction to decrease parasitic infections.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;Behavioral interventions have focused on promoting washing, sometimes with soap, in context of education at schools and child care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ejemot-Nwadiaro|first=Regina I|last2=Ehiri|first2=John E|last3=Arikpo|first3=Dachi|last4=Meremikwu|first4=Martin M|last5=Critchley|first5=Julia A|date=2015-09-03|year=|title=Hand washing promotion for preventing diarrhoea|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=9|pages=1–95|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004265.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4563982|pmid=26346329|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent studies, the best interventions follow a multidisciplinary approach by:
* Increasing environmental sanitation to promote hand washing and shoe wearing habits

Drugs are frequently used to kill parasites in the host. In earlier times, [[turpentine]] was often used for this, but modern drugs do not poison intestinal worms directly. Rather, anthelmintic drugs now inhibit an enzyme that is necessary for the worm to make the substance that prevents the worm from being digested.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

For example, [[tapeworm]]s are usually treated with a medicine taken by mouth. The most commonly used medicine for tapeworms is [[praziquantel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model Prescribing Information: Drugs Used in Parasitic Diseases - Second Edition: Helminths: Cestode (tapeworm) infection|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2922e/3.html|website=apps.who.int|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holtorf is a graduate of the [[University of California at Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pop.2008.07.015 |title=Hormones in Wellness and Disease Prevention: Common Practices, Current State of the Evidence, and Questions for the Future |year=2008 |last1=Schwartz |first1=Erika T. |last2=Holtorf |first2=Kent |journal=Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=669–705 |pmid=18928825}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a graduate of the [[St. Louis University School of Medicine]], where he received his doctorate of medicine then returned to UCLA for residency training.&lt;ref name="KentPost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz" /&gt; He has maintained a clinical practice since 1994 and is a former medical director of the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Centers, Inc. (FFC).&lt;ref name="KentPost" /&gt; Holtorf has published a number of endocrine reviews on complex topics in peer-reviewed journals on controversial diseases and treatments.&lt;ref name="Schwartz" /&gt; He is a guest editor and peer-reviewer for a number of medical journals including ''[[Endocrine (journal)|Endocrine]]'',  is the current AOL Health Expert in Endocrinology,&lt;ref name="Schwartz" /&gt; and is a diplomate and board examiner of the American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine (ABAAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agemd.org/about-agemd/executive-board |title=AgeMD Advisory Board &amp;#124; AgeMD Bioidentical Hormone Doctors |publisher=Agemd.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is a founding member of The Bioidentical Hormone Initiative (BHI), and a founder and director of the National Academy of Hypothyroidism (NAH).&lt;ref name="Schwartz" /&gt; In 2001, Holtorf established the Holtorf Medical Group.&lt;ref name="Schwartz" /&gt;

==Controversy==

Holtorf has been the subject of criticism online and in the media for several years for his promotion of controversial diagnostic methods. He has been an advocate of bioidentical hormones, which has been labeled as quack medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthandage.com/saturday-quack-bio-identical-hormone-therapy |title=Saturday Quack - Bio-Identical Hormone Therapy |author=Robert W. Griffith, MD |publisher=Healthandage.com |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2011-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415082258/http://www.healthandage.com/saturday-quack-bio-identical-hormone-therapy |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published an extensive review on the safety and efficacy of bioidentical hormones in the peer-reviewed journal ''Post Graduate Medicine''. The review concluded, “Physiological data and clinical outcomes demonstrate that bioidentical hormones are associated with lower risks, including the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, and are more efficacious than their synthetic and animal derived counterparts. Until evidence is found to the contrary, bioidentical hormones remain the preferred method of HRT. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to delineate these differences more clearly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19179815 |year=2009 |last1=Holtorf |first1=K |title=The bioidentical hormone debate: Are bioidentical hormones (estradiol, estriol, and progesterone) safer or more efficacious than commonly used synthetic versions in hormone replacement therapy? |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=73–85 |doi=10.3810/pgm.2009.01.1949 |journal=Postgraduate Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusions were contrary to mainstream opinions on the use of bioidentical hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20154637 |year=2010 |last1=North American Menopause |first1=Society |title=Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=242–55 |doi=10.1097/gme.0b013e3181d0f6b9 |journal=Menopause}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many argue that the extensive use of compounded bioidentical hormones is risky because they can be inconsistent and unstable and are not always subject to FDA oversight.&lt;ref name="Diagnosis"&gt;“Diagnosis of hypothyroidism: Are we getting what we want from TSH testing?” ''The Non-Profit National Academy of Hypothyroidism.'' Nahypothyroidism.org. Retrieved 2011-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/womens-health/articles/2009/01/30/the-truth-about-bio-identical-hormone-therapy |title=The Truth About 'Bio-identical' Hormone Therapy |publisher=US News and World Report |author=Gardner, Amanda |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menopause.org/bioidenticalHT_Endosoc.pdf |title=The Endocrine Society Position Statement (bio-identical hormones) |publisher=The Endocrine Society |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holtorf has also taken an unpopular stance that children are over vaccinated and that vaccines may be associated with autism. Televised appearances and interviews have put Holtorf's views front and center and invited criticism and debate. Among them, his 2009 appearance on ''Fox News'' in regards to the [[H1N1]] vaccine, in which Holtorf plainly states he "definitely would not" administer the controversial vaccine to his own children, is one of the most highly deliberated.&lt;ref name="Ashford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashford |first=Molika |url=http://www.stinkyjournalism.org/editordetail.php?id=461 |title=FOX News Broadcasts Bad Advice From H1N1 Flu "Expert" |publisher=Stinkyjournalism.org |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2011-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212132314/http://www.stinkyjournalism.org/editordetail.php?id=461 |archivedate=2011-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holtorf likewise links high levels of vaccine adjuncts, such as mercury, to some cases of autism development in children during the interview and is questionably identified on the program as an infectious disease expert.&lt;ref name="Ashford" /&gt; This view is contrary to the position statements of agencies such as the [[Center for Disease Control]] and the [[Institute of Medicine]], and societies such as the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], who state that there is no credible evidence that vaccines have any link to autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flushotsusa.com/detail/C97/vaccine_safety1 |title=Vaccine Safety &amp;#124; Immunization Facts For Parents &amp;#124; Immunization Safety - Mollen Immunization |publisher=Flushotsusa.com |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/isdh/files/MMR_VaccineAutismFacts.pdf |title=MMR Vaccine and Autism - CDC. (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella). FACT SHEET |publisher=www.in.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism==

Holtorf states that the standard thyroid tests which are typically relied upon by primary care and specialist physicians to diagnosis hypothyroidism (low thyroid) and determine dosage are insufficient because they focus on TSH levels as an indicator of thyroid function and miss a large percentage of people with low thyroid.&lt;ref name="Diagnosis" /&gt; This is discussed extensively on the website of his nonprofit organization the National Academy of Hypothyroidism.&lt;ref&gt;“How Accurate is TSH Testing?” NAHypothyroidism.org. Retrieved 2011-10-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Holtorf advocates labs and diagnostics which look at all thyroid hormone levels, with a particular emphasis on free T3, triodothyronine, the active hormone both produced by the thyroid and converted from T4, levothyroxine, and reverse T3, a metabolite of T4 conversion usually created during times of stress or trauma.&lt;ref name="Diagnosis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thyroid.about.com/od/hypothyroidismhashimotos/a/The-Optimal-Treatment-For-Hypothyroidism.htm |title=Optimal Treatment for Hypothyroidism - Dr. Kent Holtorf Shares Thoughts About The Best Way to Treat an Underactive Thyroid and Hypothyroidism |publisher=Thyroid.about.com |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrary to position statements by societies such as the American Thyroid Association and [[American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)|American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thyroidguidelines.net/hypothyroidism_1995/guidelines |title=Treatment Guidelines for Patients With Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism &amp;#124; Thyroid Cancer Guidelines from the American Thyroid Association |publisher=Thyroidguidelines.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206192607/http://thyroidguidelines.net/hypothyroidism_1995/guidelines |archivedate=2011-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15260011 |year=2002 |last1=Baskin |first1=HJ |last2=Cobin |first2=RH |last3=Duick |first3=DS |last4=Gharib |first4=H |last5=Guttler |first5=RB |last6=Kaplan |first6=MM |last7=Segal |first7=RL |author8=American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists |title=American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=457–69 |journal=Endocrine Practice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holtorf condones treating hypothyroidism with compounded combinations of bioidentical thyroid hormones.&lt;ref name="Diagnosis" /&gt;

==Diagnosis and treatment of CFS and fibromyalgia==

[[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]] (CFS) and [[fibromyalgia]] are two separate disorders that share many overlapping symptoms and are often cross-diagnosed. FDA approved therapies for the treatment of fibromyalgia include [[Cymbalta]] (duloxetine hydrochloride), [[Lyrica]] (pregabalin), and [[Savella]] (milnacipran HCL); while there are no FDA approved medications for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pi.lilly.com/us/cymbalta-pi.pdf |title=Highlights of Prescribing Medication - Cymbalta |publisher=pi.lilly.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=49051 |title=Highlights of Prescribing Medication - Lyrica |publisher=Dailymed.nlm.nih.gov |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frx.com/pi/Savella_pi.pdf |title=Highlights of Prescribing Medication - Savella |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other medications that are commonly used include tryicylcic antidepressants, SSRI antidepressants, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/tc/fibromyalgia-medications |title=Fibromyalgia Medications |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Dr Holtorf advocates a controversial six step plan that involves the treatment of hormone imbalances, mitochondrial dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and chronic infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kent Holtorf, MD |url=http://healthy-aging.advanceweb.com/Article/A-Confounding-Condition.aspx |title=A Confounding Condition on ADVANCE for Healthy Aging |publisher=Healthy-aging.advanceweb.com |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease==

The Infectious Disease Society of America states that [[Lyme disease]] is easily treated with a few weeks of antibiotics and that chronic Lyme disease does not exist. Their position is that standard blood tests are an accurate means of determining the presence of Lyme disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/508667 |title=The Clinical Assessment, Treatment, and Prevention of Lyme Disease, Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis, and Babesiosis: Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America |year=2006 |last1=Wormser |first1=Gary P. |last2=Dattwyler |first2=Raymond J. |last3=Shapiro |first3=Eugene D. |last4=Halperin |first4=John J. |last5=Steere |first5=Allen C. |last6=Klempner |first6=Mark S. |last7=Krause |first7=Peter J. |last8=Bakken |first8=Johan S. |last9=Strle |first9=Franc |last10=Stanek |first10=Gerold |last11=Bockenstedt |first11=Linda |last12=Fish |first12=Durland |last13=Stephen Dumler |first13=J. |last14=Nadelman |first14=Robert B. |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=43 |issue=9 |pages=1089–134 |pmid=17029130|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight loss==

Holtorf maintains a controversial stance that weight loss is not an issue of diet and exercise, citing causes for the inability to lose weight as leptin resistance, undiagnosed hypothyroidism, environmental toxins, hypometabolism and dysfunctional weight set-point.&lt;ref name="long"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kent-holtorf/long-term-weight-loss---m_b_192933.html |title=Kent Holtorf: Long Term Weight Loss - More Than Will Power? |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hormoneandlongevitycenter.com/leptinweightloss/ |title=Weight Loss |publisher=Hormoneandlongevitycenter.com |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leptin resistance is described as a condition in which overweight individuals are unable to respond to the hormone’s signals appropriately, leading to a starvation response in the body as well as hypothyroid symptoms at the cellular level where they are more difficult to detect. Holtorf treats leptin resistance in patients with a class of medications that are typically reserved for controlling blood sugar levels in diabetics.&lt;ref name="long" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weight" /&gt;

A suppressed or "wrecked" metabolism is another cause of obesity commonly cited by Holtorf.&lt;ref name="weight" /&gt; Holtorf claims the metabolism, when subjected to repeated or overzealous dieting and exercise, will regulate itself by repressing thyroid hormone levels in the body, resulting in a hypothyroid state.&lt;ref name="weight" /&gt; Even the return to normal intake of food or levels of exercise will not be substantial enough to return the metabolism to its previous state. According to his website, holtorfmed.com, this leads to a permanently or chronically suppressed metabolism and Holtorf issues metabolic testing for patients exhibiting metabolism suppression, as well as labs denoting thyroid and other hormone levels.&lt;ref name="weight" /&gt;

Set-Point malfunction is another theory proposed and supported by Holtorf, which suggests that the body is programmed to return to a set weight and that this point can be altered by numerous medications, resulting in weight gain.&lt;ref name="weight" /&gt; Holtorf prescribes naltrexone, an opioid receptor blocker, used most often to treat opiate addiction, and buproprion (Wellbutrin), a common antidepressant, to reduce the body's set-point.&lt;ref name="weight" /&gt;

'''Lake Tarnobrzeg''', '''Machowski Reservoir''' or '''Lake Machów''' is an artificial lake created in a former [[sulfur]] [[mining|mine]] in [[Machów, Tarnobrzeg|Machów]], [[Tarnobrzeg]], [[Poland]].

==History==
The lake was opened in 2010 after 16 years of construction and landscaping. The re-cultivation work began in the old mine in 1994. The total cost of changing post the industrial area into lake totaled 1.5 billion [[Polish złoty|PLN]]. The project was paid for by the [[State Treasury]].

== Re-name ==
In 2011 the Tarnobrzeg City Council, together with the Mayor of Tarnobrzeg, [[Interpellation (politics)|interpellated]] with the [[Ministry of the Interior and Administration (Poland)|Polish Ministry of the Interior and Administration]] to change the official name to '''Lake Tarnobrzeg'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiwum.tarnobrzeg.pl/uchwaly/VI/168.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that occurred in the [[Americas]].

This section does '''not''' include [[List of rampage killers#School massacres|school massacres]]; [[List of rampage killers#Workplace killings|workplace killings]]; [[List of rampage killers#Religious, political or racial crimes|religious, political, or racial crimes]]; or mass murders that took place primarily in a [[List of rampage killers#Domestic violence|domestic environment]], like familicides, which are covered in their own categories. Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another [[felony]], like robbery, are also excluded.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons at least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

'''Majewski's polydactyly syndrome''', also known as '''polydactyly with neonatal chondrodystrophy type I, short rib-polydactyly syndrome type II''', and '''short rib-polydactyly syndrome''', is a lethal form of [[neonatal]] [[dwarfism]] characterized by [[osteochondrodysplasia]] ([[skeleton|skeletal]] abnormalities in the development of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]]) with a narrow [[thorax]], [[syndactyly|polysyndactyly]], disproportionately short [[tibia]]e, thorax dysplasia, hypoplastic [[lungs]] and respiratory insufficiency. Associated anomalies include protruding abdomen, [[brachydactyly]], peculiar faces, hypoplastic [[epiglottis]], cardiovascular defects, renal cysts, and also genital anomalies. Death occurs before or at birth.

The disease is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern.

It was characterized in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 4331366 | year = 1971 | last1 = Majewski | first1 = F. | last2 = Pfeiffer | last3 = Lenz | last4 = Müller | last5 = Feil | last6 = Seiler | title = Polysyndactyly, short limbs, and genital malformations--a new syndrome? | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 118–138 | journal = Zeitschrift für Kinderheilkunde | doi = 10.1007/BF00446428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue-tailed damselflies (Ischnura elegans) mating, female typica 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Blue-tailed damselfly|Blue-tailed damselflies]]&lt;br&gt;(''Ischnura elegans'') mating]]

In [[biology]], '''mating''' (or '''mateing''' in [[American and British English spelling differences|British English]]) is the pairing of either opposite-[[sex]] or [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[organism]]s, usually for the purposes of [[sexual reproduction]]. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mating|title=Mate|author=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other definitions extend the term to mating in plants and fungi. ''[[Fertilization]]'' is the fusion of both [[Germ cell|sex cell]] or [[gamete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary|title='Fertilization' - definition of|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fertilization|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Copulation (zoology)|Copulation]]'' is the union of the [[sex organ]]s of two sexually reproducing animals for [[insemination]] and subsequent [[internal fertilization]]. Mating may also lead to [[external fertilization]], as seen in [[amphibians]], [[fish]]es and plants. For the majority of species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization ([[Reproduction#Autogamy|autogamy]]); for example, [[banana slug]]s.

The term ''mating'' is also applied to related processes in [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[virus]]es.  Mating in these cases involves the pairing of individuals, accompanied by the pairing of their [[homologous chromosomes]] and then exchange of genomic information leading to formation of [[Genetic recombination|recombinant]] progeny (see [[mating systems]]).

==Animals==
{{Main|Animal sexual behaviour}}
{{See also|Copulation (zoology)|Human mating strategies}}

For animals, mating strategies include [[random mating]], [[disassortative mating]], [[assortative mating]], or a [[mating pool]]. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as [[nest]]-building and [[nutrition|feed]]ing offspring. The human practice of mating and [[Artificial_insemination#Artificial_insemination_in_livestock_and_pets|artificially inseminating domesticated animals]] is part of [[animal husbandry]].

In some [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[arthropod]]s, including [[insect]]s representing [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] (primitive) [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] clades, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure.  [[Courtship display|Courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. In groups such as [[dragonflies]] and many [[spider]]s, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified [[sternite]]s on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male [[pedipalp]]s). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its [[aedeagus]], a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a "[[spermatophore]]") into the female's reproductive tract.

Other animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s. Vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) reproduce with internal fertilization through [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]),{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while [[Mating behavior of mammals|mammals copulate vagina]]lly.&lt;ref name="Hyman1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Libbie Henrietta Hyman|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=copulate&amp;f=false|date=15 September 1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-87013-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants and fungi==
{{Main|Mating systems#In plants|Mating in fungi|Mating of yeast}}

Like in animals, mating in other Eukaryotes, such as [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]], denotes {{clarify span|sexual conjugation|date=April 2013}}. However, in vascular plants this is mostly achieved without physical contact between mating individuals (see [[pollination]]), and in some cases, e.g., in fungi no distinguishable male or female organs exist (see [[isogamy]]); however, [[mating type]]s in some fungal species are somewhat analogous to [[sexual dimorphism]] in animals, and determine whether or not two individual isolates can mate. ''[[Yeasts]]'' are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s classified in the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[fungus|Fungi]], with 1,500 [[species]] currently described.&lt;ref name="YeastRef2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yeastgenome.org/VL-what_are_yeast.html |title=What are yeasts? |work=Yeast Virtual Library |date=13 September 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226151906/http://www.yeastgenome.org/VL-what_are_yeast.html |archivedate=26 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, under high stress conditions like [[nutrient]] starvation, [[haploid]] cells will die; under the same conditions, however, [[diploid]] cells of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' can undergo sporulation, entering sexual reproduction ([[meiosis]]) and produce a variety of haploid [[spore]]s, which can go on to [[mating of yeast|mate]] (conjugate) and reform the [[diploid]].&lt;ref name=Neiman2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neiman, A.M. |title=Ascospore formation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=565–584 |year=2005 |pmid=16339736 |pmc=1306807 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.69.4.565-584.2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protists==

Protists are a large group of diverse [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[microorganism]]s, mainly [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] animals and plants, that do not form [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].  Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid11452306"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Javaux EJ, Knoll AH, Walter MR |title=Morphological and ecological complexity in early eukaryotic ecosystems |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6842 |pages=66–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11452306 |doi=10.1038/35083562 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists. Mating and sexual reproduction are widespread among extant eukaryotes including protists such as ''[[Paramecium]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]''. In many eukaryotic species, mating is promoted by [[sex pheromones]] including the protist ''[[Blepharisma japonicum]].'' Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger&lt;ref name="pmid10229582"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dacks J, Roger AJ |title=The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=779–83 |year=1999 |pmid=10229582 |doi= 10.1007/pl00013156|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes.  A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain [[pathogen]]ic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree.  However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for [[meiosis]] and hence mating.  To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite ''[[Giardia lamblia|Giardia intestinalis]]'' was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex.  However, ''G. intestinalis'' was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid15668177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramesh MA, Malik SB, Logsdon JM |title=A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis |journal=Curr.

Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of mating and sexual reproduction, was also found in ''G. intestinalis''.&lt;ref name="pmid17980591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper MA, Adam RD, Worobey M, Sterling CR |title=Population genetics provides evidence for recombination in Giardia |journal=Curr.

Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intechopen.com/books/meiosis/evolutionary-origin-and-adaptive-function-of-meiosis Bernstein H and Bernstein C (2013).

'''Muhammadu Bello Abubahkar Masaba Bida''' also known as '''Mohammed Bello Abubakar'''&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/1024/p07s08-woaf.html Nigerian man with 86 wives faces a 'fatwa'] The Christian Science Monitor, 24 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (28 January 1924-28 January 2017) was born in [[Nigeria]]. Masaba is known for having  stirred up controversy in his hometown [[Bida]], [[Niger State]] due to his extensive polygamy, and for being outspoken, he was uncharged under [[Sharia law]] and sent to prison in 2008 for refusing to divorce 82 of his wives.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; Islam limits the number of wives a Muslim man can have to four, mandating they must be all treated equally.&lt;ref name="arrest"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7618396.stm Nigerian with 86 wives arrested] BBC.co.uk, 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He married 120 wives, divorced 10, and fathered 203 children. At the time of his death in 2017, some of his wives were believed to be pregnant.&lt;ref name="muslimpreacher"&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/world/nigeria-muslim-preacher-with-130-wives-dies-at-93-4500043 Nigerian Muslim Preacher with 130 Wives Dies], ''[[The Indian Express]]'', 31 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Masaba was as a teacher and [[Imam]]. He lived in an entire apartment block with his family. Masaba claimed that he never pursued his wives, and that he was sought by them due to his reputation as a [[Traditional healer|healer]]. Most of his wives were younger than 30 years of age, and a few younger than his elder children. In interviews with [[Al Jazeera English]], his wives claimed that he was a good husband and father. 

== Interpretation of the Quran ==
The [[Quran]] states that a man may marry up to four wives mandating they must be all treated equally. Masaba claimed that when the Quran set a law, it must also set a punishment for offenders, and no punishment was given for this offense.&lt;ref name="advises"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7547148.stm Nigerian advises against 86 wives] BBC.co.uk, 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During a prison interview Masaba told The Christian Science Monitor:

"If God permits me, I will marry more than 86 wives. A normal human being could not marry 86 – but I can only by the grace of God, I married 86 women and there is peace in the house – if there is peace, how can this be wrong?"&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

== Interrogations and trials ==
After the death pronouncement on him by the Islamic group, '''Jama'atu Nasiru-l Islam (JNI)''', the [[Bida Emirate]] Council and an assembly of Islamic leaders invited Masaba for interrogation. Deliberations were given in Etsu Nupe's palace Bida and the '''Etsu Nupe of Bida, Alhaji Yahya Abubakar''' read out a veredict saying that Masaba should divorce 82 of the 86 wives within 48 hours or leave the entire [[Nupe Kingdom]] as his safety could not be guaranteed within the kingdom. At the expiration of the ultimatum, Masaba refused to divorce any of his wives and denied ever promising this.&lt;ref name="travails"&gt;''In spite of his travails, followers, children back embattled man with 86 wives'', "Sunday Punch", Nigeria 7 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="embattled"&gt;[http://nigeriaworld.com/news/archive/2008/step/6.html In spite of his travails, followers, children back embattled man with 86 wives], ''[[NigeriaWorld News Archive]]'', 7 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2008 Bello was arrested by Islamic authorities and tried before a [[Sharia]] court.&lt;ref name="arrest" /&gt; Before his trial at the Sharia court, Police in Niger State gave him a clean bill, as the state command declared that nothing incriminating was found in his house. The leader of the police team, that arrested the Islamic cleric in Bida before 27 September 2008, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mr John Olayemi declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We found nothing incriminating in his house. There was no knife, no pistol or skull in his house when we went to invite him to the headquarters for a chat."&lt;ref name=exonerate&gt;[http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=64126 Police exonerate man with 86 wives], ''[[The Nation]]'', Nigeria 27 September 2008."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Olayemi explained that the command of arresting Masaba acted on an instrument of Upper Sharia Court.&lt;ref name=exonerate/&gt;

== Life in prison ==
In October 6,2008, while in detention in '''[[Minna]]''' Prison, an '''Upper Sharia Court Judge''' in Minna, Alhaji Abdulmalik Imam, transferred Masaba's case to a Chief Magistrate's Court in Minna after admitting lacking jurisdiction. Masaba was still remanded in prison custody at the instance of the Sharia Court.&lt;ref name="transferred"&gt;[http://nm.onlinenigeria.com/templates/default.aspx?a=13704&amp;template=print-article.htm Polygamist's Trial: Sharia Court Transfers Case], ''[[Online Nigeria]]'', 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hands"&gt;[http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=65219 Sharia Judge hands of Masaba's Case], ''[[The Nation]]'', Nigeria 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="magistrate"&gt;Falola, Francis. "Judge Transfers Masaba's case to magistrate's court", ''[[The Punch]]'', Nigeria 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of protestors gathered to protest against his actions, and claimed that if he were released, they would not allow him to return to his home. His wives announced their outrage at his arrest. Due to his persistent refusal to divorce 82 of his wives during his trial&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7591037.stm Nigerian man to divorce 82 wives] BBC.co.uk, 31 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="legal"&gt;[http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=20080825112649977 Nigeria's Islamic authority has told an 84-year-old man with 86 wives and 170 children that he must whittle his number of spouses down to four. Mohammed Bello Abubakar, a former teacher and preacher, could face the death penalty under Sharia law, which was reintroduced to the Muslim-majority Niger State in 2000.] Legal Brief Today, 25 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ,he was sentenced to death. The sentence was lifted in early September 2008.&lt;ref name="advises" /&gt;&lt;ref name="death"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7574757.stm Nigerian faces death for 86 wives] BBC.co.uk, 21 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="divorce"&gt;[http://news.theage.com.au/world/nigerian-man-agrees-to-divorce-82-wives-20080902-47pf.html Nigerian man agrees to divorce 82 wives] theage.com.au, 2 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Masaba still faced eviction from his home. The case was reported globally and throughout Nigeria, angering many Nigerian Muslims. 

Following the case, Masaba told the BBC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A man with ten wives would collapse and die, but my own power is given by Allah. That is why I have been able to control 86 of them," &lt;ref name="death" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Release ==
On 12 November 2008, a '''Federal High Court''' sitting in Maitama, [[Abuja]] ordered the release of Masaba from detention in '''Minna Prison''' with immediate effect. The trial high court judge, '''Justice G.O. Kolawole''' attached no condition to his release. The judge also ordered '''the Inspector General of  Police''', Mr Mike Okiro, to ensure the protection of Masaba's [[fundamental rights]] to life, liberty and privacy, as enshrined in the 1999 [[constitution]] of [[Nigeria]], through the '''Niger State Commissioner of Police'''. Masaba returned to his hometown, [[Bida]], on 13 November 2008.&lt;ref name="freemasaba"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/20081110122html Nigeria: Court Frees Masaba], ''[[All Africa Global Media (all Africa)]]'', 13 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="court fees"&gt;"Court Frees Masaba", ''[[Africa News Service (business. high beam.com)]]'', 13 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="children"&gt;[http://www.ijawmonitor.org/news.php?cut=3&amp;article=398 "I've added 18 to my children since I was released from detention"], ''[[The Punch]]'', Nigeria 2010-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, '''Dr. Muazu Babangida Aliyu''', the [[governor]] of [[Niger State]] said "though we have [[Sharia]] in place in the state, but we have no law to pin him down".&lt;ref name="nolaw"&gt;"Conversation with an octogenarian polygamist", ''[[The Nation]]'', Nigeria 21 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Niger State government's effort to prosecute Masaba , were unsuccessful because of legal lacuna. The '''Speaker of Niger State House of Assembly''', Barrister Adamu Usman, disclosed that various attempts to prosecute Masaba ran into hitches because there was no provision in the law of the state to effect his prosecution.&lt;ref name="prosecute"&gt;"Why we Could Not Prosecute Man With 86 Wives", ''[[Leadership]]'', Nigeria 30 January2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrister Adamu Usman said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"As '''Attorney General''' then I personally appeared before Sharia court, Minna, as prosecutor to prosecute the man but later discovered that Sharia courts in Niger State cannot deal with the case. No provision made in Penal code C.P.C or Sharia administration of Justice law to deal with such cases."&lt;ref name=prosecute/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Appearance on media ==
Masaba is frequently depicted by the media as "the man with 86 wives." Contrary to some media reports, that Masaba divorced 82 out of his 86 wives, he '''refused to divorce''' any of his wives.&lt;ref name="travails" /&gt;&lt;ref name="embattled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="refusedivorce"&gt;"Man refuses 82 divorces", ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'', London, England, 18 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contrary"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-185230910.html Man refuses 82 divorces], ''[[Around the World. (News)]]'', 18 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently Masaba has reappeared in articles concerning an alleged plot to disenfranchise his family. Members of his family were prevented by thugs from registering to vote.&lt;ref name="sue"&gt;[http://newnigerianpolitics.com/2011/02/06/man-with-86-wives-to-sue-inec/ Man with 86 wives to sue INEC] NewNigerianPolitics.com. 6 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine members of the Masaba family were injured by thugs whenever they attempted to register to vote.&lt;ref name="disenfranchisement"&gt;[http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/man-with-86-wives-alleges-disenfranchisement/85889/ Man with 86 Wives Alleges Disenfranchisement] ThisDayLive.com, 7 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="times"&gt;[http://www.thetimesofnigeria.com/Article.aspx?id=3145 INEC Displays List Of Candidates In States] The Times of Nigeria, 7 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a Federal High Court sitting in [[Abuja]] ordered the release of Masaba from detention, he had 18 more children, having a total of 138 .&lt;ref name="added"&gt;"I've added 18 to my 120 children since I was released from detention", ''[[Sunday]]', Nigeria 17 April 2010.''&lt;/ref&gt; Masaba came into limelight with another super [[polygamist]], '''Ziona Chana''' of India in 2011. As of May 2011, Masaba had 89 wives and 133 children while India's Ziona Chana had 39 wives, 94 children and 33 grandchildren.&lt;ref name="masabachana"&gt;[http://www.nigerianews24.com/articles/masaba-chana-tale-of-two-super-polygamists-nigerian-tribune Maasaba, Chana: Tale of two super polygamists], ''[[Nigerian Tribune]]'', 18 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Masaba had an interview with Jide Orintunsin where he debunked his rumoured death and said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Large number of wives? I only have 97 wives. I am still going to marry more. I will keep marrying them for as long I am alive. Whoever is fighting me because of my wives or love life. Such an individual has missed it. Left for me, I would have married maybe two wives, but what I am doing is divine. It is an assignment and I will keep marrying till the end of time. I just want to advise those fighting against the number of my wives to stop because such people are waging war against God, their creator."&lt;ref name="97wives"&gt;[http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index.php/news/52156-i-would-have-taken-only-two-wives-but-i%E2%80%99m-fulfilling-a-divine-assignment-%E2%80%94-super-polygamist-masaba.html I would have taken only two wives but I'm fulfilling a divine assignment - super polygamist Masaba], ''[[The Nation]]'', Nigeria 30 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Morning sickness''', also called '''nausea and vomiting of pregnancy''' ('''NVP'''), is a [[Symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy|symptom of pregnancy]] that involves [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]].&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt; Despite the name, nausea or vomiting can occur at any time during the day.&lt;ref name=Fes2009/&gt; Typically these symptoms occur between the 4th and 16th [[gestational age|week of pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Fes2009/&gt; About 10% of women still have symptoms after the 20th week of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Fes2009/&gt; A severe form of the condition is known as [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] and results in weight loss.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practice Bulletin No. 153: Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=September 2015|volume=126|issue=3|pages=e12–24|pmid=26287788|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000001048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Women2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Pregnancy|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html|website=Office on Women's Health|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=September 27, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210060201/http://womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html|archivedate=10 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of morning sickness is unknown but may be related to changing levels of the hormone [[human chorionic gonadotrophin]].&lt;ref name=Fes2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Festin|first1=M|title=Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy|journal=BMJ Clinical Evidence|date=3 June 2009|volume=2009|pmid=21726485|pmc=2907767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed that it may be useful from an [[evolutionary]] point of view.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt; Diagnosis should only occur after other possible causes have been ruled out.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015/&gt; [[Abdominal pain]], fever, or [[headache]]s are typically not present in morning sickness.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;

&lt;!-- Prognosis, history, epidemiology, and culture --&gt;
Morning sickness affects about 70-80% of all pregnant women to some extent.&lt;ref name=Kor2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ei2013&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Einarson|first=Thomas R.|last2=Piwko|first2=Charles|last3=Koren|first3=Gideon|date=2013-01-01|title=Prevalence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in the USA: a meta analysis|journal=Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology |volume=20|issue=2|pages=e163–170|issn=1710-6222|pmid=23863545}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 60% of women have vomiting.&lt;ref name=Fes2009/&gt; Hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in about 1.6% of pregnancies.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt; Morning sickness can negatively affect [[quality of life]], result in decreased ability to work while pregnant, and result in health care expenses.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practice Bulletin Summary No. 153: Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=September 2015|volume=126|issue=3|pages=687–8|pmid=26287781|doi=10.1097/01.aog.0000471177.80067.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally mild to moderate cases have no effect on the baby.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt; Most severe cases also have normal outcomes.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt; Some women choose to have an [[abortion]] due to the severity of symptoms.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt; Complications such as [[Wernicke encephalopathy]] or [[esophageal rupture]] may occur but are very rare.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
About 66% of women have both nausea and vomiting while 33% have just nausea.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt;

==Cause==
The cause of morning sickness is unknown.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt; While some have claimed it to be due to psychological reasons, this is not supported by evidence.&lt;ref name=ACOG2015Full/&gt;

Nausea and vomiting may also occur with [[molar pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verberg|first1=MF|last2=Gillott|first2=DJ|last3=Al-Fardan|first3=N|last4=Grudzinskas|first4=JG|title=Hyperemesis gravidarum, a literature review|journal=Human Reproduction Update|date=2005|volume=11|issue=5|pages=527–39|pmid=16006438|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmi021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

===Hormone changes===
[[File:Morning sickness.svg|thumb|300px|Pathophysiology of vomiting in pregnancy]]
* An increase in the circulating level of the [[hormone]] [[estrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lagiou |first1=P |author2=Tamimi, R |author3=Mucci, LA |author4=Trichopoulos, D |author5=Adami, HO |author6=Hsieh, CC|title=Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in relation to prolactin, estrogens, and progesterone: a prospective study |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=April 2003|volume=101|issue=4|pages=639–44|pmid=12681864  |deadurl=no |doi=10.1016/s0029-7844(02)02730-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no consistent evidence of differences in estrogen levels and levels of [[bilirubin]] between women that experience sickness and those that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nymetroparents.com/newarticle.cfm?colid=7114|title=Morning Sickness: Coping With The Worst|publisher=NY Metro Parents Magazine|accessdate=2008-07-06|author=Elizabeth Bauchner|author2=Wendy Marquez|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204115500/http://www.nymetroparents.com/newarticle.cfm?colid=7114|archivedate=2008-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to increased [[estrogen]] levels, a similar form of nausea is also seen in some women who use [[hormonal contraception]] or [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]].
* An increase in [[progesterone]] relaxes the [[muscle]]s in the [[uterus]], which prevents early [[childbirth]], but may also relax the [[stomach]] and [[intestine]]s, leading to excess [[stomach acid]]s and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease|gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)]].
* An increase in [[human chorionic gonadotropin]]. It is probably not the HCG itself that causes the nausea. More likely, it is the HCG stimulating the maternal ovaries to secrete estrogen, which in turn causes the nausea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1003896 | last1 = Niebyl | first1 = Jennifer R. | year = 2010| title = Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 16| pages = 1544–1550 | pmid = 20942670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense mechanism===
Morning sickness may be an [[natural selection|evolved trait]] that protects the baby against [[toxin]]s ingested by the mother. Evidence in support of this theory includes:&lt;ref name="Nesse"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nesse |first1= Randolphe M|authorlink=George C. Williams (biologist) |last2=Williams |first2=George C |title= Why We Get Sick |year=1996  |accessdate= |edition=1st |series= |volume= |date= |publisher= Vintage Books|location= New York |pages=290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pepper"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pepper GV, Craig Roberts S | title = Rates of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and dietary characteristics across populations  | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B  | volume = 273  | issue = 1601  | pages = 2675–2679  |date=October 2006  | pmid = 17002954  | pmc = 1635459  | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2006.3633}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Morning sickness is very common among pregnant women, which argues in favor of its being a functional adaptation and against the idea that it is a [[pathology]].
* Fetal vulnerability to toxins peaks at around 3 months, which is also the time of peak susceptibility to morning sickness.
* There is a good correlation between toxin concentrations in foods, and the tastes and odors that cause revulsion.

Women who have ''no'' morning sickness are more likely to [[miscarriage|miscarry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chan | first = Ronna L. | last2 = Olshan | first2 = A.

In addition to protecting the fetus, morning sickness may also protect the mother.  A pregnant woman's [[immune system]] is suppressed during pregnancy, presumably to reduce the chances of [[transplant rejection|rejecting]] tissues of her own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Haig | first = David  | author-link = David Haig (biologist)  | title = Genetic conflicts in human pregnancy  | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology  | volume = 68  | pages = 495–532  | date = October 1993  | pmid = 8115596  | issue = 4| doi=10.1086/418300| url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3153297  | format = Submitted manuscript  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, animal products containing [[parasite]]s and harmful bacteria can be especially dangerous to pregnant women. There is evidence that morning sickness is often triggered by animal products including meat and fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | first1 = Samuel M.  | last1 = Flaxman  | first2 = Paul W.  | last2 = Sherman  | authorlink =  | title = Morning sickness: a mechanism for protecting mother and embryo  | journal = Quarterly Review of Biology  | volume = 75  | pages = 113–148  | date = June 2000  | pmid = 10858967  | issue = 2| doi=10.1086/393377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If morning sickness is a defense mechanism against the ingestion of toxins, the prescribing of [[anti-nausea drugs|anti-nausea medication]] to pregnant women may have the undesired [[side effect]] of causing birth defects or miscarriages by encouraging harmful dietary choices.&lt;ref name="Nesse"/&gt;

==Treatments==
There is a lack of good evidence to support the use of any particular intervention for morning sickness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=A|last2=Haas|first2=DM|last3=O'Mathúna|first3=DP|last4=Dowswell|first4=T|title=Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 September 2015|issue=9|pages=CD007575|pmid=26348534|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007575.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===
A number of [[antiemetic]]s are effective and safe in pregnancy including: [[pyridoxine/doxylamine]], [[antihistamines]] (such as [[diphenhydramine]]), [[metoclopramide]], and [[phenothiazines]] (such as [[promethazine]]).&lt;ref name=BMJ2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarvis|first1=S|author2=Nelson-Piercy, C|title=Management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy|journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)|date=Jun 17, 2011|volume=342|pages=d3606|pmid=21685438|doi=10.1136/bmj.d3606|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/342/jun28_3/d4018|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2014"/&gt; With respect to effectiveness it is unknown if one is superior to another.&lt;ref name=BMJ2011/&gt; In the United States and Canada, the doxylamine-pyridoxine combination (as Diclegis in US and Diclectin in Canada) is the only approved [[pregnancy category]] "A" prescription treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Clark2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Clark SM, Dutta E, Hankins GD |title=The outpatient management and special considerations of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy|journal=Semin Perinatol|date=September 2014|volume=38|issue=14|pages=496–502|pmid=25267280|doi=10.1053/j.semperi.2014.08.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ondansetron]] may be beneficial, but there are some concerns regarding an association with [[cleft palate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koren|first=G|title=Motherisk update. Is ondansetron safe for use during pregnancy?|journal=Canadian Family Physician |date=October 2012 |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=1092–3 |pmid=23064917 |pmc=3470505}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is little high quality data.&lt;ref name=BMJ2011/&gt; [[Metoclopramide]] is also used and relatively well tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=PC|author2=Omar, SZ|title=Contemporary approaches to hyperemesis during pregnancy|journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=April 2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=87–93|pmid=21297474|doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e328342d208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the use of [[corticosteroid]]s is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poon|first=SL|title=Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: Best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary.

The '''American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program''' (ACS NSQIP) was started in the [[United States|American]] [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA). In the mid-1980s the VHA was criticized for their high operative mortality. To that end, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed Public Law 99-166 in December 1985 which mandated the VHA to report their outcomes in comparison to national averages and the information must be risk-adjusted to account for the severity of illness of the VHA surgical patient population. In 1991 the National VA Surgical Risk Study (NVASRS) began in 44 Veteran's Administration Medical Centers. By 31 December 1993 there was information for 500,000 non-cardiac surgical procedures. In 1994 NVASRS was expanded to all 128 HVA hospitals that performed surgery. The name was then changed to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archsurg.137.1.20 |vauthors=Khuri SF, Daley J, Henderson WG | year = 2002 | title = The Comparative Assessment and Improvement of Quality Surgical Care in the Department of Veterans Affairs | url = | journal = Archives of Surgery | volume = 137 | issue = 1| pages = 20–27 | pmid = 11772210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ACS NSQIP Data==

The ACS NSQIP collects data on 135 variables, including preoperative risk factors, intraoperative variables, and 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity outcomes for patients undergoing major surgical procedures in both the inpatient and outpatient setting.

'''Nicholas Green''' (September 9, 1987 &amp;ndash; October 1, 1994) was an Anglo-American boy who was shot and killed in an attempted car robbery while vacationing with his family in Southern [[Italy]].

==Death==
Nicholas Green, his sister, Eleanor Green, and their parents, Margaret and Reginald Green, were having a holiday in [[Calabria]], Southern Italy. On the night of September 29, 1994 his parents were driving on the [[Autostrada A3 (Italy)|A3]] motorway between [[Salerno]] and [[Reggio Calabria]].&lt;ref name="ItalyMoved" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AChildsKilling" /&gt; They stopped at an [[Autogrill]], where two men started following their car, believing they were jewellers. The men pulled up alongside the Greens' vehicle and shouted something in Italian, which the Greens did not understand. Reginald Green accelerated, at which point the men fired shots into the rear of the car. He accelerated a second time, and once again the men shot into the back of the car. After the pursuers gave up Reginald stopped the car, and at this point he and Margaret realized that Nicholas had been shot in the head.&lt;ref name="AChildsKilling"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Cowell| first = Alan| title = A Child's Killing Puts Focus on Italy's Roads| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 53 | date = October 23, 1994| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/travel/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-child-s-killing-puts-focus-italy-s-roads.html | accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They drove directly to the nearest town, but the hospital was not equipped to deal with Nicholas' injuries. The police took the family to [[Villa San Giovanni]], where they transferred to a ferry which brought them across the [[Strait of Messina]] to the port of [[Messina]]. From there, the police took them to a specialist head injuries unit at a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead the next day.&lt;ref name="GangstersShoot"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sparrow| first = Andrew| title = Gangsters Shoot British Boy In Car| newspaper = Daily Mail| location = London | page = 5 | date = October 1, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Family===
In May 1996 the Greens had twins, a girl (Laura) and a boy (Martin). Since their loss, the Greens have been strong supporters of organ donation and they have been traveling throughout the world to spread the message of donation and tell their story.

===Aftermath in Italy===
Following their decision of donating Nicholas' organs, Nicholas' parents were received by Italy's President ([[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]]). They were awarded Italy's highest honour for civilians "Medaglia d'Oro al Merito Civile". After Nicholas' death, donation rates increased dramatically in Italy, a country where organ donations had been among the lowest in Europe. According to 2017 data, organ donations in Italy have more than tripled since. Many elementary schools as well as city locations/addresses all over the country were named after Nicholas.

===Trial===
Following the shooting, Italian police arrested two men on November 2, 1994, Francesco Mesiano and Michele Iannello.&lt;ref name="ItalyDetains"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Cowell| first = Alan| title = Italy Detains 2 in Highway Killing of U.S. Boy, 7| newspaper = The New York Times| page = A5 | date = November 2, 1994| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/02/world/italy-detains-2-in-highway-killing-of-us-boy-7.html| accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were tried in [[Catanzaro]] by a court consisting of three judges, and on January 17, 1997 they were found not guilty. Reginald Green had been unable to identify them, as the shooters had both been wearing masks, and it was dark.&lt;ref name="ItalyAcquits"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Tagliabue| first = John| title = Italy Acquits 2 in Killing of U.S. Boy Whose Organs Were Donated| newspaper = The New York Times| page = A4 | date = January 17, 1997| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/17/world/italy-acquits-2-in-killing-of-us-boy-whose-organs-were-donated.html| accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConvictionsUpheld"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Callahan| first = Mary| title = Convictions Upheld In Nicholas Green Case| newspaper = The Press Democrat| location = Santa Rosa, CA, USA| page = B2| date = April 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a year later, with no new evidence, an appellate court with a jury convicted the pair. Iannello was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] and Mesiano was sentenced to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Boy-s-Italian-killers-sentenced-to-long-terms-3085467.php&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was upheld by Italy's supreme court in 1999.&lt;ref name="ConvictionsUpheld" /&gt;

===Organ Donation===
After Nicholas' death, donation rates increased dramatically in [[Italy]], a country where organ donations had been among the lowest in Europe.&lt;ref name="Gathering"/&gt; According to 2017 data, organ donations in Italy have more than tripled since. Nicholas' name continues to be associated with organ donation, and is acknowledged as the most famous organ donor in the world. The result of his parents' decision has been called "The Nicholas Effect" (l'Effetto Nicholas) and refers not only to organ donation but also to everything good that emerged from the tragedy.&lt;ref name="ItalyAcquits" /&gt;

==Memorials==
A memorial bell tower (The Children's Bell Tower) has been built in [[Bodega Bay]] in memory of Nicholas Green and all the children, using more than 140 bells sent to the Greens from individuals, families, schools, and churches all over Italy. The monument, set in Bodega Bay, where Nicholas and his family lived, has become a place of pilgrimage as well as a tourist attraction. The central bell, donated by the [[Pontificia Fonderia Marinelli|Marinelli Foundry]], that has been making bells for the Papacy for more than 1000 years, was blessed by Pope John Paul II. It has the names of the seven recipients of Nicholas' organs inscribed on it. The monument is the work of San Francisco sculptor Bruce Hasson.

Another sculpture, called "The Birds", has been donated by the Greens to the [[Calabria|Calabria Region]] and is located at the Regional Council Palace. It depicts seven birds (like Nicholas' organs that were donated and the number of the recipients) made of steel, floating in a sort of tower. This monument is also the work of Bruce Hasson. He used the steel of guns confiscated by the [[San Francisco Police Department]].

An educational video has been made out of their story, called 'The Nicholas Effect'. It is currently shown in hospitals all around the United States and is used by procurement organizations, hospitals, churches, to spread a message of solidarity and the importance of donation. It tells the story of Nicholas, how his organs saved the lives of seven very sick Italians, and how this thing changed the attitude of a whole Country towards organ donation.
Since Nicholas died, organ donation rates in Italy have more than tripled, bringing Italy from being at the bottom among European Countries in donation to one of the top of the list (currently Italy is second, after Spain, as far as organ donation rates).

Reginald Green wrote two books: the first called "The Nicholas Effect" (Il Dono di Nicholas, in Italiano) and the second called "The Gift that Heals" (Il Dono che Guarisce, in Italian), published jointly with UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing) - the non-profit organization that manages the United States's organ transplant system under contract with the federal government.
Both books have been highly acclaimed by media and specialists of organ donation all around the world . They are used in nursing schools, hospitals, churches, since the books are considered a complete and useful work on organ donation.

The Greens also established an annual scholarship for primary and middle school children in the United States that is awarded to a distinguished student in each state. The award is managed by the NAGC (the National Association for Gifted Children).

The World Transplant Game Federation dedicated to Nicholas Green the ski race for transplanted children: it is the "Nicholas Cup". It has been held in [[Nendaz|Nendaz, Switzerland]] in 2001, [[Bormio]] in Northern Italy in 2004, [[Poland]] in 2005, [[Rovaniemi|Rovaniemi, Finland]] in 2008, Anzere, [[Switzerland]] in March 2012 and [[La Chapelle-d'Abondance|La Chapelle D'Abondance France]] in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtgf.org/page.asp?section=0001000100160006&amp;sectionTitle=The+Nicholas+Cup |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124193238/http://wtgf.org/page.asp?section=0001000100160006&amp;sectionTitle=The+Nicholas+Cup |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-01-24 |title=The Nicholas Cup |publisher=World Transplant Games Federation |accessdate=2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a TV movie, ''[[Nicholas' Gift]]'', starring [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] and [[Alan Bates]], was based on the event.&lt;ref name="ABoyIsSlain"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lyman| first = Rick| title = A Boy Is Slain, and Gives Life to Others| newspaper = The New York Times| page = B15 | date = April 25, 1998| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/25/arts/television-review-a-boy-is-slain-and-gives-life-to-others.html| accessdate = 2010-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuriki was born in [[Imakane, Hokkaido|Imakane]], [[Setana District, Hokkaido]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;May 6, 2012 broadcast of ''The Nonfiction'', [[Fuji Television]]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Hokkaido Hiyama Kita High School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econakoto.net/kuriki/article/186|title=www.econakoto.net|language=ja|accessdate=September 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924211331/http://www.econakoto.net/kuriki/article/186|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sapporo International University]]'s Humanities and Sociology Department of Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.ac.jp/06shushoku/old/2141.html|title=卒業生（栗城史多）のインタビュー記事・2007年|language=ja|publisher=Sapporo International University|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mountain climbing==
Kuriki climbed the [[Himalayas]] at high altitude once or twice a year. He successfully climbed the [[Eight-thousander|8000 meter peaks]] [[Cho Oyu]] in August 2007 and [[Dhaulagiri]] in May 2009.&lt;ref name="Alan Arnette 2018"/&gt; He tried to climb [[Mount Everest]] without oxygen while live streaming over the internet, climbing the [[Tibet]] side in September 2009, and the Nepal side in September 2010, but was not able to climb above 8,000 meters. In his third time climbing the Nepal side in August to October 2011, Kuriki was not able to reach 7,900 meters. During his fourth attempt in October 2012, he gave up due to the strong wind, and lost nine of his fingers to frostbite after spending two days in a [[Snow cave|snow hole]] at temperatures below -20°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japanese climber who lost nine fingers to frostbite nears summit of Everest|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/11894059/Japanese-climber-who-lost-nine-fingers-to-frostbite-nears-summit-of-Everest.html|accessdate=10 January 2016|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2015 attempt was prevented by the [[2015 Mount Everest avalanches|avalanche]] that struck Everest Base Camp that year, and his attempts in 2016 and 2017 were cut short by weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Alan Arnette 2018"/&gt;

He gave well-attended lectures across Japan on the theme of "shared adventure" and the value of perseverance&lt;ref name="nippon.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/world/asia/nobukazu-kuriki-everest-death.html|title=Death of Japanese Climber on Everest Raises Toll This Month to 3|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 May 2018|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and attracted numerous social media followers with his online postings, including videos and photos of his climbs.&lt;ref name="Alan Arnette 2018"/&gt;

Kuriki successfully climbed the highest peaks of 6 continents (the [[Seven Summits]]) during his career, including [[Denali]], [[Mount Aconcagua]], [[Mount Elbrus]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the [[Carstensz Pyramid]], and [[Mount Vinson]].&lt;ref name="Japan Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/05/21/he-lost-his-fingers-trying-to-climb-everest-on-his-eighth-attempt-he-lost-his-life/|title=He lost his fingers trying to climb Everest.

'''Nodding disease''' or '''nodding syndrome''' is a recent, little-known disease which [[Emerging infectious disease|emerged]] in [[Sudan]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lacey M |title=Nodding disease: mystery of southern Sudan |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=2|issue=12 |pages=714 |year=2003 |pmid=14649236 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mentally and physically disabling disease that only affects children, typically between the ages of 5 and 15. It is currently restricted to  small regions in [[South Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], and northern [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="irinnews"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=85646 UGANDA: Nodding disease or "river epilepsy"?] IRIN Africa. Accessed 19 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2011/06/05/africa.dowell.nodding.disease.cnn?hpt=hp_mid|title=Nodding disease in East Africa|accessdate=6 June 2011 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the South Sudan outbreaks and subsequent limited spread, the disease was first described in 1962 existing in secluded mountainous regions of [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt; although the connection between that disease and nodding syndrome was only made recently.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

== Symptoms ==
Children affected by nodding disease experience a complete and permanent stunting of growth. The growth of the brain is also stunted, leading to mental handicap. The disease is named for the characteristic, pathological [[nod (gesture)|nodding]] [[seizure]], which often begins when the children begin to eat, or sometimes when they feel cold.&lt;ref name=Harding&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3133440.stm 'Nodding disease' hits Sudan] Andrew Harding BBC News 23 September 2003, Accessed 19 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These seizures are brief and halt after the children stop eating or when they feel warm again. Seizures in nodding disease span a wide range of severity. [[Neurotoxicologist]] Peter Spencer, who has investigated the disease, has stated that upon presentation with food, "one or two [children] will start nodding very rapidly in a continuous, pendulous nod. A nearby child may suddenly go into a [[tonic–clonic seizure]], while others will freeze."&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt; Severe seizures can cause the child to collapse, leading to further injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/28/health/main596493.shtml Bizarre Illness Terrifies Sudanese - 'Nodding Disease' Victims Suffer Seizures, Retardation, Death] Emma Ross, CBS News, Jan. 28, 2004. Accessed 19 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-clinical seizures have been identified in [[electroencephalogram]]s, and [[MRI]] scans have shown brain atrophy and damage to the [[hippocampus]] and [[glia]] cells.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110713/full/475148a.html|title=African outbreak stumps experts|last=Wadman|first=Meredith|date=13 July 2011|work=Nature|accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found that no seizures occur when victims are given an unfamiliar or non-traditional food, such as chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO document describing disease with unusual observation re: unfamiliar food|url=http://www.who.int/hac/crises/sdn/sitreps/10june2011/en/|work=World Health Organisation|publisher=WHO|accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
It is currently not known what causes the disease, but it is believed to be connected to infestations of the parasitic worm ''[[Onchocerca volvulus]]'', which is prevalent in all outbreak areas,&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt; and a possible explanation involves the formation of antibodies against parasite antigen that are cross-reactive to leiomodin-1 in the hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Tory P.|last2=Tyagi|first2=Richa|last3=Lee|first3=Paul R.|last4=Lee|first4=Myoung-Hwa|last5=Johnson|first5=Kory R.|last6=Kowalak|first6=Jeffrey|last7=Elkahloun|first7=Abdel|last8=Medynets|first8=Marie|last9=Hategan|first9=Alina|date=2017-02-15|title=Nodding syndrome may be an autoimmune reaction to the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/377/eaaf6953|journal=Science Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=9|issue=377|pages=eaaf6953|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf6953|issn=1946-6234}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''O. volvulus'', a [[nematode]], is carried by the [[black fly]] and causes [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]]. In 2004, most children suffering from nodding disease lived close to the Yei River, a hotbed for river blindness, and 93.7% of nodding disease sufferers were found to harbour the parasite — a far higher percentage than in children without the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060519084631/http://www.yaleph.com/archive/vol1no1/reg_focus.html When Nodding Means Dying: A baffling new epidemic is sweeping Sudan.] Lekshmi Santhosh ''The Yale Journal of Public Health'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2004. Accessed 25 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A link between river blindness and normal cases of [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Druet-Cabanac M, Boussinesq M, Dongmo L, Farnarier G, Bouteille B, Preux PM |title=Review of epidemiological studies searching for a relationship between onchocerciasis and epilepsy |journal=Neuroepidemiology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=144–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15084784 |doi=10.1159/000075958}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as retarded growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ovuga E, Kipp W, Mungherera M, Kasoro S |title=Epilepsy and retarded growth in a hyperendemic focus of onchocerciasis in rural western Uganda |journal=East African medical journal |volume=69 |issue=10 |pages=554–6 |year=1992 |pmid=1473507}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been proposed previously, although the evidence for this link is inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marin B, Boussinesq M, Druet-Cabanac M, Kamgno J, Bouteille B, Preux PM |title=Onchocerciasis-related epilepsy?

The CDC is investigating a possible connection with wartime [[chemical warfare|chemical]] exposure. The team is also investigating whether a deficiency in [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[pyridoxine]]) could be a cause, noting the seizures of [[pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy]] and this common deficiency in disease sufferers.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt; Older theories include a 2002 toxicology report that postulated a connection with tainted [[Game meat|monkey meat]], as well as the eating of agricultural seeds provided by relief agencies that were covered in toxic chemicals.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt;

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Diagnosis is not very advanced and is based on the telltale nodding seizures of the victims. When stunted growth and mental disability are also present, probability of nodding syndrome is high. In the future, neurological scans may also be used in diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/noddingsyndrome/|title=CDC - Global Health - Nodding Syndrome|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no known cure for the disease, treatment has been directed at symptoms, and has included the use of anticonvulsants such as [[sodium valproate]]&lt;ref name="NS"/&gt; and [[phenobarbitol]]. Anti-[[malaria]] drugs have also been administered, to unknown effect.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt;Most of the non communicable diseases are about lack of nutrients in the body, to this being that the nodding syndrome is non communicable without a clear cause, Moringa with 93 of the nutrients needed by the human body and selenim, are some foods that can help on boosting the immune system for adjunctive therapy (benefits of Moringa and benefits of selenium). These two can help in malnutrition, stroke, appetite some of the symptoms we see in nodding syndrome victims.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-benefits-of-moringa-oleifera&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;https://draxe.com/selenium-benefits/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Prognosis ==
Nodding syndrome is debilitating both physically and mentally. In 2004, Peter Spencer stated: "It is, by all reports, a progressive disorder and a fatal disorder, perhaps with a duration of about three years or more."&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt; While a few children are said to have recovered from it, many have died from the illness.&lt;ref name=Harding/&gt; Seizures can also cause children to collapse, potentially causing injury or death.

== Prevalence and epidemiology==

While the majority of occurrences of the disease known as "nodding syndrome" have been relatively recent, it appears that the condition was first documented in 1962 in southern Tanzania.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt; More recently, nodding syndrome had become most prevalent in [[South Sudan]], where in 2003 approximately 300 cases were found in Mundri alone. By 2009, it had spread across the border to Uganda's [[Kitgum]] district,&lt;ref name="irinnews" /&gt; and the Ugandan ministry of health declared that more than 2000 children had the disease.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt; As of the end of 2011, outbreaks were concentrated in Kitgum, [[Pader District|Pader]] and [[Gulu]]. More than 1000 cases were diagnosed in the last half of that year.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21316-mysterious-nodding-syndrome-spreading-through-uganda.html|title=Mysterious nodding syndrome spreading through Uganda|last=Abraham|first=Curtis|date=23 December 2011|work=New Scientist|accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were further outbreaks in early 2012, in South Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/14/1074241/-East-African-Mystery-Disease-Nodding-Syndrome |title=East African Mystery Disease: Nodding Syndrome |date=March 14, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012|publisher=[[Daily Kos]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread and manifestation of outbreaks may further be exacerbated due to the poor availability of health care in the region.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/03/health/main597751.shtml |title=Sudan A Hotbed Of Exotic Diseases |last=Ross |first=Emma |date=3 February 2004 |work=CBS News |accessdate=25 December 2011 |location=Rumbek, Sudan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218105940/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/02/03/health/main597751.shtml |archivedate=February 18, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Repeat

==Benefits==

The pelvic floor is a “broad sling of muscles, ligaments and sheet-like tissues that stretch from your pubic bone at the front of your body, to the base of your spine at the back”.&lt;ref name="BabyC417"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a536339/your-pelvic-floor-in-pregnancy||publisher=BabyCentre |title=Your Pelvic Floor in Pregnancy|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pelvic floor is resistant to stretch and weight as it bounces back. However, after carrying weight for long periods of time, it can become stretched.&lt;ref name="BabyC417"/&gt; Additionally, weight on the pelvic floor can weaken its resistance and contribute to its loss of shape over time.&lt;ref name="BabyC417"/&gt;

Performing this exercise routinely can strengthen glutes, abs, and lower back muscles. As a result, doctors may recommend pelvic lifts to reduce lower back pain, improve posture, and improve bladder control.&lt;ref name="DrLisa417"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.doctor-recommended-stress-relief.com/Pelvic-Tilts.html |title= Pelvic Tilts for Low Back Strength and Flexibility

'''Pinhole glasses''', also known as '''stenopeic glasses''', are [[glasses|eyeglasses]] with a series of pinhole-sized perforations filling an opaque sheet of plastic in place of each lens. Similar to the workings of a [[pinhole camera]], each perforation allows only a very narrow beam of light to enter the eye which reduces the size of the [[circle of confusion]] on the retina and increases [[depth of field]]. In eyes with [[refraction error|refractive error]], the result is often a sharper image. However, a second effect may appear at the common bridge between each two adjacent holes, whereby two different rays of light coming from the same object (but each passing through a different hole) are [[diffraction|diffracted]] back toward the eye and onto different places on the retina. This leads to double vision (objects having doubled edges) around the rim of each hole the eye is not focussing on, which can make the overall image disturbing and tiring to look at for prolonged periods of time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Unlike conventional prescription glasses, pinhole glasses produce an image without the [[image distortion|pincushion effect]] around the edges (which makes straight lines appear curved). While pinhole glasses are claimed to be useful for people who are both near- and far-sighted, they are not recommended for people with over 6 [[diopters]] of [[myopia]]. Additionally, pinhole glasses reduce brightness and [[peripheral vision]],&lt;ref&gt;Wittenberg S, Pinhole eyewear systems: a special report. J Am Optom Assoc. 1993 Feb;64(2):112-6 {{PMID|8436795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/eyequack.html |author1=Russell S. Worrall OD |author2=Jacob Nevyas |author3=Stephen Barrett MD | title=Eye-Related Quackery | date=September 12, 2007 | accessdate=2008-03-27 | publisher=Quackwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus should not be used for driving or when operating machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-truth-about-pinhole-glasses-1253113.html | author = Cherrill Hicks | date = July 29, 1997

Merchants state that after prolonged use, the plastic grating should become easy to ignore. However, each time the user blinks, the horizontal lines of the grating will briefly appear to be thicker. This is because the eyelid moving over the pupil will reduce the amount of light falling onto the retina and thus will briefly remove the [[Lateral inhibition#Sensory inhibition|lateral inhibition]] effect which normally makes all the holes appear bigger (and the grating appear thinner). So, as long as the user keeps blinking, they will be constantly reminded of the dark grating covering their eyes.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Pinhole glasses have been marketed by various companies on the claim that—combined with certain [[eye exercises]]—they could permanently improve eyesight. However, no scientific evidence has been found to support these claims.  Due to a lack of formal clinical studies to substantiate this type of claim by companies selling pinhole glasses, this type of claim is no longer allowed to be made in the United States under the terms of a legal settlement with the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casewatch.org/ftc/news/1993/natural-vision.shtml Casewatch]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pinhole occluder]], a device used by ophthalmologists and optometrists for diagnosis of refractive errors, works on the same principles, but is not intended for use outside of diagnosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4088">A '''prospective payment system''' ('''PPS''') is a term used to refer to several payment methodologies for which means of determining insurance reimbursement is based on a predetermined payment regardless of the intensity of the actual service provided.

It includes a system for paying hospitals based on predetermined prices, from [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Payments are typically based on codes provided on the insurance claim such as these:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Prospective Payment Systems|url=https://www.cms.gov/prospmedicarefeesvcpmtgen/|publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Diagnosis-related group]]s for hospital inpatient claims
* [[Ambulatory Payment Classification]] for hospital outpatient claims
* [[Current Procedural Terminology]] for other outpatient claims

The PPS was established by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS), as a result of the [[Social Security Amendments Act of 1983]], specifically to address expensive hospital care. Regardless of services provided, payment was of an established fee. The idea was to encourage hospitals to lower their prices for expensive hospital care. 

In 2000, CMS changed the reimbursement system for outpatient care at [[Federally Qualified Health Centers]] (FQHCs) to include a prospective payment system for [[Medicaid]] and Medicare.&lt;ref name="NACHC Medicaid Medicare Issue Brief #69"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chris Koppen|title=Understanding the Medicaid Prospective Payment System for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)|url=http://www.nachc.com/client//IB69%20PPS%20Complete.pdf|accessdate=24 December 2014|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this system, health centers receive a fixed, per-visit payment for any visit by a patient with Medicaid, regardless of the length or intensity of the visit. The per-visit rate for the Medicaid PPS is specific to the individual health center location. The rate is determined and updated by a financial accounting process conducted by State Medicaid agencies. The FQHC PPS rate for Medicare (previously called the All Inclusive Reimbursement Rate), in contrast, is fixed at the same level across different health centers. &lt;ref name="NACHC PPS explanation"&gt;{{cite web|author1=National Association of Community Health Centers|title=Medicaid Prospective Payment System|url=http://www.nachc.com/medicaid-prospective-payment-system.cfm|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name="FQHC overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federally Qualified Health Centers: An Overview|website=Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation|url=http://www.chrt.org/public-policy/policy-papers/federally-qualified-health-centers-an-overview/|accessdate=24 December 2014|date=23 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022065807/http://www.chrt.org/public-policy/policy-papers/federally-qualified-health-centers-an-overview/ |archive-date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from FQHCs, other entities that provide outpatient services to Medicaid patients, that are also paid by a PPS methodology include:
*FQHC look-alikes ([[Community health centers in the United States|health centers]] not receiving a federal grant under section 330 of the [[Public Health Service Act]], but that otherwise meet the criteria for FQHC status.)

'''''Quiet Power: The Secret Strengths of Introverts''''' is a 2016 non-fiction book written by [[Susan Cain]] with Gregory Mone and Erica Moroz, and illustrated by Grant Snider.

''Quiet Power'' is an adaptation for children and teens, and for their educators and parents, of Cain's 2012 adult-audience book ''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking]].''

==Background==
Susan Cain's 2012 book ''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking]]'' reached [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' best seller list]] and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's cover, and was the subject of one of the most-watched [[TED (conference)|TED Talks]].&lt;ref name=NPR20160218/&gt; In 2015 Cain co-founded [[Quiet Revolution (company)|Quiet Revolution]], a company that produces content, including online training courses for parents, about and for [[Extraversion and introversion|introverts]].&lt;ref name=NPR20160218/&gt; ''Quiet Power'' constitutes Cain's focus on introverted children and teens, especially in the context of schools,&lt;ref name=NewCaledonian20160321/&gt; so that the next generation of introverts doesn't grow up feeling there is something wrong with them&lt;ref name=NPR20160218/&gt; or repress their personality trait.&lt;ref name=ElPaisUy20160113/&gt;

Cain's co-authors Erica Moroz and Gregory Mone are, respectively, a journalist and a writer of children's books; illustrator Grant Snider was discovered through his comics that were inspired by Cain's 2012 ''Quiet.''&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly20160503/&gt;

==Content==
''Quiet Power'' discusses the distinction between [[Extraversion and introversion|introversion]] and [[shyness]]; deeper student engagement versus conventional expectations of class participation; speaking in front of groups; individual versus group work; introvert-friendly methods of structuring group work; and use of social media in education.&lt;ref name=NPR20160218/&gt; The book focuses on shyness in addition to introversion, saying that shyness involves fear of social judgment.&lt;ref name=WashPost20160525/&gt; Cain says that while shyness may be something to overcome, introversion can be something to celebrate, adding that introspection tends to come with "superpowers" such as listening ability, empathy, deeper study, and longer focus.&lt;ref name=Guardian20160604/&gt; The book includes chapters on school, socializing, hobbies, and home,&lt;ref name=Guardian20160604/&gt; and incorporates firsthand accounts of introverted teens and of famous figures who have succeeded outside of their initial comfort zones.&lt;ref name=SLJ20160505/&gt;

Cain included new research in ''Quiet Power'' that was not present in the adult-audience ''Quiet,'' and recast it especially for 10- to 14-year-olds who would be less able than high schoolers to translate the workplace-oriented ''Quiet'' into their own world.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly20160503/&gt;  The book also includes appendices for teachers and parents.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly20160503/&gt;&lt;ref name=SLJ20160505/&gt;

Saying that adolescence is the hardest period in an introvert's life, Cain suggests that young introverts talk with others about their desired socializing style (to avoid misunderstandings), find activities about which they can be passionate (to motivate stepping outside their comfort zones), focus on their strengths (to remain true to themselves), and be open to extroverted people (as having complementary abilities).&lt;ref name=20160429ChicagoTrib/&gt;

Cain critiques schools' clustered desks, infatuation with group projects, and rewards for students who are quickest to speak.&lt;ref name=AtlantaJnlConst20160505/&gt; Cain instead favors recognition of deep focus and talent for listening with empathy and patience, noting that in the business world people don't read books together or write memos together.&lt;ref name=AtlantaJnlConst20160505/&gt; The [[Quiet Revolution (company)]] created a Quiet Schools Network to partner with educators to design techniques to develop the talents of introverted students, such as by beginning public speaking programs with lower-anxiety assignments and incrementally increasing challenges as the student progresses.&lt;ref name=WashPost20160525/&gt;

Cain encourages parents, first, to understand that introverts' nerve biologies react more strongly to stimulation, and that the reactions can be draining through no preference of their own.&lt;ref name=WashPost20160525/&gt; Also, Cain urges parents to help their children be "intelligent consumers" of social media with its constant personal evaluation, despite its enabling introverts to communicate "without being at the party."&lt;ref name=WashPost20160525/&gt;

==Reception==
''Quiet Power'' started at #4 on ''The New York Times'' bestseller list (children's middle grade hardcover category).&lt;ref name=NYTimes20160522/&gt;

The '''RBM Partnership To End Malaria''' (formerly '''Roll Back Malaria Partnership''') is the largest global platform for coordinated action towards a world free from malaria.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The partnership includes organizations from malaria endemic countries, bilateral and multilateral development partners, organizations from the private sector, nongovernmental and community-based organizations, foundations, research and academic institutions.

Since its inception in 1998, the RBM Partnership has played a role in global efforts that reduced malaria deaths by over 60% and saved 7 million lives.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The RBM Partnership Host is the [[United Nations Office for Project Services|United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)]], an operational arm of the United Nations, supporting the implementation of its partners' peacebuilding, humanitarian, and development projects around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5311">[[File:Dr Raúl G. Cuero.jpg|thumb|Raúl Cuero during an interview in Bogotá, May 1st. 2013]]

'''Raúl Gonzalo Cuero Rengifo''' (born in [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], [[Colombia]]) is an [[Colombians| Colombian]] professor of microbiology.  From 1988 through 2012 he was a professor at [[Prairie View A&amp;M University]] researching biological resistance to [[ultraviolet]] light.&lt;ref name=Quest/&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raulcuerobiotech.com/about/professional_experiences.html |title=Professional Experiences |last=Cuero |first=Raúl |work=RaulCueroBiotech.com |accessdate=14 December 2013}} {{Dead link|date=November 2018}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  The work was supported in part by [[NASA]] and led to at least one publication and patent.  During this period, Colombian media portrayed Cuero as "one of the greatest scientists in the world"&lt;ref name=ElPais/&gt; who was internationally acknowledged as one of the greatest Colombian inventors,&lt;ref name=ElColombiano2/&gt; stated he had over 100 publications in scientific journals,&lt;ref name=ElColombiano/&gt; and claimed he had won a significant award from NASA.&lt;ref name=ElUniversal/&gt; Since 2012, he has been the research director of International Park of Creativity, an organization of which he is the founder.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

In 2013, an ''[[El Espectador]]'' investigation alleged Cuero's [[curriculum vitae]] mixed in trivial publications with his peer-reviewed work, listed publications that did not appear to exist, misstated his invention record and employment at [[NASA]] and possibly fabricated several awards and honors.&lt;ref name=Elespectador01/&gt;  This contradicted Cuero's reputation as a leading researcher.&lt;ref name=Elspectador03/&gt; In a follow-up interview with the paper, Cuero clarified he had contracted with NASA, could not recall the origin of the award in question, stated that 11 of the 13 patents claimed on his CV were still going through the approval process, and confirmed he had five [[peer review]]ed articles published in the past 14 years.&lt;ref name=Elspectador02/&gt;

The '''Royal College of Physicians of Ireland''' (RCPI), ({{lang-ga|Coláiste Ríoga Lianna na hÉireann}}) is an Irish professional body dedicated to improving the practice of [[general medicine]] and related [[medical specialty|medical specialties]], chiefly through the accreditation of [[physicians]] by examination.

==History==
The "Royal" in the title comes from the Royal Charters that were granted in 1667, by King [[Charles II of England]], and in 1692, by King [[William III of England|William III]] and Queen [[Mary II of England]]. It was known as the '''King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland''' until 1890 when, under charter of Queen Victoria, it adopted the present title.

The College was founded in 1654 by [[John Stearne (physician)|John Stearne]], a professor and registrar of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], for the purpose of regulating the practice of medicine in Ireland. Originally, it was called "The Fraternity of Physicians of Trinity Hall", as its first home was in a building called [[Trinity Hall (Dublin)|Trinity Hall]], given to the Physicians by Trinity College.

The Royal Charter of 1692 made the Physicians independent of Trinity College but meant that they had to leave Trinity Hall. They then had no permanent home until the opening of [[Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital]] in 1812, when the College established its headquarters in some rooms in the hospital.[[File:Heritage Center, The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.JPG|thumb|Heritage Center, The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland]][[File:Dun's Library at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.JPG|thumb|Dun's Library at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland]]

In 1860, the College purchased the premises of the Kildare Street Club in Kildare Street. The building was destroyed in a fire in November 1860 and subsequently rebuilt by the College to its own design. It opened in 1864 and has remained the College's home ever since.

The College Library dates its foundation to 1713 when Sir Patrick Dun bequeathed his personal, large library to the College. The Library has been known as "Dun's Library" ever since. The Dun's Library forms part of the College's Heritage Centre, with the archive, heritage items and genealogical research collections. The Heritage Centre holds one of the most important and extensive collections of printed, manuscript material and items relating to the history of medicine and medical education in Ireland.&lt;ref name=exa4&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcpi.ie/HeritageCentre/Pages/HeritageCentre.aspx |title=Royal College of Physicians of Ireland |author=RCPI |publisher=RCPI |work=Heritage Centre Website |accessdate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629220017/http://www.rcpi.ie/HeritageCentre/Pages/HeritageCentre.aspx |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidents==
Among the famous past presidents of the College were [[William Fetherstone Montgomery]], [[Sir Patrick Dun]] (1681–93), [[Sir Henry Marsh, 1st Baronet|Henry Marsh]] (1841), [[Robert James Graves]] (1843), [[William Stokes (physician)|William Stokes]] (1849), and Sir [[Dominic Corrigan]] (1859–1863). [[James Little (physician)|James Little]] (1837–1916), who was president from 1886 to 1888, had worked as a ship's surgeon early in his career. He survived the shipwreck of the SS ''[[SS Ava (1855)|Ava]]'' in 1858, which is recorded in his diary, now held in the college's archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wheelock|first=Harriet|title=The Diary of Dr James Little – Medicine, Shipwreck and the Indian Mutiny |url=http://rcpilibrary.blogspot.com/2011/04/diary-of-dr-james-little-medicine.html|publisher=RCPI|accessdate=19 May 2011|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In November 1974 Irish president Erskine Hamilton Childers made a speech to psychiatrists at the Royal College of Physicians  about alternative treatments for mentally ill people. And means to be made available for people who were suffering from depression and anxiety and other such disorders Before he himself suddenly collapsed dead of heart failure in the very conference  room of the building    [[File:Organizing a Fellowship ceremony at No. 6 Kildare Street.jpg|thumb|Organizing a Fellowship ceremony at No.6 Kildare Steet]]

==Membership and qualifications==
The College offers the postgraduate [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland]] (MRCPI) qualification.  There is a separate and distinct [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]] (MRCPUK) qualification which is run by the UK Royal Colleges of Physicians in Glasgow, Edinburgh and London.

For several years, the College has been successfully conducting its MRCPI examinations in its overseas centres (Malaysia, Oman, India, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain) in addition to many centres in the Republic of Ireland.
[[File:Membership Diploma of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.JPG|thumb|Membership Diploma of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland]]
Membership is governed by the by-laws of the college.  Every candidate wishing to obtain Membership of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland must pass both parts of the Membership Examination (unless exemption has been granted) and attend a Membership Conferring Ceremony where he/she is conferred as a Member of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. Membership confers the right to use the post nominal MRCPI.
 [[File:Fellowship Diploma of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, FRCPI.JPG|thumb|left|Fellowship Diploma of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, FRCPI]]
Fellowship is awarded by the College upon nomination by 2 existing Fellows (who should be in a good standing with the College) to doctors of consultant or equivalent status. In 1915 the College updated the regulations to allow women to become Fellows. The first woman to become a fellow was [[Mary Hearn]] in 1924. The benefits of this award include recognition of professional standing, access to Continuing Medical Education and Continuing Professional Development support, international collegiality and the opportunity to influence the future of the profession. Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (FRCPI) is an international benchmark of professional excellence, reserved for doctors who have made substantial contributions to their specialty and whose published works and attainments meet the high expectations of the College.

'''Tawa Reservoir''' is a [[reservoir]] on the [[Tawa River]] in central India. It is located in [[Hoshangabad District]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] state, above Baitul district. The reservoir was formed by the construction of the '''Tawa Dam''', which began in 1958 and was completed in 1978. The dam provides for [[irrigation]] to several thousand hectares of farming land in Hoshangabad and [[Harda]] districts. It is also a big tourist attraction during the [[monsoon]] months. A cruise boat service has been started by the tourism department for visitors to the dam and reservoir. The dam was made by late Shri Vinay Kumar Diwan also known as Denva Ke Gandhi for his work for public welfare being public representative in the region for almost two decades serving as MLA.

The dam has brought prosperity to the Hoshangabad district.

Tawa Reservoir forms the western boundary of [[Satpura National Park]] and [[Bori Wildlife Sanctuary]].

==Power plant details==
It is a small hydropower plant which was set up on the left bank to utilize the tailrace water for irrigation purpose.

It is a private sector hydro-electric generation power plant. The two units of 2 × 6.75 MW were set up by LNJ Bhilwara group. Generated power supplied to HEG Plant Mandideep via MPPTCL Power Line.

The power production in this plant was started in 1998.

The construction of project was completed in record time of 22 months and at a cost of about 65 crore. Early and efficient completion made possible by RSWI, Canada.

 }}
'''Thyroiditis''' is the inflammation of the [[thyroid gland]]. The thyroid gland is located on the front of the neck below the [[laryngeal prominence]], and makes hormones that control metabolism.

==Classification==
Thyroiditis is a group of disorders that all cause thyroidal inflammation. Forms of the disease are [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the US, [[postpartum thyroiditis]], [[subacute thyroiditis]], [[silent thyroiditis]], drug-induced thyroiditis, [[radiation-induced thyroiditis]], [[acute thyroiditis]], and [[Riedel's thyroiditis]].{{r|thyroid}}

Each different type of this disease has its own causes, clinical features, diagnoses, durations, resolutions, conditions and risks.

==Signs and symptoms ==

There are many different signs and symptoms for thyroiditis, none of which are exclusively limited to this disease. Many of the signs imitate symptoms of other diseases, so thyroiditis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose. Common [[hypothyroidism|hypothyroid]] symptoms manifest when thyroid cell damage is slow and chronic, and may include fatigue, weight gain, feeling "fuzzy headed", depression, dry skin, and constipation. Other, rarer symptoms include swelling of the legs, vague aches and pains, decreased concentration and so on. When conditions become more severe, depending on the type of thyroiditis, one may start to see puffiness around the eyes, slowing of the heart rate, a drop in body temperature, or even incipient heart failure. On the other hand, if the thyroid cell damage is acute, the thyroid hormone within the gland leaks out into the bloodstream causing symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, which is similar to those of [[hyperthyroidism]]. These symptoms include weight loss, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, fast heart rate, and fatigue. Elevated levels of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream cause both conditions, but thyrotoxicosis is the term used with thyroiditis since the thyroid gland is not overactive, as in the case of hyperthyroidism.{{r|thyroid}}&lt;ref name="AmerAcad"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://familydoctor.org/condition/thyroiditis/|title = Thyroiditis |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website = Familydoctor.org |publisher= American Academy of Family Physicians|access-date=October 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Thyroiditis is generally caused by an immune system attack on the thyroid, resulting in inflammation and damage to the thyroid cells. This disease is often considered a malfunction of the immune system, and can be associated with IgG4-related systemic disease, in which symptoms of autoimmune pancreatitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis and noninfectious aortitis also occur. Such is also the case in Riedel thyroiditis, an inflammation in which the thyroid tissue is replaced by fibrous tissue which can extend to neighbouring structures. Antibodies that attack the thyroid are what causes most types of thyroiditis. It can also be caused by an infection, like a [[viral disease|virus]] or [[bacterial disease|bacteria]], which works in the same way as antibodies to cause inflammation in the glands, such as in the case of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thyroidmanager.org/chapter/hashimotos-thyroiditis/ |title= Hashimoto's Thryoiditis|vauthors = De Groot LJ, Nobuyuki A, Takashi A |date= |website=TDM |publisher=Thyroid Disease Manager |access-date=March 3, 2008 |registration = y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain people make [[thyroid antibody|thyroid antibodies]], and thyroiditis can be considered an [[autoimmune disease]], because the body acts as if the thyroid gland is foreign tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.medicinenet.com/hashimotos_thyroiditis/article.htm|title=Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Symptoms, Diet, and Treatments |last=Ferry |first=Robert |date=September 8, 2007 |website=MedicineNet |publisher= |access-date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some drugs, such as [[interferon]], lithium and [[amiodarone]], can also cause thyroiditis because they have a tendency to damage thyroid cells.

==Diagnosis/investigation==
The most common and helpful way to diagnose thyroiditis is first for a physician to [[palpate]] the thyroid gland during a physical examination. Laboratory tests allow doctors to evaluate the patient for elevated [[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]]s, elevated [[thyroglobulin]] levels, and depressed [[radioactive iodine uptake]] (Mather, 2007). Blood tests also help to determine the kind of thyroiditis and to see how much [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] the pituitary gland is producing and what antibodies are present in the body. In some cases a [[biopsy]] may be needed to find out what is attacking the thyroid.

==Treatment==
Treatments for this disease depend on the type of thyroiditis that is diagnosed. For the most common type, which is known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the treatment is to immediately start hormone replacement. This prevents or corrects the hypothyroidism, and it also generally keeps the gland from getting bigger. However, Hashimoto's thyroiditis can initially present with excessive thyroid hormone being released from the thyroid gland (hyperthyroid). In this case the patient may only need bed rest and [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications]]; however, some need steroids to reduce inflammation and to control palpitations. Also, doctors may prescribe [[beta blockers]] to lower the heart rate and reduce tremors, until the initial hyperthyroid period has resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=Douglas|title=Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism|website=UpToDate|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

Most types of thyroiditis are three to five times more likely to be found in women than in men. The average age of onset is between thirty and fifty years of age. This disease tends to be geographical and seasonal, and is most common in summer and fall.&lt;ref name="AmerAcad"/&gt;

==Hashimoto's thyroiditis==
[[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] was first described by Japanese physician Hashimoto Hakaru working in Germany in 1912. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and patients with this disease often complain about difficulty swallowing. This condition may be so mild at first that the disease goes unnoticed for years. The first symptom that shows signs of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a goiter on the front of the neck. Depending on the severity of the disease and how much it has progressed, doctors then decide what steps are taken for treatment.

Beginning early in the 20th century, [[Monterrey]], Mexico began a successful economic metamorphosis and growth pattern that remains an exception in [[Mexico]]. This all began with increased investments in irrigation that fueled a boom in agriculture and ranching for this northern Mexican city. The economic growth has fueled income disparity for the 3.86 million residents who live in the '''Monterrey Metro area (MMA)'''. In addition, the rapid urbanization has taken a large toll on the water resources. In addressing many of this challenges, the city of Monterrey has become a model for sound and effective [[Integrated urban water management]].

The challenges that Monterrey has confronted pertain to scarcity of surface water resources, poor water quality due to untreated industrial [[effluents]], political cycles and term-limits which can limit long-term vision, and water disputes between urban and agricultural users. Monterrey has good groundwater "well-fields" that supply about 40% of the water demand for the city and generally are not over-exploited because of good connections to high-yield [[aquifer]] systems in the central parts of the '''"Curvatura de Monterrey"'''. These wells are managed as storage reserves that can be used in time of drought, which is quite common in this region of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Wellfield"/&gt;

Also unique to Monterrey is an arrangement made between farmers and the municipality, whereby the farmers grant the use of their water rights from the nearby '''Cuchillo reservoir''' and the municipal water utility SADM ''(Servicios de Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey)'' returns urban used and treated water to farmers for [[irrigation]].&lt;ref name="C. Scott"/&gt;  This arrangement has benefited both parties since SADM supplements its water supply with high quality but internmitent supply from the Cuchillo reservoir and farmers receive a consistent and full of nutrients water for irrigation. The longer term outlook for the area is for urbanization to continue and water availability to decrease, therefore, new water management strategies will have to be created.

==Economic and social==
During the first half of the 1900s, high investments in irrigation infrastructure had spurred agricultural development.&lt;ref name="C. Scott"&gt;{{cite journal

Referred to as the "Mexican Miracle" from the 1940s through the 1970s, rapid economic and population growth transformed Monterrey into the second most important industrial city and second largest city in the country with a metropolitan population of 3.8 million. Monterrey's rapid [[urbanization]] was driven in part by the development of assembly plants (‘‘[[maquiladoras]]’’) and expanded significantly with the 1994 signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). More specifically, the electronics industry became the largest industry in Monterrey and employs large volumes of industrial solvents in its productive process. These harmful chemicals are the most serious concern to surface and ground water in the Monterrey metro area §k§l§6Hola=D.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite web

A water shortage in the late 1970s forced rationing on 750,000 people, most of whom were poor and already experienced low access to water. Forced water rationing spawned water protests that escalated to larger organized mass rallies, blockades, seizure of water service trucks, taking over of government buildings, and the holding hostage of water delivery drivers. Most of these actions were led by poor women and resulted in presidential action with the creation of the "Water for Everyone" (Agua para Todos) program that ushered in a new era of government spending that promised to bring water to every resident by 1985.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite journal

==Geography and climate==
Monterrey is the capital city of the state of [[Nuevo León]], and is situated approximately in the center of the state located in NE-Mexico and close to the [[Texas]] border. Monterrey has an elevation of {{convert|1740|ft|m}} above sea level and is located in a wide basin about {{convert|40|mi|km}} across, surrounded to the north, west, and south by mountains.&lt;ref name="About Monterrey"/&gt; It has a semi-arid climate with a mean temperature of 75o F (24o C).  However, most of the year temperatures are either warmer than 82o F (28o C), or cooler than 57o F (14o C).&lt;ref name="Wellfield"&gt;{{cite web

==Water availability==
In 1995 the population of the San Juan watershed was 5m inhabitants, of which approximately 4m 
were in Metro Monterrey (MAM) and the population is expected to increase to 8.4m inhabitants by 2020. The population of MAM is located within 360&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; across nine municipalities (Apodaca, Garcia, Escobedo, Guadalupe, Juarez, Monterrey, San Nicolas, Santa Catarina and San Pedro). Taking discharge and aquifer recharge, current population and average hydrology into account, the watershed possesses a water availability of 484 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per inhabitant per year and would be reduced to 230 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per inhabitant per year by the year 2020. The watershed therefore ranks amongst the poorest regions in regards to per capita water availability with countries such as Syria, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. Per capita water use estimates, including domestic, commercial, municipal, and industrial supplies, approach 290 liters per day per inhabitant for MAM.&lt;ref name="San Juan"/&gt; More specifically, the MAM receives 60% of their water supply from surface water while the remaining 40% comes from an extensive network of groundwater wells.&lt;ref name="SADM"/&gt;

'''Surface water''':
The [[San Juan River (Tamaulipas)|San Juan River]] with a surface area of 20,212&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, accounts for 31.5% of the entire surface area of the State of Nuevo León and is the largest and most important river in supplying water to Monterrey.&lt;ref name="C. Scott"/&gt;

''' Storage Reservoirs''': 
El Cuchillo dam (1,123,000,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; active capacity) was constructed 75&amp;nbsp;km upstream of the Gómez dam and began operations in 1993 primarily to supply water to Monterrey. The Marte R. Gómez (MRG) dam,  constructed in 1936 just upstream of the San Juan's conﬂuence with the [[Río Bravo]], serves as the '''Bajo Río San Juan (BRSJ)''' irrigation district's principal reservoir with 829,900,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; active storage capacity.&lt;ref name="C. Scott"/&gt; The José López Portillo ‘Cerro Prieto’, reservoir (ordinary storage capacity 393&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was built in the early 1980s in the adjacent Rio San Fernando watershed to supply the domestic and industrial water 
demands of Monterrey Metro Area (MAM), and was the first case of inter-basin transfer of freshwater to 
cope with shortages in Mexico’s northeast.&lt;ref name="San Juan"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Groundwater''':
Monterrey groundwater is accounted for by 46 deep wells (700 to 1000 m), 74 wells (&lt;100 m), three water tunnels (Cola de Caballo I and II,  San Francisco), and two major springs.&lt;ref name="SADM"/&gt; The wells are located in the ‘wellfields’ (area with many boreholes) and contribute 40% of the total water that consumed in Monterrey. The three most important ‘wellfields" are the "Metropolitan Area of Monterey Wellfield", "Buenos Aires Wellfield", and "Mina Wellfield". The "Buenos Aires Wellfield" is the most important and contributes nearly half (46%) of the groundwater extracted (~ 1.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s). It is located in a mountainous area of the "Huasteca Canyon" close to Monterrey. These ‘wellfields’ provide high quality water with a low cost of treatment.&lt;ref name="Wellfield"/&gt;
 
According to data gathered by researchers at the '''Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Mexico''', a medium annual precipitation of 538&amp;nbsp;mm/year within the Buenos Aires wellfield´s catchment area is sufficient to recharge the aquifer while allowing for a discharge of around 1,600 L/s (400 gal.) that can safely be extracted at any given time. In 1998, the wellfield was operated at a mean discharge of 1,535 L/s. Due to higher extraction during most of the last 25 years however, dynamic levels in some of the wells have been observed to drop almost 100 meters over a period of several years indicating possible [[over-exploitation]]. While this does occur, the wellfields are quickly and completely recharged back to [[Artesian aquifer|artesian]] conditions by hurricanes that have passed through in recent decades. Hurricanes do not appear in the hydrological balance that is based on 538&amp;nbsp;mm mean annual precipitation, therefore, long term aquifer reserves are considered to be significantly higher, implicating that extraction from the Buenos Aires wellfield can be considerably higher than 1,600 L/s without overexploiting the aquifer system.&lt;ref name="Wellfield"/&gt;

Other sources of water include man-made tunnels and natural springs (3.20% of total supply); water culture programs, reusable water from wastewater treatment plants and rehabilitation of groundwater wells that now provide access to aquifers.&lt;ref name="Wellfield"/&gt;

==Infrastructure==

===Drainage===
Management of drainage infrastructure is the domain of SADM. Despite comparably low rainfall, Monterrey receives storms and hurricanes of great intensity during the months of May and July. Drainage has been under relative control during these storms. Flooding from storms is also a distinct possibility during September and October, therefore the government has sought to protect the citizens of Monterrey by building 160&amp;nbsp;km of drainage infrastructures including: 1) seven large storm water canals totaling 60&amp;nbsp;km; 2) three retention dams; 3) 47 smaller drainage branches totaling 70&amp;nbsp;km; 4) and 26&amp;nbsp;km of other municipal works.&lt;ref name="SADM"/&gt;

===Irrigation===
The irrigation districts within the watersheds serving the MMA are the '''Bajo Río San Juan (BRSJ) irrigation district #26 (ID026)''' and the '''Bajo Río Bravo (BRB) irrigation district #25 (ID025)'''. The farmers in these two irrigation districts receive water through a unique compensation arrangement that includes crop loss payments on the order of US$100 per hectare un-irrigable land due to the diversion of water to Monterrey plus an additional 60% of the diverted water to be returned to farmers as treated effluent via the Ayancual Creek, Pesquería River. While this has been a success, the Mexican irrigation sector will continue to face intense competition for water given: (a) low water productivity in agriculture leading decision-makers to allocate water to higher productivity uses particularly in cities; (b) priority accorded to the domestic use component of municipal water supply; (c) and Mexico's national interests in meeting its water sharing obligations with the United States.&lt;ref name="C. Scott"/&gt;

In 1992, when the National Water Law (Ley de Aguas Nacionales) was enacted, management of water and irrigation systems became decentralized from the federal level to state and municipal levels. Irrigation districts, from that year on, became open to privatization and have since been responsible for maintaining themselves. Immediately, the lack of federal funding and resources to the irrigation districts around Monterrey caused problems such as lack of maintenance and management capacity. As the MMA continues to urbanize and demand for water supplies grow for both industrial and public use, irrigation districts 025 and 026 are seeing their irrigated lands contract.&lt;ref name="Navar"&gt;{{cite journal

==Water use and coverage==
Water from the Río Bravo including the San Juan sub-basin are used as follows: 78% for agriculture, 12% for urban-public supply, 8% for industry, and 2% for Livestock.&lt;ref name="C. Scott"/&gt; Monterrey has 99% coverage in water supply and 98% in sewer and close to 100% in wastewater treatment. Despite high coverage and efficiency rates, the city continues investing in expanding its capacity and improving its operations.&lt;ref name="water in mexico"&gt;{{cite web 
|url= https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:sYaM8LFJowkJ:www.iamericas.org/documents/archives/water/2001_MexicoWaterRT.pdf+Water+in+Mexico:+Government+Objectives+and+Opportunities+for+Private+Investment&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;sig=AFQjCNF0vyv7nRj6INzI9OQf54DEndJiRQ

Recent statistics show mean domestic water consumption for the city at about 12% of total discharge (Mexico average = 17%) or 10,400 liter per second (~2750 gallons) with lows in winter of 9,300 L/s (2,457 gallons) and high peaks in summer of 12,100 L/s  (~3200 gallons).&lt;ref name="Wellfield"/&gt; SADM estimated 2002 daily per capita domestic water consumption to be 130 L (32.5 gal.), down 18% from 1997 due to constant supply of 335 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year even though there has been a constant increase in population.&lt;ref name="C. Scott"/&gt;

==Water challenges==

===Pollution===
The fast pace of economic growth for the '''Monterrey Metro Area (MMA)''' has placed an increasing toll on water quality as industry (ex. Electronics) has discharged untreated industrial effluents and population has grown at a faster rate than the rest of Mexico. Consequently, availability of clean water resources has been impaired by contamination from industrial and residential sources along the Rio San Juan.&lt;ref name="Navar"/&gt; Another river that first became polluted from industrial effluents and then completely dry from overuse is the Santa Catarina River.

Adding to the problem, a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operated by SADM in Montemorelos, 45 miles southeast of Monterrey, is unable to make the capital investment required to expand unit operations and 
processes and therefore cannot meet the current needs of a growing community resulting in a heavily 
overloaded plant producing effluent that does not meet discharge standards of 30&amp;nbsp;mg/l BOD and 
[[Total suspended solids]] (TSS). In response, biological treatment technologies were deployed at the Montemorelos 1 WWTP without further significant capital increases.&lt;ref name="InPipe"&gt;{{cite journal

|pages= 1–3
|accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive results were observed after utilizing the biological treatment. Specifically, after 8 weeks of treatment, the Montemorelos 1 WWTP monthly average of influent BOD decreased 49% from 318&amp;nbsp;mg/l to 161&amp;nbsp;mg/l and influent TSS decreased 20% from 228&amp;nbsp;mg/l to 184&amp;nbsp;mg/l. Effluent BOD decreased 92% from 116&amp;nbsp;mg/l to 9&amp;nbsp;mg/l and effluent TSS decreased 80% from 58&amp;nbsp;mg/l to 12&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref name="InPipe"/&gt;

===Water shortage and scarcity===
Evaporation and droughts have played a significant role in Monterrey's ongoing struggle to acquire adequate quantities of water. Because Monterrey is located in a semi-arid region where surface water is scarce and rainfall is infrequent, high temperatures stimulate high degree of water loss through [[evaporation]] from bodies of water and [[evapotranspiration]] from surrounding flora. In El Cuchillo, the largest reservoir in the area, water evaporation is equal to the amount extracted for drinking water at least five months of the year due to a large water surface and shallow depth of the reservoir.&lt;ref name="Wellfield"/&gt; The impact of water loss through evaporation is very high as more than half of Monterrey's water supply comes from surface water.

===Water disputes===
El Cuchillo dam is the centerpiece of the basin's water management infrastructure and has become the ﬂashpoint of a multi-faceted water dispute between the states of [[Nuevo León]] and [[Tamaulipas]] as well as between urban and agricultural water interests in the basin.&lt;ref name="C. Scott"/&gt; An article from a 1999 issue of the publication, '''''Borderlines''''', does a good job of describing why there is conflict between the states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. Until the construction of the El Cuchillo project, the reservoir created by the '''Marte R. Gómez Dam''', known in the U.S. as Sugar Lake, had provided a relatively clean source of drinking water to [[Reynosa, Tamaulipas]] and irrigation water to the 26th Irrigation District, which surrounds Sugar Lake. But since coming online, El Cuchillo has devastated northern Tamaulipas. As a result of the diversion upstream, water that once supported rural users downstream has virtually dried up. Approximately 300 fishing families who earned their living from Sugar Lake lost their livelihoods, as have some local merchants and motel owners. Likewise, farmers in the 26th Irrigation District have lost their crops over several seasons and affected crop lands are estimated as high as 70,000.  As many as 20,000 families may have been affected. Also, Reynosa's drinking water now comes from the Rio Grande, which is extremely polluted. To date, the Mexican government denies any responsibility and blames the problems on the ongoing drought.&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to challenges==
In response to the contamination of the San Juan River, the government of Nuevo León initiated a sanitation program in 1994 entitled Plan Monterrey IV, which included the construction of three large wastewater treatment plants and the discharge of municipal effluents and treated water to other Rio San Juan tributaries. The public perception has remained, however, that the San Juan River is still a polluted river.&lt;ref name="Navar 2"&gt;{{cite journal

|year=2002
|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes over water between agriculture and municipal needs have been mitigated to some degree as the Monterrey water utility, SADM, now returns treated effluent back to the farming districts. This solution seems to be working for both sectors; however, the program and strategy will have to be re-evaluated as water resources become more scarce.

SADM has developed a program to replace micro-meters and valves on its secondary water network. One goal of the  program was to replace 700,000 water meters by April 2003 while another goal was to increase water supply to the city by 2,500 L/s. Actions taken to achieve these stated goals included repairing leaks in the system, promoting water re-use in industry, extracting water from new wells, using new sources which contain sulfured water, reducing urban consumption by 5% and using technologies to avoid evaporation in dams.&lt;ref name="water in mexico"/&gt;

==Institutional framework==
'''[http://www.sadm.gob.mx/ SADM]''' '''(Servicios de Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey)''' is the water and sewer utility and supplies water in the Monterrey metro area (MMA). SADM is an autonomous public utility under the government of the state of Nuevo León and is the acting water authority in throughout the MMA.&lt;ref name="SADM"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-09-27|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular type of '''Water User Association (WUA)''' called '''‘‘módulos’’''' propose operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) plans for irrigation systems while also supporting farmers with procurement and marketing plans.

New SADM tariff agreements were signed in 2007 that became effective January 1, 2008. The first agreement maintained current rates for monthly domestic water consumption between 0–10 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Another agreement enacted a 7.5% increase for all uses ranging from commercial, industrial, public and private institutions, and government dependencies. many more specifics of the 2007 Agreement can be located and downloaded at the [http://www.sadm.gob.mx/PortalSadm/jsp/seccion.jsp?id=47&amp;opm=1 SADM website] concerning their tariff structures.&lt;ref name="SADM Tariff"&gt;{{cite web

'''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050720082150/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/ IBWC]''' '''(International Boundary and Water Commission)''' has responsibility for applying the boundary and water treaties between the United States and Mexico. The IBWC is an international body composed of the United States Section and the Mexican Section, each headed by an Engineer-Commissioner appointed by his/her respective president. The commissioners report to their respective federal authorities (State Department in the case of the US, and Secretario de Relaciones Exteriores in Mexico), but operationally work with state and local agencies on water management and allocation. Each Section is administered independently of the other. The IBWC is important here because the surface water of Monterrey is supplied by the El Cuchillo reservoir receiving water from the San Juan River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande.&lt;ref name="IBWC"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Trailerpark.jpg|thumb|right|Mobile home parks often submeter their tenants]]'''Utility submetering''' is a system that allows a [[landlord]], property management firm, [[condominium]] association, [[homeowners association]], or other multi-tenant property to bill tenants for individual measured utility usage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008|Website=www.starnik.com}} The approach makes use of individual [[water meter]]s, [[gas meter]]s, or [[electricity meter]]s.

Submetering may also refer to the monitoring of the electrical consumption of individual equipment within a building, such as HVAC, indoor and outdoor lighting, refrigeration, kitchen equipment and more. In addition to the "main load" meter used by utilities to determine overall building consumption, submetering utilizes individual "submeters" that allow building and facility managers to have visibility into the energy use and performance of their equipment, creating opportunities for energy and capital expenditure savings.

==Overview==
Typically a multi-tenant dwelling has either one master meter for the entire property or a meter for each building and the property is responsible for the entire utility bill. Submetering allows property owners who supply utilities to their tenants the ability to account for each tenant’s usage in measurable terms. By fairly billing each tenant for their portion, submetering promotes conservation and offsets the expense of bills generated from a master meter, maintenance and improvements for well water systems, lagoon, or septic systems. Submetering is legally allowable in most states and municipalities, but owners should consult a Utility Management Vendor for assistance with local and state compliance and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universalutilities.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical users of submetering are [[mobile home parks]], [[apartment communit]]ies, [[condominium communit]]ies, [[townhouse communit]]ies, [[student housing communit]]ies, and [[commercial plaza]]s. Usually, utility submetering is placed in situations where the local utility cannot or will not individually meter the utility in question. Municipal Utility companies are often reluctant to take on metering individual spaces for several reasons. One reason is that rental space [[tenants]] tend to be more transient and are more difficult to collect from. By billing only the owner, they can place liens on real property if not paid (as opposed to tenants they may not know exist or who have little to lose if they move without paying). Utilities also generally prefer not to have water meters beyond their [[easement]] (i.e., the property boundary), since leaks to a service line would be before the meter and could be of less concern to a property owner. Other reasons include difficulty in getting access to meters for reading, or electrical systems and [[plumbing]] not suitable for submetering.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
[[Image:Water meter 2006.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A typical residential water meter]]
[[File:Electric submeter.jpg|thumb|A typical residential digital electric submeter]]

Before submetering, many landlords either included the utility cost in the bulk price of the [[renting|rent]] or [[lease]], or divided the utility usage among the tenants in some way such as equally, by square footage via allocation methods often called [[RUBS]] (Ratio Utility Billing System) or some other means. Without a meter to measure individual usage, there is less incentive to identify building inefficiencies, since the other tenants or landlord may pay all or part of those costs. Submetering creates awareness of [[Water conservation|water]] and [[Energy conservation]] because landlords and tenants are equally aware of what they will pay for these inefficiencies if they are not attended to.&lt;ref&gt;https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/86/submetering/system-overview&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation also allows property owners to keep the cost of rent reasonable and fair for all units regardless of how much water or energy they consume.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energystar.gov/ia/business/higher_ed/Submeter_energy_use.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6668/is_200310/ai_n26594899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainablefacility.com/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000186340{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.speedreadtech.com/SR-Value/Tenant-Fairness.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013135147/http://www.speedreadtech.com/SR-Value/Tenant-Fairness.htm |archive-date=2008-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, submetering provides an opportunity for building owners to shift their rising electricity costs to tenants who lack ownership or control over thermal efficiency of the structure, its insulation, windows, and major energy consuming appliances.  Landlords may attempt to deem their charges for electric service as "additional rent" making tenants subject to eviction for nonpayment of electric bills, which would not be possible if they were direct customers of the utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pulp.tc/html/residential_submetering.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227154108/http://www.pulp.tc/html/residential_submetering.html |archive-date=2009-12-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ontario Energy Board in August 2009 nullified all landlord submetering and allowed future submetering only upon informed tenant consent, including provision of third party energy audits to tenants to enable them to judge the total cost of rent plus electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pulp.tc/Ontairo_Energy_Board_-_8-13-2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107022011/http://pulp.tc/Ontairo_Energy_Board_-_8-13-2009.pdf |archive-date=2011-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some submetering products connect with software that provides consumption data. This data provides users with the information to locate leaks and high-consumption areas. Users can apply this data to implement conservation or renovation projects to lower usage &amp; costs, meet government mandates, or participate in green building programs such as LEED and green globes.

==System design==

A submetering system typically includes a "master meter", which is owned by the utility supplying the water, electricity, or gas, with overall usage billed directly to the property owner. The property owner or manager then places their own private meters on individual tenant spaces to determine individual usage levels and bill each tenant for their share. In some cases, the landlord might add the usage cost to the regular rent or lease bill. In other cases, a third party might read, bill, and possibly even collect for the service. Some of these companies also install and maintain meters and reading systems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Panel or circuit submeters are used to measure resource use of the same system for added security, economic, reliability, and behavioral benefits. These provide important insights into resource consumption of building systems and equipment working in the same series. Submeters can measure use of a single panel, or multiple points within a panel system using single-point, multi-point, and branch circuit submeters.&lt;ref&gt;https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/86/submetering/system-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest{{Clarify|date=July 2008}}&lt;!-- specify time period, 1990s? Also is this US-specific? --&gt; trend in submetering is [[Automatic Meter Reading]], or AMR. This technology is used to get from meter reading to billing by an automated electronic means. This can be by [[handheld computer]]s that collect data using touch wands, walk or drive-by radio, fixed network systems where the meter has a [[transmitter]] or [[transceiver]] that sends the data to a central location, or transmission via [[Wi-Fi]], [[Mobile phone|cellular]], or [[Internet]] connections.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Although not technically submetering, an alternate method of utility cost allocation called RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing Systems) is sometimes used to allocate costs to tenants when true submetering is not practical or not possible due to plumbing or wiring constraints. This method divides utility costs by square footage, number of occupants, or some other combination of cost ratios.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Submetering in the world==

Submeters take many forms. For example, [[Central heating]] in apartment blocks in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland is sometimes submetered with liquid filled calibrated vials, known as [[heat cost allocator]]s, attached to each of the heating radiators. The metering company visits the apartments about once a year and reads the liquid level and replaces the vials. Some apartment owners have replaced the vials with electronic submeters that transmit temperature readings via radio to a master unit in each apartment. The master unit in turn transmits collated readings to the utility company, thereby saving both labour costs and inconvenience to both tenant and landlord. The master unit displays a number representing the current total of "heating value".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Submetering history and laws==

[[Image:Gas meter.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A residential gas meter]]
The concept of submetering was effectively "invented" sometime in the 1920s, when many laws currently affecting submetering were written.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}{{Clarify|date=July 2008}}&lt;!-- US laws? --&gt; However, submetering really did not take a hold in the property management world until the late 1980s, with the ever increasing costs associated with utilities and a society more aware of environmental conservation.

The '''Women's Health Initiative''' ('''WHI''') was initiated by the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in 1991. The Women's Health Initiative, which consisted of three clinical trials (CT) and an observational study (OS), was conducted to address major health issues causing morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women.  In particular, [[randomized controlled trial]]s were designed and funded that addressed [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]], and [[osteoporosis]].  In its entirety, the WHI enrolled more than 160,000 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years (at time of study enrollment) over 15 years, making it one of the largest U.S. prevention studies of its kind, with a budget of $625 million.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker-Pope|first=Tara|title=The Women’s Health Initiative and the Body Politic|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/weekinreview/10estrogen.html?ref=weekinreview|accessdate=6 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 analysis calculated a net economic return on investment of $37.1 billion for the estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the study's hormone trial alone, providing a strong case for the continued use of this variety of large, publicly funded population study.&lt;ref name=roth1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=Joshua A.|last2=Etzioni|first2=Ruth|last3=Waters|first3=Teresa M.|last4=Pettinger|first4=Mary|last5=Rossouw|first5=Jacques E.|last6=Anderson|first6=Garnet L.|last7=Chlebowski|first7=Rowan T.|last8=Manson|first8=JoAnn E.|last9=Hlatky|first9=Mark|last10=Johnson|first10=Karen C.|last11=Ramsey|first11=Scott D.|title=Economic Return From the Women's Health Initiative Estrogen Plus Progestin Clinical Trial|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=6 May 2014|volume=160|issue=9|pages=594–602|doi=10.7326/M13-2348|pmid=24798522|pmc=4157355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jama1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Francis S.|title=Exceptional Opportunities in Medical Science|journal=JAMA|date=13 January 2015|volume=313|issue=2|pages=131|doi=10.1001/jama.2014.16736|pmc=5101937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation for the expanded study of women's health==
In the 1980s, it had become apparent that past biomedical research had focused disproportionately on white men, often neglecting prevention and treatment studies of diseases that are either unique to or more common in women and minorities.  In 1985, the Public Health Service Task Force on Women's Health Issues issued recommendations that biomedical and behavioral research should be expanded to provide for the inclusion diseases and conditions identified among women of all age groups.  In 1986, the NIH issued recommendations that women be included in all research studies. To further promote the study of women, in 1990, the NIH created the Office of Research on Women's Health.

In 1990, however, a report was published by the General Accounting Office (GAO), at the request of the Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues, which stated that this NIH policy was not being adequately applied to research grant applications.  As a consequence, beginning in 1991, NIH strengthened the policy to require, rather than recommend, the inclusion of women in clinical research (when appropriate) in order to obtain funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossouw|first=Jacques|title=The Evolution of the Women's Health Initiative: Perspectives from the NIH|journal=J Am Med Womens Assoc|date=Mar–Apr 1995|volume=50|issue=2|pages=50–55|pmid=7722207|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was these changes in societal attitudes and policy toward women's health research, in addition to the demonstration that such a large study was not only feasible, but could be done economically, that gave rise to the WHI.

==WHI study antecedents and demonstration of feasibility for a large-scale intervention study==
Among postmenopausal women, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, as well as impaired quality of life.  Among women in all age groups, cancer and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Center for Health Statistics: Vital Statistics of the United States, volume II, Part B.|year=1990|publisher=DHSS Public Health Service|location=Washington, DC|pages=90-1102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=DM|title=Axial and appendicular bone mineral and a woman's lifetime risk of hip fracture|journal=J Bone Miner Res|date=June 1992|volume=7|issue=6|pages=633–638|pmid=1414481|doi=10.1002/jbmr.5650070607|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As the incidence of these diseases increases according to age, women over the age of 50 bear much of the disease burden.

It had been generally accepted that postmenopausal estrogen deficiency may play a role in these morbidities, and that dietary, behavioral, and drug interventions may forestall their development.  However, these findings were identified on the basis of epidemiologic observational studies alone.  Such interventions would require testing through clinical trials before they, along with their full range of risks and benefits, could be used as the basis for setting public health policy and creating prevention guidelines.

However, concerns existed about the feasibility of such a complex clinical trial among participants in this demographic of older women, particularly with respect to sufficient recruitment and adherence to the dietary and hormone-treatment regimens.

In 1987, the NIH funded the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Intervention (PEPI).  The trial followed 875 women who underwent treatment with estrogen, estrogen and progestin, or placebo, and&amp;nbsp;— even quite early in the study&amp;nbsp;— demonstrated both successful recruitment and participant retention/adherence in a hormone therapy (HT) setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett-Connor|first=Elizabeth|title=The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions Study: primary outcomes in adherent women|journal=Maturitas|date=July 1997|volume=27|issue=3|pages=261–274|pmid=9288699|doi=10.1016/s0378-5122(97)00041-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of estrogen or estrogen/progestin regimens on heart disease risk factors in postmenopausal women.

In 1984, the NIH provided funding for a feasibility study pertaining to diet adherence, conducted by the Women's Health Trial (WHT).  The WHT, which commenced in 1986 and involved 303 women randomized into dietary intervention and control groups, yielded results demonstrating a high degree of adherence on the basis of both food-intake questionnaires and clinical laboratory findings.{{sfn|Henderson et al|1990}}{{sfn|White et al|1992}} The WHT did not proceed with its full-scale trial, as it was not awarded further funding from the NIH on the basis of the potential inability of the study to test the hypothesis in a larger cohort of women.  In 1990, however, interest in the impact of diet on cancer and cardiovascular disease in women was renewed, and a joint National Cancer Institute (NCI)-National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) workshop concluded that a full-scale dietary trial, with a focus on these two diseases, was warranted.

===WHI study announced and planning begins===
[[File:Former NIH Director Bernadine Healy (27584865040).jpg|thumb|Former NIH Director Bernadine Healy]]
On April 19, 1991, Dr. [[Bernadine Healy]], newly appointed as the first female director of the NIH, announced her plan for the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Almanac&amp;nbsp;— Past NIH Directors|url=http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/directors.htm#healy|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning for the WHI CT/OS study began that year.  In order to promote cross-institutional collaboration, and to prevent the loss of funding to other women's health-related studies, funding was requested and obtained directly from Congress in the form of a discrete line item, with a projected budget of $625 million over the life of the 15-year study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release&amp;nbsp;— U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi/pr_92-10-2.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIH awarded the role of Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) to the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] (FHCRC), located in [[Seattle, Washington]].  The CCC's responsibilities included the coordination of the 40 study clinics that would eventually recruit women nationwide, as well as ensuring their consistent adherence to the study design and guidelines.

==Design overview, eligibility, and enrollment==
In 1991, working groups were formed to determine the study plan for both the clinical trials (CT) and the observational study (OS). These groups included experts from diverse arenas of medicine, public health, and clinical trial design from both within and outside the NIH.

===Study organization and implementation===
Given the complexity of the WHI study, both in terms of the number of interventions and outcomes studied, as well as the number and geographic distribution of participants and clinical centers, careful orchestration was required.  To this end, the WHI maintained a carefully designed organizational structure, along with governance- and science-specific committees and communications channels for staff and investigators to resolve study-related questions and exchange information. As the study launched concurrently with the early stages of modern [[Internet]] connectivity, the study centers had to be supplied with computing and networking equipment to connect to the WHI network; WHI-hosted e-mail facilitated the efficient exchange of information among staff and scientists, as well as the transfer of study-related data.

The launch of the study was undertaken in two stages.  At first, 16 "vanguard" study centers entered active operation, to evaluate the study protocol and procedures.  Once this initial portion of the study was underway, the remaining 24 study centers entered the study around a year later, each assigned to one of the "vanguard" study centers for purposes of mentorship.  Study centers were subdivided into four regions, each under the supervision of a regional center, to further facilitate communication and information exchange among study centers.

===Eligibility and enrollment===
The WHI study recruited postmenopausal women in the 50-79 age range, and sought to be as inclusive as practical.  The wide nature of the age range balanced the need to observe the effects of hormone therapy on younger women, while also attempting to capture physical and cognitive outcomes in older populations.  In addition, a 20% minority enrollment rate was set for all components, to accurately represent the proportion of minorities within the study demographic (17% at the time of the 1990 U.S. Census).  To achieve this, 10 of the 40 WHI clinical centers were designated as minority recruitment centers, with enhanced minority recruitment goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hays|first=J|author2=Hunt, JR |author3=Hubbell, FA |author4=Anderson, GL |author5=Limacher, M |author6=Allen, C |author7= Rossouw, JE |title=The Women's Health Initiative recruitment methods and results.|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|date=Oct 2003|volume=13|issue=9 Suppl|pages=S18-77|pmid=14575939|doi=10.1016/s1047-2797(03)00042-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eligibility and exclusion criteria also were defined, both study-wide and component-specific.  Global inclusion criteria included postmenopausal women, between 50 and 79 years of age, who were willing and able to provide written consent, and who planned to reside in the study recruitment for a least three years after enrollment.  Global exclusion criteria included medical conditions that would be predictive of a survival of less than three years, possessing characteristics or conditions that may diminish study adherence (e.g., substance abuse, mental illness, or cognitive impairment), or concurrent enrollment in another randomized controlled clinical trial.

For the CT, a partial factorial study design was utilized for the investigation of three overlapping interventions (dietary modification, hormone therapy, and calcium/vitamin D supplementation), as this would provide considerable cost efficiencies. Willing study-eligible women were asked to join either the hormone therapy (HT trial), the dietary modification (DM) trial, or both.  After one year, willing and eligible CT participants were also asked to join the calcium/vitamin D trial (CaD).

Recruitment goals for the HT, DM, and CaD components of the CT were 27,500, 48,000, and 45,000, respectively, each obtained on the basis of calculations of [[statistical power]] with regard to the outcomes of interest for each component.

Participants who either did not qualify for or declined to participate in the CT were, if eligible and willing to consent, enrolled in the observational study (OS), which had an enrollment goal of 100,000.

==Study components and primary findings==
The WHI study was composed of four study components, to include three overlapping clinical trial (CT) interventions and one observational study (OS). Component enrollment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prentice|first=RL|author2=Anderson, GL |title=The women's health initiative: lessons learned.|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|year=2008|volume=29|pages=131–50|pmid=18348708|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090947}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the primary findings are summarized in the following two tables, respectively, with additional detail following subsequently:

===Hormone therapy (HT) intervention===
The design of the hormone therapy trial (HT) was approached with the hypothesis that [[estrogen]] therapy would result in a decrease in coronary heart disease and osteoporosis-related fractures. As such, the primary outcome of interest was coronary heart disease, as this is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women, particularly those over age 65, and because, at the time, no clinical trial had been undertaken to prove the cardioprotective effects of HT. Due to the concern over the relationship between HT and elevated [[breast cancer]] risk, breast cancer was selected as the primary adverse outcome. Additional outcomes monitored included [[stroke]], [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE), [[endometrial cancer]], [[colorectal cancer]], [[hip fracture]], and death due to other causes.

Two regimens were selected, in addition to a placebo group. Women assigned to the intervention group who had previously undergone a [[hysterectomy]] were treated with unopposed estrogen, specifically [[conjugated estrogens]] (Premarin), manufactured by ([[Wyeth]]), at a dosage of 0.625&amp;nbsp;mg/day ("E-alone," n = 5310; placebo, n = 5429). Women with an intact uterus were treated by a combined estrogen plus [[progestin]] regimen ("E+P," n = 8506; placebo, n = 8102), specifically the aforementioned estrogen regimen with the addition of 2.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day of [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (MPA; Prempro, also manufactured by Wyeth). The addition of progestin has been linked to a marked reduction in the risk for the development of [[endometrial cancer]] in women receiving estrogen treatment who have not undergone a hysterectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brinton|first=Louise A.|author2=Felix, Ashley S. |title=Menopausal hormone therapy and risk of endometrial cancer|journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|date=1 May 2013|doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2013.05.001|pmid=23680641|volume=142|pages=83–89|pmc=3775978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the global exclusion criteria, women were ineligible for the HT component if safety was a concern. Such concerns included a breast cancer diagnosis at any time in the past, other cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) diagnosed within the previous 10 years, or low hematocrit or platelet counts.

====HT component findings and ensuing events====
The HT component had originally been designed to include a follow-up period of nine years. However, interim monitoring of the combined estrogen/progestin treatment group indicated an increased risk of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism, which outweighed the evidence indicating a benefit in preventing colorectal cancer and fractures. As a consequence, the HT study pills were stopped in July 2002, with an average follow-up period of 5.2 years.{{sfn|WHI|2002}} The unopposed estrogen trial was halted in February 2004, after an average follow-up period of 6.8 years, on the basis that unopposed estrogen did not appear to affect the risk of heart disease, the primary outcome, which was in contrast to the findings of previous observational studies. On the other hand, there were indications for an increased risk of stroke. Unopposed estrogen did reduce the risk for osteoporotic fractures and, unlike the estrogen/progestin treatment, showed a decrease in breast cancer risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=GL |author2=Limacher, M |author3=Assaf, AR |author4=Bassford, T |author5=Beresford, SA |author6=Black, H |author7=Bonds, D |author8=Brunner, R |author9=Brzyski, R |author10=Caan, B |author11=Chlebowski, R |author12=Curb, D |author13=Gass, M |author14=Hays, J |author15=Heiss, G |author16=Hendrix, S |author17=Howard, BV |author18=Hsia, J |author19=Hubbell, A |author20=Jackson, R |author21=Johnson, KC |author22=Judd, H |author23=Kotchen, JM |author24=Kuller, L |author25=LaCroix, AZ |author26=Lane, D |author27=Langer, RD |author28=Lasser, N |author29=Lewis, CE |author30=Manson, J |author31=Margolis, K |author32=Ockene, J |author33=O'Sullivan, MJ |author34=Phillips, L |author35=Prentice, RL |author36=Ritenbaugh, C |author37=Robbins, J |author38=Rossouw, JE |author39=Sarto, G |author40=Stefanick, ML |author41=Van Horn, L |author42=Wactawski-Wende, J |author43=Wallace, R |author44=Wassertheil-Smoller, S |title=Effects of conjugated equine estrogen in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy: the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial.|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Apr 14, 2004|volume=291|issue=14|pages=1701–12|pmid=15082697|doi=10.1001/jama.291.14.1701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the findings, which indicated that the incurred risks of HT outweigh the identified benefits, the study authors recommended that HT not be prescribed for the purpose of chronic disease prevention in postmenopausal women.

The hypothesized and observed risks of specific clinical outcomes are summarized in the following table. Of particular interest are the contrasts between several of the hypothesized risks and the observed [[attributable risk]]s, which are instructive in demonstrating the distinct differences between the HT trial findings and those of previous observational studies.

The DM trial was conducted with the purpose of identifying the effects of a low-fat eating pattern; the primary outcome measures were the incidence of invasive breast and colorectal cancers, fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and overall [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD), calculated as a composite of CHD and stroke.

Women in the trial were randomly assigned to the dietary intervention group (40%; n = 19541) or the control group (60%; n = 29294). In addition to the global exclusion criteria, component-specific exclusion criteria included prior breast cancer, colorectal cancer, other cancers excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer in the past 10 years, adherence or retention concerns (e.g., a substance abuse history or dementia), or a baseline diet that included a fat intake accounting for less than 32% of total energy intake.

Participants in the intervention group underwent a regimen of trainings, group meetings, and consultations which encouraged low-fat eating habits, targeted to 20% of daily caloric intake, along with increasing the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Those assigned to the control group were not asked to adopt any specific dietary changes.

====DM component findings====
The mean follow-up for the DM intervention was 8.1 years. At study years 1 and 6, the dietary fat intake levels for the intervention group were 10.7% and 8.2% less than those of the control group, respectively. The results indicated that, despite some reduction in CVD risk factors (e.g., blood lipids and diastolic blood pressure), there was no significant reduction in the risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD, indicating that a more focused combination of diet and lifestyle interventions may be required to further improve CVD risk factors and reduce overall risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=BV |author2=Van Horn, L |author3=Hsia, J |author4=Manson, JE |author5=Stefanick, ML |author6=Wassertheil-Smoller, S |author7=Kuller, LH |author8=LaCroix, AZ |author9=Langer, RD |author10=Lasser, NL |author11=Lewis, CE |author12=Limacher, MC |author13=Margolis, KL |author14=Mysiw, WJ |author15=Ockene, JK |author16=Parker, LM |author17=Perri, MG |author18=Phillips, L |author19=Prentice, RL |author20=Robbins, J |author21=Rossouw, JE |author22=Sarto, GE |author23=Schatz, IJ |author24=Snetselaar, LG |author25=Stevens, VJ |author26=Tinker, LF |author27=Trevisan, M |author28=Vitolins, MZ |author29=Anderson, GL |author30=Assaf, AR |author31=Bassford, T |author32=Beresford, SA |author33=Black, HR |author34=Brunner, RL |author35=Brzyski, RG |author36=Caan, B |author37=Chlebowski, RT |author38=Gass, M |author39=Granek, I |author40=Greenland, P |author41=Hays, J |author42=Heber, D |author43=Heiss, G |author44=Hendrix, SL |author45=Hubbell, FA |author46=Johnson, KC |author47=Kotchen, JM|title=Low-fat dietary pattern and risk of cardiovascular disease: the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial.|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Feb 8, 2006|volume=295|issue=6|pages=655–66|pmid=16467234|doi=10.1001/jama.295.6.655}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, no statistically significant reduction in breast cancer risk was identified, although the results approached significance and indicated that longer-term follow-up may yield a more definitive comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prentice|first=RL |author2=Caan, B |author3=Chlebowski, RT |author4=Patterson, R |author5=Kuller, LH |author6=Ockene, JK |author7=Margolis, KL |author8=Limacher, MC |author9=Manson, JE |author10=Parker, LM |author11=Paskett, E |author12=Phillips, L |author13=Robbins, J |author14=Rossouw, JE |author15=Sarto, GE |author16=Shikany, JM |author17=Stefanick, ML |author18=Thomson, CA |author19=Van Horn, L |author20=Vitolins, MZ |author21=Wactawski-Wende, J |author22=Wallace, RB |author23=Wassertheil-Smoller, S |author24=Whitlock, E |author25=Yano, K |author26=Adams-Campbell, L |author27=Anderson, GL |author28=Assaf, AR |author29=Beresford, SA |author30=Black, HR |author31=Brunner, RL |author32=Brzyski, RG |author33=Ford, L |author34=Gass, M |author35=Hays, J |author36=Heber, D |author37=Heiss, G |author38=Hendrix, SL |author39=Hsia, J |author40=Hubbell, FA |author41=Jackson, RD |author42=Johnson, KC |author43=Kotchen, JM |author44=LaCroix, AZ |author45=Lane, DS |author46=Langer, RD |author47=Lasser, NL |author48=Henderson, MM |title=Low-fat dietary pattern and risk of invasive breast cancer: the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial.|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Feb 8, 2006|volume=295|issue=6|pages=629–42|pmid=16467232|doi=10.1001/jama.295.6.629}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial also did not identify a reduction in colorectal cancer risk attributable to a [[low-fat diet]]ary pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beresford|first=SA |author2=Johnson, KC |author3=Ritenbaugh, C |author4=Lasser, NL |author5=Snetselaar, LG |author6=Black, HR |author7=Anderson, GL |author8=Assaf, AR |author9=Bassford, T |author10=Bowen, D |author11=Brunner, RL |author12=Brzyski, RG |author13=Caan, B |author14=Chlebowski, RT |author15=Gass, M |author16=Harrigan, RC |author17=Hays, J |author18=Heber, D |author19=Heiss, G |author20=Hendrix, SL |author21=Howard, BV |author22=Hsia, J |author23=Hubbell, FA |author24=Jackson, RD |author25=Kotchen, JM |author26=Kuller, LH |author27=LaCroix, AZ |author28=Lane, DS |author29=Langer, RD |author30=Lewis, CE |author31=Manson, JE |author32=Margolis, KL |author33=Mossavar-Rahmani, Y |author34=Ockene, JK |author35=Parker, LM |author36=Perri, MG |author37=Phillips, L |author38=Prentice, RL |author39=Robbins, J |author40=Rossouw, JE |author41=Sarto, GE |author42=Stefanick, ML |author43=Van Horn, L |author44=Vitolins, MZ |author45=Wactawski-Wende, J |author46=Wallace, RB |author47=Whitlock, E|title=Low-fat dietary pattern and risk of colorectal cancer: the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial.|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Feb 8, 2006|volume=295|issue=6|pages=643–54|pmid=16467233|doi=10.1001/jama.295.6.643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calcium/Vitamin D (CaD) intervention===
The CaD trial component was designed to test the hypothesis that women taking a combination of [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] will experience a reduced risk of hip and other fractures, as well as breast and colorectal cancer.

Women participating in this intervention were randomly assigned to receive a regimen of 1000&amp;nbsp;mg calcium in combination with 400 [[International Units]] (IU) of vitamin D (n = 18176) or a placebo (n = 18106), and were followed for an average of 7 years, with monitoring for bone density, fractures, and pathologically confirmed cancers as the measures of outcomes. Women in the CaD trial were already participating in the HT trial, the DM trial, or both. In addition to the global exclusion criteria, component-specific exclusion criteria [[hypercalcemia]], [[renal calculi]], [[corticosteroid]] use, and [[calcitriol]] use.

====CaD component findings====
Among the intervention cohort, a small but significant improvement in hip bone density was observed, although a significant reduction in hip fractures was not observed. However, subgroup analysis revealed a possible benefit to older women in terms of a reduced risk of hip fractures, attributable to calcium plus vitamin D supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=RD |author2=LaCroix, AZ |author3=Gass, M |author4=Wallace, RB |author5=Robbins, J |author6=Lewis, CE |author7=Bassford, T |author8=Beresford, SA |author9=Black, HR |author10=Blanchette, P |author11=Bonds, DE |author12=Brunner, RL |author13=Brzyski, RG |author14=Caan, B |author15=Cauley, JA |author16=Chlebowski, RT |author17=Cummings, SR |author18=Granek, I |author19=Hays, J |author20=Heiss, G |author21=Hendrix, SL |author22=Howard, BV |author23=Hsia, J |author24=Hubbell, FA |author25=Johnson, KC |author26=Judd, H |author27=Kotchen, JM |author28=Kuller, LH |author29=Langer, RD |author30=Lasser, NL |author31=Limacher, MC |author32=Ludlam, S |author33=Manson, JE |author34=Margolis, KL |author35=McGowan, J |author36=Ockene, JK |author37=O'Sullivan, MJ |author38=Phillips, L |author39=Prentice, RL |author40=Sarto, GE |author41=Stefanick, ML |author42=Van Horn, L |author43=Wactawski-Wende, J |author44=Whitlock, E |author45=Anderson, GL |author46=Assaf, AR |author47=Barad, D |title=Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of fractures.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=Feb 16, 2006|volume=354|issue=7|pages=669–83|pmid=16481635|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa055218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observational study (OS)===
The OS study recruited eligible postmenopausal women (n = 93676) who were either ineligible or unwilling to participate in the CT portion of the study, for the purpose of obtaining additional risk factor information, identifying risk-related biomarkers, and serving as a comparative observational assessment to the CT interventions.

Participants underwent an initial baseline screening, including the collection of physical measurements, blood specimens, an inventory of medications and supplements, and completion of questionnaires pertaining to medical history, family history, reproductive history, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and quality of life. In addition, more specific information was collected with regard to the participant's geographic residence history, passive (i.e., "second-hand") smoking exposure in childhood and adulthood, early life exposures, details of physical activity, weight and weight-cycling history, and occupational exposures. In addition to the baseline data collected, OS participants received annual questionnaire mailings to update selected exposures and outcomes, and were expected to make an additional clinic visit, to include an additional blood collection, about three years post-enrollment. It was planned that participants would be followed for an average of 9 years.

The major outcomes of interest for the OS were coronary heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, osteoporotic fractures, [[diabetes]], and total mortality. Given the size and diversity of the cohort,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langer|first=RD|author2=White, E |author3=Lewis, CE |author4=Kotchen, JM |author5=Hendrix, SL |author6= Trevisan, M |title=The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study: baseline characteristics of participants and reliability of baseline measures.|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|date=Oct 2003|volume=13|issue=9 Suppl|pages=S107-21|pmid=14575943|doi=10.1016/s1047-2797(03)00047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; taken together with the data and specimen collection being undertaken, it was expected that this cohort could yield insights into a variety of hypotheses, as well as generate new hypotheses with respect to disease etiology in women.

==Study extensions, new trials, and the WHI at present==
The WHI study has received three extensions; these extensions are referred to as "Extension Study 1" (2005-2010), "Extension Study 2" (2010-2015), and the recently undertaken "Extension Study 3" (2015-2020).  Participants from the first phase of the WHI study were consented and enrolled, with the intention of collecting additional longitudinal data from subjects involved in all of the original study components. The primary outcomes were the same, although greater emphasis was placed on the investigation of cardiovascular disease and aging.  Extension Study 1 enrolled 115,403 of the original WHI participants, or 77% of those eligible from the first study phase. Extension Study 2 was able to enroll 93,540 participants, or 87% of those eligible from Extension Study 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extension Study 2|url=https://cleo.whi.org/about/SitePages/WHI%20Extension%202010-2015.aspx|publisher=Women's Health Initiative|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preliminary estimates for Extension Study 3 participation, as of September 30, 2015, estimate that 36,115 of the Clinical Trial participants and 45,271 Observational Study participants remain active in the WHI study, for a total of 81,386 or 87% of those previously enrolled in Extension Study 2.&lt;ref&gt;Internal e-mail communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long Life Study (LLS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Life Study|url=https://cleo.whi.org/about/SitePages/Long%20Life%20Study.aspx|publisher=Women's Health Initiative|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
A subsample of the Extension Study 2 participants (n = 7875), aged 63–99 and meeting other eligibility criteria, were consented into the Long Life Study (LLS), the purpose of which was to establish new baselines from which new studies in disease and aging can work.  In-person visits were conducted to assess and collect physical and functional measurements, as well as blood to replenish the WHI biospecimen repository and determine current CBC parameters for these participants.  The LLS completed its in-person visits and blood collections in May 2013.

A large subset of the LLS participants (n ≈ 7400) were further enrolled in the Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health in Women (OPACH) study, the purpose of which was to assess physical activity in women capable of ambulation.  These women were asked to maintain a week-long sleep log, wear an [[accelerometer]] for a week, and keep track of falls on a month basis for one year.  The goal was to establish a stronger correlation between physical activity and cardiovascular disease and total mortality.

===COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS)===
Undertaken beginning in 2015, the [http://www.cosmostrial.org/ COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS)]  at [[Brigham and Women’s Hospital]] and the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] (Seattle, WA) is a four-year clinical trial that will randomize 18,000 men and women across the U.S. The study will investigate whether taking daily supplements of cocoa flavanols (600&amp;nbsp;mg/day) or a common multivitamin reduces the risk for developing heart disease, stroke, and cancer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whi.org/participants/SitePages/Home.aspx|title=Participants&amp;nbsp;— Home|website=www.whi.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whi.org/Stories/COcoa%20Supplement%20and%20Multivitamin%20Outcomes%20Study%20(COSMOS)%20Trial.aspx|title=WHI&amp;nbsp;— COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) Trial|website=www.whi.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's Health Initiative Strong &amp; Healthy (WHISH)===
The [https://whish.stanford.edu/ Women’s Health Initiative Strong and Healthy Study (WHISH)], started in 2015 and expected to last four years, seeks to examine the impact of physical activity in older women on certain outcomes such as heart disease and metrics including maintaining an independent lifestyle. The study has enrolled nearly 50,000 participants as of October 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Health Initiative Strong and Healthy Study&amp;nbsp;— Tabular View&amp;nbsp;— ClinicalTrials.gov|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02425345|website=clinicaltrials.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose assigned interventions will include varying physical activity routines, which are monitored by mail and via phone, using an [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Other Ancillary Studies===
Public health investigators and biostatisticians can apply to use WHI study data in conjunction with their investigations.  As of June 2013, nearly 450 Ancillary Studies have been proposed.  Newly generated data from these Ancillary Studies must be submitted to the WHI, which in turn provides a richer data resource for subsequent studies.

In addition to the study data, data from [[genome-wide association studies]] (GWAS) conducted on participant DNA is available on the NIH-hosted [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)].

===Significant Extension Study Findings===
Recent analysis during the post-intervention period following the estrogen-plus-progestin trial continues to reveal the strong association between estrogen- plus-progestin usage and breast cancer risk. Following the halt of the estrogen-plus-progestin trial, there was a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in the early post-intervention period, though the hazard ratio remained greater than 1, followed by a sustained risk during the late post-intervention period that was significantly greater than 1. It is hypothesized that the initial decrease was due to the resulting change in the hormone environment, while the subsequent persistent increase in breast cancer incidence may be attributed to the persistence of oncogenic mutations and subsequent expansion of these mutation-harboring cell lineages.

In contrast, breast cancer risk was significantly lower for the estrogen-alone group compared to placebo during the post-intervention period.  Specifically, the reduction of breast cancer incidence persisted throughout the early post-intervention phase, but was lost during the late post-intervention phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chlebowski|first1=Rowan T.|last2=Rohan|first2=Thomas E.|last3=Manson|first3=JoAnn E.|last4=Aragaki|first4=Aaron K.|last5=Kaunitz|first5=Andrew|last6=Stefanick|first6=Marcia L.|last7=Simon|first7=Michael S.|last8=Johnson|first8=Karen C.|last9=Wactawski-Wende|first9=Jean|last10=O’Sullivan|first10=Mary J.|last11=Adams-Campbell|first11=Lucile L.|last12=Nassir|first12=Rami|last13=Lessin|first13=Lawrence S.|last14=Prentice|first14=Ross L.|title=Breast Cancer After Use of Estrogen Plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone|journal=JAMA Oncology|date=16 April 2015|doi=10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0494|volume=1|pages=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding endometrial cancer, although estrogen-plus-progestin use during the intervention period suggested a reduction in cancer incidence, the difference became statistically significant with additional follow-up from the extension period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chlebowski|first1=R. T.|last2=Anderson|first2=G. L.|last3=Sarto|first3=G. E.|last4=Haque|first4=R.|last5=Runowicz|first5=C. D.|last6=Aragaki|first6=A. K.|last7=Thomson|first7=C. A.|last8=Howard|first8=B.

According to a cumulative 18-year follow-up analysis published in 2017, it was found that, among 27,347 postmenopausal women who had originally participated in the WHI hormone therapy trials, interventions using estrogen-plus-progestin and estrogen-alone were not associated with increased or decreased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, or total cancer mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manson|first=JoAnn E.|last2=Aragaki|first2=Aaron K.|last3=Rossouw|first3=Jacques E.|last4=Anderson|first4=Garnet L.|last5=Prentice|first5=Ross L.|last6=LaCroix|first6=Andrea Z.|last7=Chlebowski|first7=Rowan T.|last8=Howard|first8=Barbara V.|last9=Thomson|first9=Cynthia A.|date=12 September 2017|title=Menopausal Hormone Therapy and Long-term All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality: The Women's Health Initiative Randomized Trials|journal=JAMA|volume=318|issue=10|pages=927–938|doi=10.1001/jama.2017.11217|issn=1538-3598|pmid=28898378|pmc=5728370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note, mortality is a rather limited summary because it does not include non-fatal CVD and non-fatal cancer events that may have long term consequences on health and quality of life. Post-menopausal women considering initiation of HT and their clinicians should refer to previous WHI publications for a complete summary of risks for fatal and non-fatal events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2017/09/death-risk-menopausal-hormone-replacement.html|title=Big study finds no rise in death risk among women who took hormone therapy|work=Fred Hutch|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dietary Modification intervention has also yielded new findings, after nearly two decades of follow-up.  During the dietary intervention period (median, 8.1 years), it was found that a low-fat dietary pattern led to a lower incidence of death after breast cancer (40 deaths versus 94 in the "normal diet" arm; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.94, P = .02.). After a median 16.1 years of cumulative follow-up (inclusive of the intervention period), further analysis showed that this benefit persisted (234 deaths versus 443 in the "normal diet" arm; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96 with P = .01).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chlebowski|first=Rowan T.|last2=Aragaki|first2=Aaron K.|last3=Anderson|first3=Garnet L.|last4=Thomson|first4=Cynthia A.|last5=Manson|first5=JoAnn E.|last6=Simon|first6=Michael S.|last7=Howard|first7=Barbara V.|last8=Rohan|first8=Thomas E.|last9=Snetselar|first9=Linda|date=2017-09-01|title=Low-Fat Dietary Pattern and Breast Cancer Mortality in the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|volume=35|issue=25|pages=2919–2926|doi=10.1200/JCO.2016.72.0326|issn=1527-7755|pmc=5578391|pmid=28654363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent analysis of Dietary Modification intervention outcomes showed a 30% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk among women having normal blood pressure (n = 23,248) and partaking in a low-fat dietary pattern (122 versus 256 CHD events; HR, 0.70; 95% CI,  0.56 to 0.87 during the intervention period). Participants with existing cardiovascular disease at baseline (n = 1,656) were at higher risk of developing coronary heart disease, both during the intervention and extended follow-up periods (101 versus 116 CHD events, HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.93; and 36 versus 44, HR, 1.61 95% CI 1.02 to 2.55, respectively). The increased among women with prior CVD was likely due to post-randomization confounding, resulting in some difficulty in interpretation.  Women in the diet intervention group were more likely to report changes in statin use (either cessation or initiation) post-randomization than women in the comparison group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prentice|first=Ross L.|last2=Aragaki|first2=Aaron K.|last3=Van Horn|first3=Linda|last4=Thomson|first4=Cynthia A.|last5=Beresford|first5=Shirley Aa|last6=Robinson|first6=Jennifer|last7=Snetselaar|first7=Linda|last8=Anderson|first8=Garnet L.|last9=Manson|first9=JoAnn E.|date=July 2017|title=Low-fat dietary pattern and cardiovascular disease: results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=106|issue=1|pages=35–43|doi=10.3945/ajcn.117.153270|issn=1938-3207|pmc=5486201|pmid=28515068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These types of analysis, conducted more than a decade after the halt of the intervention trials, serves further to demonstrate the long-term value and return on investment yielded by the WHI study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshi|first1=Purna A.|last2=Goodwin|first2=Pamela J.|last3=Khokha|first3=Rama|title=Progesterone Exposure and Breast Cancer Risk|journal=JAMA Oncology|date=16 April 2015|doi=10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0512|volume=1|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The WHI trial was limited by low adherence, high attrition, inadequate power to detect risks for some outcomes, and evaluation of few regimens. Subsequent to publication of the WHI, controversy arose regarding the applicability of its findings to women just entering menopause. To be properly double blinded, the study required that women not be perimenopausal or have symptoms of menopause. As the average age of menopause is 51, this resulted in an older study population, with an average age of 63. Only 3.5% of the women were 50–54 years of age, the time when women usually decide whether to initiate hormonal therapy.  Further analysis of WHI data, however, demonstrated that there is no gained preventive benefit in starting hormone therapy soon after menopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banks|first=E|author2=Canfell, K |title=Invited Commentary: Hormone therapy risks and benefits--The Women's Health Initiative findings and the postmenopausal estrogen timing hypothesis.|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=Jul 1, 2009|volume=170|issue=1|pages=24–8|pmid=19468078|doi=10.1093/aje/kwp113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prentice|first=R.

Most fundamentally, the WHI did not address the major indication for MHT use, relief of symptoms.  On the other hand, the stated goal of the HT component was to test the long-term cardiovascular-protective effects (rather than treatment of menopausal symptoms) of HT in postmenopausal women, which had been supported by previous observational studies in terms of how it reduces atherosclerotic diseases by lowering serum lipid levels and promoting vasodilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Franklin H.|author2=Mendelsohn, Michael E. |author3=Karas, Richard H. |title=The Protective Effects of Estrogen on the Cardiovascular System|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=10 June 1999|volume=340|issue=23|pages=1801–1811|doi=10.1056/NEJM199906103402306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an expert consensus statement from [[The Endocrine Society]], evidence from the WHI trial was weighted less than that of a randomized controlled trial according to the GRADE system criteria because of mitigating factors: large dropout rate; lack of adequate representation of applicable group of women (i.e. those initiating therapy at the time of menopause); and modifying influences from prior hormone use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Santen |first1= RJ|last2=Utian |first2=WH |year= 2010|title=Executive Summary: Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy: An Endocrine Society Scientific Statement |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume= 95 | pages = S1–S66 |issue=Supplement 1 |doi= 10.1210/jc.2009-2509 |url=http://www.endo-society.org/journals/scientificstatements/upload/jc-2009-2509v1.pdf |accessdate=Feb 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the editor of one of the journals which published the results of the WHI called it a "landmark" study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeAngelis|first=Catherine D.|title=Onward|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=22 June 2011|volume=305|issue=24|pages=2575|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.876|quote=we have published important articles such as ... the landmark Women's Health Initiative study}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The double blinding limited validity of study results due to its effects on patient exclusion criteria. The dominant majority of participants were Caucasian, and tended to be slightly overweight and former smokers, with the necessary health risks for which these demographics predispose.  Furthermore, the focus of the WHI study was disease prevention.  Most women take hormone therapy to treat symptoms of menopause rather than for disease prevention and therefore the risks and benefits of hormone therapy in the general population differ from the women included in the WHI.  Despite these concerns, the original findings of the WHI trial have been accepted by reputable journals, and have withstood the scrutiny of subsequent reanalysis of the study data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossouw|first=JE|author2=Manson, JE |author3=Kaunitz, AM |author4= Anderson, GL |title=Lessons learned from the Women's Health Initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=January 2013|volume=121|issue=1|pages=172–6|pmid=23262943|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31827a08c8 |pmc=3547645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whi1&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = H.

'''xDT''' (aka KVDT) is a family of [[data exchange|data exchange format]]s that are used by [[physician]]s and [[health care administration]] in [[Germany]]. They were created by initiative of the ''Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung'' ([[National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians]] - NASHIP).

== Formats ==

As of October 2013 the following formats have been implemented:

* '''ADT''' (''Abrechnungsdatentransfer''): A format for transferring billing data
* '''BDT''' (''Behandlungsdatentransfer''): A format for exchange of complete [[electronic health record]]s among electronic health record software systems
* '''GDT''' (''Gerätedatentransfer''): A format to transfer data among medical devices and software systems
* '''LDT''' (''Labordatenträger''): A format to transfer orders of laboratory tests and their results.
