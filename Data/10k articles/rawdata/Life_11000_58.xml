I've cried to their music. They've definitely changed my life, and saved me from a lot of stuff."&lt;ref name=Corrigan2018/&gt; Shake's recording experience with West in [[Wyoming]] for his ''Ye'' album impacted her thoughts about ''Yellow Girl''; she stated "I don't know if it's going to be called ''Yellow Girl''. I know the songs are definitely changing. The experience I had in Wyoming makes me want to make music on a different level."&lt;ref name=Corrigan2018/&gt;

The '''2005 Andijan Unrest''' occurred when Uzbek [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Uzbekistan)|Interior Ministry]] (MVD) and [[National Security Service (Uzbekistan)|National Security Service]] (SNB) troops fired into a crowd of [[protest]]ers in [[Andijan]] in the [[Republic of Uzbekistan]] on 13 May 2005.&lt;ref name=OSCE&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Findings on the Events in Andijan, Uzbekistan, 13 May 2005|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/15653?download=true|work=Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe|accessdate=7 April 2014|location=Warsaw|date=20 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Documenting&gt;{{cite web|last=Beehner|first=Lionel|title=Documenting Andijan|url=http://www.cfr.org/uzbekistan/documenting-andijan/p10984#6|work=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=7 April 2014|date=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnashev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burnashev|first=Rustam|author2=Irina Chernykh|title=Changes in Uzbekistan's Military Policy after the Andijan Events|journal=China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly|volume=5|issue=I|pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of those killed on 13 May range from 187, the official count of the government, to several hundred.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Usmanova |first=Dilya |title=Andijan: A Policeman's Account |url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/andijan-policemans-account-0 |work=Institute for War and Peace Reporting |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defector from the SNB alleged that 1,500 were killed.&lt;ref name=Donovan&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeffrey|last=Donovan|title=Former Uzbek Spy Accuses Government Of Massacres, Seeks Asylum |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Former_Uzbek_Spy_Seeks_Asylum/1195372.html|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=[[RFE/RL]]|date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of many of those who died were allegedly hidden in [[mass grave]]s following the [[massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Andijan massacre a year after|url=http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/radio/175/2006-05-05/361.asp|work=Columbia Radio News|accessdate=7 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610015311/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/radio/175/2006-05-05/361.asp|archivedate=10 June 2007|date=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uzbek government]] at first said the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] organised the unrest and the protesters were members of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].&lt;ref name=HTIDEN&gt;{{cite web|title=Border situation between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan returns to normal|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/uzbekistan/border-situation-between-uzbekistan-kyrgyzstan-returns-normal|work=ReliefWeb|accessdate=7 April 2014|date=26 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that the [[Islamist]] radical label is just a pretext for maintaining a repressive regime in the country.

It was claimed that calls from [[Western world|Western]] governments for an international investigation prompted a major shift in Uzbek foreign policy favouring closer relations with Asian nations, although the Uzbek government is known to have close ties with the U.S. government, and the Bush administration had declared Uzbekistan to be vital to US security because it hired out a large military base to US military forces. The Uzbek government ordered the closing of the United States air base in [[Karshi-Khanabad Air Base|Karshi-Khanabad]] and improved ties with the People's Republic of China and Russia, who supported the regime's response in Andijan.&lt;ref name=Documenting/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Alex|title=US closes air base in Uzbekistan amid uprising dispute|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2005/11/22/us_closes_air_base_in_uzbekistan_amid_uprising_dispute/|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=22 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial of businessmen==
The protesters initially asked for the release of 23 local businessmen who were arrested on 23 June 2004 and charged with "[[Three Evils|extremism, fundamentalism and separatism]]". The police subsequently charged them with membership in [[Akromiya]], an organization the government has designated and banned as [[terrorist]]. The businessmen denied the charge, saying they were arrested because of their growing support among the local populace.&lt;ref name=CLAN&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav092905.shtml Andijan massacre linked to local power struggle -- source 9/29/05] EurasiaNet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ARRESTINFO&gt;The 23 businessmen are Rasuljon Ajikhalilov, Abdumajit Ibragimov, Abdulboki Ibragimov, Tursunbek Nazarov, Makhammadshokir Artikov, Odil Makhsdaliyev, Dadakhon Nodirov, Shamsitdin Atamatov, Ortikboy Akbarov, Rasul Akbarov, Shavkat Shokirov, Abdurauf Khamidov, Muzaffar Kodirov, Mukhammadaziz Mamdiyev, Nasibillo Maksudov, Adkhamjon Babojonov, Khakimjon Zakirov, Gulomjon Nadirov, Musojon Mirzaboyev, Dilshchodbek Mamadiyev, Abdulvosid Igamov, Shokurjon Shakirov, and Ravshanbek Mazimjonov.

Melissa Hooper, a US lawyer in [[Tashkent]] who worked with the defense in the trial, said on 14 May, "This is more about [the businessmen] acquiring economic clout, and perhaps refusing to pay off the local authorities, than about any religious beliefs." Andrei Grozin, head of the Central Asia and Kazakhstan Department of the Institute of CIS Countries, said in an interview conducted by ''Rossiiskaya gazeta'' that authorities used the trial to "take away the business of several entrepreneurs under a clearly trumped-up pretext".&lt;ref name=GROZIN&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/05/99498e1f-029f-488b-9cda-ac3292ca9e54.html Uzbekistan: Bloody Friday in the Ferghana Valley] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trials, protests in front of the courthouse were common.&lt;ref name="OSCE"/&gt; On 10 May another demonstration occurred involving at least 1,000 people. The protesters, mainly relatives of the defendants, videotaped the demonstration, which the police did not interrupt. Demonstrators lined the streets around the courthouse, with women on one side and men on the other. By 11 May over 4,000 demonstrators had gathered to hear the verdict. Prosecutors had asked for prison terms ranging from three to seven years for 20 of the accused, offering to free the remaining three. However, the government postponed the scheduled sentencing.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt; The government arrested some of the protesters and relatives of the defendants late on 12 May.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCHow"&gt;BBC news, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4550845.stm How the Andijan killings unfolded], 17 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==13 May==
On the night of 12 May or early in the morning of 13 May armed men attacked the prison where the businessmen were held and freed them, along with hundreds of other prisoners, many of whom were charged with similar charges; several prison guards were killed.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Documenting/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCHow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PRISONEST&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/world/20/92/373/15802_andijan.html A truthful report from Uzbekistan's Andijan] Pravda&lt;/ref&gt; The armed men, including the 23 defendants, also took over the regional administration building in Andijan, and took at least twenty law enforcement and government officials hostage, including the Head of the Prosecutors Office and the Chief of the Tax Inspection Authority.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOETAG"/&gt; The militants unsuccessfully tried to seize the National Security Service (SNB) headquarters in the city.&lt;ref name=NSEIZURE&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/world/20/92/373/15462_Uzbekistan.html The revolution in Uzbekistan's Andijan turns out to be narcotic] Pravda&lt;/ref&gt; They demanded the resignation of President [[Islam Karimov]].&lt;ref name=CALLRESIG&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav051305.shtml Dozens killed in Uzbek city, as security forces crush protest in Andijan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408045301/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/eav051305.shtml |date=8 April 2007 }} EurasiaNet&lt;/ref&gt; Karimov's press office said that "intensive negotiations" proved fruitless.

Encouraged by the prison break, even more protesters gathered in the central square to voice their anger over growing poverty and government corruption, speaking at microphones that were installed at [[Babur Square]].&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCHow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MURRAY&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/01/19/1452237 EXCLUSIVE: Ex-British Ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray on why he defied UK Foreign Office by posting classified memos blasting U.S., British support of torture by Uzbek regime] Democracy Now!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520249275&amp;id=H_Sb2S1eAUYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;ots=g10aKcv1xt&amp;dq=Andijan&amp;sig=_B-p1LT1xig7TufPP_PULwamke4#PRA1-PA192,M1 Islam After Communism: Religion And Politics in Central Asia]'', page 192&lt;/ref&gt; Though government officials blocked the roads to Babur Square in the morning, they let people through on foot.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt; Someone (it is unclear who) set fire to the Babur theater and cinema.&lt;ref name="TOETAG"/&gt;

Government soldiers blocked the streets to the prison.&lt;ref name=Documenting/&gt;&lt;ref name=PRISON&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/accidents/21/96/382/15458_andijan.html There are casualties among the civilians; the terrorists ask for Russia's mediation in the conflict] Pravda&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting incidents began in the morning; there was at least one exchange of gunfire between armed civilians and troops.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt; But protesters remained on the square, apparently because of rumors that Karimov was coming to address their demands or because attempts to exit the square or surrender were refused.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;

Around 17:00 or 18:00, the government launched a major offensive on the square without warning.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt; There are reports that the protesters used government hostages as [[human shield]]s in the front row as they tried to escape.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Documenting/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCHow"/&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the government then sealed off the perimeter of the protest and opened fire.

[[Galima Bukharbaeva]], a journalist for [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]], witnessed a "mass of dead and wounded. At first, one group of armoured-personnel carriers approached the [city] square, and then another group appeared. They opened fire without mercy on everyone indiscriminately, including women and children. The crowd began to run in all directions. We dove into a ditch and lay there for a while. I saw at least five bloody corpses next to me. The rebels who are holding the provincial administration opened fire in response. They intend to stand to the end!

The Uzbek government disputes this and states that only "[[Terrorism|terrorists]]" were killed.&lt;ref name="HREPORT"/&gt;

Several foreign news sources estimated the dead in Andijan as numbering between 400 to 600, with civilians accounting for almost all the victims.&lt;ref name=OSCE/&gt;&lt;ref name=MAYHEM&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1614062,00.html Mayhem follows Uzbek massacre] ''The Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports stated that troops had systematically shot the wounded after the first shootings.&lt;ref name="BBCHow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SYS&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=530712005 'They shot us like rabbits'] ''The Scotsman''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uzbek President]] Islam Karimov "placed blame for the unrest on [[Islamic extremist]] groups, a label that he has used to describe political opponents in recent years and that his critics say is used as a pretext for maintaining a repressive state".&lt;ref name="RECKLESS"/&gt; A press release from the government stated that "As a result of the clashes, 9 people died and 34 were injured."&lt;ref name=UZPR&gt;[http://www.gov.uz/en/content.scm?contentId=12614 New update on events in Andizhan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117032830/http://www.gov.uz/en/content.scm?contentId=12614 |date=17 January 2006 }} Republic of Uzbekistan&lt;/ref&gt; The government-controlled [[News media|media]] within the country broadcast only brief statements regarding the crisis. In its news bulletins, Uzbek State TV said "an armed group of criminals" had attacked the security forces in Andijan: "The bandits seized dozens of weapons and moved on to attack a correctional colony, setting some convicts free." Describing the rebels as "extremists", they claimed that nine people had been killed and 34 wounded during the clashes. The local [[radio]] station had reportedly been taken off air. Authorities also blocked foreign TV news channels, including [[CNN]] and the [[BBC News]].&lt;ref name=UZNEWS&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/asia-pacific/4543473.stm Uzbek media clampdown stifles unrest news] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of government involvement===
According to Ikrom Yakubov, a major in Uzbekistan's [[National Security Service (Uzbekistan)|secret service]] who defected to Britain in 2007, the government "propped up" [[Akramia]], which the Uzbek government blamed for fomenting the sparking the incident led to the protests. He believes that the attacks were used as a pretext to repress dissenters. According to Yakubov, President [[Islam Karimov|Karimov]] personally ordered government troops to fire on the protesters.&lt;ref name=Donovan/&gt;

In some accounts, the troops involved in the quelling the uprising were from the Interior Ministry.&lt;ref name=POLACCOUNT&gt;[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news.php?id=14294 Uzbekistan: Andijan Policeman's Account] Turkish Weekly&lt;/ref&gt; Burnashev and Chernykh report that the 12,500 troops involved included the "17th air-assault brigade and a battalion of specialized operations from the Eastern military district ([[Military of Uzbekistan]]); a brigade of rapid reaction forces and a separate battalion of Special Forces "Bars" of the Ministry of Interior's internal troops; and four separate units of Special Forces of the National Security Service."&lt;ref name=Burnashev/&gt;

==Mass graves==
[[Muhammad Solih]], founder and leader of the [[Erk/Liberty Democratic Party]] political party in Uzbekistan, estimated more than a thousand casualties in the massacre. Solih said the bodies were buried in mass graves holding 15 to 20 people each, or were thrown into the [[Karasu River (Central Asia)|Karasu River]]. Between 13–14 May, 18 flights took 35 or more bodies from Andijan out of the city. Solih said, "Andijan is a litmus test for countries who want influence in the region. Russia sees [[Central Asia]] as the source for [[religious extremism]], while China fears a growth of internal [[separatist]]s," but "neither wants to recognize that Karimov gives strength to what they fear". The Chinese and Russian governments' support for the Uzbek government allowed it to avoid an international investigation.&lt;ref name=SALIH&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/releases/2005/07/352-200705.asp Uzbek opposition leader hopes Andijon tragedy will awaken west] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&lt;/ref&gt;

Juraboy, a citizen of Andijan, led a ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'' correspondent to a mass grave on the far end of the city on 27 May 2005. Gravediggers told ''Radio Free Europe'' that 74 bodies were buried in the grave, and that there were 37 more secret graves, each containing two bodies, in the area. Three trucks brought the first bodies on 13 May. On 28 May two people murdered Juraboy. Some families of the deceased found the graves of their relatives, dug up the bodies, and reburied them according to Islamic burial rites. There is another known mass grave outside of Andijan in the botanical gardens in the center of the city. Vitaly Ponomaryov, director of the Central Asia Program at the Moscow-based [[Memorial Human Rights Center]], said, "planes flew out of Andijon beginning late in the evening on 13 May. In the course of 24 hours, there were around 18 flights. Our source for this information doesn't know where they were flying to, but he spoke with an eyewitness who talked about 36 bodies that were loaded into one plane alone."&lt;ref name=JURABOY&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/releases/2005/05/339-300505.asp RFE/RL led to mass grave site in Uzbekistan] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Despite the violent crushing of the protests, the following day thousands reappeared to demonstrate. Huge crowds shouted "killers, murderers", and again demanded the president step down. One man, speaking of the previous days' events, said, "People were raising their hands up in the air showing they were without arms but soldiers were still shooting at them."&lt;ref name=RAISED&gt;[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news.php?id=10194 'High death toll' in Uzbekistan] Journal of Turkish Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May thousands seeking to flee the country stormed government buildings in the eastern frontier town of [[Qorasuv]], 50&amp;nbsp;km east of Andijan.

According to ''The New York Times'', "[T]here were reports of skirmishes in or near Andijon and of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of refugees making their way to Kyrgyzstan. There were indications that the Uzbek government, which normally maintains strict order, did not have full control of a portion of the valley."&lt;ref name=RECKLESS/&gt;

On 16 May several foreign news sources estimated the dead in Andijan as numbering between 400 to 600, with civilians accounting for almost all the victims.&lt;ref name="MAYHEM"/&gt; One report stated that troops had systematically shot the wounded after the first shootings.&lt;ref name="SYS"/&gt; A press release on the same day on the official government website continued to maintain that "As a result of the clashes, 9 people died [sic] and 34 were injured."&lt;ref name="UZPR"/&gt; In 2008, defector Ikrom Yakubov, a major in the SNB at the time of the incident, alleged that 1,500 people were killed – over twice the highest number estimated by outside observers.&lt;ref name=Donovan/&gt;

In October 2005 an Uzbek court found several Kyrgyz citizens guilty of several crimes revolving around involvement in the Andijan massacre.&lt;ref name=KYRCON&gt;[http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2370300 Andijan trial opens in Tashkent with shaky government case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121052647/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2370300 |date=21 November 2006 }} The Jamestown Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The government denied access to observers and refused to identify the defendants as the trial proceeded.&lt;ref name=HRWBlocked&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/30/uzbeki12103.htm Uzbekistan: Access to Andijan trials blocked], Human Rights Watch, 30 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 60-page report based on 50 interviews with victims and witnesses of the Andijan crackdown, [[Human Rights Watch]] said the killing of unarmed protesters by the Uzbek government on 13 May was so extensive and unjustified that it amounted to a massacre.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/uzbekistan0605/|title=Human Rights Watch report|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song ''Anda jonim qoldi mening qo'shiq matni'' ([[English language|English]]: Over There Remains This Soul of Mine") by [[Sherali Jo'rayev]] was popularized by the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grandpoohbah.blogspot.com/2011/02/anda-jonim-qoldi-mening.html|title=Grandpoohbah's Blog: Anda Jonim Qoldi Mening|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uzhits.net/text-pesni/32859-sherali-jorayev-anda-jonim-qoldi-mening-qoshiq-matni.html|title=Sherali Jo'rayev - Anda jonim qoldi mening qo'shiq matni|access-date=2017-02-24|language=ru|newspaper=Скачать музыку бесплатно новинки музыки 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fergananews.com/article.php?id=5089|title=Узбекистан: Народному певцу Шерали Джураеву исполняется шестьдесят лет.

From the poetry of first Mughal emperor [[Babur]], a native to Andijan, the line "Andijonim qoldi mening" (English: "my Andijan remains.") was one of the most used phrases on the [[Uzbek language|Uzbek-language]] internet after the uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/opinion/uzbekistans-forgotten-massacre.html|title=Uzbekistan's Forgotten Massacre|last=Kendzior|first=Sarah|date=2015-05-12|access-date=2017-02-24|issn=0362-4331|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several documentary films have been made about the Andijan uprising and its impact on the lives of those caught up in it. In 2010, the British journalist Monica Whitlock, who was the BBC correspondent in Uzbekistan at the time, made the 55-minute film ''Through the Looking Glass''. The film incorporates testimony from survivors, who speak for the first time five years after the massacre. In 2012, the Danish journalist Michael Andersen completed the 80-minute film ''Massacre in Uzbekistan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massacre-in-uzbekistan.com|title=Massacre in Uzbekistan|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental organizations==
After non-governmental organizations criticized the government's response, non-governmental organizations based in the Western world had their operations in Uzbekistan shut down on charges some analysts have criticized as spurious. In April 2006 an Uzbek court ordered the [[American Bar Association]] to end its activities after it gave funding to local non-governmental organizations. On 26 July an Uzbek court ordered Winrock International, which gave technical expertise to farmers, to leave because the court found it had "denigrated national values".&lt;ref name=WINROCK&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/world/20060726/51877759.html Court in Uzbekistan orders another U.S. NGO out - 1] RIA Novosti&lt;/ref&gt; The Uzbek government ordered Central Asian Free Exchange to leave on 7 July on the grounds that it had an "unregistered logo" and lacked an "internet license". [[Urban Institute]] received an order to shut down on 12 July because their officials discussed "the socioeconomic and sociopolitical situation in Uzbekistan" during a "training session for a homeowner society", a violation of their charter.&lt;ref name=URBANOUT&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/world/20060712/51274552.html Court rules to close U.S. NGO in Uzbekistan] RIA Novosti&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations that were ordered or pressured to leave Uzbekistan shortly after the Andijan massacre include Global Involvement through Education, Ecumenical Charity Service, [[Eurasia Foundation]], [[Freedom House]], the [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]], [[Counterpart International]], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], the American Council for Collaboration in Education and Language Study, Internews Network, [[BBC World Service]], Ezgulik, and the Uzbek branch of the [[UNHCR]].&lt;ref name=TIMELINE/&gt;&lt;ref name=NGOS&gt;[https://archive.is/20130414215020/http://www.globalengage.org/media/article.aspx?id=2046 Aftermath of Andijan: The Challenge of Uzbekistan] Institute for Global Engagement&lt;/ref&gt;

==External reactions==

===European Union===
On 3 October 2005 the [[European Union]] imposed an [[arms embargo]] on Uzbekistan and decided to deny visas to top Uzbek officials, in response to an "excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force", and because of the Uzbek government's opposition to an international investigation into the events.&lt;ref name=EMBARGO&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4306700.stm EU bans arms sales to Uzbekistan] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HRSANCTIONS&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/10/03/uzbeki11812.htm EU imposes sanctions on Uzbekistan over massacre] Human Rights Watch&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006 the EU renewed the sanctions but agreed to resume low-level talks.&lt;ref name=RENEWAL&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6142956.stm EU renews Uzbekistan sanctions] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]] said on 15 May that "there had been a clear abuse of human rights" in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=STRAW&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4548299.stm Uzbek city sealed after clashes] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German Foreign Minister]] [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] met with Uzbek Foreign Minister [[Vladimir Norov]] in March 2007. He told the foreign ministers of the governments of European Union member nations in Brussels on 5 March that the government of Uzbekistan may be willing to let the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] visit prisons in Uzbekistan, hold talks on the Andijan massacre with EU officials, and letting EU officials reexamine human rights cases in return for an end to the sanctions imposed by the EU following the incidents in Andijan.&lt;ref name=STEIN&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/03/f931ebff-67cb-4457-a3b7-2be9d464050f.html Uzbekistan: EU gets promises from Tashkent, postpones decision on sanctions] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&lt;/ref&gt; Steinmeier visited Uzbekistan again from 6–9 April to further assess the effects of the economic sanctions and how to proceed. Uzbek Foreign Minister Vladimir Norov stressed the need to respect Uzbekistan's sovereignty when an EU delegation met with officials from Central Asian governments in [[Astana]], Kazakhstan on 27–28 March. [[Pierre Morel]], the European Union's special representative to Central Asia, said continuing negotiations would be positive.&lt;ref name=OILHR&gt;[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news.php?id=44153 Uzbekistan: Oil and human rights on the table] The Journal of Turkish Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shanghai Cooperation Organisation members===
The [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], composed of Russia, China, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and Uzbekistan, characterized the Andijan massacre as a terrorist plot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/publication/10883 "The Rise of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation"], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/china12270.htm "Human Rights Overview:China"], Human Rights Watch, 18 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The SCO passed resolutions in July 2005 calling for nations to deny asylum to Uzbek refugees from Andijan in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/06/14/eca13545.htm "Eurasia: Uphold Human Rights in Combating Terrorism"], Human Rights Watch, 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Andijan protesters had called for help from [[Vladimir Putin]], but Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] told a press conference after meeting with the foreign ministers of [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]] (CSTO) member nations, "Uzbekistan is not a CSTO member, and we don't interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."&lt;ref name=INTERAFFAIR&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/ACIO-6DLSTB?OpenDocument CSTO to help Uzbekistan fight extremists] Xinhua News Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyrgyzstan, which had recently undergone [[Tulip Revolution|a revolution]], closed its border with Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=PRISON /&gt;

===United States===
When asked about the government's response to the incident, State Department spokesman [[Richard Boucher]] said the U.S. government has been "very consistently critical of the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, we're very concerned about the outbreak of violence in Andijan, in particular the escape of prisoners, including possibly members of the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]], an organization we consider a terrorist organization. I think at this point we're looking to all the parties involved to exercise restraint to avoid any unnecessary loss of life." At another point Boucher said, "It's becoming increasingly clear that very large numbers of civilians were killed by the indiscriminate use of force by Uzbek forces. There needs to be a credible and a transparent accounting to establish the facts of the matter of what occurred in Andijon. At the same time I think it is clear that the episode began by an armed attack on the prison and on other government facilities. There are reports of hostage-taking and other claims that should be investigated. Nothing justified such acts of violence."&lt;ref&gt;''Tamerlane's Children: Dispatches from Contemporary Uzbekistan'', p189&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Murray]], the ambassador of the United Kingdom to Uzbekistan, criticized the US government's position, calling it a "sickening response".&lt;ref name=MURRAY/&gt; [[George Soros]], chairman of the [[Open Society Institute]] which actively promoted the [[color revolution]]s, called the Andijan massacre "one of the worst political crimes committed in the 21st century".&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Culture in Uzbekistan: One Language in the Middle of Nowhere'', page xv&lt;/ref&gt;

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators criticized the State Department's reaction and called for a United Nations investigation: "We believe that the United States must be careful about being too closely associated with a government that has killed hundreds of demonstrators and refused international calls for a transparent investigation."&lt;ref name="SENATORS"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/78490d36-d874-11d9-8fa7-00000e2511c8.html "US senators ask for UN action in Uzbekistan"], [[Financial Times]], 9 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Andijan massacre [[United States State Department]] officials argued in favor of ending all US ties to Uzbekistan, whereas the [[United States Defense Department]] argued that the US should take a look at each program and decide on a case-by-case basis. Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] opposed an international investigation into the incident.&lt;ref name=USPOS&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301550.html|title=U.S. Opposed Calls at NATO for Probe of Uzbek Killings|last=Smith|first=R.

==Clan struggle theory==
One interpretation of the unrest and the preceding trial mainly espoused by Central Asian scholars is an inter-clan struggle between the [[Tashkent clan|Tashkent-Ferghana clan alliance]] and the rival [[Samarkand clan]].&lt;ref name=Burnashev/&gt;&lt;ref name=CLANALLIANCE&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/EC13Ag03.html Uzbek strongman under Russian attack] Asia Times&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2004 the legislative chamber of Andijan's regional government voted to impeach Kobiljon Obidov, the Governor of Andijan and a leading member of the Ferghana clan, replacing him with Saydullo Begaliyev, the former Minister of Agriculture and Water in the national government. Governor Obidov's involvement in several political scandals lost him favor with President Karimov, who personally attended his impeachment proceedings. According to an anonymous source who spoke with ''EurasiaNet'' Obidov "was the province's master... businesses favored by the hokim got the green light for everything. All the entrepreneurs who enjoyed [Obidov's] patronage," including the 23 businessmen, "grew rich". In late 2004 Karimov appointed Ikromkhon Nazhmiddinov, who succeeded Begaliyev as the Minister of Agriculture and Water, Governor of [[Ferghana province]].&lt;ref name=CLAN/&gt;

The source said, "Criminal proceedings were started against many of his [Obidov's] administration members. The new hokim also decided to re-divide the businesses in the province; he cracked down on the entrepreneurs who had been supported by Obidov. They were told to sell their businesses for a pittance either to him [Begaliyev] or his people, or face legal proceedings."&lt;ref name=CLAN/&gt;

Prior to the Andijan massacre the Samarkand clan maintained control over the Interior Ministry under the leadership of Zakir Almatov and the [[Tashkent clan]] controlled the National Security Service under the leadership of Rustam Innoyatov. Rustam Burnashev and Irina Chernykh of the Central Asia-Institute argue that rumors of Karimov's resignation due to ill-health prompted the two leaders to try to seize power. Both leaders considered [[coup d'état]]s in 2004, early 2005, and in mid-2005.&lt;ref name="Burnashev"/&gt;

During the unrest security forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense acted as police forces. Ministry of Interior troops were abolished and counter-terrorism divisions were put under the command of the Ministry of Defense or the National Security Service (SNB), run by the Tashkent clan. Karimov fired Defense Minister Kadyr Gulyamov, Interior Minister Almatov, Head of the Joint Headquarters of the Armed Forces Ismail Ergashev, and Commander of the Eastern military district Kosimali Akhmedov. Karimov replaced Almatov with the deputy director of the SNB, a member of the Tashkent clan. This greatly shifted control of security to the Tashkent clan which has traditionally controlled the SNB.&lt;ref name=Burnashev/&gt;&lt;ref name=IM&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/08/970cdfca-adb7-4c9c-856b-526cef00273b.html Uzbekistan: Karimov appears to have political clans firmly in hand] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts had previously suggested that the Interior Ministry, under Almatov's leadership, had organized the 1999 Tashkent bombings. Others have suggested the bombings were done by the SNB under the leadership of Rustam Inoyatov, who at the time led the Tashkent clan. Analysts suggested a series of bombings in 2004 in Tashkent and [[Bukhara]] may have been done by the SNB against the Interior Ministry.&lt;ref name=BOMBINGS&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/04/51d08217-f03f-4906-9cc7-6224a3cff08b.html Uzbekistan: Islam Karimov vs. The clans] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilyor Jumabayev, a prominent member of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], later said in an interview in [[Kara-Suu]], Kyrgyzstan that in February 2005 SNB agents offered to pay Hizb ut-Tahrir members to overthrow Andijan's government; "But we refused. They said they were sick and tired of Karimov's regime. But we said, 'After Karimov will come another Karimov.' We said such things are sin. We did not participate."&lt;ref name=JUMBAYEV&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/26/AR2005072601662.html|title=Uzbek Refugees Are Forced To Wait Out Diplomatic Storm|last=Vick|first=Karl|date=27 July 2005|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obidov, initially put under [[house arrest]], is now imprisoned in Tashkent. Karimov replaced Begaliyev with Akhmad Usmanov, the former security head of the Interior Ministry of [[Namangan province]], on 13 October 2006.&lt;ref name=CLANNOW&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav101906.shtml Political purge in Uzbekistan indicates president is "afraid of his own nation"] EurasiaNet&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikbol Mirsaitov, a Kyrgyz expert on Islam, said that trial and subsequent unrest "was all about clan struggle".&lt;ref name=MIRSAITOV&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/19/world/asia/19iht-web.0519uzbek.html|title=Uzbek government troops reclaim eastern town|date=19 May 2005|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Anna of Kashin''' ({{lang-ru|Святая благоверная великая княгиня - инокиня Анна Кашинская}}) (1280 – 2 October 1368) was a [[Russia]]n princess from the [[Rurik Dynasty]], who was [[Canonization|canonized]] in 1650.

==Life==

Anna was a daughter of [[Prince Dmitry Borisovich]] of [[Rostov]] and a great-granddaughter of [[Vasilko Konstantinovich|Prince Vasily]] of Rostov.  From her earliest years, Anna was brought up strictly [[Christian]]. She was taught the virtues of humility and obedience. Her teacher was Saint Ignatius, Bishop of Rostov (died 1288), who was noted for strict selflessness and pacifism. Like all royal daughters of her time, Anna learned different kinds of needlework. When the princess grew up, Princess [[Xenia of Tarusa|Xenia of Tver]], second wife of Grand Prince [[Yaroslav III|Yaroslav of Tver]] sent ambassadors to Rostov with a request to marry Anna to her son [[Mikhail of Tver|Mikhail]]. The embassy was successful, and Anna became the wife of Prince Mikhail.

Princess Anna's marriage to Prince Mikhail took place on 8 November 1294 in the Preobrazhensky cathedral of [[Tver]]. In celebration of this event, dwellers in the city of [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]] built the Saint Michael Church and the triumphal gates from the local [[Kremlin]] to the Tver road, naming the gates also "Mikhaylovsky." In the Kashin Uspensky cathedral a special Feast was established and celebrated annually on 8 November.

Anna and Mikhail had five children:
# Feodora (died in infancy)
# Prince [[Dmitry of Tver]] (1299–1326)
# Prince [[Alexander of Tver]] (1301–1339)
# Prince [[Konstantin of Tver]] (1306–1346)
# Prince [[Vasily of Kashin]] (d. after 1368)

In 1294, her father died, and in 1295 a terrible fire destroyed Tver. Soon after that, Anna and Mikhail's first-born daughter, Feodora, fell severely ill and died in infancy. In 1296, another fire destroyed their palace, and the prince and princess were barely rescued. In 1317, a war began between her husband and Prince [[Yury of Moscow]].

In 1318 the princess said goodbye to her husband forever, who was summoned to the [[Golden Horde|Horde]], where he was brutally tortured to death on 22 November 1318. Only in July of the following year did Anna hear about her husband's martyrdom. Learning that Mikhail's remains had been brought to [[Moscow]], she sent an embassy there, and her husband's body was transferred into Tver and buried in Preobrazhensky cathedral.

In 1325, her eldest son, Dimitry, was tortured in the Horde.  In 1327, her second son, Alexander, broke the Tartar army, which devastated the duchy. In revenge [[Uzbeg Khan]] gathered a new army and destroyed Tver; Prince Alexander was forced to hide in [[Pskov]]. For ten years, Anna did not see her son, and in 1339 Prince Alexander and his son Feodor were killed by the Horde.

After the death of Prince Mikhail, Anna carried out an old desire "in silence to work only for God." She took vows in Sofia's monastery in Tver and adopted the name Evfrosiniya. In 1365 the youngest son of the princess, Vasiliy, her only child remaining alive by that time, entreated his mother to move to his principality. The Uspensky monastery was built in Kashin, and there the saint accepted the schema with the name of Anna.

She died of old age on 2 October 1368, and was buried in the cathedral temple of the Blessed Virgin.

==Canonization==
[[File:Anna of Kashin (icon).jpg|thumb|120px|Icon of Holy Anna of Kashin]]

The name of the Princess Anna was forgotten for many centuries. It was during the 1611 siege of Kashin by [[Lithuania]]n troops that Anna appeared to Gerasim, Sexton of the Dormition Cathedral, and it is said that she prayed to the Saviour and [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] for the deliverance of her city from the foreigners. Her relics were reported to work miracles.

The [[synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] convened in 1649 and declared her relics worthy of a universal homage. The princess was glorified as a saint. Twenty-eight years later, Patriarch [[Patriarch Joachim of Moscow|Joachim]] addressed the Moscow Synod with a suggestion to decanonize her because of the uncommon veneration and esteem for Anna among the [[Old Believers]].

It was traditionally thought the Old Believers chose Anna as their palladium because the princess was represented on icons as making the [[Sign of the Cross]] with two fingers, as the Old Believers practiced, rather than with three, as official church policy required after [[Patriarch Nikon]] in 1656. However, writings used by the Old Believers show that one of the reasons they venerated her so highly was that her incorrupt body, on display, showed her hand in the two-fingered [[Sign of the Cross]] favoured by the Old Believers, vindicating their stance. Despite  numerous efforts of the Church authorities to "correct" the situation, her hand always went back to the same two-fingered position. In response, Patriarch Joachim removed the relics of Anna from public view.

Grand Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Joachim collected, held in Moscow from January to February 1678 [[decanonization]] Anna of Kashin: forbade her to pray, and allowed only pray for her - by her serve memorial service.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Московский собор (1678)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 12 June 1909 that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] glorified Anna again and sanctioned a general celebration of her cult. That year a monastic community was dedicated to her in [[Grozny]]. A year later, a church was consecrated in her name in [[St Petersburg]].

'''Biological constraints''' are factors which make [[population]]s resistant to [[evolution]]ary change. One proposed definition of constraint is "A property of a trait that, although possibly adaptive in the environment in which it originally evolved, acts to place limits on the production of new phenotypic variants."&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, S. P., and T. Garland. 2002. Tempo and mode in evolution: phylogenetic inertia, adaptation and comparative methods. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 15:899–910.&lt;/ref&gt;  Constraint has played an important role in the development of such ideas as [[homology (biology)|homology]] and [[body plan]]s.

== Types of constraint==
Any aspect of an organism that has not changed over a certain period of time could be considered to provide evidence for "constraint" of some sort. To make the concept more useful, it is therefore necessary to divide it into smaller units. First, one can consider the pattern of constraint as evidenced by [[phylogenetic]] analysis and the use of [[phylogenetic comparative methods]]; this is often termed [[Phylogenetic Inertia|phylogenetic inertia]], or phylogenetic constraint. It refers to the tendency of related taxa sharing traits based on phylogeny.  Charles Darwin spoke of this concept in his 1859 book "[[On the Origin of Species]]", as being "Unity of Type" and went on to explain the phenomenon as existing because organisms do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new taxa due to these constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On The Origin of Species|last = Darwin|first = Charles|publisher =|year = 1859|isbn =|location =|pages = Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If one sees particular features of organisms that have not changed over rather long periods of time (many generations), then this could suggest some constraint on their ability to change (evolve). However, it is not clear that mere documentation of lack of change in a particular character is good evidence for constraint in the sense of the character being unable to change. For example, long-term [[stabilizing selection]] related to stable environments might cause [[Punctuated_equilibrium#Stasis|stasis]].  It has often been considered more fruitful, to consider constraint in its causal sense: what are the causes of lack of change?

===Stabilizing selection===
The most common explanation for biological constraint is that [[stabilizing selection]] acts on an organism to prevent it changing, for example, so that it can continue to function in a tightly-defined [[ecological niche|niche]]. This may be considered to be a form of external constraint, in the sense that the organism is constrained not by its makeup or genetics, but by its environment. The implication would be that if the population was in a new environment, its previously constrained features would potentially begin to evolve.

===Functional coupling and physico-chemical constraint===
Related to the idea of [[stabilizing selection]] is that of the requirement that organisms function adequately in their environment. Thus, where stabilizing selection acts because of the particular niche that is occupied, mechanical and physico-chemical constraints act in a more general manner. For example, the acceleration caused by [[gravity]] places constraints on the minimum [[bone]] [[density]] and [[Physical_strength|strength]] for an animal of a particular size. Similarly, the properties of [[water]] mean that tissues must have certain [[osmotic]] properties in order to function properly.

Functional coupling takes the idea that organisms are integrated networks of functional interactions (for example, the vertebral column of [[vertebrate]]s is involved in the muscle, nerve, and vascular systems as well as providing support and flexibility) and therefore cannot be radically altered without causing severe functional disruption. This may be viewed as one type of [[trade-off]]. As [[Rupert Riedl]] pointed out, this degree of functional constraint — or burden — generally varies according to position in the organism. Structures literally in the centre of the organism — such as the vertebral column — are often more burdened than those at the periphery, such as hair or toes.

===Lack of genetic variation and developmental integration===
This class of constraint depends on certain types of phenotype not being produced by the genotype (compare stabilizing selection, where there is no constraint on what is produced, but rather on what is naturally selected). For example, for a highly homozygous organism, the degree of observed phenotypic variability in its descendents would be lower than those of a heterozygous one. Similarly, developmental systems may be highly [[canalization (genetics)|canalised]], to prevent the generation of certain types of variation.

==Relationships of constraint classes==
Although they are separate, the types of constraints discussed are nevertheless relatable to each other. In particular, stabilizing selection, mechanical, and physical constraints might lead through time to developmental integration and canalisation. However, without any clear idea of any of these mechanisms, deducing them from mere patterns of stasis as deduced from phylogenetic patterns or the [[fossil record]] remains problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Brakefield, P. M., and J. C. Roskam. 2006. Exploring evolutionary constraints is a task for an integrative evolutionary biology. American Naturalist 168(supplement):S4-S13.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the terminology used to describe constraints has led to confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Antonovics, J., and P. H. van Tienderen. 1991. Ontoecogenophyloconstraints? The chaos of constraint terminology. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 6:166–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coroners Act 2006''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] which completely reformed the Coronal services and introduced the office of Chief Coroner and clarified matters related the working conditions of coroners and their remuneration.
 
Coroners inquests in [[New Zealand]] are [[inquisitorial]] rather than [[adversarial]]; they are fact-finding exercises rather than methods of apportioning guilt.&lt;ref name=MacLean2012&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacLean, Neil |year=2012 |title=An Inquisitorial Cuckoo in an Adversarial Nest: Five Years of Coronial Reform in New Zealand |journal=Hearsay |url=http://www.hearsay.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1486&amp;Itemid=203 |accessdate=2013-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was prompted by a 2000 [[New Zealand Law Commission]] report which recommended a number of changes.

'''Sir Edward Rayne''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CVO|FRSA}} (19 August 1922 – 7 February 1992) was head of [[Rayne (shoe company)|H. &amp; M. Rayne]] (often simply known as Rayne), one of the foremost British manufacturers of high-end and couture shoes. With a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] to both the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]], Rayne shoes were worn by high society and film stars.&lt;ref name="FTM Rayne"&gt;{{cite web |title=An Afternoon with Rayne Shoes |url=http://ftmlondon.org/talk-event/an-afternoon-with-rayne-shoes/ |publisher=ftmlondon.org |accessdate=1 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612002849/http://ftmlondon.org/talk-event/an-afternoon-with-rayne-shoes/ |archivedate=12 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his stewardship H. &amp; M. Rayne took a stake in [[Genesco]] – then the largest shoe company in the world – secured licensing deals with [[Bergdorf Goodman]] and [[Bonwit Teller]] and encouraged British designers to embark on [[franchising]]. Having served a long apprenticeship in making shoes at the family firm, he was also a skilled designer – [[Jean Muir]] described him as the best British shoemaker of his age.&lt;ref name="SI Rayne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rayne, Edward|url=http://eng.shoe-icons.com/museum/select_designer.htm?designer=107:|website=eng.shoe-icons.com|publisher=Shoe Icons Publishing|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayne served on the boards of [[Debenhams]] and [[Harvey Nichols]] (director and chairman respectively) and was a high-profile ambassador for British fashion; he was chair of the [[Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers]] (IncSoc) and its successor the [[British Fashion Council]] (BFC), as well as working for numerous other trade and industry bodies. He did much to place [[London Fashion Week]] on the international map; his ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' obituary said: "If any single man persuaded American fashion buyers and correspondents to take London Fashion Week seriously, it was Rayne".&lt;ref name="The Guardian Driver"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Driver|first1=Christopher|title=Obituary: If the shoe fits, sell it|work=The Guardian|date=8 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Eddie Rayne, he was a talented [[Contract bridge|bridge]] player, representing England at the age of 21 and becoming European Bridge Champion at the age of 26.&lt;ref name=EBU&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Edward Rayne|url=http://www.ebu.co.uk/biographies/sir-edward-rayne|publisher=ebu.co.uk|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interview shortly before he took up his role as chairman of the BFC also noted his facility with other card games: "He is the Sky Masterson of Mayfair. As a colleague said: 'Nobody beats Eddie at poker'."&lt;ref name="The Guardian McDowell 101085"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDowell|first1=Colin|title=Nicely-Nicely Rambo: London Fashion Week Starts Today Amid Confusion|work=The Guardian|date=10 October 1985|ref=pg.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Edward Rayne was born in the United States – his mother Meta (née Reddish) came from [[New York State]] and met his British father Joseph Rayne in Italy, where she was training to be an opera singer.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Sir Edward Rayne|issue=64251.|work=The Times|date=10 February 1992|ref=pg.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Rayne was heir to the shoe side of the family business, which was founded in 1889 as a theatrical costumier by Henry and Mary Rayne and located close to [[The Old Vic]]. Opening a store in [[Bond Street]] in 1920, Joseph cashed in on the trend for shoes as a fashion (rather than simply practical) item and by 1928 the company had become a [[Public Limited Company|PLC]].&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt;

Edward Rayne was educated at [[Harrow School]] but left at the age of 16 because his eyesight was threatened by [[cataract]]s in both eyes. His sight was saved following surgery.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt; The thick pebble glasses he needed for the rest of his life also became his trademark – an obituary writer compared him to [[Mr Magoo]], while [[Colin McDowell]] described him as looking like a character from a [[Robert Smith Surtees|Surtees]] novel. Physical comparisons were also drawn with [[Sergeant Bilko]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian Driver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian McDowell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDowell|first1=Colin|title=Appreciation: Edward Rayne – Shoes and Shine|work=The Guardian|date=10 February 1992|ref=pg.33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian JR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=R.|first1=J.|title=Rayne and Shine|work=The Guardian|date=20 June 1988|ref=pg.38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was excused from active service in the [[World War II|war]] because of this, and began a long apprenticeship at H. &amp; M. Rayne's factory in [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]]. His obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' noted that he would arrive at 7.45&amp;nbsp;am every morning to learn the 200 steps required to make a pair of high-end shoes.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt; While his apprenticeship was intense, Rayne found time to master the game of bridge; he was known as Eddie as a bridge player, represented his country at the age of 21 and was part of the winning team that won both the 1948 and 1949 European championships.&lt;ref name="EBU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt;

===Promotion to chairman===
Joseph Rayne died in 1952 and, at the age of 29, Edward Rayne became chairman of the family firm.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt;

He had inherited a company that was very much part of the British society dress code. It had acquired the first of its Royal Warrants to [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and its early customers also included [[Lillie Langtry]]. A pair of flat [[Ballet shoes|pumps]] with a bow originally designed for the actress [[Gertrude Lawrence]] remained the company's best-selling line for 50 years, worn by society and theatricals alike.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt;

The company was active as an exporter – its shoes were sold to 12 countries – and had high-profile clients such as [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Ava Gardner]] and [[Rita Hayworth]] who were paying up to £40 for a pair of Rayne shoes.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt; Edward Rayne was able to capitalise on that existing foothold – and his Stateside roots – and a decade after he took over the firm he established a joint venture with US shoe firm [[Frost Bros.|Delman]], giving Rayne a presence in New York's [[Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt; The Rayne link with Delman went back to the 1930s;&lt;ref name="The Times 47314"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Capital for Boot and Shoe Company|issue=47314|work=The Times|date=4 March 1936|ref=pg.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rayne's 1954 review to shareholders noted that the company's three shops, Rayne and Delman in Bond Street and Rayne in [[Regent Street]] had produced record profits.&lt;ref name="The Times 52820"&gt;{{cite news|title=H. &amp; M. Rayne: Mr Edward Rayne's Review|issue=52820|work=The Times|date=4 January 1954|ref=pg.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s developments==
Edward Rayne expanded the Rayne business in the early 1960s, beginning an association with Genesco in the United States and also buying a 49 per cent stake in the British company of John Plant and its subsidiary Butlers.&lt;ref name="The Times 55171"&gt;{{cite news|title=Company News|issue=55171|work=The Times|date=28 August 1961|ref=pg.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rayne still designed shoes himself – his ebony brown patent leather design was mentioned in a ''Times'' report about the autumn fashion show of IncSoc members. Rayne was, by then both chair and associate member of the group of elite London couturiers.&lt;ref name="The Times 54832"&gt;{{cite news|title=Autumn Designs for London Couturiers|issue=54832|work=The Times|date=25 July 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a member of the [[Export Council for Europe]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="The Times 55506."&gt;{{cite news|title=Exports to Europe Increased|issue=55506.|work=The Times|date=26 September 1962|ref=pg.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayne enlisted the help of leading stage designer [[Oliver Messel]] for the new Delman shoe store that opened in Old Bond Street in 1960. This was a radical retailing concept for the time because, whereas upmarket shoe stores had been discreet enclaves dressed with curtains and pot plants, with shoes consigned to underground stores, this refit incorporated display stands and cases, some of them illuminated, to show off hundreds of pairs of shoes. An article by [[Alison Settle]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' noted that: "Mr Messel and Mr Rayne are at one in thinking that shoes to buy should be as easy to see and handle as books in a library".&lt;ref name="The Observer Settle"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Settle|first1=Alison|title=Reading the Name in the Shoes|work=The Observer|date=1 May 1960|ref=pg.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued the Rayne brand's reputation for luxury; [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]]'s white satin wedding shoes (along with the Queen and Queen Mother's shoes) were all Rayne models.&lt;ref name="The Times 54765."&gt;{{cite news|title=Gossamer Silk in Wedding Dress|issue=54765.|work=The Times|date=7 May 1960|ref=pg.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times 54764"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dresses for the Abbey: Dignified Simplicity of the Queen's Dress|issue=54764|work=The Times|date=6 May 1960|ref=pg.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, the shoes designed by [[Roger Vivier]] for [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior]] were made at Rayne's UK factory and personally supervised by Edward Rayne.&lt;ref name="The Observer Settle"/&gt; Four years later, Vivier began selling Rayne brand shoes in his Rue François store in Paris, and the straight set back heel Rayne had introduced a year earlier was, he told ''The Guardian'', "fashion right" and included across the Rayne and Miss Rayne lines.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Tinling"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tinling|first1=Teddy|title=View of Fashion|work=The Guardian|date=21 February 1964|ref=pg.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While high-end and haute couture were part of the company's pedigree, Edward Rayne always had an eye on the more mainstream direction of fashion – he was the first to display [[Mary Quant]] shoes in his flagship store, placing them alongside those of Roger Vivier. He also gained a foothold in the mass market, ensuring the company had an interest in both H.E. Randall and Lotus chainstores.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt; By 1966, he was managing what were known as 'Young Design quartet' – Jean Muir, Roger Nelson, [[Moya Bowler]] and [[Gerald McCann (fashion designer)|Gerald McCann]] – capitalising on London's thirst for younger designers by getting them to design fashionable shoes in a more affordable price bracket, with designs being sold in [[Harrods]] and some high-street shoe shops.&lt;ref name="Guardian McCarthy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacCarthy|first1=Fiona|title=Shoe Group|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 1966|ref=pg.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s and beyond==
Edward Rayne continued to work with haute couture brands in both the UK and overseas. By 1970, Rayne shoes were included in the [[Edward Molyneux|Molyneux]] collection – with ''The Guardian'' reporting that it was thought to be the first time a French couture house had used branded British shoes. In autumn of that year, Rayne opened its own store in Paris – said to be the first shoemaker to do so since [[John Lobb Bootmaker|Lobb]].&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian 210770"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aldburgham|first1=Alison|title=Story by Alison Adburgham drawings by May Routh|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 1970|ref=pg.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rayne was also designing shoes for other French designers, including [[Nina Ricci (brand)|Nina Ricci]] and [[Lanvin (company)|Lanvin]], while in the UK it had recruited designers such as [[Bill Gibb]].&lt;ref name="FTM Rayne"/&gt;

In 1975, Rayne was sold to the department-store chain Debenhams, at which point Edward Rayne joined the boards of Debenhams and Harvey Nichols.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt; Two years later, he was made a [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] by the Queen.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt; By 1980, Rayne shoes were exported to 16 countries and Edward Rayne was chair of the multiple fashion division of Debenhams, which included worldwide Rayne-Delman shoe shops.&lt;ref name="PBDN Sobotka"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sobotka|first1=Jon|title=He's A Shoo-In for Cobbler of the Year|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1961&amp;dat=19800214&amp;id=ZoQhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jYwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=956,3425095&amp;hl=en|accessdate=9 June 2015|publisher=Palm Beach Daily News|date=14 February 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debenhams was sold to [[Arcadia Group|Burton Group]] in 1985, and two years later Rayne was acquired by the businessman David Graham. Edward Rayne then resigned and focused on his other roles. He was recruited by [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] as a consultant for its growing shoe range.&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt; He also continued to act as a consultant to Harvey Nichols.&lt;ref name="The Times 63107"&gt;{{cite news|title=Honours all round|issue=63107|work=The Times|date=14 June 1988|ref=pg.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was knighted in 1988 for services to the fashion industry – France had awarded him its equivalent (a ''chevalier'') four years earlier.&lt;ref name="Who's Who Rayne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rayne, Sir Edward|publisher=ukwhoswho.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times 64251"/&gt;

==Other roles==
Rayne was active in various national industry bodies, notably serving on the Export Council of Europe between 1962 and 1971 and the Franco British Council between 1980 and 1988.&lt;ref name="Who's Who Rayne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rayne, Sir Edward|publisher=ukwhoswho.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was active too within industry-specific bodies, serving as president of the British Footwear Manufacturers' Association and the British Boot and Shoe Institution.&lt;ref name="Who's Who Rayne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rayne, Sir Edward|publisher=ukwhoswho.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his national honours, he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1971 and was made Master of the Worshipful Company of Pattern Makers in 1981, one of the [[Livery company|livery companies]] of the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name="Who's Who Rayne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rayne, Sir Edward|publisher=ukwhoswho.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WCPM&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Masters|url=http://www.pattenmakers.co.uk/masters.asp|publisher=patternmakers.co.uk|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IncSoc and British Fashion Council===
In 1960, Rayne became chairman of IncSoc, the first chair not drawn from the world of couture garment design – significant since normally IncSoc was presided over by a fashion designer, not an accessories maker.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Driver"/&gt; His businesslike approach was to serve the society well, as noted in a 1985 article: "Rayne's great success with the Incorporated Society was in raising money. Courtauld's [sic] were major patrons and donated £10,000 per year". [[Courtaulds]] was a major boost – funding IncSoc for a decade – but Rayne also brought in the foreign orders, chartering a plane from Paris to capture the US buyers who had hitherto bypassed London. He would later say that British designers didn't capitalise on all the opportunities brought about by the [[Swinging London]] publicity: "As a country, we blew the sixties, threw them away! The designers had the British disease, they couldn't understand the delicate balance between commerce and design".&lt;ref name="The Guardian McDowell 101085"/&gt;

After IncSoc petered out, Rayne formed part of the self-appointed collective – along with ''[[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor [[Beatrix Miller]], former war correspondent and diplomat's wife [[Nicholas Henderson|Lady Henderson]], Jean Muir and [[Terence Conran]] – who enlisted the support of the British government and high-profile figures for the promotion of British fashion; this included assistance from [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]], who became a high-profile clothes-horse for British designs, handed out awards and hosted a reception at [[Kensington Palace]] to celebrate fashion's high flyers. Rayne was a natural fit for chair of the British Fashion Council. As ''The Times'' put it in 1988, he: "marshalled London's notoriously independent-minded designers into a united team, harnessed their creative energy to the financial support provided by the industry's largest clothing manufacturers and retail groups, and provided back up services to those designers who need them".&lt;ref name="The Times 63207"&gt;{{cite news|title=London fashion: who does what|issue=63207|work=The Times|date=8 October 1988|ref=pg.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Edward Rayne was killed in a fire at his home in [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]], East Sussex on 7 February 1992. He was 69. His wife Morna was injured but survived. Both his sons continued the family association with shoemaking.&lt;ref name="The Times 64250."&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-stores chief dies in fire|issue=64250.|work=The Times|date=8 February 1992|ref=pg.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His obituaries not only singled out his business acumen but also his good humour. Colin McDowell said that almost uniquely for a personality in the centre of the fashion industry, no journalist ever had a bad word to say about him.&lt;ref name="The Guardian McDowell"/&gt; He was also held in affection by the British couturiers he promoted. [[Norman Hartnell]] used to send Christmas cards bearing the inscription: 'to the cobbler from the Little Woman Round The Corner'.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Driver"/&gt;

The contribution of H. &amp; M. Rayne – especially under Edward Rayne's leadership – was showcased in an exhibitions held at the [[Fashion and Textile Museum]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="FTM exhibition note"&gt;{{cite web|title=RAYNE shoes for stars|url=http://ftmlondon.org/ftm-exhibitions/rayne-shoes-for-stars/|publisher=ftmlondon.org|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rayne shoes are held in several archives, including the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in New York and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London. A portrait of Rayne by [[Howard Coster]] forms part of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] archive.&lt;ref name="NPG Rayne/Coster"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Edward Rayne (1922–1992), Footwear designer and manufacturer|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp129794/sir-edward-rayne?search=sas&amp;sText=Edward+Rayne|publisher=npg.org.uk|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elisabeth Freeman''' (September 12, 1876 &amp;ndash; February 27, 1942) was an American suffragist and civil rights activist, best known for her investigative report for the [[NAACP]] on the May 1916 spectacle [[lynching of Jesse Washington]] in [[Waco, Texas]], known as the "Waco Horror". In addition, she was active in suffragist conventions and activities, known for her participation in the 1913 [[Suffrage Hike]] from New York City to Washington, D.C. Born in England, she had immigrated as a child to the United States with her mother and siblings, and lived in her early years in an orphanage.

==Biography==
Elisabeth Freeman was born in England in 1876 to Mary Hall Freeman, who was estranged from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Patricia|title=The First Waco Horror: The Lynching of Jesse Washington and the Rise of the NAACP|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ecm82CkRZX4C&amp;pg=PA216|year=2006|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|location=College Station|isbn=978-1-58544-544-8|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth was the younger sister of [[Jane Freeman (artist)|Jane Freeman]], who became a notable artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Freeman Is Dead at 92; Portraitist Painted Schweitzer|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0CE4D61F3EE23BBC4B51DFBF668388679EDE&amp;legacy=true|accessdate=June 19, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=September 23, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth, her mother, and siblings Clara (Jane) and John moved to the United States, where they lived on [[Long Island]], New York. Mary worked for St. Johnland orphanage, where her children lived for a while.&lt;ref name=ef&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elizabethfreeman.org/ |title=Elisabeth Freeman |accessdate=2008-12-15 |quote=Elisabeth Freeman came to this country as a small child with her brother John and sister (Clara) Jane, and their mother, Mary Hall Freeman, who came estranged from her husband. Mary worked for St. Johnland, an orphanage on Long Island for a time, and the children lived at the orphanage for some time. ... |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Growing up poor, Elisabeth Freeman gained only a limited education. She was said to have found only her activities for [[The Salvation Army]] to be "uplifting".&lt;ref name=scrap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elizabethfreeman.org/|title=An Interactive Scrapbook of Elisabeth Freeman: Suffragette, Civil Rights Worker, and Militant Pacifist. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman moved for a time back to [[London]], where she helped a woman who was beaten by a policeman; both women were arrested after the confrontation. This woman brought Freeman into the [[Women's suffrage|suffrage movement]], within which she learned the arts of campaigning, including public speaking, media work and recruitment.&lt;ref name=scrap/&gt; Having developed such skills in London, Freeman used them after returning to the US, where she was employed by the suffrage movement.&lt;ref name=scrap/&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Freeman (suffragist) d6db2bf1ce o.jpg|thumb|Elisabeth Freeman in 1913]]
A notable example of Freeman's activism occurred in 1913, when she took part in the national [[Suffrage Hikes|Suffrage Hike]] to the inauguration of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=ef/&gt; As a publicity stunt for a New York City suffrage march, she wore a [[Romani people|gypsy]] costume and drove a wagon stenciled with 'Votes for Women' slogans and piled with women's suffrage literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9803/suffrage.html |title=Marching for the Vote |accessdate=2008-12-15 |quote=One of the New York group, Elisabeth Freeman, dressed as a gypsy and drove a yellow, horse-drawn wagon decorated with Votes for Women symbols and filled with pro-suffrage literature, a sure way to attract publicity. |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended a statewide suffrage convention in [[Dallas, Texas]] in May 1916. A crowd of 10,000 witnessed the brutal [[lynching of Jesse Washington]], a young African-American farmhand convicted of murder in [[Waco, Texas]]. The NAACP contacted Freeman, hiring her to investigate and report on the murder and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Wade Goodwyn]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5401868 |title=Waco Recalls a 90-Year-Old 'Horror' |accessdate=2010-09-08|date=May 13, 2006 |quote=On May 16, 1916, one day after the lynching of Jesse Washington, Royal Freeman Nash, the white social worker who was then secretary of the NAACP, wired Elisabeth Freeman in Fort Worth, where she remained following the statewide suffrage convention in Dallas. |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For a week, claiming to be a reporter, she talked to both African Americans and whites in Waco about the events. Her report on the lynching to [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was used by the NAACP to publicize the case and garner national attention over the outrage of lynching American citizens. Their campaign helped establish the organization as a force for civil rights. In this period the NAACP was based in New York City; it hanged banners outside its office publicizing lynchings. Its attorneys became involved in the defense of numerous African Americans in cases across the country.

[[File:Freeman NAACP 1.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Freeman speaking at NAACP]]
In the years between 1917 and 1919, when the United States was involved in the [[Great War]] (World War I) in Europe, Freeman was active for the peace movement. She lobbied Congress and also continued her work fighting for the cause of civil rights. Speaking up against US policies concerning the war generated strong reactions in opposition.

Freeman owned an antique store in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] from 1925 until 1937, when she moved to [[Pasadena, California]] for health reasons.&lt;ref name=scrap/&gt; She died of [[pleurisy]] in February 1942.&lt;ref name=ef/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23723">{{Duplication|dupe=Frame (artificial intelligence)|date=June 2015}}

A '''frame language''' is a technology used for [[knowledge representation]] in [[artificial intelligence]]. Frames are stored as [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] of [[Set theory|sets]] and subsets of the [[Frame (artificial intelligence)|frame concepts]]. They are similar to class hierarchies in [[object-oriented languages]] although their fundamental design goals are different. Frames are focused on explicit and intuitive representation of knowledge whereas objects focus on [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] and [[information hiding]]. Frames originated in AI research and objects primarily in [[software engineering]]. However, in practice the techniques and capabilities of frame and object-oriented languages overlap significantly.

==Description==
Early work on Frames was inspired by psychological research going back to the 1930s that indicated people use stored stereotypical knowledge to interpret and act in new cognitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=F.C.|title=Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology|year=1932|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term Frame was first used by [[Marvin Minsky]] as a paradigm to understand visual reasoning and natural language processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=The Psychology of Computer Vision|year=1975|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|pages=211–277|editor=Pat Winston|chapter=A Framework for Representing Knowledge|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6089/AIM-306.pdf?%20sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these and many other types of problems the potential solution space for even the smallest problem is huge. For example, extracting the phonemes from a raw audio stream or detecting the edges of an object. Things which seem trivial to humans are actually quite complex. In fact, how difficult they really were was probably not fully understood until AI researchers began to investigate the complexity of getting computers to solve them.

The initial notion of Frames or Scripts as they were also called is that they would establish the context for a problem and in so doing automatically reduce the possible search space significantly. The idea was also adopted by Schank and Abelson who used it to illustrate how an AI system could process common human interactions such as ordering a meal at a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schank|first=Roger|title=Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding|year=1977|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, New Jersey|author2=R. P. Abelson|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2007-0-06021-9&amp;isbn=9781134919666&amp;format=googlePreviewPdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These interactions were standardized as Frames with slots that stored relevant information about each Frame. Slots are analogous to object properties in object-oriented modeling and to relations in entity-relation models. Slots often had default values but also required further refinement as part of the execution of each instance of the scenario. I.e., the execution of a task such as ordering at a restaurant was controlled by starting with a basic instance of the Frame and then instantiating and refining various values as appropriate. Essentially the abstract Frame represented an object class and the frame instances an object instance. In this early work the emphasis was primarily on the static data descriptions of the Frame. Various mechanisms were developed to define the range of a slot, default values, etc. However, even in these early systems there were procedural capabilities. One common technique was to use "triggers" (similar to the database concept of triggers) attached to slots. A trigger was simply procedural code that was attached to a slot. The trigger could fire either before and/or after a slot value was accessed or modified.

As with object classes, Frames were organized in [[Subsumption relation|subsumption]] hierarchies. For example, a basic frame might be ordering at a restaurant. An instance of that would be Joe goes to McDonald's. A specialization (essentially a [[Subclass (computer science)|subclass]]) of the restaurant frame would be a frame for ordering at a fancy restaurant. The fancy restaurant frame would inherit all the default values from the restaurant frame but also would either add more slots or change one or more of the default values (e.g., expected price range) for the specialized frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feigenbaum|first=Edward|title=The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence, Volume III|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0201118114|pages=216–222|url=https://archive.org/stream/handbookofartific01barr#page/156/mode/2up|author2=Avron Barr|date=September 1, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobrow|first=D.G.|author2=Terry Winograd|title=An Overview of KRL: A Knowledge Representation Language|journal=Cognitive Science|year=1977|volume=1|pages=3–46|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0101_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the early Frame language research (e.g. Schank and Abelson) had been driven by findings from experimental psychology and attempts to design knowledge representation tools that corresponded to the patterns humans were thought to use to function in daily tasks. These researchers were less interested in mathematical formality since they believed such formalisms were not necessarily good models for the way the average human conceptualizes the world. The way humans use language for example is often far from truly logical.

Similarly, in linguistics, [[Charles J. Fillmore]] in the mid-1970s started working on his theory of [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]], which later would lead to computational resources like [[FrameNet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lakoff|first=George|title=Charles Fillmore, Discoverer of Frame Semantics, Dies in SF at 84: He Figured Out How Framing Works|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-lakoff/charles-fillmore-discover_b_4807590.html|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frame semantics was motivated by reflections on human language and human cognition.

Researchers such as [[Ron Brachman]] on the other hand wanted to give AI researchers the mathematical formalism and computational power that were associated with Logic. Their aim was to map the Frame classes, slots, constraints, and rules in a Frame language to set theory and logic.  One of the benefits of this approach is that the validation and even creation of the models could be automated using theorem provers and other automated reasoning capabilities. The drawback was that it could be more difficult to initially specify the model in a language with a formal semantics.

This evolution also illustrates a classic divide in AI research known as the "[[neats vs. scruffies]]". The "neats" were researchers who placed the most value on mathematical precision and formalism which could be achieved via [[First Order Logic]] and [[Set Theory]]. The "scruffies" were more interested in modeling knowledge in representations that were intuitive and psychologically meaningful to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crevier|first=Daniel|title=AI: The Tumultuous Search for Artificial Intelligence|year=1993|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-02997-3|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable of the more formal approaches was the [[KL-ONE]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brachman|first=Ron|title=A Structural Paradigm for Representing Knowledge|journal=Bolt, Beranek, and Neumann Technical Report|year=1978|issue=3605|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA056524}}&lt;/ref&gt; KL-ONE later went on to spawn several subsequent Frame languages. The formal semantics of languages such as KL-ONE gave these frame languages a new type of automated reasoning capability known as the [[Deductive classifier|classifier]]. The classifier is an engine that analyzes the various declarations in the frame language: the definition of sets, subsets, relations, etc. The classifier can then automatically deduce various additional relations and can detect when some parts of a model are inconsistent with each other. In this way many of the tasks that would normally be executed by forward or backward chaining in an inference engine can instead be performed by the classifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|accessdate=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technology is especially valuable in dealing with the Internet. It is an interesting result that the formalism of languages such as KL-ONE can be most useful dealing with the highly informal and unstructured data found on the Internet. On the Internet it is simply not feasible to require all systems to standardize on one data model. It is inevitable that terminology will be used in multiple inconsistent forms. The automatic classification capability of the classifier engine provides AI developers with a powerful toolbox to help bring order and consistency to a very inconsistent collection of data (i.e., the Internet). The vision for an enhanced Internet, where pages are ordered not just by text keywords but by classification of concepts is known as the [[Semantic Web]]. Classification technology originally developed for Frame languages is a key enabler of the Semantic Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |author2=James Hendler |author3=Ora Lassila |title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities |journal=Scientific American |date=May 17, 2001 |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34 |volume=284 |pages=34–43 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html |archivedate=2013-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horridge|first=Mathew|title=Protégé OWL Tutorial A step-by-step guide to modelling in OWL using the popular Protégé OWL tools.|url=http://130.88.198.11/tutorials/protegeowltutorial/|work=Manchester University|publisher=Manchester University|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "neats vs. scruffies" divide also emerged in Semantic Web research, culminating in the creation of the [[Linking Open Data]] community—their focus was on exposing data on the Web rather than modeling.

==Example==
A simple example of concepts modeled in a frame language is the [[FOAF (ontology)|Friend of A Friend (FOAF) ontology]] defined as part of the Semantic Web as a foundation for social networking and calendar systems. The primary frame in this simple example is a ''Person''. Example slots are the person's ''email'', ''home page, phone,'' etc. The interests of each person can be represented by additional frames describing the space of business and entertainment domains. The slot ''knows'' links each person with other persons. Default values for a person's interests can be inferred by the web of people they are friends of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOAF|url=http://semanticweb.org/wiki/FOAF|website=http://semanticweb.org|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
The earliest Frame based languages were custom developed for specific research projects and were not packaged as tools to be re-used by other researchers. Just as with [[expert system]] [[inference engine]]s, researchers soon realized the benefits of extracting part of the core infrastructure and developing general purpose frame languages that were not coupled to specific applications. One of the first general purpose frame languages was KRL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobrow|first=D.G.|author2=Terry Winograd|title=An Overview of KRL: A Knowledge Representation Language|journal=Cognitive Science|year=1977|volume=1|pages=3–46|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0101_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential early Frame languages was [[KL-ONE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brachman|first=Ron|title=A Structural Paradigm for Representing Knowledge|journal=Bolt, Beranek, and Neumann Technical Report|year=1978|issue=3605|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA056524}}&lt;/ref&gt; KL-ONE spawned several subsequent Frame languages. One of the most widely used successors to KL-ONE was the [[LOOM (ontology)|Loom language]] developed by Robert MacGregor at the [[Information Sciences Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|accessdate=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Artificial Intelligence generated a great deal of interest in the business world fueled by expert systems. This led to the development of many commercial products for the development of knowledge-based systems. These early products were usually developed in Lisp and integrated constructs such as IF-THEN rules for logical reasoning with Frame hierarchies for representing data. One of the most well known of these early Lisp knowledge-base tools was the [[Knowledge Engineering Environment]] (KEE) from [[IntelliCorp (software)|Intellicorp]]. KEE provided a full Frame language with multiple inheritance, slots, triggers, default values, and a rule engine that supported backward and forward chaining. As with most early commercial versions of AI software KEE was originally deployed in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] on [[Lisp machine]] platforms but was eventually ported to PCs and Unix workstations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mettrey|first=William|title=An Assessment of Tools for Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems|journal=AI Magazine|year=1987|volume= 8| issue = 4|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research agenda of the [[Semantic Web]] spawned a renewed interest in automatic classification and frame languages.  An example is the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) standard for describing information on the Internet. OWL is a standard to provide a semantic layer on top of the Internet. The goal is that rather than organizing the web using keywords as most applications (e.g. Google) do today the web can be organized by concepts organized in an ontology.

The name of the OWL language itself provides a good example of the value of a Semantic Web. If one were to search for "OWL" using the Internet today most of the pages retrieved would be on the bird [[Owl]] rather than the standard [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]. With a Semantic Web it would be possible to specify the concept "Web Ontology Language" and the user would not need to worry about the various possible acronyms or synonyms as part of the search. Likewise the user would not need to worry about homonyms crowding the search results with irrelevant data such as information about birds of prey as in this simple example.

In addition to OWL various standards and technologies that are relevant to the Semantic Web and were influenced by Frame languages include [[Ontology Inference Layer|OIL]] and [[DARPA Agent Markup Language|DAML]].  The [[Protégé (software)|Protege]] Open Source software tool from Stanford University provides an ontology editing capability that is built on OWL and has the full capabilities of a classifier. However it ceased to explicitly support frames as of version 3.5 (which is maintained for those preferring frame orientation), the version current in 2017 being 5. The justification for moving from explicit frames being that OWL DL is more expressive and "industry standard". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horridge|first=Mathew|title=Protégé OWL Tutorial A step-by-step guide to modeling in OWL using the popular Protégé OWL tools.|url=http://130.88.198.11/tutorials/protegeowltutorial/|work=Manchester University|publisher=Manchester University|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of frames and objects==
Frame languages have a significant overlap with [[object-oriented]] languages. The terminologies and goals of the two communities were different but as they moved from the academic world and labs to the commercial world developers tended to not care about philosophical issues and focused primarily on specific capabilities, taking the best from either camp regardless of where the idea began. What both paradigms have in common is a desire to reduce the distance between concepts in the real world and their implementation in software. As such both paradigms arrived at the idea of representing the primary software objects in taxonomies starting with very general types and progressing to more specific types.

The following table illustrates the correlation between standard terminology from the object-oriented and frame language communities:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Frame Terminology !! OO Terminology
|-
| Frame || Object Class
|-
| Slot || Object property or attribute
|-
| Trigger || Accessor and Mutator methods
|-
| Method (e.g. Loom, KEE) || Method
|}

The primary difference between the two paradigms was in the degree that encapsulation was considered a major requirement. For the object-oriented paradigm encapsulation was one of the if not the most critical requirement. The desire to reduce the potential interactions between software components and hence manage large complex systems was a key driver of object-oriented technology. For the frame language camp this requirement was less critical than the desire to provide a vast array of possible tools to represent rules, constraints, and programming logic. In the object-oriented world everything is controlled by methods and the visibility of methods. So for example, accessing the data value of an object property must be done via an accessor method. This method controls things such as validating the data type and constraints on the value being retrieved or set on the property. In Frame languages these same types of constraints could be handled in multiple ways. Triggers could be defined to fire before or after a value was set or retrieved. Rules could be defined that managed the same types of constraints. The slots themselves could be augmented with additional information (called "facets" in some languages) again with the same type of constraint information.

The other main differentiator between frame and OO languages was multiple inheritance (allowing a frame or class to have two or more superclasses). For frame languages multiple inheritance was a requirement.  This follows from the desire to model the world the way humans do, human conceptualizations of the world seldom fall into rigidly defined non-overlapping taxonomies. For many OO languages, especially in the later years of OO, single inheritance was either strongly desired or required. Multiple inheritance was seen as a possible step in the analysis phase to model a domain but something that should be eliminated in the design and implementation phases in the name of maintaining encapsulation and modularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unified Modeling Language|url=http://www.essentialstrategies.com/publications/modeling/uml.htm|work=essentialstrategies.com|publisher=Essential Strategies Inc.|accessdate=10 December 2013|year=1999|quote=In your author’s experience, nearly all examples that appear to require multiple inheritance or multiple type hierarchies can be solved by attacking the model from a different direction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the early frame languages such as KRL did not include message passing, driven by the demands of developers, most of the later frame languages (e.g. Loom, KEE) included the ability to define messages on Frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mettrey|first=William|title=An Assessment of Tools for Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems|journal=AI Magazine|year=1987|volume= 8| issue = 4|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the object-oriented side, standards have also emerged that provide essentially the equivalent functionality that frame languages provided, albeit in a different format and all standardized on object libraries. For example, the [[Object Management Group]] has standardized specifications for capabilities such as associating test data and constraints with objects (analogous to common uses for facets in Frames and to constraints in Frame languages such as Loom) and for integrating rule engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macgregor|first=Robert|title=Retrospective on Loom|url=http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/papers/macgregor/Loom_Retrospective.html|work=isi.edu|publisher=Information Sciences Institute|accessdate=10 December 2013|date=August 13, 1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063241/http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/papers/macgregor/Loom_Retrospective.html|archivedate=25 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMG Formal Specifications|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/|work=omg.org|publisher=Object Management Group|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Funayūrei'''|船幽霊 or 舟幽霊||literally "boat spirit"}} are [[ghost]]s ([[yūrei]]) that have become [[vengeful ghost]]s ([[onryō]]) at sea. They have been passed down in the  folklore of various areas of Japan. They frequently appear in ghost stories and miscellaneous writings from the Edo Period as well as in modern folk customs.&lt;ref name="youkaijiten"&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=Murakami|editor1-first=Kenji|title=Yōkai Jiten |script-title=ja:妖怪事典|year=2000|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]sha|isbn=978-4-620-31428-0|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] and the [[Saga Prefecture]], they are called [[Ayakashi (yōkai)|Ayakashi]].&lt;ref name="youkaijiten" /&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;!-- see history: diff=538764977&amp;oldid=521960054 --&gt;

==Legends==
Funayūrei are ghosts believed to use [[hishaku]] (ladles) to fill boats with water and make them sink. They are said to be the remnants of people who have died in shipwrecks and are attempting to cause humans to join them.&lt;ref name="youkaijiten"/&gt; According to legends, there are various methods that can be used to protect from the harm they inflict, such as throwing [[onigiri]] into the sea or preparing a hishaku with its bottom missing. They are also called mōjabune (亡者船), bōko, or [[Ayakashi (yōkai)|ayakashi]] depending on the area.&lt;ref name="hanabe"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hanabe|first1=Hideo|editor1-last=Nomura|editor1-first=Jun'ichi|title={{nihongo||昔話・伝説小事典|Mukashibanashi ・ Densetsu Shōjiten}}|year=1987|publisher=Mizuumi Shobō|isbn=978-4-8380-3108-5|page=209|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Umibōzu]], another strange phenomenon at sea, are sometimes considered to be a type of funayūrei rather a type of yōkai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kyōgoku|first1=Natsuhiko|editor1-last=Tada|editor1-first=Katsumi|title={{nihongo||妖怪画本 狂歌百物語|Yōkai Gahon Kyōka Hyakumonogatari}}|year=2008|publisher=Kokushokankōkai|isbn=978-4-3360-5055-7|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their appearance as depicted in legends varies widely depending on the area. There are stories that speak of ghosts that appear above water, of boats that are themselves ghosts ([[ghost ship]]s), of ghosts that appear on human-occupied ships, or of any combination of the above. They are described as appearing like [[umibōzu]] or an [[atmospheric ghost lights|atmospheric ghost light]].&lt;ref name="youkaijiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hanabe" /&gt; There are many legends of funayūrei at sea, but they have also been described as appearing in the rivers, lakes, and swamps of inland areas.&lt;ref name="youkaijiten"/&gt; In [[Kōchi Prefecture]], the [[kechibi]], a type of [[onibi]], is also sometimes seen as being a type of funayūrei.&lt;ref name="kochi"&gt;{{Cite book|author=高木啓夫|editor=溝渕増巳他編纂|title=高知県史|year=1978|publisher=高知県|volume=民俗編|pages=250頁|chapter=海の怪異}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They often appear in rainy days, as well as nights on a new or full moon,&lt;ref name="gensousekai"&gt;{{Cite book|author=多田克己|title=幻想世界の住人たち|year=1990|publisher=新紀元社|series=Truth in fantasy|volume=IV|isbn=978-4-915146-44-2|pages=172頁}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on stormy nights and foggy nights.&lt;ref name="youkaijiten"/&gt; When it appears as a boat, the funayūrei itself glows with light, so that it is possible to confirm its details even at night.&lt;ref name="gensousekai"/&gt; Also, by operating on the sixteenth day of bon, the dead would attempt to approach the side of the ship and sink the ship. Also, on a very foggy evening, by making the boat attempt to run, a cliff or a boat without a pulley would appear, and since getting startled and attempting to avoid it would result in capsizing and getting stranded on a reef, it would be no problem to simply push on forward, making it disappear naturally.&lt;ref name="hanabe" /&gt;

Other than attempting to sink ships, in the town of [[Ōtsuki, Kōchi|Ōtsuki]], [[Hata District, Kōchi|Hata District]] Kochi Prefecture, they are said to make the boat's compass malfunction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=國學院大學 民俗学研究会|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/2360909.shtml|title=民俗採訪 通巻昭和39年度号 高知県幡多郡大月町旧月灘村|website=怪異・妖怪伝承データベース|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Toyoma Prefecture]], fishing boats that travel to Hokkaido get turned into a funayurei, causing the crew to hang themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=漆間元三|editor=中沖豊他編|title=富山県史|year=1973|publisher=富山県|volume=民俗編|pages=306頁|chapter=海と信仰}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ehime Prefecture]], when one encounters a funayurei, if one tries to avoid it by changing the boat's route, the boat runs aground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=山口常助|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/0200262.shtml|title=伊予の民俗 通巻5号 舟幽霊やシャククレ|website=怪異・妖怪伝承データベース|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ehime"&gt;{{Cite book|author=佐々木正興|editor=伊賀貞雪他編纂|title=愛媛県史|year=1983|publisher=愛媛県|volume=民俗上|pages=830–831頁|chapter=憑きもの・妖怪伝承}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the past, to avoid shipwreck on a day of bad weather, people would light a bonfire on land, but a funayurei would light a fire on open sea and mislead the boatmen, and by approaching the fire, one would get eaten by the sea and drown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=宗優子|url=http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~youkai-kids/51-funa-yurei/yokai51-.html|title=舟幽霊|website=[http://www7a.biglobe.ne.jp/~youkai-kids/index.html 宗優子の妖怪キッズ]|publisher=|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also various legends about how to drive away funayurei depending on the area, and in the [[Miyagi Prefecture]], when a funayurei appears, they would disappear if one stops the ship and stares fixedly at the funayurei for a while.&lt;ref name="youkaihyakka"&gt;{{Cite book|author=岩井宏實 監修|title=日本の妖怪百科|year=2000|publisher=河出書房新社|volume=2|isbn=978-4-3096-1382-6|pages=32–34頁}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also told that it is good to stir up the water with a stick.&lt;ref name="youkaihyakka" /&gt; There are also various theories that it would be good to throw things into the sea, and in [[Kōzu-shima]], it would be flowers and incense, incense sticks, dango, washed rice, and water,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=國學院大學民俗学研究会|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/2360286.shtml|title=民俗採訪 昭和30年度号 神津島|website=怪異・妖怪伝承データベース|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Kochi Prefecture, it would be ashes and 49 rice cakes,&lt;ref name="youkaihyakka"/&gt; and in Otsuki, Kochi, it would be summer beans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=國學院大學民俗学研究会|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/2360910.shtml|title=民俗採訪 通巻昭和39年度号 高知県幡多郡大月町旧月灘村|website=怪異・妖怪伝承データベース|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], it would be woven mats, ashes, and burnt firewood.&lt;ref name="tabi"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=瀬川清子|date=October 1938|title=相島日記 (1)|journal=旅と伝説|volume=11巻|issue=10号（通巻130号）|pages=23–24頁}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Kochi Prefecture, it is said to be possible to drive funayurei by saying "I am Dozaemon (わしは土左衛門だ)" and asserting to be one of the funayurei.&lt;ref name="kochi" /&gt; In Ehime, one is able to disperse the funayurei by lighting a match and throwing it.&lt;ref name="ehime" /&gt;

==Classics==
[[File:ShunsenFunayurei.jpg|thumb|180px|right|"Funayūrei" from the [[Ehon Hyaku Monogatari]] by Takehara Shunsen]]
In the collection of fantastic stories, the [[Ehon Hyaku Monogatari]] from the Edo period, the funayurei that appear on the western sea are departed souls from the [[Taira]] clan. It is known that the Taira clan came to ruin in the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]], but in the open sea between [[Dan no Ura]] and [[Mekari]] in the [[Kanmon Straits]] (Hayamoto, 早鞆), a funayurei wearing armor and helmet would appear, say "give me a bucket", and would cling to the boat. By lending a hishaku, it would pour water onto the boat, so when crossing this sea on a boat, one would thus prepare one with its bottom open, and thus stave off the funayurei. Once, there was a Buddhist priest, feeling pity for the spirit, gave it a Buddhist service, causing it to go away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=多田克己編|title=竹原春泉 絵本百物語 -桃山人夜話-|year=1997|publisher=国書刊行会|isbn=978-4-336-03948-4|pages=75頁}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genrin Yamaoka]], an intellectual from the Edo period, commented on funayurei that appear as balls of fire or ghosts at sea. Referring to [[Zhu Xi]] and the [[Cheng-Zhu school]], he brought up several examples of departed souls that died with resentment and remained even after carrying out their revenge, and concluded, "even by seeing something from 10 people, by sometimes going along with reason, you can also sometimes see it in ancient Chinese books (かやうの事つねに十人なみにあることには待らねども、たまたまはある道理にして、もろこしの書にもおりおり見え待る)". Although it is not possible to get a hold of smoke with one's hands, by accumulating it and staining one's hand, it is possible to take it into one's hands. The spirit (気, ki) is the beginning of one's nature, and when the spirit stagnates, the ones that create a form and produce a voice are called yurei. In the first place, the stagnated spirits of the ghosts desire to fall, and disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=田中聡|title=江戸の妖怪事件簿|year=2007|publisher=集英社|series=集英社新書|volume=|isbn=978-4-0872-0398-1|pages=149頁}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern examples==

In 1954, after the [[Tōya Maru|Toya Maru]] accident, the largest marine accident to occur after the war, the ferryboats that went on commission after the accident were discovered to have a strange scar on their propeller, providing an example of where rumors started to spread about how the victims of the accident turned into funayurei and dug claws into the propellers.&lt;ref name="gendai"&gt;{{Cite book|author=山口敏太郎|title=本当にいる日本の「現代妖怪」図鑑|year=2007|publisher=笠倉出版社|isbn=978-4-7730-0365-9|pages=244頁}}&lt;/ref&gt; This funayurei appears in sea and on land, and in Nanaehama, Hokkaido, there is a rumor that at midnight, a female would appear completely wet riding in a taxi, who would disappear once one reaches the destination, and who was rumored to be the ghost of Toya Maru.&lt;ref name="gendai" /&gt; Also, in [[Aomori Station]], the staff members who slept in the night duty room would wake up at the sound of banging on the glass window, and would see the hand of the completely wet female on the other side, got startled that "Toya Maru's victims were pleading for help," and the next morning, there would be a promissory note remaining on that glass window.&lt;ref name="gendai" /&gt;

Also, in 1969, in the sea in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], one would observe a white human figure, hear a voice saying "please give me a hishaku," and it was said that the shipwrecked members of the university's yacht club were wanting to bail water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=化野燐|editor=郡司聡他編|title=怪|year=2008|publisher=角川書店|series=カドカワムック|volume=vol.0024|isbn=978-4-04-883992-1|pages=241頁|chapter=妖怪プロファイリング}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From the view of folkloristics==

According to the folkloristician, [[Hideo Hanabe]], funayurei appear in evenings of wind and rain and heavy fog, and also frequently when the weather suddenly worsens, and since the matter that accidents happen more easily adds a sense of reality, and since they also give a feeling of eeriness and unease, some of the strange incidents would be put into a frame of legends, so that phantoms and illusions would be spoken of as reality. The fact that they often appear during Bon makes its image overlap with that of the [[Spirit Boat Procession|shōrōbune]]. However, at its foundation, as ones who are not deified, there is also faith in the spirits of those who have died at sea and float around and turn into funayurei, and in Bon and in New Year's Eve, and other set days, it is forbidden to fish or go to sea, or forbidden to go close to the sea, and a prohibition on breaking these taboos.&lt;ref name="hanabe" /&gt;

==Theories on their true identity==
{{see also | Dead water}}

Funayurei are said to possess ships and prevent them from moving,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=桜田勝徳|url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/YoukaiCard/0920034.shtml|title=島 通巻昭和九年前期号 肥前平島と出水の長島|website=怪異・妖怪伝承データベース|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have somewhat been given a scientific explanation in the modern era, and have been determined to be a phenomenon of internal waves. For example, in the area of the ocean that is at the mouth of large rivers, there are areas of water with low salinity, but since water with low salinity is comparatively light, it would stagnate to sea level, but the water on both sides would not move too much, and would form a boundary. Around that boundary, if the boat has a screw propeller, however much one turns it, the energy would merely stir up the water on the boundary, and expended all on creating internal waves, resulting in the boat not moving. In polar regions, ice would melt and float into the middle of sea, creating the same result, which was also recorded by the polar explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen]]. In this way, there is a hypothesis that the internal waves accompanied by changes in the salt content, the water temperature, and the hydraulic pressure would obstruct the boat from advancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsanet.or.jp/seminar/text/seminar_225.html|title=いくら漕いでも進まない船幽霊の秘密は「内部波」|website=[http://www.jsanet.or.jp/seminar/index.html 海軍雑学ゼミナール]|publisher=日本船主協会|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2001|url=http://www.waterworks.co.jp/vol3/02.htm|title=水の不思議 船を止める魔物、重い水と軽い水。|website=[http://www.waterworks.co.jp/index2.html Water Works 水の働き]|publisher=[http://www.sedia-system.co.jp/ 渡辺パイプ株式会社]|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The coast of [[Fukushima Prefecture]]. They speak to people on ships, saying "lend me an inada (hishaku)". An "inada" is a hishaku that is used on boats, if one doesn't open a hole in it before giving it over, it would suddenly fill the boat with water and cause it to sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=民俗学研究所編著|editor=柳田國男 監修|title=綜合日本民俗語彙|year=1955|publisher=平凡社|volume=第1巻|pages=105頁}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By making the boat go over it, the boat would suddenly sink.
:Also, there are cases where at night, the sea would suddenly shine with light, but this is due to being possessed by Murasa, and it is said that it effective to attach a sword or knife to the end of a pole and stir the sea several times with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=綜合日本民俗語彙|volume=第4巻|pages=1565頁}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PacificYew 7684.jpg|thumb|Pacific yew used for its anti-cancer properties]]
'''Herbalism''' is the study of using plants for medicinal purposes and has dated back since the first humans arose around 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Fu-Shuang|last2=Weng|first2=Jing-Ke|date=2017-07-31|title=Demystifying traditional herbal medicine with modern approach|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nplants2017109.pdf|journal=Nature Plants|language=En|volume=3|issue=8|pages=17109|doi=10.1038/nplants.2017.109|issn=2055-0278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, [[herb]]s have been used by cultures across the world to treat a variety of ailments and diseases. As modern medicine has progressed, traditional practices of [[herbalism]] have been considered{{by whom|date= November 2018}} to be primitive and archaic. But with the rise of new technology, the invaluable information accumulated by this practice in combination with [[biotechnology]] could be used to open up new way of approaching medicine through expanding the current library of compounds to be used for pharmaceutical advancement and being able to develop new and effective treatments for complex diseases.

== History of herbalism ==
With the 400,000 of plant species known to date, there are many [[metabolite]]s derived from plants that can be applied to human biology from curing headaches to [[autoimmune disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://modernherbalmedicine.com/articles/natural-approaches-to-autoimmune-disorders.html|title=Natural Approaches to Autoimmune Disorders|website=modernherbalmedicine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[morphine]], a pain drug, comes from [[poppy]], while [[paclixatxel]], an anti-[[cancer]] drug, comes from [[pacific yew]]. Humans have used these properties of plants across numerous cultures and have accumulated a rich collection of data on the causes and effects of certain plants on the human body. This gave rise to the practice of herbalism, which in the past served as many cultures’ primary method of dealing with ailments.								
The first written records of herbalism date back to [[Ancient Egypt]] around 1,500 BC in the [[Papyrus Ebers]] where more than 800 plant medicines and their effects on the human body were documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/ShenNongBenCaoLingTheDivineFarmersMateriaMedica/ShenNong%20Ben%20Cao%20ling(The%20Divine%20Farmers%20Materia%20Medica)_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Shen Nong Ben Cao Ling(The Divine Farmers Materia Medica)"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Compendium of Materia Medica, written by [[Li Shizhen]], a Chinese herbalist of the sixteenth century, contains information on 1,893 different herbs and 11,096 prescriptions, demonstrating the breadth of knowledge accumulated on herbalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/ebook/9780520959743/the-ben-cao-gang-mu|title=The Ben Cao Gang Mu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cultures, herbalism is often tied with spirituality. For example, in African culture, it is believed that healing is a religious act, while in the Chinese culture, vital energy (qi) and the balance between yin and yang play a crucial role in healing. Perhaps due to the lack of scientific evidence, herbalist practices has been disregarded, but it is no accident that so many cultures from across the world have chosen to treat disease through plants. Plants hold many biological solutions that can be applied to humans and paralleled with years of trial and error on behalf of herbalists to harness this information, herbalism has the potential to revolutionize modern medicine.								

== Modern herbalism ==
Currently, many of the treatments approved by the [[FDA]] are single-compounds and do not have the ability to treat complex issues such as cancer or [[type II diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patridge|first=Eric|last2=Gareiss|first2=Peter|last3=Kinch|first3=Michael S.|last4=Hoyer|first4=Denton|date=February 2016|title=An analysis of FDA-approved drugs: natural products and their derivatives|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617672|journal=Drug Discovery Today|volume=21|issue=2|pages=204–207|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2015.01.009|issn=1878-5832|pmid=25617672}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the prescriptions found in herbalism use multiple ingredients mixed in a specific ratio to be synergistic. This is known as the combinatorial effect and it is hypothesized that through multiple metabolites targeting many different sites, the simultaneous action has the potential to cure these complex diseases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiyohara|first=Hiroaki|last2=Matsumoto|first2=Tsukasa|last3=Yamada|first3=Haruki|date=June 2004|title=Combination Effects of Herbs in a Multi-herbal Formula: Expression of Juzen-taiho-to's Immuno-modulatory Activity on the Intestinal Immune System|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC526207/|journal=Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|volume=1|issue=1|pages=83–91|doi=10.1093/ecam/neh004|issn=1741-427X|pmid=15257329}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a treatment called Food Allergy Herbal Formula-2 (FAHF-2) is currently under development to reduce [[peanut allergy|peanut allergies]]. Developed by Chinese scientist Xiu-Min Li, FAHF-2 was refined from an ancient traditional Chinese herbal prescription known as Wu Mei Wan, which was originally used to cure [[intestinal]] [[parasitic infection]]s but shares a similar mechanism as a [[food allergy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It consists of nine different herbs and has shown in trial to be effective for curing food allergies. However, when these nine different herbs are used individually, the treatment is much less effective, demonstrating the power of the combinatorial effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Kamal D.|last2=Kattan|first2=Jacob D.|last3=Zou|first3=Zhong Mei|last4=Li|first4=Jing Hua|last5=Zhang|first5=Libang|last6=Wallenstein|first6=Sylvan|last7=Goldfarb|first7=Joseph|last8=Sampson|first8=Hugh A.|last9=Li|first9=Xiu-Min|date=January 2005|title=The Chinese herbal medicine formula FAHF-2 completely blocks anaphylactic reactions in a murine model of peanut allergy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637565|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=115|issue=1|pages=171–178|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2004.10.003|issn=0091-6749|pmid=15637565}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many herbal prescriptions use the combinatorial effect, if this phenomenon can be analyzed and understood, many kinds of diseases could be cured with just a single prescription. 

The power of herbalism has shown itself to be very promising, but perhaps in conjunction with new developments in biotechnology, it can be used to its full potential.

== Developments in biotechnology ==

=== Bioinformatic algorithms ===
[[Bioinformatics]] is the use of computers to solve biological problems specifically within the fields of [[macromolecular]] structures, [[genome]] sequences, and the results of functional genomics experiments, where large sets of data are involved. For example, they have been used to search a database of gene expression data sets from human cells treated with various small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Justin|last2=Crawford|first2=Emily D.|last3=Peck|first3=David|last4=Modell|first4=Joshua W.|last5=Blat|first5=Irene C.|last6=Wrobel|first6=Matthew J.|last7=Lerner|first7=Jim|last8=Brunet|first8=Jean-Philippe|last9=Subramanian|first9=Aravind|date=2006-09-29|title=The Connectivity Map: Using Gene-Expression Signatures to Connect Small Molecules, Genes, and Disease|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/313/5795/1929|journal=Science|language=en|volume=313|issue=5795|pages=1929–1935|doi=10.1126/science.1132939|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17008526}}&lt;/ref&gt; This database allows researchers to find patterns between small molecules and their mechanisms of action and can be applied to the field of herbalism through identifying the medicinal properties of plant compounds. For instance, this technology aided in the discovery of [[celastrol]], a compound extracted from plant called ''[[Tripterygium wilfordi]]'' commonly used in traditional traditional Chinese medicine as a [[leptin]] sensitizer used to control obesity. Gene expression signatures of lean and obese mice were compared and through analysis researchers determined that celsastrol was the top compound in the database that correlated with anti-leptin resistance. Later, celastrol was tested in mice and shown to reduce obesity and could potentially be used as a treatment for obesity in humans. This example demonstrates the power of plant metabolites and how valuable knowledge of herbalism can as new technology such as bioinformatic algorithms are employed.

=== Crystalline sponge method ===
X-ray single-crystal diffraction is often used to identify and analyze structures of compounds which is an important step to analyzing existing herbal prescriptions to develop new medications. However, this method has key restrictions which limit its use. X-ray single-crystal diffraction requires the sample to be obtained as single [[crystal]]s and in larger quantities. The crystalline sponge method would allow the sample to be aqueous and also requires as little as 80 nanograms of the sample.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inokuma|first=Yasuhide|last2=Yoshioka|first2=Shota|last3=Ariyoshi|first3=Junko|last4=Arai|first4=Tatsuhiko|last5=Hitora|first5=Yuki|last6=Takada|first6=Kentaro|last7=Matsunaga|first7=Shigeki|last8=Rissanen|first8=Kari|last9=Fujita|first9=Makoto|date=2013-03-28|title=X-ray analysis on the nanogram to microgram scale using porous complexes|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538828?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg|journal=Nature|volume=495|issue=7442|pages=461–466|doi=10.1038/nature11990|issn=1476-4687|pmid=23538828}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology uses networked porous metal complexes which have high molecule-recognition ability that can absorb molecules from an aqueous solution and order them regularly in the crystal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This way, the molecule can be analyzed with x-ray diffraction and provides a much higher accuracy than [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With this technology, researchers were able to uncover the complete stereochemistry of miyakosyne A, a scarce natural marine product. Due to the small structural difference between one [[methylene]] unit, chemical and spectroscopic methods were not precise enough to determine its exact structure, making x-ray diffraction the only viable method. A tiny crystal sponge of approximately 100 by 100 by 100 µm3 was treated with 5 mg of miyakosyne A and analyzed with x-ray diffraction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This allowed the complete structure of miyakosyne A to be revealed, making researchers hopeful for its application in a variety of its fields, including herbalism. As many organic compounds from plants must first be dried into a powder and in large quantities before analysis or analyzed through inaccurate methods such as NMR or mass spectrometry, the crystalline sponge method would greatly simplify the process of identifying compounds of interest. As a result, this would make it easier for researchers to study specific metabolites and their potential applications.

=== Combinatorial biosynthesis ===
Combinatorial biosynthesis is the use of engineered enzymes and pathways to produce different metabolites as opposed traditional chemical synthesis, which is costly, inefficient, and produces byproduct waste.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Huihua|last2=Liu|first2=Zihe|last3=Zhao|first3=Huimin|last4=Ang|first4=Ee Lui|date=2015-02-12|title=Recent advances in combinatorial biosynthesis for drug discovery|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334309/|journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy|volume=9|pages=823–833|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S63023|issn=1177-8881|pmc=4334309|pmid=25709407}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, in the context of herbalism, if a specific metabolite is scare in its herbal form, it can be produced through combinatorial synthesis to create a cheap and eco-friendly treatment. Currently, there are three major strategies for combinatorial biosynthesis: precursor-directed biosynthesis, enzyme-level modification, and pathway-level recombination.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Precursor-directed biosynthesis creates different metabolites through using different substrates through the same metabolic pathway. Because pathways are promiscuous and non-substrate specific, nonnative substrates can be integrated into the pathway to produce useful variations of metabolites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If this approach is used to manipulate the metabolic pathway of certain herbs, it could lead to new drug discovery.

The second strategy for combinatorial biosynthesis is enzyme-level modification, entailing either swapping entire domains, modules, or subunits, site-specific [[mutagenesis]], or directed evolution. Swapping entire domains, modules, or subunits of [[enzyme]]s is the classical approach of combinatorial biosynthesis and allows for the direct editing of enzymes in a specific pathway, resulting in new metabolites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Site-specific mutagenesis is the modification of individual amino acids in a sequence. Compared to the previous technique, it is less invasive, leading to higher yields of viable protein.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By introducing a single mutation, the substrate specificity of the protein can change, which could improve drugs and even make natural substances found in plants more effective at treating disease. Directed evolution takes a similar approach to site-specific mutagenesis, but creates larger alterations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As a result, new metabolites can emerge with and make existing treatments even more effective.

The final strategy for combinatorial biosynthesis is pathway-level recombination. This is the editing of the pathway itself. Pathway-level recombination is performed through using biosynthetic genes from different species of organisms to create a pathways in a host organism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This technique often used to edit yeast so they can produce metabolites of interest from rare herbs or plants.

{{nihongo|'''Hone-onna'''|[[wiktionary:骨女|骨女]]||literally: ''bone woman''}} is a being from [[Japan]]ese [[legend]]s. In some versions, it is thought to be a female [[yōkai]] who kills men by extracting their lifeforce or by grabbing their hands and holding them until the victim becomes a skeleton himself.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dylan Foster: ''Morphologies of Mystery: Yôkai and Discourses of the Supernatural in Japan, 1666–1999''. Stanford University, Stanford, 2003, S. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Can't find this source, but none of the JA materials I've seen that mention this describe the hone-onna as making others into skeletons.--&gt;  In others, the ''hone onna'' manifests as a skeletal woman.

==Description==
The ''hone-onna'' appears for the first time in a yōkai [[encyclopedia]] called ''Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki'', written in 1779 by [[Toriyama Sekien]]. The story in which the bone woman is mentioned is named ''Botan Dōrō'' (牡丹燈籠; "The Peony Lantern"). It tells about a beautiful, but very skinny lady carrying a red lantern in shape of a [[peony]] flower and visiting men in attempt to sleep with them. ''Botan Dōrō'' itself is derived from a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[China|Chinese]] tale collection named ''Otogibōko'' (御伽ばうこ), written by [[Asai Ryōi]] in 1666. The collection was composed as some kind of [[moral]]-free version of the Chinese work ''Jiandeng Xinhua'' written in 1378 by [[Qu You]].&lt;ref&gt;Murakami Kenji: 妖怪事典. Mainichi Shimbun-sha, Tokyo, 2000, {{ISBN|4-620-31428-5}}, page 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legends ==
''Botan Dōrō'' tells about a young man named ''Ogiwara Shinnojō'', who is wandering around at night and who meets a young woman named O-Tsuyu. She carries a red peony lantern and Shinnojō immediately falls in love with her. Every evening now they meet each other for love and to sleep together. The overly curious neighbour sneaks secretly to the bedroom of the couple to observe them. When the light of the bedroom falls onto the couple the neighbour nearly dies in shock, when he recognizes that the sleeping Shinnojō shares his bed with a moving skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;Takada Mamoru: 鳥山石燕 画図百鬼夜行. Kadokawa Shoten, Tokyo, 2005, {{ISBN|978-4-336-03386-4}}, page 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

An orally traditioned legend from [[Akita prefecture]] tells the story of a young man who became lost during a heavy snow storm. Suddenly he saw a young woman, carrying a red peony lantern. The woman waved at him and guided the man to her house. When the man wanted to thank her for help, the light of the house and the lantern fell onto her face and the shocked man recognized her face as a blank skeleton skull.&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi Bintarō: とうほく妖怪図鑑.

In June 1953, he became the first African American graduate of the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]] and was the first African American to serve as a producer on a major motion picture.&lt;ref name='Jet-16Oct1952'&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |date=October 16, 1952 |title=Football Player To Pioneer in Hollywood Films |journal=Jet |volume=2 |issue=25 |page=54 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ciobit&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lentz III|first1=Harris|title=Obituaries|journal=Classic Images|date=March 2015|issue=477|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jet-16Sep1965'&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |date=September 16, 1965 |title=Ike Jones Set As 1st Negro Producer of Major Film |journal=Jet |volume=28 |issue=23 |page=58 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Billboard-11Sep1965'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tiegel |first=Eliot |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor1-first=Lee |editor1-last=Zhito |date=September 11, 1965 |title=The Jazz Beat |journal=Billboard |volume=77 |issue=37 |page=70 |publisher=The Billboard Publishing Company |location=Cincinnati, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was relatively unknown outside of the film industry until 1970 when he publicly announced that he had been secretly married to actress [[Inger Stevens]], who died of a drug overdose in April 1970, since 1961.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-ike-jones-20141012-story.html |title=Ike Jones dies at 84; pioneering African American film producer |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=October 11, 2014 |accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones’ claim was backed up in court by Stevens' brother, Carl O. Stensland.

==Early life and education==
Jones was born in [[Santa Monica, California]], and attended Santa Monica High School.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

He studied motion picture production at the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. While at UCLA, he also played [[End (gridiron football)|end]] for the [[UCLA Bruins football|Bruins]] and was named to the [[1952 All-Pacific Coast football team|1952 All-Pacific Coast Conference team]].&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; After graduating from UCLA, Jones was drafted in the 25th round by the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[1953 NFL Draft]], but declined the offer.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

==Career==
In 1953, Jones worked as an actor in bit parts and served as an assistant director on ''[[The Joe Louis Story]]''.&lt;ref name='Jet-4Jun1953'&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |date=June 4, 1953 |title=Ike Jones May Get Role in Play With Eartha Kitt |journal=Jet |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=61 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in the decade, Jones worked as an assistant producer for Hill-Hecht Lancaster Company. After that production company folded, [[Harry Belafonte]] hired him as vice president of development for Harbel Productions.&lt;ref name='Jet-5Nov1959'&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |date=November 5, 1959 |title=Ex-UCLA star named to Belafonte's Harbel Film Co. |journal=Jet |volume=17 |issue=2 |page=59 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Jones headed [[Nat King Cole]]'s Kell-Cole Productions.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; After the singer's death, Jones was hired as a producer on ''[[A Man Called Adam (film)|A Man Called Adam]]'', a film starring [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] This was the first time that an African American was hired as a producer on a major motion picture.&lt;ref name='Jet-16Sep1965'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Billboard-11Sep1965'/&gt;

==Personal life==
On November 8, 1961, Jones and actress [[Inger Stevens]] were secretly married in [[Tijuana, Mexico]].&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; The couple agreed to keep their union a secret as to not harm Stevens’ acting career.&lt;ref name="jet870"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rule Ex-Actor Mate of Actress, She Took Own Life |journal=Jet |date=August 20, 1970 |volume=38 |issue=20 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Inger+Stevens+Ike+Jones+November&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM7Yr3u_rcAhUNDq0KHfC_A4UQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Inger%20Stevens%20Ike%20Jones%20November&amp;f=true |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demands of their careers meant they spent much time apart, straining their marriage and they eventually separated. In April 1970, while the couple were estranged and living apart, Stevens died of a barbiturate overdose that was eventually ruled a suicide.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; As Stevens left no will at the time of her death, Jones filed to become administrator of her estate thus making news of the marriage public. Despite being unable to produce a valid marriage license, Superior Court Commissioner A. Edward Nichols ruled in Jones' favor and appointed him administrator of her estate in August 1970. Jones announced that he would use a portion of the $1,171,000 of Stevens’ estate to open a mental health care clinic in [[Watts, Los Angeles]]. At the time, Jones managed a chain of convalescent homes.&lt;ref name="jet870" /&gt;

Around that same time, Jones had made a number of bad investments, straining his finances.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

==Later years and death==
In 1995, he became the first recipient of the [[Oscar Micheaux]] Award, presented by the [[Producers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berry |first1=S.

On October 5, 2014, Jones died "of complications from a stroke and congestive heart failure"&lt;ref name=ciobit/&gt; in an assisted-living facility in [[Los Angeles]] on October 5, 2014. He was 84 and left no known immediate survivors.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

==Legacy==
A short street called Ike Jones Road near [[John Wayne Airport]] in [[Santa Ana, California]] is named for Ike Jones.

[[File:SvatbaRichard isabela.jpg|thumb|the marriage of Richard of Cornwall to Isabella of Gloucester]]
'''Isabel Marshal''' (9 October 1200 – 17 January 1240) was a medieval [[English people|English]] countess. She was the wife of both [[Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford|Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford and 5th Earl of Gloucester]] and [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]] (son of King [[John of England]]). With the former, she was a great grandmother of King [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] of [[Scotland]].

==Family==
Born at [[Pembroke Castle]], Isabel was the seventh child, and second daughter, of [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]] and [[Isabel de Clare, 3rd Countess of Pembroke|Isabel de Clare]]. She had 9 siblings: 4 sisters and 5 brothers, who included the [[William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|2nd]], [[Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|3rd]], [[Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke|4th]], [[Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke|5th]] and [[Anselm Marshal, 6th Earl of Pembroke|6th]] [[Earl of Pembroke|Earls of Pembroke]]; each of her brothers dying without a legitimate male heir, thus passing the title on to the next brother in line. Her last brother to hold the title of Earl of Pembroke died without legitimate issue, and the title was passed down through the family of Isabel's younger sister Joan. Her sisters married, respectively, the Earls of [[Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk|Norfolk]], [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Surrey]], and [[William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby|Derby]]; the [[William de Braose (died 1230)|Lord of Abergavenny]] and the Lord of [[Swanscombe]].

==First marriage==
On her 17th birthday, Isabel was married to Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford and 5th Earl of Gloucester, who was 20 years her senior, at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]]. The marriage was an extremely happy one, despite the age difference, and the couple had six children:
* [[Agnes de Clare]]  (b. 1218)
* [[Amice de Clare]] (1220–1287), who married the [[Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon|6th Earl of Devon]]
* [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford]] (1222–1262)
* [[Isabella of Gloucester and Hertford|Isabel de Clare]] (2 November 1226 – 10 July 1264), who married the [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale]]; through this daughter, Isabel would be the great grandmother of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]]
* [[William de Clare]] (1228–1258)
* Gilbert de Clare (b. 1229), a priest

Isabel's husband Gilbert joined in an expedition to [[Brittany]] in 1229, but died 25 October 1230 on his way back to Penrose, in that duchy. His body was conveyed home by way of [[Plymouth]] and [[Cranborne]], to [[Tewkesbury]], where he was buried at the abbey.

==Second marriage==
Isabel was a young widow, only 30 years old. She had proven childbearing ability and the ability to bear healthy sons; as evidenced by her six young children, three of whom were sons. These were most likely the reasons for both the proposal of marriage from [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], and Isabel's acceptance of it, despite the fact that her husband had been dead for only five months. The two were married on 30 March 1231 at [[Fawley, Buckinghamshire|Fawley]] Church, much to the displeasure of Richard's brother [[Henry III of England|King Henry]], who had been arranging a more advantageous match for Richard. Isabel and Richard got along well enough, though Richard had a reputation as a womanizer and is known to have had mistresses during the marriage. They were the parents of four children, three of whom died in the cradle.
* John of Cornwall (31 January 1232 – 22 September 1233), born and died at [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire]], buried at [[Reading Abbey]]
* Isabella of Cornwall (9 September 1233 – 10 October 1234), born and died at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, buried at Reading Abbey
* [[Henry of Almain]]  (2 November 1235 – 13 March 1271), murdered by his cousins [[Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola|Guy]] and Simon de Montfort, buried at [[Hailes Abbey]].
* Nicholas of Cornwall (b. &amp; d. 17 January 1240 [[Berkhamsted Castle]]), died shortly after birth, buried at [[Beaulieu Abbey]] with his mother

==Death and burial==
Isabel died of [[liver failure]], contracted while in childbirth, on 17 January 1240, at [[Berkhamsted Castle]]. She was 39 years old.

When Isabel was dying she asked to be buried next to her first husband at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], but Richard had her interred at [[Beaulieu Abbey]], with her infant son, instead. As a pious gesture, however, he sent her heart, in a silver-gilt casket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e660.htm |title= e660.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Tewkesbury Abbey|Tewkesbury]].

'''Isabella of Aragon''' (1248&amp;nbsp;– 28 January 1271){{Sfn|Rodrigo Estevan|2009|p= 90}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|She had not been born yet when her father King James executed a will in January 1248 since he stipulates that if he had another male heir, he should become a [[Knights Templar|knight Templar]] and if the newborn was daughter, she should enter the [[Monastery of Santa María de Sigena]]. Isabella was born after January of 1248.{{Sfn|Zurita|1562-1580|p= 272 of PDF, Chapter XLIII}}}} was [[Queen consort]] of [[France in the Middle Ages|France]]&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Geldsetzer, ''Frauen auf Kreuzzügen''&lt;/ref&gt; from 1270 to 1271 by marriage to [[Philip III of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Weber, ''Les reines de France''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Isabella was the daughter of King [[James I of Aragon]]&lt;ref&gt;''The new Cambridge medieval history / 5 C. 1198 - c. 1300.'' by David Abulafia and Rosamond MacKitterick. The standard work of reference on the whole of Europe, east and west, during the thirteenth century. Page 654.&lt;/ref&gt; and his second wife [[Violant of Hungary]]&lt;ref&gt;''The book of deeds of James I of Aragon: a translation of the medieval Catalan Llibre dels Fets'' by Damian J Smith and Helena Buffery. Page 139.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus granddaughter of [[Yolanda de Courtenay]].

In [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] on 28 May 1262, Isabella married the future [[Philip III of France]], son of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] and [[Margaret of Provence]]. She became queen upon the accession of her spouse in 1270. 

She accompanied her husband on the [[Eighth Crusade]] against [[Tunis]]. On their way home, they stopped in [[Cosenza]], [[Calabria]]. Six months pregnant with her fifth child, on 11 January 1271 she suffered a [[List of horse accidents|fall from her horse]] after they had resumed the trip back to France. Isabella gave birth to a premature stillborn son. She never recovered from her injuries and the childbirth, and died seventeen days later, on 28 January. Her husband took her body and their stillborn son and, when he finally returned to France, buried her in the [[Basilica of St Denis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Erlande-Brandenburg]], ''Le roi est mort. Étude sur les funérailles, les sépultures et les tombeaux des rois de France jusqu'à la fin du xiiie siècle''&lt;/ref&gt; Her tomb, like many others, was desecrated during the [[French Revolution]] in 1793.

==Issue==
She had four sons:
#[[Louis of France (1264–1276)|Louis]] (1265–1276)
#[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV "the Fair"]] (1268–1314), King of France
#Robert (1269–1271)

'''Janka-Puszta''' or '''Jankovac''' was a training camp set up for the [[Ustashe]] terrorist organisation in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Paris| first=Edmond| year=1961| pp=23| title=Genocide in Satellite Croatia 1941-1945|publisher=King's|isbn=1258163462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was located in the [[Zala County]] of [[Hungary]], close to the border of the then [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] near the villages of [[Murakeresztúr]] and [[Belezna]]. The camp was one of a string of training camps established in Hungary and Italy by the [[Ustashe]]. It housed several hundred émigré recruits, mostly manual laborers returning from Western Europe and North America. The recruits swore an oath of loyalty to the leader of the [[Ustashe]], [[Ante Pavelić]], took part in militant exercises, and produced anti-Serb propaganda material.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=175}}

==Background==

In the summer of 1931, the location was leased by the Hungary authorities to [[Gustav Perčec]] who served as the camp commander. [[Ustashe]] members were already active in the region on both sides of the border at the time. Situated on a hill on approximately 150 acres, the camp consisted of two buildings, open fields and a forest. In November 1931, the first members of the [[Ustashe]] terrorist organisation arrived. The camp started out as a sort of [[commune]], a refuge for fugitive members of the [[Ustashe]] group who had recently escaped from Yugoslavia. After months of preparation, Gustav Perčec  began to actively seek members to join the camp.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=175}} In co-operation with the Hungarian authorities, [[Ustashe]] fugitives crossing the Yugoslav-Hungarian border were interviewed by Hungarian police and their details were passed onto Percec. After it was confirmed a fugitive was not a Yugoslav spy, the Hungarian police would take them to the camp and would be provided a false name and acceptance into the camp.&lt;ref name="Šadek"&gt;Vladimir Šadek: [http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/128108 Logor Janka-puszta i razvoj ustaške organizacije u Podravini do 1934.], Podravina, sv. 11, broj 21, Str. 47 - 56 Koprivnica 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Those living at the training camp partook in regimented programs. Alongside [[Croatian nationalism]] indoctrination, [[Ustashe]] members took part in military training and also, conducted duties to keep the camp running. The head instructors of weapons training were Hungarian officers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Toynbee| first=Arnold|year=1935| pp=546–47| title=Survey of International Affairs 1934| publisher=Oxford University Press| asin=B0006DIHDI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the living conditions at the camp were said to have been poor, with camp members receiving severe punishment for any misbehavior. Much of the weaponry came from Italy, and many high ranking and prominent members of the [[Ustashe]] organisation visited the camp including: [[Ante Pavelic]].&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt; In relation with the agreement reached in 1929 between the pro-Bulgarian [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and the Ustashe on a common struggle against Yugoslavia. As result, Bulgarian [[Vlado Chernozemski]] was designated as their instructor in terrorist attacks and was send to Italy in 1931. Since mid-1932, taking steps to improve its relations with Yugoslavia, the Italian authorities have closed the [[Borgo Val di Taro]] Ustashe camp. Thus [[Vlado Chernozemski]], was transferred  to Janka-Puszta. From the period of 1932-1934, the camp served as the ideological and technical support base for many militant actions including the [[Velebit uprising]] and the assassination of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt;

In the camp lived also the lover of Perčec-Jelka Pogorelec, who was an agent of Serbian intelligence. One night she secretly crossed the border. In October 1933 she published a series of materials for the camp in the "Novosti" newspaper in [[Zagreb]]. This greatly complicated Yugoslavia's relations with Hungary. Cross-border conflicts arose between the two countries, accompanied by mutual attacks. Thus, in April 1934, Belgrade made a formal complaint to the [[League of Nations]]. There was also a complaint filled by the Hungarian regent [[Horthy]]. The League formed a commission to review the case in May. Under these circumstances, the Hungarian authorities were forced to close the camp and urgently move the Ustashe in the nearby town of [[Nagykanizsa]]. When the members of the  international commission arrived at the camp, they recognized that the complaint about a terrorist camp was not correct. In this way the camp fell into disuse in late 1934.&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt;

'''Jean Babette Stein ''' (February 9, 1934 – April 30, 2017) was an American author and editor.

==Early life==
Stein was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in Chicago.&lt;ref name="nytobit"/&gt; Her father was [[Jules C. Stein]] (1896–1981), founder of the [[MCA Inc.|Music Corporation of America]] (MCA) and the Jules Stein Eye Institute at [[University of California, Los Angeles]].  Her mother, Doris J. Stein (1902–1984), established the Doris Jones Stein Foundation. Jean Stein's sister, [[Susan Shiva]], died of breast cancer (1983), as did Doris Stein.&lt;ref name=TheLastMogul&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zV1aziv9CYC&amp;pg=PA531&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q=jones&amp;f=false |title=The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the Hidden History of Hollywood |first=Dennis |last=McDougal |authorlink=Dennis McDougal |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |year=2001 |page=27 |isbn=978-0306810503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein was educated at the Katharine Branson School in [[Ross, California]], then at [[Brillantmont International School]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], after which she graduated from [[Hewitt School|Miss Hewitt's Classes]] in New York City. Thereafter, she spent two years at [[Wellesley College]] and then attended classes at the [[University of Paris]] (formerly known as the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]). While in Paris she interviewed [[William Faulkner]], with whom she had an affair,&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Robins. Alien Ink: The FBI's War on Freedom of Expression (New Brunswick: Rutgers U Press, 1992), pp. 424-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to the historian Joel Williamson, offered the interview to ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in exchange for being made an editor there.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Williamson. William Faulkner and Southern History (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Stein returned to New York and worked in 1955 as assistant to director [[Elia Kazan]] on the original production of [[Tennessee Williams|Tennessee Williams's]] [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning play ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name | id=jean-stein-104252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein was the author of three books and a pioneer of the narrative form of oral history. Her final work was a cultural and political history of Los Angeles, ''West of Eden'', published by [[Random House]] in February 2016. In 1970, Stein authored, with [[George Plimpton]] as editor, a biography of [[Robert F. Kennedy]], titled ''American Journey: The Times of Robert Kennedy''.

With Plimpton, Stein co-wrote the best-selling book ''Edie: American Girl'', based on the life of socialite/actress and [[Andy Warhol]] muse [[Edie Sedgwick]], in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6XCIqw48uSwC&amp;pg=PP13&amp;dq=Jean+Stein+george+Editor+Edie&amp;sig=ACfU3U0LkKRN3-Th98DUOAjo6WjNNtKEZQ  ''Edie: American Girl'' review]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Mailer]] wrote of ''Edie'': "This is the book of the Sixties that we have been waiting for."{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Stein also worked as a magazine editor. In the late 1950s she was an editor, with Plimpton, at ''The Paris Review''. From 1990 to 2004, she was editor of the literary/visual arts magazine ''Grand Street'' with art editor [[Walter Hopps]]. The magazine actively sought out international authors, visual artists, composers and scientists to bring to its readership.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Legacy==
In 2017, Stein partnered with [[PEN American Center|PEN America]] to launch the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award and the PEN/Jean Stein Grant for Oral History to honor groundbreaking literature. The annual $75,000 PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, which is awarded to a book of fiction, memoir, essay, or nonfiction, “focuses global attention on remarkable books that propel experimentation, wit, strength, and the expression of wisdom.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-pen-75000-book-prize-20160720-snap-story.html|title=PEN America launches $75,000 book prize, one of the country's biggest|date=2016-07-20|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hisham Matar]], a Libyan-American writer, won the 2017 inaugural award for his memoir, ''The Return.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pen.org/2017-penjean-stein-book-award|title=2017 PEN/JEAN STEIN BOOK AWARD - PEN America|date=2017-03-27|work=PEN America|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $10,000 PEN/Jean Stein Grant for Oral History is awarded to support the completion of a “literary work of nonfiction that uses oral history to illuminate an event, individual, place, or movement.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pen.org/literary-award/penjean-stein-grant-for-literary-oral-history-10000/|title=PEN/Jean Stein Grant for Literary Oral History ($10,000) - PEN America|work=PEN America|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Stein's first marriage in 1958 was to [[William vanden Heuvel]], a lawyer who served in the U.S. Justice Department under [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and who later also became a diplomat and author. Since 1984, he has been the chairman of the [[Roosevelt Institute]]. Their first daughter, [[Katrina vanden Heuvel]], was born in 1959; she is now the editor and publisher of ''The Nation'' magazine. The couple's second daughter, Wendy vanden Heuvel, was born in 1961, and she is an actress and producer in New York. She is also on the board of the ''52nd Street Project'', which matches inner-city youth with professional theater artists to create original dramatic works.

From 1995 to 2007, Stein was married to [[Torsten Wiesel]], a co-recipient with [[David H. Hubel]] of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Suffering from depression, Stein apparently committed suicide by jumping from her Manhattan apartment on April 30, 2017. She was 83.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/books/jean-stein-dies-chronicled-wealth-fame-and-influence.html?_r=0 |title=Jean Stein, Who Chronicled Wealth, Fame and Influence, Dies at 83 |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |authorlink=Richard Sandomir |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=A25 |date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph William Calzaghe''', {{post-nominals|country=UK|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|l|ˈ|z|æ|ɡ|i}} {{respell|kal|ZAH|gee}}; born 23 March 1972) is a Welsh former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1993 to 2008. He held world championships in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], including the unified [[WBA (Super)]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]], ''[[The Ring (magazine)|Ring]]'' magazine and [[lineal championship|lineal]] [[super-middleweight]] titles, as well as the ''Ring'' [[light-heavyweight]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7638453.stm|work=BBC News|title=Calzaghe ends division domination|date=3 October 2008|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calzaghe is the longest-reigning super-middleweight world champion in boxing history to date, having held the WBO title for over 10 years and making [[World boxing championship records and statistics|21 successful defences]] (the most in super-middleweight history) before moving up to light-heavyweight. As his super-middleweight and light-heavyweight reigns overlapped, he retired with the longest continual time as world champion of any active fighter. He was also the first boxer to unify three of the four major world titles (WBA, WBC, and WBO) at super-middleweight.

Between 2006 and 2008, Calzaghe was rated by ''The Ring'' as one of the world's top ten active boxers, [[The Ring magazine Pound for Pound|pound for pound]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thering-online.com/ringpages/ratings2.html|title=The Ring Ratings|accessdate=23 March 2007|work=The Ring|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315070454/http://www.thering-online.com/ringpages/ratings2.html|archivedate=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching a peak ranking of third in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_100_:_Ranking_the_World%27s_Best_Fighters The Ring 100: Ranking the World's Best Fighters – Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia], Boxrec.com; 1 March 2009; retrieved 19 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in February 2009 with an [[list of undefeated boxing world champions|undefeated record]], and as a reigning world champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7871918.stm|title=Undefeated Calzaghe quits boxing| accessdate=5 February 2009|work=BBC Sport|date=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BoxRec]] currently ranks Calzaghe as the best British super-middleweight of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boxrec.com/en/ratings?r%5Bcountry%5D=UK&amp;r%5Bdivision%5D=Super+Middleweight&amp;r%5Bsex%5D=M&amp;r%5Bstance%5D=&amp;r%5Bstatus%5D=&amp;r_go=|title=BoxRec|website=boxrec.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calzaghe was often referred to as the "Pride of Wales" or the "Italian Dragon",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=18361&amp;more=1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122092927/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=18361&amp;more=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 January 2013|title=East Side Boxing|publisher=East Side Boxing|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being a play on the moniker "Italian Stallion" and a reference to his multiple heritages (the [[dragon]] being both a prominent [[Welsh Dragon|Welsh emblem]] that appears on the [[Welsh flag]] and a figure in [[Sardinia]]n myth).

In 2007, Calzaghe won the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/7135700.stm Calzaghe wins Sports Personality]. BBC News. 9 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; making him the first Welsh winner of this award since [[David Broome]] in 1960. Calzaghe was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/10499252/Joe-Calzaghe-and-promoter-Barry-Hearn-and-inducted-into-the-International-Boxing-Hall-of-Fame.html "Joe Calzaghe and promoter Barry Hearn and inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame"].

==Biography==
Calzaghe was born in Hammersmith, London, to an [[Italian people|Italian]] ([[Sardinian people|Sardinian]]) father, [[Enzo Calzaghe|Enzo]], and a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] mother, Jackie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Calzaghe: My family values|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/06/joe-calzaghe-my-family-values|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Wales]] when he was two years old; their home is at [[Newbridge, Caerphilly|Newbridge]], near [[Caerphilly]], in South Wales. He attended Roots School System and still lives in the area.

==Amateur career==
Calzaghe, a [[southpaw stance|southpaw]], began boxing at age nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/sports/sports-news-round-up/2008/11/08/boxing-joe-calzaghe-chases-his-very-own-fairytale-of-new-york-91466-22209439/ |title=Sports – Sports News – Boxing: Joe Calzaghe chases his very own Fairytale of New York! |publisher=WalesOnline |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more than 120 amateur contests, he won four schoolboy ABA titles, followed by three consecutive senior British ABA titles (British Championships) between 1990 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/justthejob/takeitfromme/star_joec.shtml |title=BBC Online – Just the Job – Take it from me |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly had an amateur record of 112–10. Calzaghe received his last defeats at the hands of Michael Smyth in the 1990 Welsh ABA Final and [[Romanian people|Romanian]] amateur Adrian Opreda at the 1990 European Junior Championships in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth  P ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/7346607.stm How to stop Joe Calzaghe]''BBC report, 15 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090211171619/http://calzaghe.com/pages/about_joe/biography.html Biography]'' on Joe Calzaghe's official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
In September 1993 Calzaghe was signed up and made his professional debut at [[Cardiff Arms Park]] on the [[Lennox Lewis vs. Frank Bruno]] bill the following month, halting 23 fight veteran Paul Hanlon in one round. By September 1995, Calzaghe had won thirteen out of thirteen fights, including seven in the first round and two in the second, including quickfire victories over the highly experienced American duo of Frank Minton and Robert Curry, with only the fully fledged British Light Heavyweight Bobbie Joe Edwards lasting the distance.

In October 1995, Calzaghe won the vacant [[BBBofC|British]] [[super-middleweight]] title, stopping the previously unbeaten Stephen Wilson in the eighth round.

At the end of 1995, Calzaghe was voted Young Boxer of the Year by the Professional Boxing Association and the Boxing Writers' Club, with [[Barry McGuigan]]'s top tipping Calzaghe for 1996: "He punches ferociously, moves superbly and has the best of the European technique and US aggression."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.men-arena.com/about/?page_id=1176 World Championship Boxing presents Joe Calzaghe]'' Manchester Evening News, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After beginning 1996 with two more quick knockouts over Guy Stanford and Anthony Brooks, he successfully defended his British title with an easier-than-expected fifth round stoppage of the tough undefeated puncher [[Mark Delaney (boxer)|Mark Delaney]] (21–0). Despite Delaney being a good fighter in his own right, Calzaghe's critics said that he had still not really been tested. Calzaghe said in reply that he could only beat whoever was out there and prepared to fight him. Calzaghe rounded off the year with victories over two experienced opponents in Warren Stowe and [[Pat Lawlor]].

In November 1996, Calzaghe moved to [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]]'s stable. Warren, who had managed [[Nigel Benn]] for his first twenty fights, declared: "Joe Calzaghe is a far better prospect, in fact he is my fighter for the new millennium."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkboxing.co.uk/guides/boxing_legends_joe_calzaghe.html |title=Joe Calzaghe – A Boxing Legend Profile |publisher=Talkboxing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe continued his winning ways in 1997, defeating Carlos Christie, the unbeaten [[Tyler Hughes]] and the 45–2 Luciano Torres. Meanwhile, Warren spent the summer of 1997 chasing a fight for Calzaghe with either [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Champion [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]] or Irish [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Champion [[Steve Collins]]. The fight with Collins was arranged, but at a late stage Collins withdrew because of injury, was stripped of his title, and then retired.

===WBO super-middleweight champion===
After Collins retired, a fight against British boxing legend [[Chris Eubank]] was quickly set up for the vacant WBO title on 11 October 1997, in [[Sheffield]]. Calzaghe emerged victorious over the two-time WBO champion, knocking the granite chinned Eubank down in the opening seconds and claiming a unanimous points win. The judges scored the contest 118–110, 118–109, and 116–111 in favour of Calzaghe. Eubank said of Calzaghe in a 2006 interview that: "Joe is the proper article, a true warrior."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxingandmma/joecalzaghe/3386601/Top-10-Joe-Calzaghes-most-important-fights.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Top 10: Joe Calzaghe's most important bouts | first=Huw | last=Turbervill | date=5 February 2009 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe conceded that Eubank, even in his comeback, gave him the toughest fight of his life.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

In 1998 he defended his title against [[Branko Sobot]] (winning by [[technical knockout]] in 3 rounds). Sobot was a late replacement for Syrian-American [[Tarick Salmaci]],&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/50336.stm | work=BBC News | title=Calzaghe cruises to WBO defence | date=25 January 1998 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pulled out after a row with his management.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Sobot was knocked down in the third round, he beat the count but immediately came under renewed punishment from Calzaghe,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; forcing the referee to step in at 1:35 of the third round.

Calzaghe then went on to defeat perennial contender [[Juan Carlos Gimenez Ferreyra]] (TKO in 10 rounds), a former opponent of both [[Nigel Benn]] and Chris Eubank.

In 1999, Calzaghe started out by fighting his domestic rival, [[Robin Reid (boxer)|Robin Reid]]. Calzaghe was bitter that Reid refused to face him whilst holding the WBC Championship in a unification bout and vowed to beat him. After twelve rounds, the judges scored the fight for Calzaghe via a split decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mostbeautifulman.com/athletes/robinreid/bio.shtml |title=Robin Reid – pictures, picture, pics, images, gallery, info, bio, gossip, shirtless, photos, videos, band, lyrics, songs |publisher=Mostbeautifulman.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114173153/http://www.mostbeautifulman.com/athletes/robinreid/bio.shtml |archivedate=14 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid was never given the opportunity of a rematch. Calzaghe damaged his hand early on in the fight and according to Calzaghe, he suffered a dose of food poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exodine.com/boxing/joe-calzaghe.html |title=Joe Calzaghe Boxing &amp;#124; Calzaghe Vs Hopkins Boxing Fight Tickets |publisher=Exodine.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119212038/http://www.exodine.com/boxing/joe-calzaghe.html |archive-date=19 January 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe finished the year with another points win against Australian Rick Thornberry, where he again injured his hand after looking like overwhelming his opponent early.

2000 started with another points decision against fellow Briton [[David Starie]]. This was followed by wins against [[Omar Sheika]] (who was coming off a win over [[Glen Johnson (boxer)|Glenn Johnson]]) by fifth-round stoppage, and former WBC world champion and close friend [[Richie Woodhall]] in ten rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/976045.stm | work=BBC News | title=Calzaghe-Woodhall – the countdown | date=17 October 2000 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2001 started with an impressive first-round-stoppage win over the unbeaten German No 1 contender [[Mario Veit]] (30–0), followed by a win against American contender Will McIntyre on the [[Mike Tyson]]–[[Brian Nielsen (boxer)|Brian Nielsen]] undercard in [[Copenhagen]] Denmark, marking his first defence outside Britain. Calzaghe dropped him in the third round with a ferocious left uppercut, although McIntyre managed to survive the count.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/1597994.stm | work=BBC News | title=Calzaghe douses Kid Fire | date=13 October 2001 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the end was near, Calzaghe dropped McIntyre again at the start of the fourth and this time the referee stopped proceedings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

2002 started with unanimous points wins against former [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] world champion [[Charles Brewer (boxer)|Charles Brewer]] of the United States in Cardiff, followed by a quick TKO of American Tocker Pudwill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishboxing.net/fights_561-Joe-Calzaghe-vs-Tocker-Pudwill.html |title=Boxing Fights |publisher=BritishBoxing.net |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314144110/http://www.britishboxing.net/fights_561-Joe-Calzaghe-vs-Tocker-Pudwill.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who took the fight at very short notice as a replacement for the injured [[Thomas Tate (boxer)|Thomas Tate]], in Newcastle in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/Calzaghe-vs-Pudwill-Result.php |title=Calzaghe and Hatton score easy wins in Newcastle |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207041026/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/Calzaghe-vs-Pudwill-Result.php |archivedate=7 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the win, Calzaghe successfully defended his WBO super-middleweight title for the 12th time. After the fight, Calzaghe said: "I'm one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world. I want to be remembered as one of the best British boxers ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/2570217.stm | work=BBC News | title=Calzaghe destroys Pudwill | date=14 December 2002 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calzaghe's only fight of 2003 was in June against another former world champion, in the shape of American [[Byron Mitchell]] at the [[Cardiff International Arena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing-calzaghes-world-title-under-threat-from-mitchell-541990.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Boxing: Calzaghe's world title under threat from Mitchell | first=Steve | last=Bunce | date=27 June 2003 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe won by [[knockout|TKO]] in the second.

2004 started out with a defence against Armenian contender Mger Mkrtchian in Cardiff where he won easily by a seventh-round knockout, followed by a points win over Egyptian-American [[Kabary Salem]] in [[Edinburgh]] in October, during which Calzaghe was briefly knocked down in the fourth round by a right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=147 |title=Joe Calzaghe Nearly Derailed – Boxing News |publisher=Boxingscene.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Calzaghe was not hurt, and he dominated the fight and knocked Salem down in the 12th round, winning comfortably on all three scorecards, 116–109, 117–109 and 118–107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/statistics/1235868.stm | work=BBC News | title=Results from 2004 | date=4 January 2005 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario Veit worked his way to a rematch against Calzaghe in [[Braunschweig]], Germany, in July 2005, marking Calzaghe's second defence on foreign soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishboxing.net/news_678-Calzaghe-can-t-Veit-to-make-Mario-pay.html |title=Latest Boxing News |publisher=BritishBoxing.net |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314144115/http://www.britishboxing.net/news_678-Calzaghe-can-t-Veit-to-make-Mario-pay.html |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe beat Veit by technical knockout in the sixth round. On 10 September 2005, Calzaghe fought the [[Kenyan|Kenya]] boxer [[Evans Ashira]] and won by a comfortable unanimous decision over the former Middleweight title challenger, despite breaking his left hand in the third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2007-04-10-1302554252_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Calzaghe breaks left hand in 20th title defense against Manfredo | date=10 April 2007 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe fought on one-handed winning 120–108, 120–108, 120–107.

====Calzaghe vs. Lacy====
{{main article|Joe Calzaghe vs. Jeff Lacy}}
His scheduled unification bout with IBF super-middleweight champion [[Jeff Lacy]] for 4 November 2005 was initially canceled due to the break sustained to the metacarpal in his left hand. Warren successfully rescheduled it for 5 March 2006, and the match was won by easy unanimous points decision over Lacy, who was a pre-fight favourite with the bookmakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| publisher = BBC Sport
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American pundits alike. Calzaghe dominated throughout the fight, with British fight fans chanting "easy" at the American during the last three rounds. Calzaghe gained the IBF title and won every round despite a point being deducted in the 11th for an illegal behind the body punch. He also won the vacant ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' and [[Lineal championship|lineal]] titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/supermid.htm|title=Joe Calzaghe - Lineal Super Middleweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first super-middleweight to be recognized as world champion by ''The Ring'' magazine.
 
On 14 October 2006, the tough Cameroonian-Australian [[Sakio Bika]] challenged Calzaghe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/boxing/events/2006/1014_calzaghe_bika/columns/gottlieb_profile.html |title=Boxing: All Fights : Upcoming |publisher=HBO |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two points were deducted from Bika for head butts, one of which led to a severe cut over Calzaghe's left eye&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staniforth |first=Mark |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/top-stories/Calzaghe-overcomes-the-cut-and.2818792.jp |title=Calzaghe overcomes the cut and thrust of Bika to win in ugly style – Scotsman.com Sport |publisher=Sport.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would cause him problems for the duration of the bout. However, Calzaghe won the fight by clear decision to continue his undefeated run.

On 27 November 2006, it was announced that Calzaghe had signed a contract to defend his WBO super-middleweight title against former star of ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]'' [[Peter Manfredo Jr.]] of the United States on 7 April 2007, at [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff, Wales to be shown on [[HBO]]. Because HBO did not want to cover a fight with the non-American mandatory IBF challenger [[Robert Stieglitz]] of Germany, and with the opportunity to fight World Middleweight champion Jermaine Taylor in the summer if he won against Manfredo, Calzaghe chose to fight Manfredo and as a result had to relinquish the IBF super-middleweight championship. Both Calzaghe and Warren claimed that, "Stieglitz doesn't mean anything outside Germany."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/6175236.stm | work=BBC News | title=Calzaghe relinquishes IBF title | date=27 November 2006 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stieglitz went on to fight [[Alejandro Berrio]] for the vacant IBF title, losing in 3 rounds. Berrio in turn lost the title to [[Lucian Bute]] in his first defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Human:22445 |title=Alejandro Berrio – Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2007, Calzaghe met Peter Manfredo Jr. in front of 35,000 fans in [[Cardiff, Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/03/boxing.joecalzaghe | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Calzaghe's heavyweight dream | first=John | last=Rawling | date=3 April 2007 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe was victorious on a third-round stoppage, unleashing a flurry of punches on the outclassed Manfredo, who threw nothing in return, thus drawing a stoppage from the referee.
Manfredo and some American commentators called the stoppage premature because Manfredo did not appear hurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/6530845.stm | work=BBC News | title=Calzaghe too strong for Manfredo | date=7 April 2007 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; HBO's ringside announcers declared that the stoppage was "way too quick." Trainer [[Emanuel Steward]] did contend that Calzaghe was clearly on his way to victory, but the stoppage was no fault of his own.

====Calzaghe vs. Kessler====
[[File:Joe Calzaghe crop.jpg|thumb|right|Calzaghe in 2007]]
{{main article|Joe Calzaghe vs. Mikkel Kessler}}
In May 2007, [[Frank Warren (promoter)|Frank Warren]] released details to [[BBC 5 Live]] and on his website that Calzaghe had accepted Mogens Palle's offer of [[USD|$]]5 million to fight undefeated WBA world champion [[Mikkel Kessler]]. The bout took place at Cardiff's [[Millennium Stadium]] on 4 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/6280484.stm|title=Calzaghe-Kessler set Cardiff date|work=BBC Sport|date=11 July 2007|accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was a unification bout for the WBO, ''The Ring'', [[World Boxing Association|WBA (Super)]] and [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] super-middleweight titles. Calzaghe won by [[unanimous decision]], surpassing the 20 defences made by [[Bernard Hopkins]] and [[Larry Holmes]] at [[middleweight]] and [[heavyweight]] respectively.&lt;ref name="usat"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2007-11-03-calzaghe-kessler_N.htm|title=Calzaghe beats Kessler to unify belts, eyes Hopkins|last=Johnson|first=Chuck|date=3 November 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="secondsout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondsout.com/reports/index.cfm?ccs=529&amp;cs=23157|title=Calzaghe Outboxes Kessler To Become Undisputed World Champion|publisher=SecondsOut.com|author=Paul Upham|date=4 November 2007|accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |agency=Reuters|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/calzaghe-the-undisputed-king/2007/11/04/1194117877368.html|title=Calzaghe the undisputed king|date=5 November 2007|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only former [[heavyweight]] champion [[Joe Louis]] (with 25 defences), former [[light heavyweight]] champion [[Dariusz Michalczewski]] (23 defences), former [[minimumweight]] champion [[Ricardo López (boxer)|Ricardo López]] (23 defences), and former heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko (23 defences) have made more title defences.

Calzaghe split with promoter Frank Warren in June 2008 and announced that he would promote his fights personally for the remainder of his career. The split caused Warren to launch a court case against Calzaghe, claiming that a verbal promise to promote the [[Roy Jones Jr.]] fight was broken and that Calzaghe owed him $1.4 million;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7469896.stm | work=BBC News | title=Calzaghe ends Warren association | date=24 June 2008 | accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe in turn claimed that Warren owed him past fees. In March 2009 the High Court ruled that Warren had persuaded Calzaghe to sign contracts under [[duress]] when Calzaghe was hungry and [[dehydrated]] preparing for matches and that Warren's company Sports Network Limited owed Calzaghe $2.8 million in unpaid fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/03/16/sports/AP-BOX-Calzaghe-Warren.html?_r=1 Calzaghe Wins Court Battle Against Promoter] NY Times, 16 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Calzaghe vs. Hopkins====
{{Main article|Bernard Hopkins vs. Joe Calzaghe}}
On 19 April 2008, at the [[Thomas &amp; Mack Center]] in [[Las Vegas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/box/news?slug=ki-fightchart041808&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Fight breakdown: Hopkins-Calzaghe – Boxing – Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe defeated [[Bernard Hopkins]] to win ''The Ring'' Light Heavyweight Championship by a split decision in his first ever fight in the United States. 

Calzaghe did not get off to a good start. In the first round, Hopkins struck him with a right hand, knocking him down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iole |first=Kevin |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/box/news?slug=ki-boxscoring041908&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Hopkins-Calzaghe round-by-round – Boxing – Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the rounds went on, Calzaghe continued to push the pace and began to get his rhythm going by landing combinations at close range. Hopkins’ key weapon was his right hand, but after a few rounds Calzaghe could see the right hands coming and easily blocked the shots whilst Hopkins gradually tired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=15323&amp;more=1 |title=Sharkie's Machine: White Boy Beats Bernard Hopkins |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |date=20 April 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[CompuBox]], Calzaghe landed more punches on Hopkins than any of his previous opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2008-04-20-calzaghe-hopkins-folo_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='Legend killer' Calzaghe overcomes Hopkins | date=20 April 2008 | accessdate=6 May 2010 | first=J. Michael | last=Falgoust}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Judges Chuck Giampa (116–111) and Ted Gimza (115–112) scored the fight clearly for Calzaghe, while judge Adalaide Byrd (114–113) scored the fight narrowly for Hopkins. HBO's unofficial ringside judge [[Harold Lederman]] scored the bout 116–111 for Calzaghe.

Hopkins was upset with the official decision and said that he was robbed of a clear points win. Hopkins said, "I just really feel like I took the guy to school. I feel like I made him fight my fight, not his. I wanted him to run into my shots. I think I made him do that, and I think I made it look pretty easy. I think I controlled the pace, and I controlled the fight." He has also openly stated that he wanted a rematch with Calzaghe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=17615&amp;more=1 |title=Bernard Hopkins Still Wants Rematch With Calzaghe, Says He'll KO Joe This Time! |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calzaghe said: "It was one of the toughest fights of my career. ... He is very clever. He was so awkward. It wasn't pretty, but I won the fight. ... It wasn't my best night, but I know I won."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7355823.stm | work=BBC News | first=Ben | last=Dirs | title=Calzaghe rallies to beat Hopkins | date=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The first four rounds, and after that Calzaghe got in his groove, much like he did when he fought Mikkel Kessler, and from that point on it was Calzaghe. And Calzaghe didn't fight as good a fight as he could've fought, and he still won decisively," [[Emanuel Steward]] said at ringside.

On 5 February 2009, Joe Calzaghe announced his retirement from professional boxing, finishing with a record of 46 wins and no losses, and becoming one of only fifteen world champions ([[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Andre Ward]], [[Kim Ji-won (boxer)|Ji-won Kim]], [[Terry Marsh (boxer)|Terry Marsh]], [[Pichit Sitbangprachan]], [[Harry Simon (boxer)|Harry Simon]], [[Jimmy Barry]], [[Jack McAuliffe (boxer)|Jack McAuliffe]], [[Ricardo Lopez (boxer)|Ricardo Lopez]], [[Michael Loewe (boxer)|Michael Loewe]], [[Edwin Valero]], [[Sven Ottke]], and [[Dmitry Pirog]]) to retire as an undefeated world champion.&lt;ref name="BeebRetire"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7871918.stm|title=Undefeated Calzaghe quits boxing|date=5 February 2009|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement, fellow boxer and friend, [[Ricky Hatton]] described him as "the best British fighter we've ever had."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/7873582.stm| title = Hatton hails Calzaghe as the best| accessdate = 6 February 2009| publisher = BBC Sport | date=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BoxRec]] rates Calzaghe as the best super-middleweight of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxrec.com/ratings.php?country=&amp;sex=m&amp;division=Super+Middleweight&amp;status=E&amp;SUBMIT=Go Boxer Lb for Lb Ratings]. boxrec.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after boxing==
Following his retirement from boxing, Calzaghe started his own boxing [[promoter (entertainment)|promotion]] company, Calzaghe Promotions, with his father [[Enzo Calzaghe]].&lt;ref name="Only Hatton can decide – Calzaghe"&gt;{{cite news | title = Only Hatton can decide – Calzaghe | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/8054350.stm | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 18 May 2009 | accessdate = 18 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[GMTV]], Calzaghe stated he is promoting the Beat Bullying campaign. He is said to have found the inspiration from being a victim of bullying himself when he was young, saying he got bullied because of his small stature.

Calzaghe won the [[Soccer Aid|2010 Soccer Aid]], a British [[Charitable organization|charity]] football match with the Rest of the World team beating England, and Joe scored the Rest of the World team's first goal. The game was tied after full-time but the Rest of the World won on penalties.

In 2012, Calzaghe made a cameo appearance as himself in an episode of the UK TV comedy drama ''[[Stella (UK TV series)|Stella]]''.

==Personal life==
Calzaghe has two sons, Joe (born 1994) and Connor (born 1997), from an 11-year marriage to Mandy Davies from 1994 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100129003313/http://www.joecalzaghe.com/about-joe.aspx About Joe] joecalzaghe.com&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe split up with his girlfriend of 5 years, Jo-Emma Larvin, in 2009, after participating in the seventh series of the BBC's ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' series, partnering with Russian professional [[Kristina Rihanoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2009/08/26/joe-calzaghe-could-be-strictly-champion-says-kristina-91466-24533949/|title=Calzaghe could be Strictly Champion|publisher=Wales Online|date=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calzaghe and Rihanoff began a relationship soon thereafter. However, the couple announced the amicable breakup of their relationship in August 2013.

Following an undercover investigation by the ''[[News of the World]]'' newspaper, Calzaghe admitted he had used cocaine since his boxing career had ended. In a statement on his website, he added that he regretted his "occasional use of cocaine in what have sometimes been the long days since my retirement from the ring".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joecalzaghe.com/latest-news/joe-calzaghe.aspx |title=An Apology |publisher=joecalzaghe.com |date=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401102741/http://www.joecalzaghe.com/latest-news/joe-calzaghe.aspx |archivedate=1 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[aphorism]] "'''know thyself'''" ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|γνῶθι σεαυτόν}}, transliterated: ''{{lang|grc-Latn|gnōthi seauton}}''; also {{lang|grc|... σαυτόν}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|… sauton}}'' with [[crasis|the ε contracted]]), is one of the [[Delphic maxims]] and was inscribed in the [[pronaos]] (forecourt) of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo at Delphi]] according to the Greek writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (10.24.1).&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.24&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 Paus. 10.24].&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was later expounded upon by the philosopher [[Socrates]] who taught that:

In [[Latin]] the phrase, "know thyself," is given as ''nosce te ipsum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nosce%20te%20ipsum |title=Nosce te ipsum - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''temet nosce''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Ancient-Languages-2210/Know-thyself.htm |title=AllExperts.com: temet nosce |publisher=allexperts.com |date= |accessdate=17 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231172656/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Ancient-Languages-2210/Know-thyself.htm |archivedate=31 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim, or aphorism, "know thyself" has had a variety of meanings attributed to it in literature.

==Attribution==
According to a proposal by De Lubicz and Lamy (1956), the Greek aphorism may have been adopted from [[Ancient Egypt]]: there are two parts of the ancient [[Luxor Temple]], the External Temple, where the beginners were allowed to enter and the Internal Temple where a person was only allowed to enter after proven worthy and ready to acquire more knowledge and insights. One of the proverbs of the External Temple is "The body is the house of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Lubicz|first1=Isha Schwaller|last2=Lamy|first2=Lucie||title=Her-Bak: The Living Face of Ancient Egypt|date=1954|publisher=Hodder and Staughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the Internal Temple, one of the many proverbs is "Man, know thyself, and you are going to know the gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Lubicz|first1=Isha Schwaller|last2=Lamy|first2=Lucie|title=Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate|date=1978|publisher=Inner Traditions International}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Greek aphorism has been attributed to at least the following [[Seven Sages of Greece|ancient Greek sages]]:
* [[Bias of Priene]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bias of Priene]], in Plato's Protagoras (343a-343b) Socrates lists Bias as one of the seven sources of the Delphic maxims including "Know Thyself." &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text%3DProt.:section%3D343a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Periander]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 10.24.1 mentions a controversy over whether Periander should be listed as the seventh sage instead of Myson.  But Socrates who is cited by Pausanias as his source supports Myson. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.24&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 Paus. 10.24]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pittacus of Mytilene]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pittacus of Mitylene]], in Plato's Protagoras (343a-343b) Socrates lists Pittacus as one of the seven sages who were sources of the Delphic maxims including "Know Thyself." &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text%3DProt.:section%3D343a&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pythagoras]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* [[Socrates]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates]], Socrates refers to it in Plato's Philebus 48c, and Phaedrus 229e as a saying of Delphi.  The Tufts Perseus web site shows Philebus text as: &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text=Phileb.:section=48c&amp;highlight=thyself,know&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] attributes it to Thales (''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|Lives]]'' I.40), but also notes that Antisthenes in his ''Successions of Philosophers'' attributes it to [[Phemonoe]], a mythical Greek poet, though admitting that it was appropriated by Chilon. In a discussion of moderation and self-awareness, the Roman poet [[Juvenal]] quotes the phrase in Greek and states that the precept descended ''e caelo'' (from heaven) (''[[Satires of Juvenal#Satire XI: Dinner and a Moral|Satires]]'' 11.27).  The 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia the ''[[Suda]]'' recognized Chilon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/gamma/333&lt;/ref&gt; and Thales&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/theta/17&lt;/ref&gt; as the sources of the maxim "Know Thyself."

The authenticity of all such attributions is doubtful; according to Parke  and Wormell (1956), "The actual authorship of the three maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages."&lt;ref&gt;H. Parke and D. Wormell, ''The Delphic Oracle'', (Basil Blackwell, 1956), vol. 1, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, T., [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Cj0ueSqyVQC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Delphic Oracle: Its Early History, Influence &amp; Fall''], Oxford : B.H.

==Usage==
Listed chronologically:
===By Aeschylus===
The ancient Greek playwright [[Aeschylus]] uses the maxim "know thyself" in his play ''[[Prometheus Bound]].'' The play about a mythological sequence, thereby places the maxim within the context of Greek mythology. In this play, the demi-god [[Prometheus]] first rails at the Olympian gods, and against what he believes to be the injustice of his having been bound to a cliffside by Zeus, king of the Olympian gods.  The demi-god [[Oceanus]] comes to Prometheus to reason with him, and cautions him that he should "know thyself".&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheys Bound'', [https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%82_%CE%94%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82 v. 309]: ''γίγνωσκε σαυτὸν''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, Oceanus is telling Prometheus that he should know better than to speak ill of the one who decides his fate and accordingly, perhaps he should better know his place in the "great order of things."

===By Socrates===
One of [[Socrates|Socrates's]] students, the historian [[Xenophon]], described some of the instances of Socrates's use of the Delphic maxim 'Know Thyself' in his history titled: ''Memorabilia.''  In this writing, Xenophon portrayed his teacher's use of the maxim as an organizing theme for Socrates's lengthy dialogue with Euthydemus.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon describes Socrates use of 'Know Thyself' in Memorabilia 4.2.24 &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0208:book%3D4:chapter%3D2:section%3D24&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===By Plato===
[[Plato]], another student of Socrates, employs the maxim 'Know Thyself' extensively by having the character of Socrates use it to motivate his dialogues.  Benjamin Jowett's index to his translation of the ''[[Dialogues of Plato]]'' lists six dialogues which discuss or explore the Delphic maxim: 'know thyself.' These dialogues (and the [[Stephanus numbers]] indexing the pages where these discussions begin) are ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'' (164D), ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' (343B), ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (229E), ''[[Philebus]]'' (48C), ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' (II.923A), ''[[First Alcibiades|Alcibiades I]]'' (124A, 129A, 132C).&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], The Dialogues of Plato translated into English with Analyses and Introductions by [[Benjamin Jowett]], M.A. in Five Volumes. 3rd edition revised and corrected (Oxford University Press, 1892), (See Index: Knowledge; 'know thyself' at Delphi).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'', Critias refers to the maxim consistently with the view expressed in the ''[[Suda]]'', with Critias saying, "for they imagined that 'Know Thyself!' was a piece of advice which the god gave and not his salutation of the worshippers at their first coming in."&lt;ref&gt;Critias states the meaning of 'know thyself' in Plato's Charmides (165a),&lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0176:text%3DCharm.:section%3D165a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern words Critias gives his opinion that 'Know Thyself!' was an admonition to those entering the sacred temple to remember or know their place and Critias says, " 'know thyself!' and 'be temperate!' are the same.  Notice that when the words of Critias are written, 'thyself' and 'temperate' are punctuated with exclamation marks in the English translations, as if they were commands.&lt;ref&gt;Critias says 'know thyself!' and 'be temperate!' are the same in Plato's Charmides (164e), &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0176:text%3DCharm.:section%3D164e&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the balance of the ''Charmides'', Plato has Socrates lead a longer inquiry as to how we may gain knowledge of ourselves.

In Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', Socrates uses the maxim 'know thyself' as his explanation to Phaedrus to explain why he has no time for the attempts to rationally explain mythology or other far flung topics. Socrates says, "But I have no leisure for them at all; and the reason, my friend, is this: I am not yet able, as the Delphic inscription has it, to know myself; so it seems to me ridiculous, when I do not yet know that, to investigate irrelevant things."&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates]] uses the saying 'know thyself' to explain what is important for him to know. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text%3DPhaedrus:section%3D229e&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Socrates lauds the authors of [[Laconic phrase|pithy and concise sayings]] delivered precisely at the right moment and says that Lacedaemon, or [[Sparta]], educates its people to that end.  Socrates lists the Seven Sages as Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Solon, Cleobulus, Myson, and Chilon, who he says are gifted in that Lacedaemonian art of concise words "twisted together, like a bowstring, where a slight effort gives great force."&lt;ref&gt;Socrates lists the authors of Delphi's sayings. &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Prot.+343a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates says examples of them are, "the far-famed inscriptions, which are in all men's mouths,--'Know thyself,' and 'Nothing too much'.".&lt;ref&gt;Socrates seeks to understand 'Know thyself' as pithy, concise wisdom.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text%3DProt.:section%3D343b&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Having lauded the maxims, Socrates then spends a great deal of time getting to the bottom of what one of them means, the saying of Pittacus, 'Hard is it to be good.'  The irony here is that although the sayings of Delphi bear 'great force,' it is not clear how to live life in accordance with their meanings.  Although, the concise and broad nature of the sayings suggests the active partaking in the usage and personal discovery of each maxim; as if the intended nature of the saying lay not in the words but the self-reflection and self-referencing of the person thereof.
 
In Plato's ''[[Philebus]]'' dialogue, Socrates refers back to the same usage of 'know thyself' from ''Phaedrus'' to build an example of the ridiculous for Protarchus.  Socrates says, as he did in Phaedrus, that people make themselves appear ridiculous when they are trying to know obscure things before they know themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates use of 'Know thyself' in Philebus (48c) http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Phileb.+48c&amp;fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174&lt;/ref&gt; Plato also alluded to the fact that understanding 'thyself,' would have a greater yielded factor of understanding the nature of a human being. Syllogistically, understanding oneself would enable thyself to have an understanding of others as a result.

===Later usage===
[[File:Antropomorpha12c.png|thumb|right|Detail from the 6th edition of Linnaeus' ''Systema Naturae'' (1748). "HOMO. ''Nosce te ipsum''."]]

The ''[[Suda]]'', a 10th-century encyclopedia of Greek knowledge, says: "the proverb is applied to those whose boasts exceed what they are",&lt;ref&gt;'Know Thyself' as an admonition, in "Know Thyself". ''Suda'' On Line. Tr. Catherine Roth. 13 Aug 2002. 15 Feb 2011 &lt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/gamma/333&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "know thyself" is a warning to pay no attention to the opinion of the multitude.&lt;ref&gt;'Know the value of Thyself' rightly, in  "Know Thyself". ''Suda'' On Line. Tr. Catherine Roth. 13 Aug 2002. 15 Feb 2011 &lt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/gamma/334&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

One work by the Medieval philosopher [[Peter Abelard]] is entitled ''Scito te ipsum'' (“know yourself”) or ''Ethica''.

From 1539 onwards the phrase ''nosce te ipsum'' and its Latin variants were often used in the anonymous texts written for [[Anatomical Fugitive Sheet|anatomical fugitive sheets]] printed in Venice as well as for later anatomical atlases printed throughout Europe. The 1530s fugitive sheets are the first instances in which the phrase was applied to knowledge of the human body attained through dissection.&lt;ref&gt;William Schupbach, The Paradox of Rembrandt's "Anatomy of Dr. Tulp (Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine: London, 1982), pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1651 [[Thomas Hobbes]] used the term ''nosce teipsum'' which he translated as 'read thyself' in his famous work, ''[[The Leviathan]]''. He was responding to a popular philosophy at the time that you can learn more by studying others than you can from reading books. He asserts that one learns more by studying oneself: particularly the feelings that influence our thoughts and motivate our actions. As Hobbes states, "but to teach us that for the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man, to the thoughts and passions of another, whosoever looketh into himself and considereth what he doth when he does think, opine, reason, hope, fear, etc., and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know what are the thoughts and passions of all other men upon the like occasions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |title=The Leviathan |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html |work=Civil peace and social unity through perfect government |publisher=Oregon State University: Phl 302, Great Voyages: the History of Western Philosophy from 1492-1776, Winter 1997 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127130924/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734 [[Alexander Pope]] wrote a poem entitled "An Essay on Man, Epistle II", which begins "Know then thyself, presume not God to scan, The proper study of mankind is Man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Pope]] begins his Essay on Man Epistle II "Know then thyself."&lt;http://www.harpers.org/archive/2008/03/hbc-90002748&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1735 [[Carl Linnaeus]] published the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in which he described humans (''[[Homo]]'') with the simple phrase "''Nosce te ipsum''".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=_XUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Linnaeus%201735%20%22nosce%20te%20ipsum%22&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=Linnaeus%201735%20%22nosce%20te%20ipsum%22&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750 [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'', observed the great difficulty of knowing one's self, with: "There are three Things extremely hard, Steel, a Diamond, and to know one's self." &lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Franklin]] observes that it is extremely hard to know oneself. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=MYkTAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Autobiography%2C%20Sayings%20of%20Poor%20Richard%2C%20Letters&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754 [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] lauded the "inscription of the Temple at Delphi" in his ''[[Discourse on the Origin of Inequality]]''.

In 1831, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote a poem entitled "Γνώθι Σεαυτόν", or Gnothi Seauton ('Know Thyself'), on the theme of 'God in thee.' The poem was an anthem to Emerson's belief that to 'know thyself' meant knowing the [[God]] which Emerson felt existed within each person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] Gnothe Seauton, Poem 1831. &lt;http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/poems/gnothi.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 [[Samuel T. Coleridge]] wrote a poem entitled "Self Knowledge" in which the text centers on the Delphic maxim 'Know Thyself' beginning, 'Gnôthi seauton!--and is this the prime And heaven-sprung adage of the olden time!--' and ending with 'Ignore thyself, and strive to know thy God!' Coleridge's text references JUVENAL, xi. 27.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel T. Coleridge]] wrote the poem 'Self Knowledge' discussing 'Gnôthi seauton' or know thyself. &lt;http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/37203/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] has his 16th-century alter ego in his letter to Francis Bacon mention a book he intended to call ''Nosce te ipsum''.

In 1904 Sarah Ida Shaw and Elanor Dorcas Pond founded the [[Delta Delta Delta]] fraternity. Part of their motto is Self-Knowledge, Self-Reverence, and Self-Discipline.

[[The Wachowskis]] used one of the Latin versions (''temet nosce'') of this aphorism as inscription over the Oracle's door in their movies ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Temet+Nosce%22%22The+Matrix%22+Oracle occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://patrickmcgrath.blogspot.it/2011/01/know-thyself-most-important-art-lesson.html#.Uk2k-NdxNok | title="Know Thyself".

"Know Thyself" is the motto of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], of [[Lyceum International School]] (Nugegoda, Sri Lanka) and of [[İpek University]] (Ankara, Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130317114755/http://www.ipek.edu.tr/ ipek.edu.tr].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nosce te ipsum'' is also the motto for the [[Thompson (surname)|Scottish clan Thompson]]. It is featured on the family crest or coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thompson Surname, Family Crest &amp; Coats of Arms |url=https://www.houseofnames.com/thompson-family-crest |website=House of Names |accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in the Universe}}

The possibility of [[life]] on [[Mars]] is a subject of significant interest to [[astrobiology]] due to its proximity and similarities to [[Earth]]. To date, no proof has been found of past or present life on Mars. Cumulative evidence shows that during the ancient [[Noachian]] time period, the surface environment of Mars had liquid water and may have been [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] for microorganisms. The existence of habitable conditions does not necessarily indicate the presence of life.

Scientific searches for evidence of life began in the 19th century, and they continue today via telescopic investigations and deployed probes. While early work focused on phenomenology and bordered on fantasy, the modern [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] has emphasized the search for [[Water on Mars|water]], chemical [[biosignature]]s in the soil and rocks at the planet's surface, and [[biomarker]] gases in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120003707 |title=The Search for Life on Mars |last=Mumma |first=Michael J. |date=January 8, 2012 |conference=Origin of Life Gordon Research Conference |location=Galveston, TX |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604111239/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120003707 |archivedate=June 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth’s Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=September 12, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=September 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912225220/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |archivedate=September 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mars is of particular interest for the study of the origins of life because of its similarity to the early Earth. This is especially so since Mars has a cold climate and lacks [[plate tectonics]] or [[continental drift]], so it has remained almost unchanged since the end of the [[Hesperian]] period. At least two-thirds of Mars's surface is more than 3.5 billion years old, and Mars may thus hold the best record of the prebiotic conditions leading to [[abiogenesis]], even if life does not or has never existed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/RG027i002p00189 |title=The early environment and its evolution on Mars: Implication for life |date=1989 |last=McKay |first=Christopher P. |last2=Stoker |first2=Carol R. |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=189–214|bibcode = 1989RvGeo..27..189M |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231452 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fromproto"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2007prpl.conf..929G |arxiv=astro-ph/0602008 |title=From Protoplanets to Protolife: The Emergence and Maintenance of Life |last=Gaidos |first=Eric |last2=Selsis |first2=Franck |date=2007 |pages=929–44 |journal=Protostars and Planets V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings of organic compounds inside sedimentary rocks and of [[boron]] on Mars are of interest as they are precursors for prebiotic chemistry.

In June 2018 NASA announced the detection of seasonal variation of methane levels on Mars.

{{Double image|right|Karte Mars Schiaparelli MKL1888.png|220|Lowell Mars channels.jpg|220|Historical map of Mars from [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]]|Mars canals illustrated by astronomer [[Percival Lowell]], 1898}}
[[Martian polar ice caps|Mars' polar ice caps]] were discovered in the mid-17th century. In the late 18th century, [[William Herschel]] proved they grow and shrink alternately, in the summer and winter of each hemisphere. By the mid-19th century, astronomers knew that [[Mars]] had certain other similarities to Earth, for example that the [[Timekeeping on Mars|length of a day on Mars]] was almost the same as a day on Earth. They also knew that its [[axial tilt]] was similar to Earth's, which meant it experienced seasons just as Earth does — but of nearly double the length owing to its [[Darian calendar|much longer year]]. These observations led to increase in speculation that the darker [[albedo feature]]s were water and the brighter ones were land, whence followed speculation on whether Mars may be inhabited by some form of life.

In 1854, [[William Whewell]], a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge, who popularized the word ''scientist,'' theorized that Mars had seas, land and possibly life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/mystique/history/1800/|title=1800s {{!}} Mars Exploration Program|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=mars.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation about life on Mars exploded in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation by some observers of apparent [[Martian canal]]s — which were later found to be optical illusions. Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer [[Percival Lowell]] published his book ''Mars,'' followed by ''Mars and its Canals'' in 1906,&lt;ref name="NYT-20151001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunlap |first=David W. |title=Life on Mars?

G. Wells]] to write ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet's desiccation.

[[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] analysis of Mars' atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer [[William Wallace Campbell]] showed that neither water nor oxygen were present in the [[Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chambers |title=Life on Mars; The Complete Story |place=London |publisher=Blandford |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-7137-2747-0}}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1909, better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.

===Present===
Conceivably, if life exists (or existed) on Mars, evidence of that life could be found, or is best preserved, in the subsurface, away from present-day harsh surface conditions.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nai.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2015/10/NASA_Astrobiology_Strategy_2015_151008.pdf|title=NASA Astrobiology Strategy|year=2015|work=NASA|quote=Subsurface: Conceivably, if life exists (or existed) on Mars, an icy moon, or some other planetary body, evidence of that life could be found, or is best preserved, in the subsurface, away from present-day harsh surface processes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day life on Mars, or its biosignatures, could occur kilometers below the surface, or in subsurface geothermal hot spots, or it could occur a few meters below the surface. The [[permafrost]] layer on Mars is only a couple of centimeters below the surface, and salty [[brine]]s can be liquid a few centimeters below that but not far down. Water is close to its boiling point even at the deepest points in the Hellas basin, and so cannot remain liquid for long on the surface of Mars in its present state, except when covered in ice or after a sudden release of underground water.

So far, NASA has pursued a "follow the water" strategy on Mars and has not searched for biosignatures for life there directly since the ''Viking'' mission. As of 2017, the consensus by astrobiologists at NASA is that it may be necessary to access the Martian subsurface to find currently habitable environments.&lt;ref name='NASA strategy 2015'/&gt;

====Cosmic radiation====

In 1965, the [[Mariner 4]] probe discovered that Mars had no [[Magnetosphere|global magnetic field]] that would protect the planet from potentially life-threatening [[cosmic radiation]] and [[solar radiation]]; observations made in the late 1990s by the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] confirmed this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/mars_mag/ |chapter=Mars: Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere |first=J.

:"From MSL RAD measurements, ionizing radiation from [[Cosmic ray|galactic cosmic rays]] (GCR) at Mars is so low as to be negligible. Intermittent [[Solar particle event]]s (SPE) can increase the atmospheric ionization down to ground level and increase the total dose, but these events are sporadic and last at most a few (2–5) days. These facts are not used to distinguish Special Regions on Mars." A Special Region is defined as a region on the Mars surface where Earth life could potentially survive.

====UV radiation====

On UV radiation, a 2014 report concludes &lt;ref name="RummelBeaty2014"/&gt; that "[T]he Martian UV radiation environment is rapidly lethal to unshielded microbes but can be attenuated by global dust storms and shielded completely by &lt; 1 mm of regolith or by other organisms."

====Perchlorates====
The Martian regolith is known to contain a maximum of 0.5% (w/v) [[perchlorate]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) that is toxic for most living organisms,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/earth-analogues-for-past-and-future-life-on-mars-isolation-of-perchlorate-resistant-halophiles-from-big-soda-lake/F05005A274DC403138403A122AE95273 Earth analogues for past and future life on Mars: isolation of perchlorate resistant halophiles from Big Soda Lake].

Research published in July 2017 shows that when irradiated with a simulated Martian UV flux, perchlorates become even more lethal to bacteria ([[bactericide]]). Even dormant spores lost viability within minutes.&lt;ref name='bacteriocidal'/&gt; In addition, two other compounds of the Martian surface, [[iron oxide]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], act in synergy with irradiated perchlorates to cause a 10.8-fold increase in cell death when compared to cells exposed to UV radiation after 60 seconds of exposure.&lt;ref name='bacteriocidal'/&gt;&lt;ref name='oxides'/&gt;  It was also found that abraded silicates (quartz and basalt) lead to the formation of toxic [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref&gt;"Silicates Eroded under Simulated Martian Conditions Effectively Kill Bacteria—A Challenge for Life on Mars".

====Recurrent slope lineae====

[[Seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes|Recurrent slope lineae]] (RSL) features form on Sun-facing slopes at times of the year when the local temperatures reach above the melting point for ice. The streaks grow in spring, widen in late summer and then fade away in autumn. This is hard to model in any other way except as involving liquid water in some form, though the streaks themselves are thought to be a secondary effect and not a direct indication of the dampness of the regolith. Although these features are now confirmed to involve liquid water in some form, the water could be either too cold or too salty for life. At present they are treated as potentially habitable, as "Uncertain Regions, to be treated as Special Regions".

The 'Special Regions assessment' says of them:&lt;ref name="RummelBeaty2014"/&gt; "Although no single model currently proposed for the origin of RSL adequately explains all observations, they are currently best interpreted as being due to the seepage of water at &gt; 250 K, with &lt;math&gt;a_w&lt;/math&gt; ([[water activity]]) unknown and perhaps variable. As such they meet the criteria for Uncertain Regions, to be treated as Special Regions. There are other features on Mars with characteristics similar to RSL, but their relationship to possible liquid water is much less likely." They were first reported in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warm-Season Flows on Slope in Newton Crater |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/multimedia/pia14472.html |website=NASA Press Release |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212164022/https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/multimedia/pia14472.html |archivedate=February 12, 2017 |date=2018-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were already suspected as involving flowing brines back then, as all the other models available involved liquid water in some form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Martian salt streaks 'painted by liquid water' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34379284 |publisher=BBC Science |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125042041/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34379284 |archivedate=November 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20150928b"&gt;{{cite web

The thermodynamic availability of water ([[water activity]]) strictly limits microbial propagation on Earth, particularly in hypersaline environments, and there are indications that the brine ionic strength is a barrier to the habitability of Mars. Experiments show that high [[ionic strength]], driven to extremes on Mars by the ubiquitous occurrence of divalent ions, "renders these environments uninhabitable despite the presence of biologically available water."&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2015.1432 Ionic Strength Is a Barrier to the Habitability of Mars].

=== Nitrogen fixation ===
After carbon, [[nitrogen]] is arguably the most important element needed for life. Thus, measurements of [[nitrate]] over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required to address the question of its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support [[nitrogen fixation]] for biological incorporation.&lt;ref name="Icebreaker2018"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The ''Icebreaker Life'' Mission to Mars: A Search for Biomolecular Evidence for Life | journal=Astrobiology | date=April 5, 2013 | first=Christopher P. | last=McKay | first2=Carol R. | last2=Stoker | first3=Brian J. | last3=Glass | first4=Arwen I. | last4=Davé | first5=Alfonso F. | last5=Davila | first6=Jennifer L. | last6=Heldmann | first7=Margarita M. | last7=Marinova | first8=Alberto G. | last8=Fairen | first9=Richard C. | last9=Quinn | first10=Kris A. | last10=Zacny | first11=Gale | last11=Paulsen | first12=Peter H. | last12=Smith | first13=Victor | last13=Parro | first14=Dale T. | last14=Andersen | first15=Michael H. | last15=Hecht | first16=Denis | last16=Lacelle | first17=Wayne H. | last17=Pollard. | display-authors=9 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=334–353 | doi=10.1089/ast.2012.0878 | pmid=23560417 | bibcode= 2013AsBio..13..334M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrogen in the form of [[nitrate]] could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes. On Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed by thermal shock from impact or volcanic plume lightning on ancient Mars.&lt;ref name="Stern 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence for indigenous nitrogen in sedimentary and aeolian deposits from the Curiosity rover investigations at Gale crater, Mars |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=24 March 2015 |last=Stern |first=Jennifer C. |doi=10.1073/pnas.1420932112 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/03/18/1420932112 |accessdate=2015-03-25 |volume=112 |issue=14 |pages=4245–4250 |pmid=25831544 |pmc=4394254 |bibcode=2015PNAS..112.4245S |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327002323/http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/03/18/1420932112 |archivedate=March 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2015, NASA reported that the [[Sample Analysis at Mars|SAM]] instrument on the ''Curiosity'' rover detected nitrates by heating surface sediments. The nitrogen in nitrate is in a "fixed" state, meaning that it is in an oxidized form that can be used by [[living organisms]]. The discovery supports the notion that ancient Mars may have been hospitable for [[life]].&lt;ref name="Stern 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20150324"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neal-Jones |first1=Nancy |last2=Steigerwald |first2=William |last3=Webster |first3=Guy |last4=Brown |first4=Dwayne |title=Curiosity Rover Finds Biologically Useful Nitrogen on Mars |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4516 |date=24 March 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=25 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327000753/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4516 |archivedate=March 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32048273 |title=Curiosity Mars rover detects 'useful nitrogen' |work=NASA |publisher=BBC News |date=25 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327172922/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32048273 |archivedate=March 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suspected that all nitrate on Mars is a relic, with no modern contribution.&lt;ref name='Nitrogen 2017'&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170002371.pdf Nitrogen on Mars: Insights from Curiosity] (PDF).

=== Low pressure ===
Further complicating estimates of the habitability of the Martian surface is the fact that very little is known about the growth of microorganisms at pressures close to those on the surface of Mars. Some teams determined that some bacteria may be capable of cellular replication down to 25 mbar, but that is still above the atmospheric pressures found on Mars (range 1–14 mbar).&lt;ref name="Serratia"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Growth of Serratia liquefaciens under 7 mbar, 0°C, and CO2-Enriched Anoxic Atmospheres | journal=Astrobiology | date=February 2013 | first=Andrew C. | last=Schuerger | first2=Richard | last2=Ulrich | first3=Bonnie J. | last3=Berry | first4=Wayne L. | last4=Nicholson | volume=13 | issue=2 | pages=115–131 | doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0811 | pmid=23289858 | bibcode=2013AsBio..13..115S | pmc=3582281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, twenty-six strains of bacteria were chosen based on their recovery from spacecraft assembly facilities, and only ''[[Serratia liquefaciens]]'' strain ATCC 27592 exhibited growth at 7 mbar, 0&amp;nbsp;°C, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-enriched anoxic atmospheres.&lt;ref name="Serratia" /&gt;

Analysis of Martian sandstones, using data obtained from orbital spectrometry, suggests that the waters that previously existed on the surface of Mars would have had too high a salinity to support most Earth-like life.

The images showed changes in steep crater walls and sediment deposits, providing the strongest evidence yet that water coursed through them as recently as several years ago.

There is  disagreement in the scientific community as to whether or not the recent gully streaks were formed by liquid water.

Research at the University of Arkansas presented in June 2015 suggested that some methanogens could survive on Mars's low pressure.  Rebecca Mickol found that in her laboratory, four species of methanogens survived low-pressure conditions that were similar to a subsurface liquid aquifer on Mars.  The four species that she tested were ''[[Methanothermobacter]] wolfeii'', ''[[Methanosarcina]] barkeri'', ''[[Methanobacterium]] formicicum'', and  ''[[Methanococcus maripaludis]]''.&lt;ref name="Mickol" /&gt; In June 2012, scientists reported that measuring the ratio of [[hydrogen]] and [[methane]] levels on Mars may help determine the likelihood of life on Mars.&lt;ref name="PNAS-20120607"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oze |first=Christopher |last2=Jones |first2=Camille |last3=Goldsmith |first3=Jonas I. |last4=Rosenbauer |first4=Robert J. |title=Differentiating biotic from abiotic methane genesis in hydrothermally active planetary surfaces |date=June 7, 2012 |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=109| issue =  25 |pages=9750–9754 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1205223109 |bibcode=2012PNAS..109.9750O |pmid=22679287 |pmc=3382529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Space-20120625"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |title=Mars Life Could Leave Traces in Red Planet's Air: Study |url=http://www.space.com/16284-mars-life-atmosphere-hydrogen-methane.html |date=June 25, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630004450/http://www.space.com/16284-mars-life-atmosphere-hydrogen-methane.html |archivedate=June 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scientists, "...low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ratios (less than approximately 40) indicate that life is likely present and active."&lt;ref name="PNAS-20120607" /&gt; Other scientists have recently reported methods of detecting hydrogen and methane in [[extraterrestrial atmospheres]].&lt;ref name="Nature-20120627"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brogi |first=Matteo |last2=Snellen |first2=Ignas A.

The 1970s [[Viking program]] placed two identical landers on the surface of Mars tasked to look for [[biosignatures]] of microbial life on the surface. Of the four experiments performed by each Viking lander, only the 'Labeled Release' (LR) experiment gave a positive result for [[metabolism]], while the other three did not detect [[organic compound]]s. The LR was a specific experiment designed to test only a narrowly defined critical aspect of the theory concerning the possibility of life on Mars; therefore, the overall results were declared inconclusive.&lt;ref name="chambers" /&gt; No Mars lander mission has found meaningful traces of [[biomolecules]] or [[biosignatures]].

=== ''Curiosity'' rover sediment sampling ===
In June 2018, NASA reported that the ''Curiosity'' rover had found evidence of complex organic compounds from [[mudstone]] rocks aged approximately 3.5 billion years old, sampled from two distinct sites in a dry lake in the [[Pahrump Hills]] of the [[Gale (crater)|Gale crater]]. The rock samples, when [[Pyrolysis|pyrolyzed]] via the ''Curiosity''{{'}}s [[Sample Analysis at Mars]] instrument, released an array of organic molecules; these include sulfur-containing [[thiophene]]s, [[aromatic]] compounds such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]], and [[aliphatic]] compounds such as [[propane]] and [[butene]].  The concentration of organic compounds is 100-fold higher than earlier measurements. The authors speculate that the presence of sulfur may have helped preserve them. The products resemble those obtained from the breakdown of [[kerogen]], a precursor to oil and natural gas on Earth. NASA stated that these findings are not evidence that life existed on the planet, but that the organic compounds needed to sustain microscopic life were present and there may be deeper sources of organic compounds on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/07/nasa-mars-rover-finds-organic-matter-in-ancient-lake-bed | title = Nasa Mars rover finds organic matter in ancient lake bed | first = Ian | last =Sample | date = June 7, 2018 | accessdate = June 7, 2018 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180607"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voosen_Science&gt;{{cite journal |title=NASA Curiosity rover hits organic pay dirt on Mars |last=Voosen |first=Paul |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=2018 |volume=260 |issue=6393 |pages=1054–55 |doi=10.1126/science.360.6393.1054 |pmid=29880665 |bibcode=2018Sci...360.1054V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20180608a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=ten Kate |first=Inge Loes |title=Organic molecules on Mars |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1068 |date=June 8, 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=360 |issue=6393 |pages=1068–1069 |doi=10.1126/science.aat2662|pmid=29880670 |accessdate=June 8, 2018 |bibcode=2018Sci...360.1068T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20180608b"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Webster, Christopher R. et al. |title=Background levels of methane in Mars' atmosphere show strong seasonal variations |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1093 |date=June 8, 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=360 |issue=6393 |pages=1093–1096 |doi=10.1126/science.aaq0131|pmid=29880682 |accessdate=June 8, 2018|bibcode=2018Sci...360.1093W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20180608c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180607" /&gt;

=== Meteorites ===
As of 2018, there are 117 known [[Martian meteorite]]s (some of which were found in several fragments). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imca.cc/mars/martian-meteorites-list.htm An up-to-date List of Martian Meteorites]. Dr. Tony Irving of the University of Washington. International Meteorite Collectors Association (IMCA Inc).&lt;/ref&gt; These are valuable because they are the only physical samples of Mars available to Earth-bound laboratories. Some researchers have argued that microscopic [[wikt:morphology|morphological]] features found in [[ALH84001]] are [[wikt:biomorph|biomorphs]], however this interpretation has been highly controversial and is not supported by the majority of researchers in the field.&lt;ref name="meteoritos-Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/sci/fifthconf99/6142.pdf |format=PDF |title=Evidence for ancient Martian life |first=E.

Seven criteria have been established for the recognition of past life within terrestrial geologic samples. Those criteria are:&lt;ref name="meteoritos-Bio" /&gt;
# Is the geologic context of the sample compatible with past life?
# Is the age of the sample and its stratigraphic location compatible with possible life?
# Does the sample contain evidence of cellular morphology and colonies?
# Is there any evidence of biominerals showing chemical or mineral disequilibria?
# Is there any evidence of stable isotope patterns unique to biology?
# Are there any organic biomarkers present?
# Are the features indigenous to the sample?

For general acceptance of past life in a geologic sample, essentially most or all of these criteria must be met. All seven criteria have not yet been met for any of the Martian samples.&lt;ref name="meteoritos-Bio" /&gt;

==== ALH84001 ====
[[File:ALH84001 structures.jpg|right|thumb|An electron microscope reveals bacteria-like structures in meteorite fragment [[ALH84001]]]]

In 1996, the Martian meteorite [[ALH84001]], a specimen that is much older than the majority of Martian meteorites that have been recovered so far, received considerable attention when a group of NASA scientists led by [[David S. McKay]] reported microscopic features and geochemical anomalies that they considered to be best explained by the rock having hosted Martian bacteria in the distant past. Some of these features resembled terrestrial bacteria, aside from their being much smaller than any known form of life. Much controversy arose over this claim, and ultimately all of the evidence McKay's team cited as evidence of life was found to be explainable by non-biological processes. Although the scientific community has largely rejected the claim ALH 84001 contains evidence of ancient Martian life, the controversy associated with it is now seen as a historically significant moment in the development of exobiology.&lt;ref name="disbelief"&gt;{{cite news | title=After 10 years, few believe life on Mars | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_060806_mars_rock.html | last=Crenson | first=Matt | agency=[[Associated Press]] | work=Space.com | date=August 6, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archivedate=2006-08-09 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809161936/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_060806_mars_rock.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1996Sci...273..924M |title=Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible Relic Biogenic Activity in Martian Meteorite ALH84001 |last=McKay |first=David S. |last2=Gibson |first2=Everett K. |last3=Thomas-Keprta |first3=Kathie L. |last4=Vali |first4=Hojatollah |last5=Romanek |first5=Christopher S. |last6=Clemett |first6=Simon J. |last7=Chillier |first7=Xavier D.

In 1998, a team from NASA's Johnson Space Center obtained a small sample for analysis. Researchers found preterrestrial aqueous alteration phases and objects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Rincon |title=Space rock re-opens Mars debate |date=February 8, 2006 |publisher= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4688938.stm |work=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222021257/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4688938.stm |archivedate=February 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the size and shape consistent with Earthly [[fossil]]ized [[nanobacteria]].
Analysis with [[gas chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) studied its high molecular weight [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] in 2000, and NASA scientists concluded that as much as 75% of the organic compounds in Nakhla "may not be recent terrestrial contamination".&lt;ref name="meteoritos-Bio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/mmc/Nakhla.pdf |title=Mars Meteorite Compendium |last=Meyer |first=C. |date=2004 |format=PDF |publisher=NASA |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923212609/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/mmc/Nakhla.pdf |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This caused additional interest in this meteorite, so in 2006, NASA managed to obtain an additional and larger sample from the London Natural History Museum. On this second sample, a large dendritic [[carbon]] content was observed. When the results and evidence were published in 2006, some independent researchers claimed that the carbon deposits are of biologic origin. It was remarked that since carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the [[Universe]], finding it in curious patterns is not indicative or suggestive of biological origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Whitehouse |title=Life on Mars – new claims |date=August 27, 1999 |publisher= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/289214.stm |work=BBC News |pages= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502113931/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/289214.stm |archivedate=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compilation of scientific research references on the Nakhla meteorite: {{cite web |url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/marsmets/nakhla/references.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904223727/http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/marsmets/nakhla/references.cfm |archivedate=September 4, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yamato 000593]] is the [[List of Martian meteorites#List|second largest]] [[meteorite]] from [[Mars]] found on [[Earth]].

A team of Hungarian scientists propose that the geysers' most visible features, dark dune spots and spider channels, may be colonies of [[photosynthetic]] Martian microorganisms, which over-winter beneath the ice cap, and as the [[sunlight]] returns to the pole during early spring, light penetrates the ice, the microorganisms photosynthesize and heat their immediate surroundings.

== Forward contamination ==
{{Details|Planetary protection|Interplanetary contamination}}
[[Planetary protection]] of Mars aims to prevent biological contamination of the planet.&lt;ref name="strategy"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Committee on an Astrobiology Strategy for the Exploration of Mars | author2=National Research Council | date=2007 | chapter=Planetary Protection for Mars Missions | chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11937&amp;page=95 | pages=95–98 | title=An Astrobiology Strategy for the Exploration of Mars | publisher=The National Academies Press | isbn=978-0-309-10851-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major goal is to preserve the planetary record of natural processes by preventing human-caused microbial introductions, also called [[forward contamination]].  There is abundant evidence as to what can happen when organisms from regions on Earth that have been isolated from one another for significant periods of time are introduced into each other's environment. Species that are constrained in one environment can thrive – often out of control – in another environment much to the detriment of the original species that were present.  In some ways, this problem could be compounded if life forms from one planet were introduced into the totally alien ecology of another world.&lt;ref name="Cowing_201304"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://astrobiology.com/2013/04/planetary-protection-a-work-in-progress.html | title=Planetary Protection: A Work in Progress | first=Keith | last=Cowing | date=April 11, 2013 | work=Astrobiology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although numerous studies point to resistance to some of Mars conditions, they do so separately, and none has considered the full range of Martian surface conditions, including temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, radiation, humidity, oxidizing regolith, and others, all at the same time and in combination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2017.1772 Is Searching for Martian Life a Priority for the Mars Community?] Fairén Alberto G., Parro Victor, Schulze-Makuch Dirk, and Whyte Lyle.

== Missions ==

===Mars-2===
{{Main|Mars program}}
[[Mars program|Mars-1]] was the first spacecraft launched to Mars in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jtgnew.sjrdesign.net/exploration_space_planetary_mars.html |title="Journey Through the Galaxy" Mars Program: Mars ~ 1960-1974 |accessdate=2014-01-26 |last=Robbins |first=Stuart |date=2008 |publisher=SJR Design |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204004556/http://jtgnew.sjrdesign.net/exploration_space_planetary_mars.html |archivedate=February 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but communication was lost while en route to Mars. With [[Mars 2|Mars-2]] and [[Mars 3|Mars-3]] in 1971-1972, information was obtained on the nature of the surface rocks and altitude profiles of the surface density of the soil, its thermal conductivity, and thermal anomalies detected on the surface of Mars. The program found that its northern polar cap has a temperature below -110&amp;nbsp;°C and that the water vapor content in the atmosphere of Mars is five thousand times less than on Earth. No signs of life were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/20th_soviet_mars.html |title=Mars (1960-1974): Mars 1 |accessdate=2014-01-26 |last=Mihos |first=Chris |date=11 January 2006 |work=Department of Astronomy, Case Western Reserve University. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013211415/http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/20th_soviet_mars.html |archivedate=October 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Mariner 4 }}
[[Mariner 4]] probe performed the first successful [[Planetary flyby|flyby]] of the planet Mars, returning the first pictures of the Martian surface in 1965. The photographs showed an arid Mars without rivers, oceans, or any signs of life. Further, it revealed that the surface (at least the parts that it photographed) was covered in craters, indicating a lack of plate tectonics and weathering of any kind for the last 4 billion years. The probe also found that Mars has no [[Magnetosphere|global magnetic field]] that would protect the planet from potentially life-threatening [[cosmic rays]]. The probe was able to calculate the [[atmospheric pressure]] on the planet to be about 0.6 kPa (compared to Earth's 101.3 kPa), meaning that liquid water could not exist on the planet's surface.&lt;ref name="chambers" /&gt; After Mariner 4, the search for life on Mars changed to a search for bacteria-like living organisms rather than for multicellular organisms, as the environment was clearly too harsh for these.

=== Viking orbiters ===
{{Main|Viking program}}
Liquid water is necessary for known life and [[metabolism]], so if water was present on Mars, the chances of it having supported life may have been determinant. The Viking orbiters found evidence of possible river valleys in many areas, erosion and, in the southern hemisphere, branched streams.&lt;ref name="cratering"&gt;{{cite book | last=Strom | first=R.G. | first2=Steven K. | last2=Croft | first3=Nadine G. | last3=Barlow | title=The Martian Impact Cratering Record | publisher=University of Arizona Press | isbn=978-0-8165-1257-7 | date=1992 }}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raeburn_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Raeburn | first=P. | date=1998 | title=Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet Mars | journal=National Geographic Society }}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moore_atlas"&gt;{{cite book | last=Moore | first=P. | display-authors=etal | date=1990 | title=The Atlas of the Solar System | publisher=Mitchell Beazley Publishers | location=NY, NY. }}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viking experiments ===
{{Main|Viking biological experiments}}
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carl Sagan]] poses next to a replica of the Viking landers.]]
The primary mission of the [[Viking probes]] of the mid-1970s was to carry out experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil because the favorable conditions for the evolution of multicellular organisms ceased some four billion years ago on Mars.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html |title=Astrobiology |date=September 26, 2006 |publisher=Biology Cabinet |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212184044/http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html |archivedate=December 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tests were formulated to look for microbial life similar to that found on Earth. Of the four experiments, only the Labeled Release (LR) experiment returned a positive result,{{dubious|date=July 2013}} showing increased &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production on first exposure of soil to water and nutrients. All scientists agree on two points from the Viking missions: that radiolabeled &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was evolved in the Labeled Release experiment, and that the [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GCMS]] detected no organic molecules. There are vastly different interpretations of what those results imply.

A research team from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] headed by [[Rafael Navarro-González]] concluded that the GCMS equipment (TV-GC-MS) used by the [[Viking program]] to search for organic molecules, may not be sensitive enough to detect low levels of organics.&lt;ref name="Navarro"/&gt; [[Klaus Biemann]], the principal investigator of the GCMS experiment on ''Viking'' wrote a rebuttal.&lt;ref name="nas_104"&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the ability of the Viking gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer to detect organic matter | last=Biemann | first=Klaus | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=104 | issue=25 | pages=10310–10313 | date=2007 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0703732104 | pmid=17548829 | pmc=1965509 | bibcode=2007PNAS..10410310B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the simplicity of sample handling, TV–GC–MS is still considered the standard method for organic detection on future Mars missions, so Navarro-González suggests that the design of future organic instruments for Mars should include other methods of detection.

After the discovery of [[perchlorate]]s on Mars by the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]], practically the same team of Navarro-González published a paper arguing that the Viking GCMS results were compromised by the presence of perchlorates.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite web|last=Webster |first=Guy |last2=Hoover |first2=Rachel |last3=Marlaire |first3=Ruth |last4=Frias |first4=Gabriela |date=September 3, 2010 |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-286 |title=Missing Piece Inspires New Look at Mars Puzzle |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA |accessdate=2010-10-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103012112/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-286 |archivedate=November 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 astrobiology textbook notes that "while perchlorate is too poor an oxidizer to reproduce the LR results (under the conditions of that experiment perchlorate does not oxidize organics), it does oxidize, and thus destroy, organics at the higher temperatures used in the Viking GCMS experiment."&lt;ref name="PlaxcoGross2011_1_2nd_ed"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kevin W. |last=Plaxco |first2=Michael |last2=Gross |title=Astrobiology: A Brief Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x83omgI5pGQC&amp;pg=PA282 |date=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-1-4214-0194-2 |pages=282–283 |edition=2nd |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920155308/http://books.google.com/books?id=x83omgI5pGQC&amp;pg=PA282 |archivedate=September 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biemann has written a commentary critical of this Navarro-González paper as well,&lt;ref name="doi_3869"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2011JE003869| title = Comment on "Reanalysis of the Viking results suggests perchlorate and organics at midlatitudes on Mars" by Rafael Navarro-González et al| journal = Journal of Geophysical Research| volume = 116| pages = E12001| year = 2011| last1 = Biemann | first1 = K. | last2 = Bada | first2 = J.

=== Phoenix lander, 2008 ===
{{Main|Phoenix (spacecraft)}}[[File:Pia09344.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's concept of the Phoenix spacecraft]]
The [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]] mission landed a robotic spacecraft in the polar region of Mars on May 25, 2008 and it operated until November 10, 2008. One of the mission's two primary objectives was to search for a "habitable zone" in the Martian [[regolith]] where microbial life could exist, the other main goal being to study the [[Geology|geological]] history of water on Mars. The lander has a 2.5 meter robotic arm that was capable of digging shallow trenches in the regolith. There was an electrochemistry experiment which analysed the [[ion]]s in the regolith and the amount and type of [[antioxidant]]s on Mars. The [[Viking program]] data indicate that oxidants on Mars may vary with latitude, noting that [[Viking 2]] saw fewer oxidants than [[Viking 1]] in its more northerly position. Phoenix landed further north still.&lt;ref name="MarsDaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/Piecing_Together_Life_Potential_999.html | title=Piecing Together Life's Potential | work=Mars Daily | publisher= | date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, recent analysis of the Phoenix WCL showed that the Ca(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Phoenix soil has not interacted with liquid water of any form, perhaps for as long as 600 Myr.

On 16 December 2014, NASA reported the ''Curiosity'' rover detected a "tenfold spike", likely localized, in the amount of [[methane]] in the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]]. Sample measurements taken "a dozen times over 20 months" showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014, averaging "7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere."

* [[ExoMars]] is a European-led multi-spacecraft programme currently under development by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] for launch in 2016 and 2020.&lt;ref name="ESA signed"&gt;{{cite news|title=ExoMars: ESA and Roscosmos set for Mars missions |date=March 14, 2013 |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars_ESA_and_Roscosmos_set_for_Mars_missions |work=European Space Agency (ESA) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316135513/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars_ESA_and_Roscosmos_set_for_Mars_missions |archivedate=March 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary scientific mission will be to search for possible [[biosignature]]s on Mars, past or present. A [[ExoMars rover|rover]] with a {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} core drill will be used to sample various depths beneath the surface where liquid water may be found and where microorganisms (or organic biosignatures{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}) might survive [[cosmic radiation]].&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Q &amp; A with Mars Life-Seeker Chris Carr |date=March 25, 2011 |url=http://www.space.com/11232-mars-life-evolution-carr-interview.html |work=Space.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603003111/http://www.space.com/11232-mars-life-evolution-carr-interview.html |archivedate=June 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mars 2020]] – The ''Mars 2020'' rover is a  [[Mars]] [[Rover (space exploration)|planetary rover mission]] by [[NASA]] with a planned launch in 2020. It is intended to investigate an [[astrobiology|astrobiologically]] relevant ancient environment on Mars, investigate its surface [[Geology of Mars|geological processes]] and history, including the assessment of its past [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] and potential for preservation of [[biosignature]]s within accessible geological materials.&lt;ref name="Cowing_2020"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spaceref.com/mars/science-definition-team-for-the-2020-mars-rover.html | title=Science Definition Team for the 2020 Mars Rover | first=Keith | last=Cowing | date=December 21, 2012 | work=NASA | publisher=Science Ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mars Sample Return Mission]] — The best life detection experiment proposed is the examination on Earth of a soil sample from Mars. However, the difficulty of providing and maintaining life support over the months of transit from Mars to Earth remains to be solved. Providing for still unknown environmental and nutritional requirements is daunting. Should dead organisms be found in a sample, it would be difficult to conclude that those organisms were alive when obtained.

==Human colonization of Mars==
{{main|Colonization of Mars}}

Some of the main reasons for colonizing Mars include economic interests, long-term scientific research best carried out by humans as opposed to robotic probes, and sheer curiosity. Surface conditions and the presence of [[water on Mars]] make it arguably the most [[Planetary habitability|hospitable of the planets]] in the [[Solar System]], other than [[Earth]]. Human colonization of Mars would require ''in situ'' resource utilization ([[In situ resource utilization|ISRU]]); A NASA report states that "applicable frontier technologies include robotics, machine intelligence, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, [[3D printing|3-D printing/additive]] manufacturing, and autonomy. These technologies combined with the vast natural resources should enable, pre- and post-human arrival ISRU to greatly increase reliability and safety and reduce cost for human colonization of Mars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160005963.pdf|title=Frontier In-Situ Resource Utilization for Enabling Sustained Human Presence on Mars|date=April 2016|website=NASA|access-date=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spaceref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=12418|title=House Science Committee Hearing Charter: Lunar Science &amp; Resources: Future Options|work=spaceref.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="race"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Space Race Rekindled?

During the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation of Norway]], German authorities deported about 768 individuals of Jewish background to concentration camps outside of Norway.&lt;ref name=Mendelsohn&gt;{{cite book |last= Mendelsohn |first= Oskar |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title= Jødenes historie i Norge gjennom 300 år - Bind 2 1940-1985 |year= 1986 |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= 2nd |series= |date= |publisher= Universitetsforlaget |location= Oslo |language= Norwegian |isbn= 82-00-02524-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 334–360 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 28 and 34 of those deported survived &lt;ref name=Ottosen&gt;{{cite book |last= Ottosen |first= Kristian |authorlink= Kristian Ottosen |editor= |others= |title= I slik en natt; historien om deportasjonen av jøder fra Norge |year= 1994 |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |publisher= Aschehoug |location= Oslo |language= Norwegian |isbn= 82-03-26049-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 334–360 |chapter= Vedlegg 1 |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; their continued imprisonment (following their deportation). Because the Norwegian police and German authorities kept records of these victims, researchers have been able to compile information about the deportees.&lt;ref name=regjeringen&gt;{{Cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Inndragning av jødisk eiendom i Norge under den 2. verdenskrig |date=June 1997 |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/NOUer/1997/NOU-1997-22.html?id=141043 |format= |accessdate=2008-01-16 |edition= |series= Norges offentlige utredninger |publisher=Statens forvaltningstjeneste |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn= 82-583-0437-2 |oclc= |doi= |id=NOU 1997:22 ("Skarpnesutvalget") |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Some discrepancies about the numbers remain. For example, German documents related to the transit of prisoners on the Donau indicate that 530 were deported from Oslo, whereas the list compiled by Ottosen (1992) indicates that 534 were on board, but this includes Helene Johansen and Mirjam Kristiansen, who were deported on the Donau, but on another date. Kai Feinberg, who was a prisoner on the Donau, was ordered to compile a list of prisoners at the time, and his recollection was that there were 532 on board. Mendelsohn allows that some individuals may have been counted twice, others may have been omitted. The list provided here is based on Ottosen's list, with annotations where these are available. It has been checked for possible duplicates based on name and date of birth. In most sources, the number of survivors is commonly cited as 26; Ottosen (1992) lists 26 individuals as survivors, but omits Harry Meyer, who was captured in the context of the Kvarstad incident, and Robert Savosnick, probably due to an error on his part; as Savosnick is listed as a survivor in the master of list of deportees. This list includes all those who the Nazi authorities [[Nuremberg Laws|considered]] Jewish. A few of these did not consider themselves Jewish. None of the available literature seeks to ascertain which of the victims were or were not Jewish according to ''[[halacha]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Jewish individuals deported from Norway==

This list is largely based on Kristian Ottosen's list, with annotations from other sources. Survivors indicated in '''bold'''.

|Becker&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;Hille Becker and his wife Judith Zemechman Becker, had immigrated to Norway after World War I from the Soviet Union. They had three children: Ada, Joseph, and Herman. All but Joseph were deported and killed in the concentration camps. Herman volunteered first to the 330 Squadron under Norwegian command, and then as a navigator on de Havilland Mosquito planes with the No. 464 Squadron RAAF. He was shot down and killed during an attack on Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen on 21 March 1945. His body washed ashore on the island of Samsø and remained unidentified until 2000. {{cite news |first= Cato |last= Guhnfeldt |authorlink=Cato Guhnfeldt |author= |title= Graven funnet etter 55 år |format= |agency= |work= |publisher= Aftenposten |location= Oslo |id= |pages= |page= |date= 2000-05-29 |language= Norwegian|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}, Grete and Friedrich Doller were arrested and imprisoned in the local jail in Kristiansand and then in the camps at Berg concentration camp|Berg and Grini concentration camp|Grini before their deportation late in the war. They were spared the transport to Auschwitz primarily because there was some doubt about their Jewish heritage.&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''[[Otto Eisler|Eisler]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Otto Eisler was a noted architect in his home town of Brno before he fled Nazi persecution through Nansenhjelpen, persecuted both because he was Jewish and gay. He returned to Brno after the war and continued his work as profession, founding among other things the Brno Zoo. He died in 1968.

|'''[[Leo Eitinger|Eitinger]]'''&lt;ref name=EIT&gt;[[Leo Eitinger]], the brothers Assor and Assriel-Berl Hirsch, [[Samuel Steinmann]], and [[Julius Paltiel]] found each other during the death march from Auschwitz to Buchenwald via Prague. They were helped by Norwegian students who were inmates there, narrowly surviving the SS last-ditch effort to kill witnesses to their atrocities. They were no included in the rescue mission by the Folke Bernadotte white buses that rescued the other Norwegians. After they were liberated, they received no assistance from Norwegian authorities and had to find their own way home, with some help from the American army and the Danish consul.

|'''Feinberg'''&lt;ref&gt;Kai Feinberg was left in the Auschwitz Revier when it was evacuated in January 1945. A small group of SS soldiers had prepared to shoot all those who were sick but were scared off by Soviet air patrols. After liberation, Feinberg accepted a job with the Joint Distribution Committee in Bucharest and later returned to Norway via Rome, where he had an audience with the pope. He later testified in the trial against Adolf Eichmann and became president of the synagogue in Oslo. Mendelsohn (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

|Fischer&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Fischer founded the Kristiansund Symphony Orchestra in 1919 and maintained a passionate interest in the cultural events of his home town. When he was arrested and faced deportation in the fall of 1942, 50 of the residents signed an appeal to Sverre Riisnæs in protest. Riisnæs responded that though he remembered Fischer and might believe that he in "many ways" was "a valuable human being", the removal of all Jews was a matter of "our holiest values."&lt;/ref&gt;

|Johansen&lt;ref name=ravensbruck&gt;Helene Johansen and Mirjam Kristiansen were both originally from the Soviet Union and married, respectively to Johan Strand Johansen and Henry Wilhelm Kristiansen|Henry W. Kristiansen, who were the secretary and editor in Communist Party of Norway. They were all arrested with their husbands as political prisoners in connection with Operation Barbarossa and sent on an early departure on the SS Donau  to Ravensbrück. Once there, the two women were identified as Jewish and transported to Auschwitz, where they were murdered in May 1942. Most Jewish spouses of non-Jewish Norwegians were spared deportation, but these (as well as Benjamin Bild) were initially arrested for political reasons. Johan Strand Johansen survived the war; Henry Kristiansen died in Neuengamme on January 16, 1942.

|'''Keil'''&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Keil was made to repair watches stolen from other victims, passing through Auschwitz Birkenau to Sachsenhausen, where he met other (non-Jewish) Norwegian prisoners who shared their food with him and helped him survive. He returned to Norway after the war, taking the last name Steinwall. He died in 1984. {{cite web |url=http://www.historieboka.no/Modules/historiebok_tidsepoke_tema_artikkel.aspx?ObjectType=ArticleVersion&amp;Article.ID=2150&amp;Category.ID=1305 |title= Eugen Keil, den jødiske urmakeren på Hønefoss |first= Nils Johan |last= Rønniksen |author= |authorlink= |date= 2008-10-28|month= |year= |work= |publisher= Terra Buskerud -Historieboka.no |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= Norwegian |trans-title=|format= |doi= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Nesjestranda in Molde&lt;ref name="NESJE"&gt;A group of Czech refugees, consisting of the Lustig family, the Taglichts, Leo Eitinger, and Robert Weinstein all sought refuge in the small coastal community of Nesjestranda near Molde. They were nevertheless found and deported. Four of them: Nora Lustig, Vera and Tibor Taglicht, and Robert Weinstein, perished. The community of Nesjestranda put up a monument in their memory in the graveyard at Veyøya church in Sølsnes. The inscription reads:

{{quote|Jødiske flyktningar frå Tsjekkoslovakia/jaga frå heimane sine av nazistane/fann ein tilfluktsstda i bygda vår/også her forfølgde nazistane dei/dei vart tvangssende og drepne i/konsentrasjonsleiren Auschwitz

Translation:

{{quote|Jewish refugees from Czechoslovakia/chased from their homes by the Nazis/found a place of refuge in our community/also here the Nazis persecuted them/they were forcibly sent and killed in/the concentration camp Auschwitz

|'''Lustig (Levold)'''&lt;ref&gt;Hans Lustig's experiences are recounted in Ottosen (1992, pps. 185-197) and Mendelsohn (1986, p. 183). They had been transferred from Monowitz to Eintrachthütte, and then to Mauthausen, where they were liberated. Having been separated, the twin brothers Hans and Fritz independently found their way back to their childhood home in Brno and were reunited there. They settled in Czechoslovakia, but fled again during the Communist take-over. Hans changed his last name to Levold and worked as an engineer, installing the first digital computer at the Norwegian Institutet of Technology.

|Maliniak&lt;ref&gt;Maliniak was the conductor at the house orchestra at the Britannia Hotel in Trondheim. Born in Warsaw, he had fled via Sweden to Norway during World War I and established himself initially as a violinist and viola player, and then conductor. He was educated at the conservatory in Warsaw and probably studied under Leopold Auer.

|Rothkopf&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Rothkopf, originally from Austria, had organized the first escape route from Norway to Sweden in collaboration with Benjamin Bild and Eger Ollum. The route relied on train to Flisa and then by foot through the forest to Sweden (Ulstein, 1985). Both he and Bild were arrested, deported, and murdered.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Rubinstein&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein was apparently shot in transit between two camps in the last days of the war. He had asked for some water to quench his thirst, and an SS officer shot him in the head for his troubles. {{cite web|url=http://www.tannlegetidende.no/pls/dntt/pa_dtdm.xpnd?vp_seks_id=296061&amp;b_start=1 |title=Norges krigsgravtjeneste |accessdate=2008-06-29 |author= |last=Guldseth |first=Torbjørn |authorlink= |date= |year=2008 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=The Norwegian Dental Journal |pages= |language=Norwegian |doi= |quote=Ved ankomst byen Miste var bare fem fanger i live, derav begge nordmennene.

|Samuel&lt;ref&gt;According to Ottosen (1994, pps 116-123), Rabbi Samuel's wife Henriette Samuel testified in a court in Haifa, Israel on May 11, 1962, that the rabbi had been warned to flee the country, but refused to abandon his congregation. His family was helped in part by their neighbor Ingeborg Sletten, who was later honored by Yad Vashem as among the Righteous Among the Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;

|Weinstein&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein was sent to Auschwitz and attempted to escape, but was caught. At first imprisoned in [[Block 11]] but survived, he was later sent into the Warsaw ghetto as part of a penal work group with, among others, Robert Savosnick. Weinstein died there, possibly of Typhus|epidemic typhus (Mendelsohn, p. 177), or by a falling wall (Ottosen, p. 231).&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''Wolfberg'''&lt;ref&gt;Wolfberg's experiences are summarized in Ottosen (1992, pps 198-223). At first assigned to musician duty, Wolfberg was moved to Lieberose and then on a death march to Falkensee. There, he, was rescued with the help of non-Jewish Norwegian prisoners, who forged identification papers for him as Rolf Berg, and he stayed while the others traveled on. See {{cite web

 |quote=Sigurd glemmer ikke den flokken på rundt 60 jøder som kom marsjerende en dag på nyåret i 1945. De trakk lastekjerrer der det lå døende mennesker – og spader til å begrave dem med. De hadde vært 300 da de hadde begynt marsjen fra leiren Liebe Rose, og målet for marsjen var krematoriet i Sachsenhausen. En av jødene var norsk og het Leif Wolfberg. Nordmennene tok seg spesielt av ham, ga ham mat og stell. Sigurd mener navnet hans ble endret til Rolf Berg av noen nordmenn på personalkontoret i løpet av natta.

*February 7, 2007 - [[Mairbek Murdagaliyev]], deputy head of the [[Vedensky District]] administration, killed in a blast of an explosive device planted at the door of his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchdog.cz/index.php?show=000000-000005-000001-000179-000044&amp;lang=1 |title=Prague Watchdog - Crisis in Chechnya - The Month in Brief - February 2007 |publisher=Watchdog.cz |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassinations in North Caucasus==
* February 2, 2005 - Major-General [[Magomed Omarov (politician)|Magomed Omarov]], [[Dagestan]]'s deputy Interior Minister, was assassinated in capital [[Makhachkala]], when [[rebels]] ambushed his [[motorcade]] and killed him in the shoot-out. Omarov had coordinated all major [[counter-insurgency|anti-insurgent operations]] in the republic and had narrowly escaped another assassination attempt in 2003.
* March 22, 2006 - A group of assailants fatally shot Ruslan Aliyev, the chief administrator of mountainous Botlikhsky District of Dagestan, during a fierce gunbattle; Aliyev's vehicle was struck by gunfire in the center of Makhachkala] on the city's most guarded street. On March 10, [[Magomed Magomedov]], deputy head of the republican Criminal Investigation Department, was killed in Makhachkala by a bomb planted underneath his car. Two days later, March 12, a senior officer from the Organized Crime Department was shot dead in Makhachkala, and another was killed on March 21 in the town of [[Buinaksk]].
* May 17, 2006 - An explosion in Ingushetia killed seven people including among them the republic’s [[police chief]] and acting first Deputy Interior Minister [[Dzhabrail Kostoyev]]; the explosion was so powerful that his armoured [[SUV]] was thrown 20 meters by the blast and wrecked. The attack in [[Nazran]] was presumably committed with a car loaded with remote detonated explosives. On April 7, 2004, President [[Murat Zyazikov]], a former [[KGB]] general, was lightly injured by a suicide car bomb, and he was saved by the [[armour]] plating of his [[Mercedes-Benz]]. On August 26, 2005, Prime Minister [[Ibragim Malsagov]] was wounded in a double bomb attack on his motorcade in Nazran which killed his driver. Dzhabrail Kostoyev himself had earlier become the target of several assassination attempts involving bomb and [[rocket]] attacks; two of his relatives including a brother, also a police officials, were killed in 2005.
* June 9, 2006 - Two officials were killed minutes apart in [[Ingushetia]] by gunmen wearing black uniforms, berets, and masks. The assassinations appeared to be another round of carefully timed attacks against the government. First, [[Galina Gubina]], an administrator responsible for helping ethnic Russian families resettle in the region was gunned down. Then, Musa Nalgiyev, the commander of Ingushetia's OMON riot police, was killed as he drove his three young children to school. Nalgiyev's children were also killed, as were the commander's two guards. In recent weeks, rebels in Ingushetia have also kidnapped Magomed Chakhiyev, a [[lawmaker]] and the [[father-in-law]] of President Murat Zyazikov, and have attempted to kill [[Health Minister]] [[Magomed Aliskhanov]]. Galina Gubina earlier escaped an attempt on her life two years ago when a bomb went off under Gubina's car, severely wounding her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/email-to-friend.php?article_id=2371187 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017141959/http://www.jamestown.org/email-to-friend.php?article_id=2371187 |date=October 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 8, 2006 - A car bomb and gun attack killed prosecutor Bitar Bitarov in Dagestan and wounded his two [[bodyguard]]s. On February 4, 2007 A motorcade including the armored car carrying Dagestani Interior Minister [[Adilgerei Magomedtagirov]] was also fired on as it approached the scene to investigate, and two police officers accompanying him were shot and killed. After this, a second bomb went off around 20 meters from the site of the first blast, wounding three of minister's bodyguards and three civilians. The Interior Ministry said the attacks appeared to have been carefully planned, and the rebels claimed responsibility. The next day two hand grenades targeted the house of [[Ingushetia]]'s [[Nazranovsky District]] prosecutor, [[Girkhan Khazbiyev]], killing his brother and injuring 13 family members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930191842/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=416&amp;issue_id=3831 ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 29, 2006 - A former police chief of an anti-organized crime department in southern Russia was gunned down near a hospital in central [[Nazran]] and died at the scene. [[Akhmed Murzabekov]], a district police chief in Ingushetia, was shot three times but survived a previous assassination attempt on August 23. The official said a rapid reaction group following Murzabekov engaged the attackers, possibly wounding one of them, but added that the assailants escaped.
* September 11, 2006 - Three army generals, including Chief of [[logistics]] of Russia's [[North Caucasus Military District]], Major-General [[Vladimir Sorokin]], died when an army Mi-8 helicopter crashed in a suburb of [[Vladikavkaz]], killing at least 12. It had a three-strong crew and was carrying a group of 11 high-ranking officers, including Gen. Sorokin and a few other generals, who were taking part in a military exercise that had begun in the region of North Ossetia earlier in the day. The local rebel group ''Kataib al-Khoul'', which has vowed to shoot down Russian military aircraft on September 7, accepted responsibility.
*July 21, 2007 - Gunmen in [[Karabulak, Republic of Ingushetia|Karabulak]], Ingushetia, killed [[Vakha Vedzizhev]], a well-known figure in the republic and an adviser to Ingushetia's president on religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L21664999.htm |title=A Thomson Reuters Foundation Service |publisher=AlertNet |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassinations in Moscow===
* June 25, 2004 - A former top official in Chechnya’s pro-Moscow administration, Lieutenant-General [[Yan Sergunin]], was shot point-blank and killed by an assailant riding a [[motorcycle]] in [[downtown]] Moscow, and his Chechen wife was wounded. Sergunin served as Chechnya’s Deputy Prime Minister and [[Chief of staff (politics)|Chief of Staff]] for the late Chechen president, Akhmad Kadyrov, between 2001 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cacianalyst.org/view_article.php?articleid=2512&amp;SMSESSION=NO |title=Central Asia - Caucasus Analyst |publisher=Cacianalyst.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204204337/http://www.cacianalyst.org/view_article.php?articleid=2512&amp;SMSESSION=NO |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* July 9, 2004 - First editor of [[Forbes]] Russian edition, [[United States|American]] journalist [[Paul Klebnikov]] was shot to death on a Moscow street late at night by unknown assailants. In August 2006 a source close to the case told [[Reuters]] the investigation was now focusing on a possible link between Klebnikov's murder and his interest in the possible [[misappropriation]] of Russian funds intended for the reconstruction of [[Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=1222932006 |title=News - Scotsman.com |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible there's a direct link with the murder of Yan Segunin two weeks before.
* October 7, 2006 - Russian journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]] was found shot dead in the elevator of her apartment block in central Moscow with four gunshot wounds, news agencies reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416218.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Chechen war reporter found dead |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-10-07 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/world/europe/08russia.html?hp&amp;ex=1160280000&amp;en=aee5e01fba4b16df&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage | work=The New York Times | first=C. J. | last=Chivers | title=Journalist Critical of Chechen War Is Shot Dead | date=October 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a prominent critic of the Chechen War and [[Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]. Politkovskaya's ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' said it believed her murder was either revenge by Chechen Prime Minister [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] or an attempt to discredit him. Politkovskaya also angered other powerful people - including the Russian military - with her investigative reporting and [[human rights]] advocacy.
* November 18, 2006 - [[Movladi Baisarov]], a Chechen warlord and former FSB special-task unit commander, was killed in central Moscow by members of the Chechen police.
* September 24, 2008 - Chechen clan leader and former Duma deputy [[Ruslan Yamadayev]] shot dead near the Kremlin in Moscow.

===Assassinations abroad===
* February 13, 2004 - The former Chechen President, [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]], was assassinated by a car bomb in [[Qatar]]; up to two other people were killed in the blast and his teenage son was wounded. The Russian government denied involvement in the attack by blaming infighting among rebel factions and a dispute over money. Moscow had, at the time, been involved in a bid to extradite Yandarbiyev to Russia to face terrorism-related charges. A Qatari court convicted two Russian government [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]] (SVR) agents in the bombing.
* January 13, 2009 - [[Umar Israilov]], former bodyguard and critic of Ramzan Kadyrov, was gunned down in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
* March 30, 2009  -  [[Sulim Yamadayev]], former commander of a GRU Spetznaz battalion and rival of [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], dies after being shot in Dubai.

'''Louise Diane d'Orléans''' (27 June 1716 &amp;ndash; 26 September 1736) was the sixth daughter and last child of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans]] (''[[Régence|Regent of the Kingdom]]'' from 1715 to 1723) and his wife, [[Françoise Marie de Bourbon]], the youngest legitimised  daughter of King [[Louis XIV of France]] and his mistress, [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]]. She was born during the [[Régence|Regency of Philippe d'Orléans]], the Regent of [[Louis XV of France]]. The [[Princess of Conti]] by marriage, she died in childbirth at the age of twenty. Some sources refer to her as ''Louis Diane''.

==Biography==
Louise Diane d'Orléans was born in the Palais-Royal, the Paris residence of the [[House of Orléans]], on 27 June 1716 as the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Orléans. On the subject of her granddaughter's birth, [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate]] (known at court simply as ''Madame'') said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''At the moment when I concluded my letter to the [[Caroline of Ansbach|Princess of Wales]], they came to announce to me that [[Françoise Marie de Bourbon|Madame d'Orléans]] was in labour. It was just eleven o'clock when my carriage was ready ''[at the [[Château de Saint-Cloud]] ]'', and at a quarter to one I entered the ante-chamber, and was told in a low voice : '[[Royal Highness|Her Royal Highness]] was safely brought to bed an hour ago.' But this was said in so sad a tone that I did not doubt that Madame d'Orléans had brought into the world a seventh daughter, and that unfortunately is what has happened.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Until her marriage, she was known as ''Mademoiselle de Chartres ''. The style of [[Mademoiselle de Chartres (disambiguation)|Mademoiselle de Chartres]] had been used by her older sister, [[Louise Adélaïde d'Orléans|Adélaïde]] (1698–1743) who, by the time of Louise Diane's birth, was a nun at Chelles. It was also used by her aunt [[Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans]] (1676–1744). She grew up with her younger sister [[Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans|Élisabeth, ''Mademoiselle de Montpensier'']] with a convent education. Her sister would later become the Queen of Spain as the wife of [[Louis I of Spain]].
[[File:Marriage of the Prince of Conti and Mademoiselle de Chartres in the Chapel of Versailles, 1732.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Engraving of ''The Marriage of the Prince of Conti and Mademoiselle de Chartres'' at Versailles, 1732]]
Louise grew up in an era when her father, known as ''Philippe d'Orléans'' or simply ''le Régent'' was the [[de facto]] ruler of France, him being in charge of the affairs of state since the death of Louise's maternal grand father Louis XIV. The Palais-Royal was where the Régent held his court and lived openly with his mistress [[Marie Thérèse de Parabère]]. Her mother would later acquire the [[Château de Bagnolet, Paris|Château de Bagnolet]] where she would live quietly without scandal.

As a member of the reigning [[House of Bourbon]], she was a ''[[Prince du Sang|princesse du sang]]''. As her [[Françoise Marie de Bourbon|mother]], by then the [[Duchess of Orléans]], was illegitimate by birth, Louise, like her siblings, was not a ''[[Fils de France|petite-fille de France]]''.

In her youth, she was said to have been a very sensitive child and would grow up to be one of the more beautiful of the Regent's daughters. As she was another girl (1 of 7 overall), her birth was not really greeted with the joy that had met her brother, [[Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans]]. Upon the death of her father in 1723, at Versailles, at the age of forty-nine, her only brother inherited the title of Duke of Orléans and, in 1724, he married [[Margravine Johanna of Baden-Baden]] (1704–1726).

In December 1731, it was decided that she should marry her distant cousin [[Louis François, Prince of Conti|Louis François de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]]. Her marriage was arranged by her mother [[Françoise Marie de Bourbon|Françoise Marie, ''Dowager Duchess of Orléans'']] and her first cousin (and subsequent mother in law) [[Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon|Louise Élisabeth, ''Dowager Princess of Conti'']].

After being baptised on 19 January 1732 by the [[Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan|Cardinal of Rohan]] (then the [[Grand Almoner of France]]), she married the Prince of Conti three days later, on 22 January. The marriage ceremony took place at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Louise was then fifteen years old. At her wedding, her Condé cousin [[Élisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon]] had the honour of holding her train.

After the marriage, she became known at court as [[Serene Highness|Her Serene Highness]], the Princess of Conti. Her husband had succeeded to the Conti title in 1727 upon the death of his father, [[Louis Armand II, Prince of Conti]]. In 1734, Louise gave birth to a son, heir to the Conti name, and, in 1736, to a second child who died at birth.

Louise died in childbirth on 26 September 1736 at [[Issy-les-Moulineaux|Issy]], outside Paris. She was buried at the Saint-André-des-Arcs church&lt;!-- checking if church is one in Paris or Issy-les-Moulineaux/FW --&gt;. At her death, due to the Queen [[Marie Leszczyńska]] being otherwise engaged, the queen sent Louise's cousin [[Marie Anne de Bourbon (1697–1741)|Marie Anne de Bourbon]] (''Mademoiselle de Clermont'') to represent her at Issy.

Her only surviving son, [[Louis François Joseph, Prince of Conti|Louis François Joseph]], was the last [[Princes of Conti|Prince of Conti]].

==Issue==
#[[Louis François Joseph, Prince of Conti|Louis François Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Conti]] (1 September 1734 &amp;ndash; 13 March 1814) married his first cousin  [[Maria Fortunata d'Este|Princess Maria Fortunata of Modena]]; had no legitimate issue.
#Stillborn son (26 September 1736).

In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] and [[Etruscan mythology]], '''Mania''' (or '''Manea''') was a [[goddess]] of the dead. She, along with [[Mantus]], ruled the [[underworld]]. She was said to be the mother of [[ghosts]], the [[undead]], and other [[spiritual being|spirits]] of the night, as well as the [[Lares]] and the [[Manes]]. Her name links her to the Manes, [[Mana Genita]], and [[Manius (praenomen)|Manius]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Woodard, ''Indo-European Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' (University of Illinois Press, 2006), pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Greek and Latin ''Mania'' derive from [[PIE]] *''men-'', "to think." [[Cognate]]s include [[Ancient Greek]] μένος / ''ménos'' ("mind", "thought") and [[Avestan]] 𐬎𐬫𐬥𐬌𐬀𐬨 / ''mainyu'' ("spirit")

In Roman and Etruscan mythology, Mania (Manea) is the Goddess of Spirits and Chaos. In Greek Mythology, she is the Goddess of insanity and madness.

[[File:De Morgan Medea.jpg|thumb|''Medea'' by [[Evelyn De Morgan]]]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Medea''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|d|iː|ə}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Μήδεια}}, ''Mēdeia'', {{lang-ka|მედეა}}) is the daughter of [[Aeëtes|King Aeëtes]] of [[Colchis]],&lt;ref&gt;Colchis was an ancient [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; a niece of [[Circe]] and the granddaughter of [[Helios]], the sun god begat by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]]. Medea figures in the myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], appearing in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' around 700 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]] ''Theogony'' 993-1002&lt;/ref&gt; but best known from a 3rd century BC literary version by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] called the ''[[Argonautica]]''. Medea is known in most stories as a sorceress and is often depicted as a priestess of the goddess [[Hecate]].

== Genealogy and divinity ==
There have been many different accounts of Medea's family tree. One of the only uncontested facts is that she is a direct descendant of the sun god Helios through her father King Aeëtes of Colchis. Helios and his wife Perse (or Perses) had four children: Aeëtes, Circe, Pasiphae, and Perses. Aeëtes then married [[Idyia]] (or Iduia) and Medea was one of their children. This is where scholars have begun to question the rest of Medea's genealogy. By some accounts, Aeëtes and Idyia only had two daughters, Medea and Chalciope (or Chalkiope) and Apsyrtus (or Apsyrtos) was the son of Aeëtes through Asterodea. According to others, Idyia gave birth to Medea and Apsyrtus and Asterodea gave birth to Chalciope. Medea then marries Jason, although the number and names of their children are contested by different scholars. Euripides mentions two unnamed sons (whom Medea kills), others have suggested three sons (Thessalus, Alcimenes, and Tisander) two sons (Mermerus and Pheres) or a son and a daughter (Medeius and Eriopis). After Medea leaves Jason in Corinth, she marries the king of Athens (Aegeus) and bears him a son. Scholars have questioned whether her son Medeius is the son of Jason or of Aegeus, but Medeius goes on to become the ancestor of the Medes by conquering their lands.

The importance of Medea's genealogy is to help define what level of divinity she possessed. By some accounts, like the ''Argonautica'', she is depicted as a young, mortal woman. She is directly influenced by the Greek gods (through Hera and Aphrodite) and while she possesses magical abilities, she is still a mortal with divine ancestry. Other accounts, like Euripides' play ''Medea'', focus on her mortality, although she transcends the mortal world at the end of the play with the help of her grandfather Helios and his sun chariot. Hesiod's Theogony places her marriage to Jason on the list of marriages between mortals and divine, suggesting that she is predominantly divine. She also has connections with the Hecate,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medea|last=Griffiths|first=Emma|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|location=London: New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the goddess of magic, which could be one of the main sources of which she draws her magical ties.

===Jason and Medea===
{{redirect|Jason and Medea}}
[[Image:Jason and Medea - John William Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|''Jason and Medea'' by [[John William Waterhouse]] (1907)|alt=|275x275px]]

Medea's role began after Jason came from [[Iolcus]] to [[Colchis]], to claim his inheritance and throne by retrieving the [[Golden Fleece]]. In the most complete surviving account, the ''Argonautica'' of Apollonius of Rhodes, Medea fell in love with him and promised to help him, but only on the condition that if he succeeded, he would take her with him and marry her. Jason agreed. In a familiar mythic motif, Aeëtes promised to give him the fleece, but only if he could perform certain tasks. First, Jason had to plough a field with fire-breathing oxen that he had to yoke himself; Medea gave him an [[unguent]] with which to anoint himself and his weapons, to protect them from the bulls' fiery breath. Next, Jason had to sow the teeth of a [[European dragon|dragon]] in the ploughed field (compare the myth of [[Cadmus]]), and the teeth sprouted into an army of warriors; Jason was forewarned by Medea, however, and knew to throw a rock into the crowd. Unable to determine where the rock had come from, the soldiers attacked and killed each other. Finally, Aeëtes made Jason fight and kill the sleepless dragon that guarded the fleece; Medea put the beast to sleep with her [[narcotic]] herbs. Jason then took the fleece and sailed away with Medea, as he had promised. Apollonius says that Medea only helped Jason in the first place because [[Hera]] had convinced [[Aphrodite]] or [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] to cause Medea to fall in love with him. Medea distracted her father as they fled by killing her brother [[Absyrtus]].

In some versions, Medea was said to have dismembered her brother's body and scattered his parts on an island, knowing her father would stop to retrieve them for proper burial; in other versions, it was [[Absyrtus]] himself who pursued them and was killed by Jason. During the fight, [[Atalanta]], a member of the group helping Jason in his quest for the fleece, was seriously wounded, but Medea healed her. According to some versions,{{which|date=February 2017}} Medea and Jason stopped on her aunt [[Circe]]'s island so that she could be cleansed after murdering her brother, relieving her of blame for the deed.

On the way back to [[Thessaly]], Medea prophesied that [[Euphemus]], the helmsman of Jason's ship, the ''[[Argo]]'', would one day rule over all [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]. This came true through [[Battus (mythology)|Battus]], a descendant of Euphemus'.

The ''Argo'' then reached the island of [[Crete]], guarded by the bronze man, [[Talos]] (Talus).  Talos had one vein which went from his neck to his ankle, bound shut by a single bronze nail. According to Apollodorus, Talos was slain either when Medea drove him mad with drugs, deceived him that she would make him immortal by removing the nail, or was killed by [[Poeas]]'s arrow (Apollodorus 1.140). In the ''[[Argonautica]]'', Medea hypnotized him from the ''Argo'', driving him mad so that he dislodged the nail, [[ichor]] flowed from the wound, and he bled to death (Argonautica 4.1638). After Talos died, the ''Argo'' landed.

Jason, celebrating his return with the Golden Fleece, noted that his father [[Aeson]] was too aged and infirm to participate in the celebrations. Medea withdrew the blood from Aeson's body,  infused it with certain herbs, and returned it to his veins, invigorating him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daughters of king [[Pelias]] saw this and wanted the same service for their father.

While Jason searched for the Golden Fleece, [[Hera]], who was still angry at Pelias, conspired to make Jason fall in love with Medea, whom Hera hoped would kill Pelias.  When Jason and Medea returned to Iolcus, Pelias still refused to give up his throne, so Medea conspired to have Pelias' own daughters kill him.  She told them she could turn an old ram into a young ram by cutting up the old ram and boiling it in magic herbs.  During her demonstration, a live, young ram jumped out of the pot.  Excited, the girls cut their father into pieces and threw him into a pot. Having killed Pelias, Jason and Medea fled to [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]].

Various sources state that Jason and Medea had between one and fourteen children, including sons [[Alcimenes]], [[Thessalus]], [[Tisander]], [[Mermeros and Pheres]], [[Medus]], and Argos, and a daughter, [[Eriopis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=William|authorlink1=William Smith (lexicographer)|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology: Vol 2|date=1870|page=1004|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/acl3129.0002.001/1014?page=root;size=100;view=image|accessdate=6 December 2016|chapter=Medeia| quote=Her children are, according to some accounts, Mermerus, Pheres or Thessalus, Alcimenes and Tisander, and, according to others, she had seven sons and seven daughters, while others mention only two children, Medus (some call him Polyxemus) and Eriopis, or one son Argos.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married for 10 years in Corinth.{{sfn|Godwin|1876|p=42}}

===Various versions' endings===
[[Image:Medeia child Louvre K300.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Medea murders one of her children (Louvre)]]

In Corinth, Jason abandoned Medea for the king's daughter, Glauce. Before the fifth century BC, there seem to have been two variants of the myth's conclusion. According to the poet [[Eumelus of Corinth|Eumelus]], to whom the fragmentary epic ''Korinthiaka'' is usually attributed, Medea killed her children by accident.&lt;ref&gt;As noted in a [[scholium]] to [[Pindar]]'s ''Olympian Ode'' 13.74; cf. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 2.3.10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Creophylus]], however, blamed their murders on the citizens of Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;As noted in the scholium to ''Medea'' 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Euripides]]' [[Medea (play)|version]], Medea took her revenge by sending Glauce a dress and golden coronet, covered in poison. This resulted in the deaths of both the princess and the king, [[Creon (king of Corinth)|Creon]], when he went to save his daughter. Medea then continued her revenge, murdering two of her children herself. Afterward, she left Corinth and flew to Athens in a golden chariot driven by dragons sent by her grandfather, Helios, god of the sun.

This deliberate murder of her children by Medea appears to be Euripides' invention, although some scholars believe [[Neophron]] created this alternate tradition.&lt;ref&gt;See McDermott 1985, 10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[filicide]] would go on to become the standard for later writers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]] ''Fabulae'' 25; [[Ovid]] ''Met''. 7.391ff.; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] ''Medea''; ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 1.9.28 favors Euripides' version of events, but also records the variant that the Corinthians killed Medea's children in retaliation for her crimes.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], writing in the late 2nd century AD, records five different versions of what happened to Medea's children after reporting that he has seen a monument for them while traveling in Corinth.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 2.3.6-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleeing from Jason, Medea made her way to [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], where she healed [[Heracles]] (the former Argonaut) from the curse of Hera (that led to the murder of [[Iphitus]], his best friend). In return, Heracles gave her a place to stay in Thebes until the Thebans drove her out in anger, despite Heracles' protests. {{Citation needed|reason=no supporting text|date=December 2013}}

She then fled to [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], where she met and married [[Aegeus]]. They had one son, [[Medus]], although Hesiod makes Medus the son of Jason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]] ''Theogony'' 1000-2&lt;/ref&gt; Her domestic bliss was once again shattered by the arrival of Aegeus' long-lost son, [[Theseus]]. Determined to preserve her own son's inheritance, Medea convinced her husband that Theseus was a threat and that he should be disposed of. As Medea handed Theseus a cup of poison, Aegeus recognized the young man's sword as his own, which he had left behind many years previously for his newborn son, to be given to him when he came of age. Knocking the cup from Medea's hand, Aegeus embraced Theseus as his own.

Medea then returned to Colchis and, finding that Aeëtes had been deposed by his brother [[Perses (brother of Aeetes)|Perses]], promptly killed her uncle and restored the kingdom to her father. [[Herodotus]] reports another version, in which Medea and her son Medus fled from Athens, on her flying chariot, to the Iranian plateau and lived among the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Aryans]], who then changed their name to the [[Medes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] ''Histories'' VII.62i&lt;/ref&gt;

Recounting the many variations of Medea's story, the 1st century BC historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote, "Speaking generally, it is because of the desire of the tragic poets for the marvelous that so varied and inconsistent an account of Medea has been given out."&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus 4.56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 031.jpg|thumb|''Medea About to Murder Her Children'' by [[Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix]] (1862)]]

In Euripides' play ''Medea'' she is a woman scorned, rejected by her husband Jason and seeking revenge. Deborah Boedeker writes about different images and symbolism used in Euripides' play to invoke responses from his original Athenian audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medea: Essays on Medea in Myth, Literature, Philosophy, and Art.|last=Boedeker|first=Deborah|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ.|pages=127–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nurse gives descriptions of Medea in the prologue, highlighting comparisons to great forces of nature and different animals. There are also many nautical references throughout the play either used by other characters when describing Medea or by Medea herself. By including these references, Boedeker argues that these comparisons were used to create connections to the type of woman Medea was. She holds great power (referred to by the comparisons to forces of nature), she relies on her basic animal-like instincts and emotions (connections to different animals like bulls and lions), and it draws the audience back her original myth of Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece and the sea voyage taken by Jason, Medea, and the Argonauts.

Emma Griffiths also adds to the analysis of Medea's character in Euripides's play by discussing the male/female dichotomy created by Euripides.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Medea does not fit into the mold of a “normal woman” according to Athenian philosophy. She is depicted of having great intelligence and skill, something typically viewed as a masculine trait by Euripides' original audience. On the other hand, she uses that cunning in order to manipulate the men around her, and manipulation of other people would have been a negative female trait to the Athenian audience. There is also the paradox of how she chooses to murder her victims in the play. She poisons the princess, which would have been seen as a feminine way of murder, yet kills her children in cold blood, which is seen as more masculine. She also has dialogue about her children and shows a strong maternal love and connection to them, something that was essential to “normal women” in Athenian society. Yet at the end of the play she is able to kill her children as part of her revenge. It is through these opposites that Euripides creates a complicated character for his protagonist.

Although not the first depiction of Medea, the Argonautica by Apollonios Rhodios gives a fuller description of events that lead up to Euripides's play, mainly surrounding Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece. In this literary work, Medea is presented not as a powerful woman seeking justice rather she is a young woman who is desperately in love with Jason. So much in love that she decides to defy her father and kill her brother in order to help him. James J. Clauss writes about this version of Medea, attempting to unearth another version of this character for scholarship and discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medea: Essays on Medea in Myth, Literature, Philosophy, and Art.|last=Clauss|first=James J.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ.|pages=149–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looks into different passages in the original text to define the meaning and draw connection to the different feelings Medea was going through. He argues the feelings of Medea's initial love for Jason, the shame she feels for loving him and for going against her family, and final agreement to help Jason in his quest.

Multiple scholars have discussed Medea's use as a “helper maiden” to Jason's quest. A helper maid is typically personified as a young woman who helps on a hero's quest usually out of love. Instead of being the center of the story like she is in Euripides' ''Medea'', this version of Medea is reduced to a supporting role. Her main purpose is to help the hero with his quest. Jason would never have been successful on his quest without Medea's help, something that is pointed out and referenced many times in ancient texts and contemporary scholarly work.

Other, non-literary traditions guided the vase-painters,&lt;ref&gt;As on the bell krater at the Cleveland Museum of Art (91.1) discussed in detail by [[Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood]], "Medea at a Shifting Distance: Images and Euripidean tragedy", in Clauss and Johnston 1997, pp 253-96.&lt;/ref&gt; and a localized, [[chthonic]] presence of Medea was propitiated with unrecorded emotional overtones at Corinth, at the sanctuary devoted to her slain children,&lt;ref&gt;Edouard Will, ''Corinth'' 1955. "By identifying Medea, Ino and Melikertes, Bellerophon, and Hellotis as pre-Olympianprecursors of Hera, Poseidon, and Athena, he could give to Corinth a religious antiquity it did not otherwise possess", wrote Nancy Bookidis, "The Sanctuaries of Corinth", ''Corinth'' '''20''' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; or locally venerated elsewhere as a foundress of cities.&lt;ref&gt;"Pindar shows her prophesying the foundation of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]; [[Herodotus]] makes her the legendary [[eponym]]ous founder of the Medes; [[Callimachus]] and [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]] describe colonies founded by Colchians originally sent out in pursuit of her" observes Nita Krevans, "Medea as foundation heroine", in Clauss and Johnston 1997 pp 71-82 (p. 71).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcelino Antonio "Miko" Carag Sotto III''' (May 10, 1982 &amp;ndash; December 29, 2003) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[matinee idol]], [[actor]], and teen star, and son of singer/actress/radio commentator/TV host [[Ali Sotto]].

==Early life==
A talent of the GMA Artist Center, Sotto became a TV fixture, with stints on [[GMA-7]]'s youth oriented programs ''[[Click (Philippine TV series)|Click]]'' and ''[[Kahit Kailan]]''.

==Personal life==
Miko Sotto was part of the prominent Sotto family in showbiz. He was a great-grandson of former Senator [[Vicente Sotto]] and the grandson and grandnephew of Marcelino Antonio O. Sotto and Vicente Sotto, Jr. respectively. His parents were Ali Sotto and Marcelino Antonio "Maru" Sotto, Jr., brother of incumbent Senator [[Tito Sotto|Vicente "Tito" Sotto III]], [[Val Sotto]] and comedian [[Vic Sotto]]. His granduncle Filemon Sotto was also a former senator in the Philippines. His cousins were actors [[Oyo Sotto]], [[Ciara Sotto]], [[Danica Sotto]] and Gian Sotto.

At the time of his death, he was romantically involved with actress [[Angel Locsin]], who became Oyo Sotto's girlfriend a few months after his demise.

==Filmography==

*''Bahay ni Lola'' (2001) as Buboy
*''Bakit Ba Ganyan? (Ewan ko nga ba, Darling)'' (2000)

===Television===
*''[[SiS (TV series)|SiS]]'' (2003) as himself / guest (last TV appearance together with his mother Ali Sotto)

==Death==
Sotto died after he fell from the ninth floor of a condominium building he was living in for 4 years in [[Mandaluyong City]] before dawn on December 29, 2003.

According to initial investigation, Sotto was with his cousin [[Oyo Boy Sotto]], two other friends, and a helper at the San Francisco Garden Plaza Condominium in Bonifacio Avenue, Mandaluyong.

According to reports, a security guard saw Sotto seated at the railings of the balcony.

Sotto was about to part with his friends and tried to get down from the railings when his foot allegedly got caught in a plant box, causing him to lose his balance and fall from his perch.

Sotto, 21, was immediately rushed to the nearby Mandaluyong Medical Center where he was declared dead on arrival. "The patient died from multiple skull fracture", according to the physician on duty at the hospital.

From the Mandaluyong hospital, Sotto was brought to [[Makati Medical Center]] but doctors there were also unable to revive him.

His mother, Ali donated Miko's corneas to the Eye Bank of the Philippines at the time of his death. Two weeks thereafter, his corneas were transplanted to two women.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

[[File:شهید سبز.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Mohammad Mokhtari]]
'''Mohammad Mokhtari''' ({{lang-fa| محمد مختاری}}) (September 10, 1989 – February 15, 2011) was an Iranian university student fatally wounded by a gunshot during the February 14 [[2011 Iranian protests|2011 protests]] in Tehran in support of [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian]] and [[2010–2011 Tunisian revolution|Tunisian revolutions]]. He died the next day, while hospitalized. Like [[Sane Jaleh]], the other protester at the demonstration who was killed, both pro- and anti-Iranian government sides claim him as a supporter.&lt;ref name="TehranBureau"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/02/god-let-me-die-standing-remembering-mohammad-mokhtari.html 'God, Let Me Die Standing': Remembering Mohammad Mokhtari] by DAN GEIST, Tehran Bureau, 17 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammad reportedly "came from a large middle class family, and loved sports". He was attending [[Islamic Azad University|Azad University]] in [[Shahrood]].&lt;ref name="TehranBureau"/&gt;

==Killing and controversy==
The ''[[Tehran Times]]'' wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;according to witnesses, Jalleh, Mokhtari, and two other people were shot by rioters during the unrest on Monday. Jalleh succumbed to his injuries on the same day, and Mokhtari died on Tuesday day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=235969 "Funeral processions held for two martyrs of illegal demos"], ''Tehran Times'', February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact they were killed by basij&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast, the American newspaper the [[Wall Street Journal]] reported that Mokhtari was one of the "rioters." Reporter Farnaz Fassihi—who spoke with "Mokhtari's family and friends"—wrote that Mokhtari enjoyed watching [[Voice of America]]'s anti-government satire television program [[Parazit]], and posted messages on [[Facebook]] encouraging his friends to join the anti-government protests. She stated both he and Jaleh

&lt;blockquote&gt;
were shot by men on motorcycles that their friends say bore the hallmarks of the Iranian paramilitary [[Basij]].

After Mr. Mokhtari was shot, he briefly fell to the ground but got up and continued marching for a while as blood soaked his shirt, witnesses said. He said he was fine, according to [a] friend, but died in the hospital the next day.

...three days before his death, Mr. Mokhtari wrote on his Facebook wall, "God, give me death by standing for it's better than a life of sitting under oppression."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703961104576148070942697648 "In Tehran, Funerals Bring New Clashes"], ''Wall Street Journal'', By Farnaz Fassihi, FEBRUARY 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
On February 20 "thousands took to the streets of Iran's largest cities ... to commemorate the deaths" of the two protesters. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], during a protest in the city of Shiraz yet another student demonstrator was killed, Hamed Nour-Mohammadi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/03/iran-end-violence-against-protesters Iran: End Violence Against Protesters], Human Rights Watch, 3 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to anti-government activists, Nour-Mohammadi was "killed by security forces" while "trying to escape their attacks". Iranian state media quoted "Shiraz University Chancellor Mohammad Moazeni as saying that Nour-Mohammadi was killed in a car accident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/iran_student_killed/2317385.html Iranian Students Say The Number Of Arrests Show Regime Is Nervous], RFERL, February 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia''' ('''NAITP''', '''NAIT''', '''NATP''' or '''NAT''') is a [[disease]] that affects babies in which the [[thrombocytopenia|platelet count is decreased]]. Platelet antigens are inherited from both mother and father.  {{sc2|NAIT}} is caused by antibodies specific for platelet antigens inherited from the father but which are absent in the mother.&lt;ref name="Roback2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Technical manual|year=2008|publisher=American Association of Blood Banks (AABB)|location=Bethesda, Md.|isbn=978-1563952609|edition=16th|editor=John D. Roback|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fetomaternal transfusions (or fetomaternal hemorrhage) results in the recognition of these antigens by the mother's immune system as non-self, with the subsequent generation of allo-reactive antibodies which cross the placenta. {{sc2|NAIT}}, hence, is caused by transplacental passage of maternal platelet-specific [[alloantibodies|alloantibody]] and rarely [[human leukocyte antigen]] ({{sc2|HLA}}) allo-antibodies&lt;ref name="pmid18400574"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Porcelijn L, Van den Akker ES, Oepkes D |title=Fetal thrombocytopenia|journal=Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine|date=31 July 2008|volume=13|issue=4|pages=223–230|doi=10.1016/j.siny.2008.02.008|pmid=18400574}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which are expressed by platelets) to fetuses whose platelets express the corresponding antigens. {{sc2|NAIT}} occurs in somewhere between 1/800&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Cecile|title=Foetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopaenia|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|date=1 January 2006|volume=1|issue=1|pages=39|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-1-39|pmid=17032445|pmc=1624806}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1/5000&lt;ref name="pmid1932744"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=JG|author2=Aster, RH |author3=Bussel, JB |author4=Gianopoulos, JG |author5=Derbes, RS |author6= Newman, PJ |title=Prenatal diagnosis of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes.|journal=Blood|date=Nov 1, 1991|volume=78|issue=9|pages=2276–82|pmid=1932744|url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/78/9/2276.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; live births. More recent studies of {{sc2|NAIT}} seem to indicate that it occurs in around 1/600 live births in the Caucasian population.&lt;ref name="pmid20618318"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kamphuis MM, Paridaans N, Porcelijn L, De Haas M, Van Der Schoot CE, Brand A, Bonsel GJ, Oepkes D |title=Screening in pregnancy for fetal or neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia: systematic review|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology|date=1 October 2010|volume=117|issue=11|pages=1335–1343|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02657.x|pmid=20618318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Frequently, the thrombocytopenia is mild and the affected neonates remain largely asymptomatic.  In these cases, therapeutic interventions are not indicated. In case of severe thrombocytopenia, the neonates may exhibit hemorrhagic complication at or a few hours after delivery. The most serious complication is intracranial hemorrhage, leading to death in approximately 10% or neurologic sequelae in 20% of cases.
=== Related conditions ===
[[Immune thrombocytopenic purpura]] ({{sc2|ITP}}), sometimes called [[idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]] is a condition in which autoantibodies are directed against a patient's own platelets, causing platelet destruction and thrombocytopenia.  Anti-platelet autoantibodies in a pregnant woman with [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]] will attack the patient's own platelets and will also cross the placenta and react against fetal platelets.  Therefore, {{sc2|ITP}} is a significant cause of fetal and neonatal immune thrombocytopenia.  Approximately 10% of newborns affected by {{sc2|ITP}} will have platelet counts &lt;50,000 μL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1% to 2% will have a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage comparable to infants with {{sc2|NAIT}}.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12947011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webert|first=KE|author2=Mittal, R |author3=Sigouin, C |author4=Heddle, NM |author5= Kelton, JG |title=A retrospective 11-year analysis of obstetric patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura|journal=Blood|date=Dec 15, 2003|volume=102|issue=13|pages=4306–11|doi=10.1182/blood-2002-10-3317|pmid=12947011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothers with thrombocytopenia or a previous diagnosis of {{sc2|ITP}} should be tested for serum antiplatelet antibodies.  A woman with symptomatic thrombocytopenia and an identifiable antiplatelet antibody should be started on therapy for their {{sc2|ITP}} which may include steroids or {{sc2|IVIG}}.  Fetal blood analysis to determine the platelet count is not generally performed as {{sc2|ITP}}-induced thrombocytopenia in the fetus is generally less severe than {{sc2|NAIT}}. Platelet transfusions may be performed in newborns, depending on the degree of thrombocytopenia.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
About 80% of cases of {{sc2|NAIT}} are caused by antibodies against platelet antigen [[HPA-1a|{{sc2|HPA}}-1a]], 15% by anti-[[HPA-5b|{{sc2|HPA}}-5b]], and 5% by other antibodies (e.g. [[HPA-1b|{{sc2|HPA}}-1b]], {{sc2|HPA}}-15, {{sc2|HPA}}-3 and {{sc2|HPA}}-9b).&lt;ref name="pmid2563515"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mueller-Eckhardt|first=Christian|author2=Grubert, Alfons |author3=Weisheit, Marianne |author4=Mueller-Eckhardt, Gertrud |author5=Kiefel, Volker |author6=Kroll, Hartmut |author7=Schmidt, Sabine |author8= Santoso, Sentot |title=348 cases of suspected neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia|journal=The Lancet|date=31 January 1989|volume=333|issue=8634|pages=363–366|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(89)91733-9|pmid=2563515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davoren|first1=A|last2=Curtis|first2=BR|last3=Aster|first3=RH|last4=McFarland|first4=JG|title=Human platelet antigen-specific alloantibodies implicated in 1162 cases of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.|journal=Transfusion|date=August 2004|volume=44|issue=8|pages=1220–5|pmid=15265127|doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.04026.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{sc2|HPA}}-1a is present in 98% of the population of the United States, suggesting that approximately 2% of women who are {{sc2|HPA}}-1a negative may be at risk for {{sc2|NAIT}} during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mais2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mais|first=Daniel D.|title=Quick Compendium of Clinical Pathology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7385LQAACAAJ|accessdate=15 September 2013|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Amer Soc Of Clinical Path|isbn=978-0-89189-567-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the antigen expression of the father must also be taken into account—in most cases the father is {{sc2|HPA}}-1a/1a or 1a/1b and the mother is {{sc2|HPA}}-1b/1b with anti-{{sc2|HPA}}-1a antibodies.

The offending antibodies are IgG subtype and therefore capable of crossing the placenta and entering the fetal circulation.

Unlike [[hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn]], {{sc2|NAIT}} occurs during the first pregnancy in up to 50% of cases,&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt; and the affected fetuses may develop severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;50,000 μL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) very early during pregnancy (as early as 20 weeks gestation, consistent with the development of platelet antigens,&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt; and the majority of the time [[in utero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiller|first1=H|last2=Kamphuis|first2=MM|last3=Flodmark|first3=O|last4=Papadogiannakis|first4=N|last5=David|first5=AL|last6=Sainio|first6=S|last7=Koskinen|first7=S|last8=Javela|first8=K|last9=Wikman|first9=AT|last10=Kekomaki|first10=R|last11=Kanhai|first11=HH|last12=Oepkes|first12=D|last13=Husebekk|first13=A|last14=Westgren|first14=M|title=Fetal intracranial haemorrhages caused by fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia: an observational cohort study of 43 cases from an international multi centre registry |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/3/e002490 |journal=BMJ Open|date=22 March 2013|volume=3|issue=3|pages=e002490|pmid=23524102|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002490|pmc=3612794}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Usually, the thrombocytopenia increases as gestation progresses. During the first pregnancy, {{sc2|NAIT}} is often not detected until birth when the newborn presents with classic symptoms of thrombocytopenia including [[petechiae]], bruising or intracranial hemorrhage.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt; In utero intracranial hemorrhage occurs in about 10% to 30% of affected cases (and {{sc2|NAIT}} is thought to be the underlying cause in the majority of cases of intracranial hemorrhage due to thrommbocytopenia- greater than all other causes of thrombocytopenia combined). The risk of hemorrhage is inversely related to the platelet count with the greatest risk when the platelet count is below 100,000 μL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;

The recurrence of {{sc2|NAIT}} has been estimated to be more than 80% in subsequent pregnancies with incompatible fetuses (i.e. subsequent pregnancies which also carry the target platelet antigen).  Subsequent cases of {{sc2|NAIT}} may be equivalent or more severe.

The fetal response to {{sc2|NAIT}} is variable and may include compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Rarely, fetal hydrops may develop.  Fetal anemia (in presence of red cell incompatibility) may also occur.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Maternal and paternal platelet antigen phenotyping and screening of the maternal serum for anti-platelet antibodies can be performed.&lt;ref name="Mais2008" /&gt;

Additionally, platelet antigen [[genotyping]] can be performed on the maternal and paternal blood to determine the exact nature of the incompatibility.

Neonatal platelet counts on laboratory testing are typically under 20,000 μL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Higher counts may suggest a different diagnosis, such as maternal [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]].

==Treatment==

===During pregnancy===
Cordocentesis can be performed in utero to determine the platelet count of the fetus.  This procedure is only performed if a ''prior'' pregnancy was affected by {{sc2|NAIT}}.  Intrauterine transfusions can be performed during cordocentesis for primary prevention of intracerebral hemorrhage.  Any administered cellular blood products must be irradiated to reduce the risk of [[graft-versus-host disease]] in the fetus. Additionally, all administered blood products should be {{sc2|CMV}} reduced-risk ({{sc2|CMV}} seronegative and leukoreduced are considered essentially equivalent for the purposes of {{sc2|CMV}} risk reduction).&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;

If intrauterine platelet transfusions are performed, they are generally repeated weekly (platelet lifespan after transfusion is approximately 8 to 10 days).   Platelets administered to the fetus must be negative for the culprit antigen (often {{sc2|HPA}}-1a, as stated above).  Many blood suppliers (such as [[American Red Cross]] and [[United Blood Services]]) have identified {{sc2|HPA}}-1a negative donors.  An alternative donor is the mother who is, of course, negative for the culprit antigen.  However, she must meet general criteria for donation and platelets received from the mother must be washed to remove the offending alloantibody and irradiated to reduce the risk of [[graft-versus-host disease]].  If platlet transfusions are needed urgently, incompatible platelets may be used, with the understanding that they may be less effective and that the administration of any blood product carries risk.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;

The use of [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] ({{sc2|IVIG}}) during pregnancy and immediately after birth has been shown to help reduce or alleviate the effects of {{sc2|NAIT}} in infants and reduce the severity of thrombocytopenia.  The most common treatment is weekly {{sc2|IVIG}} infusions at a dosage of 1 g/kg beginning at 16 to 28 weeks of pregnancy, depending on the severity of the disease in the previous affected child, and continuing until the birth of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{eMedicine2|med|3256|Immune Thrombocytopenia and Pregnancy}} on eMedicine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17309545"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van den Akker|first=ESA|author2=Oepkes, D |author3=Lopriore, E |author4=Brand, A |author5= Kanhai, HHH |title=Noninvasive antenatal management of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia: safe and effective|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology|date=1 April 2007|volume=114|issue=4|pages=469–473|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2007.01244.x|pmid=17309545}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases this dosage is increased to 2 g/kg and/or combined with a course of prednisone  depending on the exact circumstances of the case.  Although this treatment has not been shown to be effective in all cases it has been shown to reduce the severity of thrombocytopenia in some. Also, it is suspected that (though not understood why) {{sc2|IVIG}} provides some added protection from intercranial haemorrhage ({{sc2|ICH}}) to the fetus.  Even with {{sc2|IVIG}} treatment, the fetal platelet count may need to be monitored and platelet transfusions may still be required.

The goal of both {{sc2|IVIG}} and platelet transfusion is to avoid hemorrhage.  Ultrasound monitoring to detect hemorrhage is not recommended as detection of intracranial hemorrhage generally indicates permanent brain damage (there is no intervention that can be performed to reverse the damage once it has occurred).

Before delivery, the fetal platelet count should be determined.  A count of &gt;50,000 μL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is recommended for vaginal delivery and the count should be kept above 20,000 μL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; after birth.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;

===After birth===
The most rapidly effective treatment in infants with severe hemorrhage and/or severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;30,000  μL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is the transfusion of compatible platelets (i.e. platelets from a donor who, like the mother, lacks the causative antigen). Additionally, if the thrombocytopenia in the infant at birth is not severe enough to warrant a transfusion of platelets (&gt;30,000  μL&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) an infusion of {{sc2|IVIG}} (1 g/kg/day for two days) in the infant has been shown to rapidly increase [[platelet count]] and reduce the risk of related injury.

After a first affected pregnancy, if a mother has plans for a subsequent pregnancy, then the mother and father should be typed for platelet antigens and the mother screened for alloantibodies.  Testing is available through reference laboratories (such as {{sc2|ARUP}}).  {{sc2|DNA}} testing of the father can be used to determine zygosiity of the involved antigen and therefore risk to future pregnancies (if homozygous for the antigen, all subsequent pregnancies will be affected, if heterozygous, there is an approximate 50% risk to each subsequent pregnancy).  During subsequent pregnancies, the genotype of the fetus can also be determined using amniotic fluid analysis or maternal blood as early as 18 weeks gestation to definitively determine the risk to the fetus.&lt;ref name="Roback2008" /&gt;

The '''neurotrophic electrode''' is an [[Chronic electrode implants|intracortical device]] designed to read the electrical signals that the brain uses to process information. It consists of a small, hollow glass cone attached to several electrically conductive gold wires. The term ''[[neurotrophic]]'' means "relating to the nutrition and maintenance of nerve tissue" and the device gets its name from the fact that it is coated with [[Matrigel]] and [[nerve growth factor]] to encourage the expansion of [[neurites]] through its tip.&lt;ref name="activity"&gt;Kennedy, P. R., &amp; Bakay, R. A. E. (1997). Activity of single action potentials in monkey motor cortex during long-term task learning. Brain Research, 760(1-2), 251-254.&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by neurologist Dr. Philip Kennedy and was successfully implanted for the first time in a human patient in 1996 by neurosurgeon Roy Bakay.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;Interview with Dr. Kennedy, Senior Research Scientist, Neural Signals, Inc., 9/30/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Motivation for development===
Victims of [[locked-in syndrome]] are cognitively intact and aware of their surroundings, but cannot move or communicate due to near complete paralysis of voluntary muscles. In early attempts to return some degree of control to these patients, researchers used [[Neural coding|cortical signals]] obtained with [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) to drive a mouse cursor. However, EEG lacks the speed and precision that can be obtained by using a direct cortical interface.&lt;ref name="cursor"&gt;Kennedy, P. R., Bakay, R. A. E., Moore, M. M., Adams, K., &amp; Goldwaithe, J. (2000). Direct control of a computer from the human central nervous system. [Article]. IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering, 8(2), 198-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with other motor diseases, such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and [[cerebral palsy]], as well as those who have suffered a severe stroke or spinal cord injury, also can benefit from implanted electrodes. Cortical signals can be used to control robotic limbs, so as the technology improves and the risks of the procedure are reduced, direct interfacing may even provide assistance for amputees.&lt;ref name="BMIs"&gt;Lebedev, M. A., &amp; Nicolelis, M. A. L. (2006). Brain-machine interfaces: past, present and future. [Review]. Trends in Neurosciences, 29(9), 536-546.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design development===
When Dr. Kennedy was designing the electrode, he knew he needed a device that would be wireless, biologically compatible, and capable of chronic implantation. Initial studies with Rhesus monkeys and rats demonstrated that the neurotrophic electrode was capable of chronic implantation for as long as 14 months (human trials would later establish even greater robustness).&lt;ref name="ultrastructural"&gt;Kennedy, P. R., Mirra, S. S., &amp; Bakay, R. A. E. (1992). THE CONE ELECTRODE - ULTRASTRUCTURAL STUDIES FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RECORDING IN RAT AND MONKEY CORTEX. [Article]. Neuroscience Letters, 142(1), 89-94.&lt;/ref&gt; This longevity was invaluable for the studies because while the monkeys were being trained at a task, neurons that were initially silent began firing as the task was learned, a phenomenon that would not have been observable if the electrode was not capable of long term implantation.&lt;ref name=activity/&gt;

==Components==

===Glass cone===
The glass cone is only 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm long, and is filled with [[Growth factor|trophic factors]] in order to encourage axons and dendrites to grow through its tip and hollow body. When the [[neurites]] reach the back end of the cone, they rejoin with the [[neuropil]] on that side, which anchors the glass cone in place. As a result, stable and robust long-term recording is attainable.&lt;ref name="cone"&gt;Kennedy, P. R. (1989). THE CONE ELECTRODE - A LONG-TERM ELECTRODE THAT RECORDS FROM NEURITES GROWN ONTO ITS RECORDING SURFACE. [Article]. Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 29(3), 181-193.&lt;/ref&gt; The cone sits with its tip near layer five of the cortex, among [[corticospinal tract]] cell bodies, and is inserted at an angle of 45° from the surface, about 5 or 6&amp;nbsp;mm deep.&lt;ref name="assembly"&gt;Bartels, J., Andreasen, D., Ehirim, P., Mao, H., Seibert, S., Wright, E. J., et al. (2008). Neurotrophic electrode: Method of assembly and implantation into human motor speech cortex. [Article]. Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 174(2), 168-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold wires===
Three or four gold wires are glued to the inside of the glass cone and protrude out the back. They record the electrical activity of the axons that have grown through the cone, and are insulated with [[Teflon]]. The wires are coiled so as to relieve strain because they are embedded in the cortex on one end and attached to the amplifiers, which are fixed to the inside of the skull, on the other. Two wires are plugged into each amplifier to provide [[Differential signaling|differential signalling]].&lt;ref name=assembly/&gt;

===Wireless transmitter===

One of the greatest strengths of the neurotrophic electrode is its wireless capability, because without transdermal wiring, the risk of infection is significantly reduced. As neural signals are collected by the electrodes, they travel up the gold wires and through the cranium, where they are passed on to the [[bioamplifier]]s (usually implemented by [[differential amplifier]]s). The amplified signals are sent through a switch to a [[transmitter]], where they are converted to FM signals and broadcast with an antenna. The amplifiers and the transmitters are powered by a 1&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] signal that is [[Rectifier|rectified]] and filtered. The antenna, amplifiers, analog switches, and FM transmitters are all contained in a standard [[Surface-mount technology|surface mount printed circuit board]] that sits just under the scalp. The whole ensemble is coated in protective gels, [[Parylene]], Elvax, and [[Silastic]], to make it biocompatible and to protect the electronics from fluids.&lt;ref name=assembly/&gt;

===Data acquisition system===

On the outside of the patient's scalp rests the corresponding induction coil and an antenna that sends the [[frequency modulation|FM signal]] to the [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. These devices are temporarily held in place with a water-soluble paste. The receiver demodulates the signal and sends it to the computer for [[spike sorting]] and data recording.&lt;ref name=assembly/&gt;

===Assembly===
Most of the neurotrophic electrode is made by hand. The gold wires are cut to the correct length, coiled, and then bent to an angle of 45° just above the point of contact with the cone in order to limit the implantation depth. One more bend in the opposite direction is added where the wires pass through the skull. The tips are stripped of their Teflon coating, and the ones farthest from the cone are soldered and then sealed with dental acrylic to a component connector. The glass cone is made by heating and pulling a glass rod to a point and then cutting the tip at the desired length. The other end is not a straight cut, but rather is carved at an angle to provide a shelf onto which the gold wires can be attached. The wires are then placed on the shelf and a [[methyl methacrylate]] gel glue is applied in several coats, with care taken to avoid covering the conductive tips. Lastly, the device is sterilized using [[glutaraldehyde]] gas at a low temperature, and aerated.&lt;ref name=assembly/&gt;

==Implementation==

===Computer cursor control===
One of Dr. Kennedy's patients, Johnny Ray, was able to learn how to control a computer cursor with the neurotrophic electrode. Three distinct neural signals from the device were correlated with cursor movement along the x-axis,  along the y-axis, and a "select" function, respectively. Movement in a given direction was triggered by an increase in neuron firing rate on the associated channel.&lt;ref name=cursor/&gt;

===Speech synthesis===

Neural signals elicited from another of Dr. Kennedy's patients have been used to formulate vowel sounds using a speech synthesizer in real time. The electronics setup was very similar to that used for the cursor, with the addition of a post-receiver neural decoder and the synthesizer itself. Researchers implanted the electrode in the area of the motor cortex associated with the movement of speech articulators because a pre-surgery [[fMRI]] scan indicated high activity there during a picture naming task. The average delay from neural firing to synthesizer output was 50 ms, which is approximately the same as the delay for an intact biological pathway.&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;Guenther, F. H., Brumberg, J. S., Wright, E. J., Nieto-Castanon, A., Tourville, J. A., Panko, M., et al. (2009). A Wireless Brain-Machine Interface for Real-Time Speech Synthesis. PLoS ONE, 4(12).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other recording methods==

The neurotrophic electrode, as described above, is a wireless device, and transmits its signals transcutaneously. In addition, it has demonstrated longevity of over four years in a human patient, because every component is completely [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]]. It is limited in the amount of information it can provide, however, because the electronics it uses to transmit its signal require so much space on the scalp that only four can fit on a human skull.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

Alternatively, the [[Utah array]] is currently a wired device, but transmits more information. It has been implanted in a human for over two years and consists of 100 conductive silicon needle-like electrodes, so it has high resolution and can record from many individual neurons.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Brumberg, J. S., Nieto-Castanon, A., Kennedy, P. R., &amp; Guenther, F. H. (2010). Brain-computer interfaces for speech communication. Speech Communication, 52(4), 367-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one experiment, Dr. Kennedy adapted the neurotrophic electrode to read [[local field potentials]] (LFPs). He demonstrated that they are capable of controlling assistive technology devices, suggesting that less invasive techniques can be used to restore functionality to locked-in patients. However, the study did not address the degree of control possible with LFPs or make a formal comparison between LFPs and single unit activity.&lt;ref name="LFP"&gt;Kennedy, P. R., Kirby, M. T., Moore, M. M., King, B., &amp; Mallory, A. (2004). Computer control using human intracortical local field potentials. [Article]. IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 12(3), 339-344.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) involves the placement of many surface electrodes on the patient's scalp, in an attempt to record the summed activity of tens of thousands to millions of neurons. EEG has the potential for long term use as a [[brain-computer interface]], because the electrodes can be kept on the scalp indefinitely. The temporal and spatial resolutions and signal to noise ratios of EEG have always lagged behind those of comparable intracortical devices, but it has the advantage of not requiring surgery.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

[[Electrocorticography]] (ECoG) records the cumulative activity of hundreds to thousands of neurons with a sheet of electrodes placed directly on the surface of the brain. In addition to requiring surgery and having low resolution, the ECoG device is wired, meaning the scalp cannot be completely closed, increasing the risk of infection. However, researchers investigating ECoG claim that the grid "possesses characteristics suitable for long term implantation".&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

==Drawbacks==

===Activation delay===
The neurotrophic electrode is not active immediately after implantation because the axons must grow into the cone before the device can pick up electrical signals. Studies have shown that tissue growth is largely complete as early as one month after the procedure, but takes as many as four months to stabilize.&lt;ref name=activity/&gt;

===Surgery risks===
The risks involved with the implantation are those that are usually associated with brain surgery, namely, the possibility of bleeding, infection, seizures, stroke, and brain damage. Until the technology advances to the point that these risks are considerably reduced, the procedure will be reserved for extreme or experimental cases.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

===Device failure===
When Johnny Ray was implanted in 1998, one of the neurotrophic electrodes started providing an intermittent signal after it had  become anchored in the neuropil, and as a result, Dr. Kennedy was forced to rely on the remaining devices.&lt;ref name=cursor/&gt; Therefore, even if there is no complication from surgery, there is still a possibility that the electronics will fail. In addition, while the implants themselves are encased in the skull and are therefore relatively safe from physical damage, the electronics on the outside of the skull are vulnerable. Two of Dr. Kennedy's patients accidentally caused damage during spasms, but in both cases only the external devices needed to be replaced.&lt;ref name=assembly/&gt;

==Future applications==

===Neuroprosthetics===
As of November 2010, Dr. Kennedy is working on the speech synthesis application of the electrode, but has plans to expand its uses to many different areas, one of which is restoring movement with [[neuroprosthetics]].&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

===Silent speech===
Silent speech is "speech processing in the absence of an intelligible acoustic signal" to be used either as an aid for the speech-handicapped or to communicate in areas with required silence or high background noise. One of the proposed future uses of the neurotrophic electrode, and brain computer interfaces in general, is to enable silent speech by decoding the "speaker's" neural signals and transmitting the audio output to headphones worn by the intended listener. The standard advantages and disadvantages of invasive versus non-invasive interfaces still apply.&lt;ref name="silent"&gt;Denby, B., Schultz, T., Honda, K., Hueber, T., Gilbert, J. M., &amp; Brumberg, J. S. (2010). Silent speech interfaces. [Article]. Speech Communication, 52(4), 270-287.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for this particular application, the neurotrophic electrode has an advantage in that it has already been shown to be effective for restoring communication to disabled patients.&lt;ref name=speech/&gt;

The '''Ogdru Jahad''' are fictional characters in [[Mike Mignola]]'s ''[[Hellboy]]'' comic and serve as the main villain of the franchise as well as being Hellboy's archenemy. They are the Dragon of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], and are destined to bring about the end of the world. Though the Ogdru Jahad are the ultimate [[antagonist]]s in the series, they are not themselves active, their release from imprisonment instead being the object of many other villains' plans.   They were imprisoned in their Golden Cocoons by the [[Hellboy#Right Hand of Doom|Right Hand of Doom]] shortly after the creation of Earth, but not before they spawned 369 children, known as the [[Ogdru Hem]].

==Fictional character biography==
Mostly inspired by the Great Old Ones of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]] (with some ancient Egyptian and Babylonian influences as well) the Ogdru Jahad are serpentine/crustacean entities which once resided on, and presided over, Earth. They are pitiless, chaotic, bent on destruction and subjugation and often so horrific in appearance that the mere sight of one of them sometimes induced madness.
They are listed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Hellboy: Seed of Destruction''. {{ISBN|1-59307-094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Adad]]-Jahad''
*''Namrat-Jahad''
*''Irra-Jahad''
*''[[Nu (mythology)|Nunn]]-Jahad''
*''Beuu-Jahad''&lt;!-- this is the correct reading not Beuu --&gt;
*''[[Nergal]]-Jahad''

===Origins===
In the beginning of time, [[God]] created an order of spirits. Of these, many of the greater spirits were sent to newborn [[Earth]] to oversee it as Watchers. After a time, one Watcher named Anum "...dared to take fire from the air, and with it, fashioned out of mud the [[Serpent (Bible)#ancient serpent|dragon]] (...)". The Ogdru Jahad is thus made up of the four classical elements. The other Watchers set their seals on the Ogdru Jahad and yet the entities did not come to life until nightfall. By then, the awakened Ogdru Jahad are instilled with purpose and function as they instantly give birth to the [[Ogdru Hem]] who become Earth's first lifeforms.

The Watchers, upon seeing the creation of these abominations, went to war with them. The Ogdru Hem were eventually all disposed of, with many of them barely clinging to existence in some fashion, with the Ogdru Jahad sealed by their creator in a prison of crystal and placed in the heart of the abyss. The other Watchers, however, turn on Anum and destroyed him. After that, God looked down in fury on what had happened, and exacted his retribution on the Watchers for botching their task: some were cast down into the pit, while others were stranded on Earth to breed monsters. Eventually, lesser spirits were given form by God and took up residence on Earth as the first men, the Golden People of [[Hyperboria]].

As it turned out, Anum's right hand survived and was found by the Hyperboreans as it became a holy relic and was attached to a great statue at the behest of their king Thoth. Holding three Watchers captive in a secret garden, Thoth learned the inner workings of the universe and only shared a small fraction of his knowledge to the people. 10,000 years later, Hyperboria's downfall began when Hecate used Thoth to find the Watchers, drain them of their blood, and reveal all their secrets to the people. Though Thoth cursed Hecate in her serpentine form, her actions led to Hyperboria's corruption as they begin to worship the Black Goddess, one of many epithets that Hecate came to be called, and commit atrocities in her name. These actions led to the statue coming to life and slaughtering the many Hyperboreans before finally hurling itself over a cliff. The [[Ice Age]] then enables the raise of humanity, the second race, while the Hyperboreans were divided into two groups. While one branch who gave their successors knowledge before departing, those among the Hyperboreans who continue to worship Hecate took refuge underground and became extinct at the hands of their corrupted slaves in their attempt to reclaim their former glory. Anum's hand eventually was recovered and ended up in Hell. As the hand is the key to freeing the Ogdru Jahad from their prison, which would usher in a new and final race of men, it came to be known as "''the [[Right Hand of Doom]]''".

===Hellboy===
When [[Hellboy]] was born, the Right Hand of Doom was grafted onto the newborn's arm by Azzael before being sent away from Hell and summoned to Earth years later by [[Grigori_Rasputin_(Hellboy)|Rasputin]]. Hellboy is aware that he must keep the hand, as it would be more dangerous to try to rid himself of it. Attempts have already been made to separate Hellboy from his arm, both to protect the world and to hasten its destruction. Hellboy believes he is the best protection the arm can have.

While certain events have made it clear that the Right Hand of Doom is the Key to releasing the Ogdru Jahad, the actions of Herman von Klempt and the frog monsters suggest that there are other conditions that need to be met. The summonings of the Conqueror Worm and Katha-Hem were meant to lead to the Ogdru Jahad's freedom, yet Hellboy's right hand had no role in these schemes and were thus considered doomed to failure. Even Nimue being possessed by the Ogdru Jahad to serve as their vessel and conduit to prematurely enter the world also ended in failure yet began the series of events that would conclude with the end of humanity.

By the end of B.P.R.D, Hell on Earth, the Ogdru Jahad are on the verge of victory, with one of them landing on Earth.

==Motivations==
From the varied attempts of the comic's villains to free the Ogdru Jahad, it is readily apparent that the release of the Ogdru Jahad is closely tied to the fall of mankind. Whether the fall of man causes the release or quickly follows it is not known with any certainty. All the characters attempting to liberate it agree that the Ogdru Jahad will do something akin to "burning the earth to a cinder" so it is possible they are all referring to some common vision of the dragon's release but are guessing at how the prophecy is fulfilled.

Immortal and vastly powerful beyond description, sometimes referred to as a single entity, the Ogdru Jahad's motivations may be impossible to represent in human terms. As such, the human and quasi-human inhabitants of the Hellboy universe have expressed a variety of opinions on what the Ogdru Jahad desire beyond freedom, which it desires above all other things.&lt;ref name="Hellboy: Seed of Evil"&gt;Hellboy: Seed of Evil&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the basic premise of seeking freedom and then burning the earth, there is much dissent as to precisely what the Ogdru Jahad desire. The aliens that watch the cosmic prison of the Ogdru Jahad apparently perceive Earth as a focal point necessary to maintaining the prison. If the Ogdru Jahad are released, they will destroy Earth and then the entire Universe.&lt;ref name="Hellboy: Seed of Evil"/&gt; [[Herman von Klempt]] believes that once man has been destroyed, the three hundred and sixty-nine Ogdru Hem will rise up from their prisons, free the Ogdru Jahad and burn the Earth to ashes.&lt;ref name="Hellboy: Conqueror Worm"&gt;Hellboy: Conqueror Worm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Bog Roosh was plagued with dreams in which Hellboy's hand is taken and used to free the Ogdru Jahad, who then burn the earth to cinders.&lt;ref&gt;Hellboy: The Third Wish&lt;/ref&gt; Rasputin, on the other hand, seems convinced that the desire of the Ogdru Jahad is to create a new, perfect world out of the ashes of the old one, where the final race of man will live.&lt;ref name="Hellboy: Conqueror Worm"/&gt; He tells Inger von Klempt that her grandfather was unable to see beyond the destruction of the human race, and that a new Eden does indeed await the final race of man. Hecate also strongly implies that there will be a "''new world to come''" during a conversation with Rasputin in the Conqueror Worm epilogue, but mentions that she cannot see that far ahead, and that death could await them just as easily. In ''The Third Wish'', the Daoine Sidhe explicitly state that it is prophesied that a new world shall rise from the old due to the Right Hand of Doom.

===Mortal agents===
After being imprisoned in the void, the Ogdru Jahad turned their considerable forces toward finding a way to escape their confinement and exact their revenge on the world. Since they are trapped in deep space, their contact with humanity is sparse at best. However, since the Ogdru Jahad are supremely powerful psychic entities, they have been able to establish contact with mortals on Earth in order to coerce them into doing their bidding.

====Herman von Klempt====
In [[Austria]] in 1939, the Nazis attempted to open relations with space-borne monsters by sending them the corpse of one of their greatest scientists, Dr. Ernst Oeming, in the hopes that the creatures would use it as a vessel and return to Earth. On March 20, 1939, even though the mission, which took place at Hunte Castle, was interrupted by the arrival of [[Lobster Johnson]] and a detachment of American soldiers, the launch went ahead as planned. The castle, however, was left in ruins, and all parties were killed except for [[Herman von Klempt]]. The creatures received the spacecraft, and responded by placing one of their own inside Oeming's lifeless body.

After the events of ''Wake the Devil,'' Herman von Klempt is provided with the truth about the Oeming mission and the details of the return of the capsule. The invisible space monsters showed von Klempt the destruction that would result from releasing the worm they had planted within Oeming's body. Once the world had been overtaken by the worm, the Ogdru Hem would be released from their [[prison]]s, and they would, in turn, release the Ogdru Jahad, who will reduce the world to ashes.  Despairing over the failures of his best laid plans, and inspired by Rasputin posing as the angel of death, von Klempt returned to Hunte Castle and set to work.

Von Klempt succeeded in bringing Oeming's capsule back to Earth, and from it rose a massive juggernaut known as the Conqueror Worm.  Spewing forth a noxious gas, the worm turned von Klempt's human agents into frog monsters, then devoured them immediately to feed its insatiable hunger.  Only quick intervention by Hellboy and Roger the Homunculus, aided by the ghost of Lobster Johnson and a mysterious alien, managed to halt the worm's feasting march.  Herman von Klempt watched in dismay as his plans were foiled, only to be grabbed by Roger and heaved off a cliff to his final death.

====Rasputin====
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Ragnarok 1.gif|thumb|left|180px|The Ragnarok Project]] --&gt;
After being poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, castrated, and hurled into the icy waters of the [[Neva]], Rasputin was contacted by the Ogdru Jahad. They sent him visions explaining their nature and what they wanted from him, namely, to release them from their prison, help bring about the end of the world, and make way for a new world. Uncertain of how to proceed, Rasputin waited to be contacted again.

Eventually, after years of silence and waiting, Rasputin was approached by [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of [[Hitler]]'s [[SS]]. Recognizing this as an opportunity to acquire the resources needed to establish a stronger connection to the Ogdru Jahad, Rasputin joined forces with the Nazis and soon assembled a team of Nazi occultists, consisting primarily of Ilsa Haupstein, Leopold Kurtz, and Prof. Doktor Karl Ruprecht [[Kroenen]]. This team was known as [[Project Ragna Rok]]. On December 23, 1944, Rasputin and his colleagues opened a doorway into the void, and Hellboy was brought forth, albeit unbeknownst to the Nazis (but not to Rasputin). After this apparent failure, the Allies won World War II and Rasputin and his allies scattered. Rasputin himself traveled to a hidden temple in the distant Arctic dedicated to the Ogdru Jahad. Inside, he sat at the foot of a statue of Sadu Hem for almost fifty years until he was disturbed by Professor Bruttenholm, providing a catalyst for his, and Sadu Hem's, sudden re-awakenings. Ilsa, [[Kroenen]] and Kurtz relocated to the frigid north of [[Norway]] and cryogenically froze themselves until Rasputin's return, though they did not revive themselves until after Rasputin's failure at Cavendish Hall.
In the film, Rasputin was sucked into the portal and was seemingly destroyed, not to be seen again for 60 years. Only 2 members of the Nazis occultist team, Ilsa Haupstein and Kroenen survived.&lt;ref&gt;(hellboy, Film, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Wake the Devil,'' while trying to strike back at Hellboy by using Ilsa's connection to a [[Romania]]n [[vampire]], Rasputin brings Hellboy into the clutches of the Hecate. Hecate threatens Hellboy with his destiny, and in the end Hellboy prevails. Retreating to the abode of his grandmother, [[Baba Yaga]], Rasputin tries to come to terms with the fact that the Ogdru Jahad manipulated him. He realizes that the Ogdru Jahad were behind his latest venture, though he alone is responsible for the failure. He also must deal with the fact that rather than saving Ilsa, he instead sacrificed her to Hecate, who would use Ilsa's corpse (and the [[Iron maiden (torture device)|Iron Maiden]] which contained it) as her new body.

Moreover, Hecate tells Rasputin that he had no hope in trying to awake the Dragon in the events of ''Seed of Destruction'' - the only power that can free the Ogdru Jahad is Hellboy's right hand, and Rasputin is nothing more than a tool with which to manipulate and maneuver Hellboy. Upon hearing this, Rasputin loses control and attacks Hecate, who virtually destroys him, leaving nothing more than a tiny shard of his [[soul]] for the Baba Yaga to preserve in an [[acorn]] shell.

====Nimue====
A former love of [[Merlin]] before she used his knowledge to imprison him in his grave, Nimue lost her mind and became a devout worshipper of the Ogdru Jahad before the other witches killed her and eventually placed her severed body parts in a box that is buried within the earth. However, during the power vacuum caused by Hecate being removed from power, Gruagach had the witches allow him to revive Nimue to be their new leader. But Nimue exacts her revenge on the witches who imprisoned her and abandoned Grugach as she prepares to wage war on the world. However, Nimue would later learn that she became a vessel for the Ogdru Jahad in their attempt to prematurely enter the world through her. Hellboy manages to kill Nimue to thwart the Orgdu Jahad, only to be killed by the witch as she is being dragged into Hell.

===The role of the "Frog monsters"===
As the Ogdru Jahad advance their plans on Earth, it becomes evident that they intend to transform humanity into a new "final" race of man. The attempts are seen in the frog monsters that were first seen in ''Seed of Destruction'' and then again in ''Conqueror Worm'' and ''[[B.P.R.D.: A Plague of Frogs]],'' creatures strong enough to overpower Hellboy and can assume human form. Moreover, the frogmen can exert a degree of telepathic influence over their victims, confusing them with illusions and mind-tricks. These creatures also possess souls, that create a corrupting influence on living beings. If they pass on, a creature seems to devour their ectasic spirits. Whether this being is the Ogdru Jahad or something else entirely is uncertain.

The frogmen are linked to the Ogdru Jahad, and are being employed to free the Ogdru Hem who were imprisoned by the Watchers at the beginning of time. Once the Ogdru Hem are free, the Ogdru Jahad will follow. Currently, due to the events in ''A Plague of Frogs,'' numerous frogmen have escaped the clutches of the B.P.R.D. and are moving across the North American countryside. These nests seem constructed around the purpose of praying to the Ogdru Hem and, in certain locations, obtain relics and items which spawn vicious and lethal Ogdru-Hem-like creatures. Moreover, the frogs have transcended their human limitations and have developed the ability to convert their bodies to biological factories, producing thousands of tadpoles which become frog monsters.

After the events of ''[[B.P.R.D.: The Black Flame]]'', it appeared that the frog monsters have been dealt a major setback but, as seen in ''[[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense#Collected Editions|B.P.R.D.: The Warning]]'' and ''B.P.R.D.: The Black Goddess'', the creatures regrouped and allied themselves with the subterraineans from ''[[B.P.R.D.: The Hollow Earth]]''. In ''[[B.P.R.D.: King of Fear]]'', it is revealed that the frog monsters were flawed attempts to create the next race of men with [[Abe Sapien]] also learning that he is actually a perfected version of the creatures.

==In other media==

===Film===
In the 2004 film ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'', the Ogdru Jahad were mentioned by name only twice by [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]]. They were portrayed as indistinct, octopus-like creatures encased in crystal shells. They are referred to by him as the seven gods of chaos who will destroy the world and from its ashes "a new Eden will arise". At the conclusion of the film, their prisons were shattered and the Ogdru Jahad began their assault on Earth. Before the final lock could be released by Hellboy, he regained his senses and the Ogdru Jahad disappeared.

[[Sammael (Hellboy)|Sammael]], a demon in the film, was referred to as the "son of [[Nergal]]"; hinting the monster to be one of the [[Ogdru Hem]] through Nergal-Jahad. The giant Behemoth, the "god" Rasputin answers to and appears at the end of the film resembles the Ogdru Hem known as Sadu-Hem.

===Animated===
In ''[[Hellboy: Sword of Storms]]'', the Ogdru Jahad (or possibly Ogdru Hem) made a cameo as the brothers of Thunder and Lightning. Though not mentioned by name, they were referred to as the "Dragons".

'''Richard Armstrong''' (April 13, 1805 – September 23, 1860) was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] missionary from [[Pennsylvania]] who arrived in Hawaii in 1832. Along with his wife Clarissa, he served in mission fields of the [[Marquesas Islands]] and in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. He established several churches and schools, and was Kahu (shepherd) of [[Kawaiahaʻo Church]] after the departure of [[Hiram Bingham I]]. [[Kamehameha III]] appointed him Minister of Public Instruction, and his accomplishments established an educational system that earned him the nickname "The father of American education in Hawaii".

== Background ==
Richard Armstrong was born in [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]],  [[Pennsylvania]]  on April 13, 1805, to James Armstrong and his American-born wife Eleanor Pollock.  The elder Armstrong had been born in [[Enniskillen]],  [[County Fermanagh]],  [[Northern Ireland]], and in 1786 emigrated to the United States, where he married Eleanor.  The family were [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]. Richard was the youngest child of the union. He was educated at [[Milton Academy]] in [[Massachusetts]], furthering his education at [[Dickinson College]] in Pennsylvania, and graduating from [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Eng (1999) pp.1,2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuku Hiva and Hawaii ==
Princeton president [[Archibald Alexander]] provided a letter of recommendation In 1831, when Armstrong made the decision to join the next contingent of missionaries being sent to Hawaii by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]].  He received his ordination on October 27, and Armstrong and his new bride [[Clarissa Chapman Armstrong|Clarissa Chapman]] departed with the other missionaries aboard the ''Averick'' on November 26. The ship docked in [[Honolulu]] on May 17, 1832, with Clarissa seven months pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Eng (1999) pp.2,3,4&lt;/ref&gt; Daughter and first child Caroline Porter was born in Honolulu on July 17.

The board sent the Armstrongs to minister to cannibalistic tribes on [[Nuku Hiva]] in the [[Marquesas Islands]]  July 2, 1833 through May 12, 1834,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawaiian Mission Children's Society|1901|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving alongside missionary couples the Rev. [[William Patterson Alexander]] and his wife Mary,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawaiian Mission Children's Society|1901|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Rev. [[Benjamin Wyman Parker]] and his wife Mary Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawaiian Mission Children's Society|1901|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  first Armstrong son William Nevins was born on Nuku Hiva on January 2, 1834. The Nuku Hiva mission field was abandoned as futile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1887|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armstrongs were reassigned to the [[Island of Maui]], where the infant William Nevins died March 17, 1835 in [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]]. Their second son had been born two days before on March 15, and he was given the name of his brother William Nevins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1887|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July of that year, the Armstrongs were assigned to [[Wailuku, Hawaii|Wailuku]]. Three more children were born during this assignment. Mary Jane was born June 2, 1836 in Honolulu. Two sons were born in Wailuku, Richard Baxter on August 15, 1837, and Samuel Chapman on January 30, 1839. During his assignment on Maui, Armstrong established churches at [[Waihee, Hawaii|Waihee]], Wailuku, [[Ulupalakua]], and at [[Haiku, Hawaii|Haiku]], where he also became an 1858 founder of [[Haiku Mill|Haiku Sugar Company]] on land he owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1887|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Robert M.

In 1840, Armstrong was appointed Kahu (shepherd) of [[Kawaiahaʻo Church]] to replace [[Hiram Bingham I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ohles|1978|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 26, 1854, he was licensed to perform marriages in Hawaii. Armstrong officiated at the June 19, 1856 wedding of [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Emma Rooke]] and [[Alexander Liholiho]] in Kawaiahaʻo Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marriage of His Majesty Kamehameha IV|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1856-07-02/ed-1/seq-2/|accessdate=December 17, 2016|via=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

=== The father of American education in Hawaii ===
Under  [[Kamehameha III]], the position of Minister of Public Instruction of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was created. On April 3, 1846, [[William Richards (Hawaii)|William Richards]] was appointed to fill the new position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH8366/47733f3b.dir/Richards,%20William.jpg | title=William Richards | publisher=State of Hawaii | work=State Archives | accessdate=May 7, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306203618/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH8366/47733f3b.dir/Richards,%20William.jpg | archivedate=March 6, 2012 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Richards died in 1847, Armstrong was appointed to fill the position.&lt;ref name="Privy" /&gt; Armstrong held the position until 1855, when he became President of the Board of Education. The educational model he established in the kingdom earned Armstrong the sobriquet "The father of American education in Hawaii". He created a structured environment that was financially supported by a school tax. With Armstrong at the helm, curriculum was standardized, and the responsibilities of faith-based citizenship became a part of it. The kingdom's teachers were given extended training. Land grants were implemented for additional and improved facilities, and the kingdom began issuing its own textbooks. The public school system accommodated the majority of the students, but Armstrong also chartered private educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Rev. R. Armstrong D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">'''Robert Balfour, 5th Lord Balfour of Burleigh''' (buried 20 March 1757) was a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] from the [[Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Burleigh family]] of the [[Kinross-shire|county of Kinross]], remembered chiefly for a [[crime of passion]] that brought devastation to his family.

==Biography==
Balfour, when a youth fell in love with a woman far inferior in rank, much to the annoyance of the family. He was sent to travel abroad in the hope that he would forget his attachment. Before he set out he declared to his lady-love that if in his absence she married he would kill her husband. Notwithstanding the threat, she did marry a Henry Stenhouse, schoolmaster at [[Inverkeithing]], acquainting him beforehand of the hazard.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite web | last =Grosart  | first =A. B. | title =Balfour, Robert (d 1757), Jacobite | work = [[Dictionary of National Biography]] Vol. IV | publisher =Smith, Elder &amp; Co.  | year = 1885 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/1196 | doi = | accessdate = 2007-11-16}} {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Balfour, Robert (d.1757)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Balfour's return his first inquiry was after the girl. On being informed of her marriage, he proceeded on horseback with two attendants directly to the school at Inverkeithing, called Stenhouse out, deliberately shot him, wounding him in the shoulder, and quietly returned to [[Burleigh, Perth and Kinross|Burleigh]]. This was on 9 April 1707.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

The schoolmaster lingered twelve days, and then died. Balfour was tried for the murder in the [[High Court of Justiciary]] on 4 August 1709.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; The defence was ingenious, but inadequate; Balfour argued there had been no intent to kill, that the wound was merely to the arm and hence plainly designed to frighten or correct, and that the deceased had lived for several days after the being shot before dying of a 'fretful temper'.&lt;ref name="scotland"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=William|title=The Scottish Nation, Volume 1|year=1867|publisher=A. Fullerton &amp; Co|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=210|url=https://archive.org/details/scottishnationo06andegoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balfour was found guilty, and sentenced to be [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 6 January 1709-10. But a few days prior to this he escaped from the [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh|Edinburgh Tolbooth]] by exchanging clothes with his sister, who resembled him. He skulked for some time in the neighbourhood of Burleigh, and is reputed to have concealed himself in a hollowed ash-tree&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt; afterwards named "Burleigh's Hole".&lt;ref name="scotland"/&gt;

On the death of his father, in 1713, the title devolved on him. His next appearance was at the meeting of Jacobites at [[Lochmaben]], 29 May 1714, when [[James Francis Edward Stuart|the Pretender's]] health was drunk, Lord Burleigh denouncing damnation against all who would not drink it. He engaged in the [[rebellion of 1715]]. For this he was in the same year [[Attainder|attainted]] by [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]], and his estates, worth ₤697 per annum,&lt;ref name="scotland"/&gt; were forfeited to the crown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4894">'''Stroke Heroes Act FAST''' is a [[public health]] campaign produced by the Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention and Control Program at the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Health]]. Begun in 2006, it is dedicated to increasing stroke recognition and shortening the time between the onset of [[Stroke#Signs and symptoms|stroke symptoms]] and arrival at a hospital’s [[emergency department]].

"Time lost is brain lost" is a phrase often used in stroke prevention programs. Because quick treatment can help avoid death or permanent [[physical disability]], the FAST campaign stresses the need for immediate action by calling 9-1-1.

FAST teaches the signs and symptoms of stroke through its [[acronym]], which stands for: Face, Arm, Speech, and Time. The highlight of the campaign is an award-winning, 3-minute animated [[video]] produced by Geovision. Accompanying the video are [[poster]]s, [[brochure]]s, wallet-sized cards, and [[Powerpoint]]s. All of the items are available in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (with [[Khmer language|Khmer]] on the way).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.MAClearinghouse.com/CatalogPageHDSP.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The PowerPoints are part of an education kit that is meant as a train-the-trainer module, and is also available in the three languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= |pmc=2396980 |title=Addressing Stroke Signs and Symptoms Through Public Education: The Stroke Heroes Act FAST Campaign |publisher=|date= April 2008|pmid=18341784 |volume=5 |issue=2 |journal=Prev Chronic Dis |pages=A49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paid media campaign has accompanied the distribution of materials, and has included [[television]], [[radio]], [[print media]], and [[transit card]]s on [[public transport]]ation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eohhs2terminal&amp;L=5&amp;L0=Home&amp;L1=Consumer&amp;L2=Prevention+and+Wellness&amp;L3=Disease+Prevention&amp;L4=Heart+Disease+and+Stroke+Prevention&amp;sid=Eeohhs2&amp;b=terminalcontent&amp;f=dph_com_health_heart_stroke_c_stroke_signs_symptoms&amp;csid=Eeohhs2 |title=Stroke Signs and Symptoms/Stroke Heroes Act FAST |publisher=Mass.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, FAST materials have been used in 48 states and 28 countries, including [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and the [[Dominican Republic]].

==Evaluation of Campaign==
The Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention and Control Program has evaluated each of the [[media campaign]]s to demonstrate knowledge and [[awareness]] change concerning stroke signs and symptoms. Prior to running the initial media campaign in a specific language and after each subsequent campaign, a [[Statistical survey|survey]] was administered to a random sample of [[Massachusetts]] adults. The validated survey questionnaire addresses stroke signs and symptoms knowledge, impetus to call 9-1-1 at any sign of a stroke, awareness of stroke advertising, as well as familiarity with the campaign and its [[terminology]]. These data have shown a significant increase in awareness and knowledge over time, confirming the effectiveness of the campaigns in Massachusetts.

==Awards==
The campaign video won the Silver Award for production at the 27th annual Telly Awards, which recognizes the "finest video and film productions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geovisiononline.com/aboutus/news |title=News &amp;#124; Geovision |publisher=Geovisiononline.com |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, two [[Gabriel Award]]s were given for "Community Awareness/PSA" for the Spanish-language version of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.catholicweb.com/GabrielAwards/index.cfm/NewsItem?id=239564 |title=Gabriel Awards at 1645 Brook Lynn Dr., Suite 2, Dayton, OH 45432-1944 US - And the winners are |publisher=Home.catholicweb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been honoured with the 2009 Media Partnership Award from the Partnership for a Heart-Healthy Stroke-Free Massachusetts (PHHSFM) organization for the campaign's [[leadership]] in using the video to increase awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke.

'''''The Countess''''' is a 2009 [[Cinema of France|French]]-[[Cinema of Germany|German]] [[drama film|drama]] [[historical film]] written and directed by [[Julie Delpy]], who also composed its score. It stars Delpy, [[Daniel Brühl]] and [[William Hurt]]. It is based on the life of the notorious Hungarian countess [[Elizabeth Báthory]].

The film is the third directorial effort by Delpy, who has said of the project that "it sounds like a gothic [story] but it's more a drama. It's more focusing on the psychology of human beings when they're given power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Interview with Julie Delpy |first = Rebecca |last = Murray |url = http://movies.about.com/od/beforesunset/a/sunsetjd062804_2.htm |work = [[About.com]]  |date = June 28, 2004 |accessdate = November 30, 2009 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5lfHBOa9a |archivedate = November 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1560, Erzsébet Báthory is born into the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] noble [[Báthory family]], the daughter of general George Báthory of Ecsed. From an early age, Erzsébet's parents raise her to accept hardness and cruelty. As a [[teenager]], Erzsébet is [[impregnated]] by a young peasant lover and is forced to watch as he is brutally [[torture]]d and executed before her eyes; Erzsébet's mother takes the child away from her directly after its birth, ensuring that she never sees him again. Erzsébet is later married to Count [[Ferenc Nádasdy]], with whom she has three children. After Nádasdy's return from the [[Ottoman-Hungarian Wars]], he succumbs to a disease he contracted abroad and dies.

Erzsébet, now the sole heir of her husband's vast estate, seeks recognition from the Hungarian [[Habsburg]] King [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias II]]. Matthias consents reluctantly due to his considerable debt to the Countess. At a ball, she meets Count [[György Thurzó]]'s 21-year-old son, István, and falls in love with him. After a night together, István is forced by his father to end the relationship and marry the daughter of a wealthy merchant in [[Denmark]]. Erzsébet, 39, believes that their age difference is to blame for the failure of the relationship. After an incident in which she is splashed with blood after striking a female servant, Erzsébet starts to believe that bathing in the blood of virgin girls can help her to reach eternal youth and beauty, a belief reinforced by her sycophantic servants who insist her skin is suddenly much smoother. To this end, her staff capture and brutally kill peasant girls to obtain their blood.

It is only when Erzsébet starts to kidnap [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] girls that the authorities begin an investigation. Count Thurzó is asked to investigate the incidents and he thus sends István, now a count himself, to visit Erzsébet. István reluctantly goes to visit her, and they spend a passionate night together.  István, despite his affections for the countess, still suspects the countess and when he and one of his companions discover evidence of her crime, they arrest her. During the trial, Erzsébet is found guilty and, due to her noble origin, she is sentenced to spend the rest of her life walled into her room in [[Čachtice Castle]] in total isolation. Erzsébet's staff are also found guilty, but unlike her they are put to death. All of her estate is awarded to the Count Thurzó with the exception of Čachtice, which is given to her children.

Driven by desperation after being walled in, Erzsébet Báthory commits [[suicide]]. She is then buried without a coffin in a humble grave, with no funeral ceremony. The film casts doubt on the sentence, suggesting that much of the happenings have been manipulated by Count Thurzó.

==Critical reception==
''The Countess'' received negative reviews. Boyd van Hoeij wrote in ''[[Variety (magazine)| Variety]]'', "Though some individual moments work, Delpy's screenplay lacks psychological connective tissue. It never becomes clear why a powerful and intelligent woman was brought to her knees by a cute kid, only to turn murderous and possibly insane when deprived of her object of affection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=van Hoeij |first1=Boyd |title=The Countess |url=https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/the-countess-1200473729/ |accessdate=30 September 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)| Variety]] |date=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for the [[Associated Press]], Kirk Honeycutt wrote that fans of Delpy and arthouse films would be disappointed: "The film is beautifully and lovingly produced with cool, deeply burnished cinematography inside the palace and out. Costumes, editing and Delpy's music all consistently support the high tone taken toward this bloody tale. One appreciates ''The Countess''. But it neither terrifies nor illuminates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Honeycutt |first1=Kirk |title=Film Review: The Countess |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/film-review-countess-92878 |accessdate=30 September 2018 |agency=Associated Press |date=10 February 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tickle torture''' is the use of [[tickling]] to abuse, dominate, harass, humiliate, or interrogate an individual. While laughter is popularly thought of as a pleasure response, in tickle torture, the one being tickled may laugh despite whether or not they find the experience pleasant. In a tickling situation, laughter can indicate a panic reflex rather than a pleasure response. Tickle torture may be a consensual activity or one that is forced, depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/science/anatomy-of-a-tickle-is-serious-business-at-the-research-lab.html|publisher=New York Times|title=Anatomy of a Tickle Is Serious Business at the Research Lab|author=Carol Yoon|date=June 3, 1997|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a consensual form, tickle torture may be part of a mutually fulfilling, physically-intimate act between partners. However, forced tickle torture can cause real physical and mental distress in a victim, which is why it has been used as an interrogation method or to simply show dominance over another person.

==In history==
''Chinese tickle torture'' is an ancient form of torture practiced by the Chinese, in particular the courts of the [[Han Dynasty]]. Chinese tickle torture was a punishment for nobility since it left no marks and a victim could recover relatively easily and quickly.&lt;ref name=AZ&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE2KfBWPAt0C&amp;pg=PA183|page=183|title=A to Z of Punishment and Torture|author=Irene Thompson|isbn=978-1-84624-203-8|publisher=Book Guild Publishing|date=March 2008|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of tickle torture was used in ancient [[Rome]], where a person’s feet were dipped in a salt solution, and a [[goat]] was brought in to lick the solution off. This type of tickle torture would only start as tickling, eventually becoming extremely painful.&lt;ref name=AZ/&gt;

{{Tone|section|date=March 2009}}

[[Josef Kohout]], a man persecuted in the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], witnessed [[Nazi]] prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate, followed by various other tortures which resulted in his death. This incident is described in [[Heinz Heger]]'s book ''The Men With The Pink Triangle'': "The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the [[armpit]]s, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain."&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz. ''The Men With the Pink Triangle''. Boston: Alyson Publications, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' about European tortures describes a method of tickle torture in which a [[goat]] was compelled to lick the victim's feet because they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamey | first1 = Gavin | year = 2001 | title = Torture: European Instruments of Torture and Capital Punishment from the Middle Ages to Present | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 323 | issue = 7308| page = 346 | doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.346}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Japan]], those in positions of authority could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called shikei, which translates as ‘private punishment.’ One such torture was kusuguri-zeme: "merciless tickling."&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark.''  The Dark Side: Infamous Japanese Crimes and Criminals''. Japan: Kodansha International, 2001. Page 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Sibling Abuse]]'', Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as [[vomiting]], incontinence (losing control of bladder), and [[Unconsciousness|losing consciousness]] due to inability to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, Vernon. Sibling Abuse: Hidden Physical, Emotional, and Sexual Trauma. New York: Lexington Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a small number of documented instances of tickle torture in the ''[[New York Times]]''. They happened in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and in these instances restrained victims were tickled upon the bare soles of their feet, apparently against their will and for the pleasure of their tormentors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

There is currently no evidence that tickle torture was ever widespread or was practiced by governments. The very small amount of related documentation discovered thus far originates from [[England]] and the [[United States]].

A 1903 article described an immobilized [[Suicide|suicidal]] patient at the [[Hudson River State Hospital]] who was tied to a bed for his own safety. While he lay helpless, the patient's toes were tickled by one of the hospital attendants, Frank A. Sanders. "Sanders is said to have confessed that while intoxicated he amused himself by tickling the feet and ribs of Hayes and pulling his nose." Sanders also gave his restrained victim a black eye. Another hospital employee came upon Sanders while he was entertaining himself at his patient's expense, and the criminal was brought before a grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Treated Patient Brutally |work=New York Times |date=September 6, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1887 article entitled "England in Old Times" states "Gone, too, are the parish stocks, in which offenders against public morality formerly sat imprisoned, with their legs held fast beneath a heavy wooden [[yoke]], while sundry small but fiendish boys improved the occasion by deliberately pulling off their shoes and tickling the soles of their defenseless feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Ker |title=England in Old Times |work=New York Times |date=November 13, 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the beating of a man's bare feet was described in an article entitled "Terrible Punishments: The Russian [[Knout]] and Turkish [[Bastinado]]: How the Punishments are Inflicted". The author, while explaining the intense pain caused by whipping, writes "I have heard men cry out in agony...but I never heard such heart-rending sounds as those from the poor bastinadoed wretch before me. Such is the bastinado. And of the intensiveness of the agony which its infliction produces, one has only to think of the congeries or plexus of delicate nerves which have their terminus in the feet. Even tickling the soles of the feet has often produced death; what then must be the excruciating pain when cruel violence is done to those most sensitive members?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=L.G.C. |title=Terrible Punishments: The Russian Knout and Turkish [[Bastinado]]: How the Punishments are Inflicted |work=New York Times |date=April 14, 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses and meanings==
The term ''tickle torture'' can apply to many different situations that do not include the aforementioned acts of either sexual gratification or malicious torture.

''Tickle torture'' can be an extended act of tickling where the recipient of the tickling would view it as a long time or tickling of an intense nature. This can be due to the length of time they are tickled, the intensity of the tickling or the areas that are being tickled. This can simply be a 30-second tickle applied to the victim's bare feet, which can seem like a much longer time if the victim's feet are very ticklish. While the palm of the [[hand]] is far more sensitive to touch, other commonly ticklish areas include the [[armpits]], sides of the [[torso]], [[neck]], [[knee]], [[midriff]], [[thigh]]s, [[navel]], and the [[ribs]]. Many people consider the [[sole (foot)|sole]]s of their feet the most ticklish, due to the many nerve endings located there: this explains why tickling one's feet against their will is the most common example of "tickle torture".&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harris, Christine R.|title=The mystery of ticklish laughter|journal=American Scientist|year=1999|accessdate=2008-11-09|volume=87|page=344|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/1999/4/the-mystery-of-ticklish-laughter|doi=10.1511/1999.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tickle torture" may also have other uses, including the act of tickling a person as a practical joke, or even an interrogation method. This may not be extreme tickling, but could include prolonged tickling upon a sensitive area until the victim has released the required information. In the former case, it could be used as a way of "pranking" a person, as the act of being tickled can produce many sounds and sensations that could be viewed as being embarrassing to the victim. In this way, the tickling can continue to the point where a certain reaction is revealed.

This method of "pranking" could also incorporate the use of physical restraint or restraint using materials. This would be done to leave a desired area of the body bare and vulnerable to the tickling, in a way that the victim would not be able to remove this area from the tickling, and would have to simply endure. This can also be seen as "punishment" or "payback" as the tickler could be using the tickling as retribution from a previous tickling experience or "prank".

{{Main|Tickling fetishism}}
In [[sexual fetishism]], tickle torture is an activity between consenting partners. A torture session usually begins with one partner allowing the other to tie them up in a position that exposes bare parts of the body, particularly those that are sensitive to tickling. Though many parts of the human body are deemed ticklish, tickle torture is commonly associated with the tickling of the bare feet or armpits.

The bondage methods of the tickling usually follows the same basic methods. The object of the bondage is to render the victim unable to remove themselves from the tickling, as well as rendering the ticklish areas of the victim vulnerable. The victim is usually bound in a sitting or lying position rather than a standing one as to expose the soles of the feet which are often among the areas upon which tickling is inflicted. The restraint of the arms above the head leaves the upper body and underarms susceptible to the tickling. This enables the torturer to use whatever they want, e.g. fingers, tongue, beard, feathers, brush, pine cones, salt sticks, electric toothbrush or a vacuum cleaner.

==In fiction==
In [[VeggieTales]]'s ''[[Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen]]'', King Xerxes disposes of criminals by banishing them to the Island of Perpetual Tickling, to which [[Death (personification)|Death]], wielding a scythe-sized feather, escorts them.  Thus, tickle torture serves here as a [[family-friendly]] depiction of capital punishment.

The TV series ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' had a recurring character named Don Turtelli whose main form of torture was to take a feather to the soles of the feet of his captives.

Tickle torture has become the subject of many fetish/sexual publications. These fictional writings can portray a fantasy of a desirable character, often a  celebrity, being restrained and interrogated. These stories are not always sexual, although they are mostly the object of sexual fantasies and dreams. Because of the fantasy element of the plot, the characters are often magical or the circumstances are completely imaginative.

In one of the light novels of the ''[[List of Naruto print media#Naruto_Secret_Chronicles_series|Naruto Secret Chronicle]]'' series, the shinobi Sai uses tickle torture on an ANBU member he was interrogating, as the man had been taught to withstand traditional torture. The action succeeded in them finding the location of their comrade, [[Sakura Haruno]].

[[File:wiki snake eats mouse.jpg|thumb|right|Thermographic image: an ectothermic snake is eating a homeothermic mouse]]
'''Warm-blooded''' [[animal]] [[species]] can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment. In particular, [[homeothermy|homeothermic]] species maintain a stable body temperature by regulating metabolic processes. The only known homeotherms are [[birds]] and [[mammals]]. Other species have various degrees of [[thermoregulation]].

Animal body temperature control varies by species, so the terms "warm-blooded" and "[[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]" (though still in everyday use) suggest a false idea of there being only two categories of body temperature control, and are no longer used scientifically.

==Terminology==
In general, warm-bloodedness refers to three separate categories of [[thermoregulation]].
*[[Endotherm]]y is the ability of some creatures to control their body temperatures through internal means such as muscle shivering or increasing their [[metabolism]] ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἔνδον ''endon'' "within" θέρμη ''thermē'' "heat"). Some writers{{Who|date=September 2010}} restrict the meaning of endothermy to mechanisms that directly raise the animal's metabolic rate to produce heat. The opposite of endothermy is [[ectothermy]]. 
*[[Homeotherm]]y maintains a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influence and temperatures. The stable internal temperature is often higher than the immediate environment (Greek: ὅμοιος ''homoios'' "similar", θέρμη ''thermē'' "heat"). The opposite is [[poikilothermy]]. Mammals and birds are homeothermic.
*Tachymetabolism maintains a high "resting" metabolism (Greek: ταχύς ''tachys/tachus'' "fast, swift", μεταβάλλειν ''metaballein'' "turn quickly"). In essence, tachymetabolic creatures are "on" all the time. Though their resting metabolism is still many times slower than their active metabolism, the difference is often not as large as that seen in [[bradymetabolism|bradymetabolic]] creatures. Tachymetabolic creatures have greater difficulty dealing with a scarcity of food.

==The variety of thermoregulation types==
A large proportion of the creatures traditionally called "warm-blooded", like birds and mammals, fit all three of these categories (i.e., they are endothermic, homeothermic, ''and'' tachymetabolic).  However, over the past 30 years, studies in the field of animal thermophysiology have revealed many species belonging to these two groups that do not fit all these criteria.  For example, many [[bat]]s and small birds are [[poikilothermic]] and [[bradymetabolism|bradymetabolic]] when they sleep for the night (or, in nocturnal species, for the day).  For these creatures, the term [[heterothermy]] was coined.

Further studies on animals that were traditionally assumed to be [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]] have shown that most creatures incorporate different variations of the three terms defined above, along with their counterparts ([[ectothermic|ectothermy]], [[poikilothermy]], and [[bradymetabolism]]), thus creating a broad spectrum of body temperature types. Some [[fish]] have warm-blooded characteristics, such as the [[opah]]. [[Swordfish]] and some [[shark]]s have [[circulatory system|circulatory]] mechanisms that keep their [[brain]]s and [[eye]]s above ambient temperatures and thus increase their ability to detect and react to [[predation|prey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2005/110/2 Hot Eyes for Cold Fish -- Wong 2005 (110): 2 -- ScienceNOW]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Warm brain and eye temperatures in sharks |author1=Block, B.A. |author2=Carey, F.G.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B | publisher=Springer | volume=156 | issue=2 |date=March 1985 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/ux6865g5610x54n4/ | doi=10.1007/BF00695777 | pages=229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=6503 | title=Warm eyes give deep-sea predators super vision | publisher=University of Queensland | date=11 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunas and some sharks have similar mechanisms in their muscles, improving their stamina when swimming at high speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Warm-Blooded Fish | author=McFarlane, P. | journal=Monthly Bulletin of the Hamilton and District Aquarium Society |date=January 1999 | url=http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/breeding/McFarlane_Warm_Blooded_Fish.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat generation==
Body heat is [[thermogenesis|generated]] by [[metabolism]].  This refers to the chemical reactions [[cell (biology)|cell]]s use to break down [[glucose]] into water and [[carbon dioxide]] and, in so doing, generate ATP ([[adenosine triphosphate]]), a high-energy compound used to power other cellular processes. Muscle contraction is a type of metabolic process that generates heat energy, and heat is also generated through friction when blood flows through the circulatory system.

All organisms metabolize food and other inputs, but some make better use of the output than others. Like all energy conversions, metabolism is rather inefficient, and around 60% of the available energy is converted to heat rather than to ATP. In most organisms, this heat is simply lost to the environment. However, endothermic homeotherms (the animals generally characterized as "warm-blooded") both produce more heat and have better ways to retain and regulate it than other animals. They have a higher basal metabolic rate, and also a greater capacity to increase their metabolic rate when engaged in strenuous activity. They usually have well-developed insulation in order to retain body heat, fur in the case of mammals and [[feather]]s in birds. When this insulation is insufficient to maintain body temperature, they may resort to [[shivering]]—rapid muscle contractions that quickly use up ATP, thus stimulating cellular metabolism to replace it and consequently produce more heat. In general, in hot environments, they use evaporative cooling to shed excess heat, either by [[perspiration|sweating]] (some mammals) or by panting (many mammals and all birds)—in general, mechanisms not present in poikilotherms.

==Defense against fungi==
It has been hypothesized that warm-bloodedness evolved in mammals and birds because it provided defense against fungal infections.  Very few fungi can survive the body temperatures of warm-blooded animals.  By comparison, insects, reptiles, and amphibians are plagued by fungal infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228411.700-killer-fungi-made-us-hotblooded.html#.UeTeVY0wd8E|year=2011|title=Killer Fungi Made us Hotblooded|last=Dunn |first=Rob|work=New Scientist|accessdate=27 April 2016}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aviv Bergman, Arturo Casadevall. 2010.

The '''will to power''' ({{lang-de|der Wille zur Macht}}) is a prominent concept in the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The will to power describes what [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] may have believed to be the main driving force in humans – achievement, ambition, and the striving to reach the highest possible position in life. These are all manifestations of the will to power; however, the concept was never systematically defined in Nietzsche's work, leaving its interpretation open to debate.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Adler]] incorporated the will to power into his [[individual psychology]]. This can be contrasted to the other [[Vienna|Viennese]] schools of [[psychotherapy]]: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] (will to pleasure) and [[Viktor Frankl]]'s [[logotherapy]] (will to meaning). Each of these schools advocates and teaches a very different essential driving force in human beings.

== ''Kraft'' vs. ''Macht'' ==

Some of the misconceptions of the will to power, including [[Influence and reception of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche and fascism|Nazi appropriation of Nietzsche's philosophy]], arise from overlooking Nietzsche's distinction between ''Kraft'' (force) and ''Macht'' (power).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Golomb |first1=Jacob |date=2002 |title=Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism? On the Uses and Abuses of a Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kraft'' is primordial strength that may be exercised by anything possessing it, while ''Macht'' is, within Nietzsche's philosophy, closely tied to sublimation and "self-overcoming", the conscious channeling of ''Kraft'' for creative purposes.

== Early influences ==

Nietzsche's early thinking was influenced by that of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], whom he first discovered in 1865. Schopenhauer puts a central emphasis on will and in particular has a concept of the "[[will to live]]". Writing a generation before Nietzsche, he explained that the [[universe]] and [[everything]] in it is driven by a primordial will to live, which results in a desire in all living creatures to avoid death and to procreate. For Schopenhauer, this will is the most fundamental aspect of reality – more fundamental even than being.

Another important influence was [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], whom Nietzsche discovered and learned about through his reading, in 1866, of [[Friedrich Albert Lange|Friedrich Albert Lange's]] 1865 ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'' (''History of Materialism''). As early as 1872, Nietzsche went on to study Boscovich’s book ''Theoria Philosophia Naturalis'' for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whitlock |first=Greg |title=Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story |journal=Nietzsche Studien |volume=25 |year=1996 |issue=1 |pages=200–220 |doi=10.1515/9783110244441.200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche makes his only reference in his published works to Boscovich in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', where he declares war on "soul-atomism".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', trans. Walter Kaufmann (1886; New York: Vintage Books, 1966), §12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boscovich had rejected the idea of "materialistic atomism", which Nietzsche calls "one of the best refuted theories there is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=R. Lanier |year=1994 |month= |title=Nietzsche’s Will to Power as a Doctrine of the Unity of Science |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=738 &lt;!--|accessdate= 2008-10-13 --&gt;|postscript= "Boscovich's theory of centers of force was prominent in Germany at the time. Boscovich’s theory 'is echoed in [[Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant’s]] ''Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science'', which reduces matter to force altogether. Kant’s view, in turn, became very influential in German physics through the work of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and his followers. By the time Nietzsche wrote, treating matter in terms of fields of force was the dominant understanding of the fundamental notions of physics.{{'"}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of centers of force would become central to Nietzsche's later theories of "will to power".

== Appearance of the concept in Nietzsche's work ==

As the 1880s began, Nietzsche began to speak of the "Desire for Power" (''Machtgelüst''); this appeared in ''[[Human, All Too Human|The Wanderer and his Shadow]]'' (1880) and ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'' (1881). ''Machtgelüst'', in these works, is the pleasure of the feeling of [[power (social and political)|power]] and the hunger to overpower.

[[Wilhelm Roux]] published his ''The Struggle of Parts in the Organism'' (''Der Kampf der Teile im Organismus'') in 1881, and Nietzsche first read it that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregory |last=Moore |title=Nietzsche, Biology, Metaphor |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0521812305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a response to Darwinian theory, proposing an alternative mode of evolution. Roux was a disciple of and influenced by [[Ernst Haeckel]]&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Müller-Lauter, "The Organism as Inner Struggle: Wilhelm Roux’s Influence on Nietzsche", in ''Nietzsche: His Philosophy of Contradictions and the Contradictions of His Philosophy'', trans. David J. Parent (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1999), 161–82.&lt;/ref&gt; who believed the struggle for existence occurred at the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] level. The various cells and tissues struggle for finite resources, so that only the strongest survive. Through this mechanism, the body grows stronger and better adapted. Lacking modern [[gene]]tic theory, Roux's model  assumed a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] or [[pangenesis|pangenetic]] model of inheritance.

Nietzsche began to expand on the concept of ''Machtgelüst'' in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (1882), where in a section titled "On the doctrine of the feeling of power",&lt;ref&gt;Section 13&lt;/ref&gt; he connects the desire for cruelty with the pleasure in the feeling of power. Elsewhere in ''The Gay Science'' he notes that it is only "in intellectual beings that pleasure, displeasure, and will are to be found",&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''The Gay Science'', trans. Walter Kaufman (1887; New York: Vintage Books, 1974), §127.&lt;/ref&gt; excluding the vast majority of organisms from the desire for power.

[[Léon Dumont]] (1837–77), whose 1875 book ''Théorie Scientifique de La Sensibilité, le Plaisir et la Peine'' Nietzsche read in 1883,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Small, ''Nietzsche in Context'' (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2001), 166.&lt;/ref&gt; seems to have exerted some influence on this concept. Dumont believed that pleasure is related to increases in force.&lt;ref&gt;Small, ''Nietzsche in Context'', 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Wanderer'' and ''Daybreak'', Nietzsche had speculated that pleasures such as cruelty are pleasurable because of exercise of power. But Dumont provided a physiological basis for Nietzsche’s speculation. Dumont’s theory also would have seemed to confirm Nietzsche’s claim that pleasure and pain are reserved for intellectual beings, since, according to Dumont, pain and pleasure require a coming to consciousness and not just a sensing.

In 1883 Nietzsche coined the phrase "Wille zur Macht" in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The concept, at this point, was no longer limited to only those intellectual beings that can actually experience the feeling of power; it now applied to all life. The phrase ''Wille zur Macht'' first appears in part 1, "1001 Goals" (1883), then in part 2, in two sections, "Self-Overcoming" and "Redemption" (later in 1883). "Self-Overcoming" describes it in most detail, saying it is an "unexhausted procreative will of life". There is will to power where there is life and even the strongest living things will risk their lives for more power. This suggests that the will to power is stronger than the will to survive.

Schopenhauer's "Will to life" thus became a subsidiary to the will to power, which is the stronger will. Nietzsche thinks his notion of the will to power is far more useful than Schopenhauer's will to live for explaining various events, especially human behavior—for example, Nietzsche uses the will to power to explain both [[ascetic]], life-denying impulses and strong, life-affirming impulses in the European tradition,{{clarify|date=January 2016}} as well as both [[master and slave morality]]. He also finds the will to power to offer much richer explanations than [[utilitarianism]]'s notion that all people really want to be happy, or the [[Plato]]nist's notion that people want to be unified with the Good.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Nietzsche read [[William Rolph]]’s ''Biologische Probleme'' around mid-1884, and it clearly interested him,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Nietzsche, Biology, Metaphor'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; for his copy is heavily annotated.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Brobjer, "Nietzsche’s Reading and Private Library, 1885–1889", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 58, no. 4 (Oct 1997): 663–93.&lt;/ref&gt; He made many notes concerning Rolph. Rolph was another [[evolution]]ary [[anti-Darwinist]] like Roux, who wished to argue for evolution by a different mechanism than the struggle for existence. Rolph argued that all life seeks primarily to expand itself. Organisms fulfill this need through assimilation, trying to make as much of what is found around them into part of themselves, for example by seeking to increase intake and nutriment. Life forms are naturally insatiable in this way.

Nietzsche's next published work was ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' (1886), where the influence of Rolph seems apparent. Nietzsche writes,
{{quote|Even the body within which individuals treat each other as equals&amp;nbsp;... will have to be an incarnate will to power, it will strive to grow, spread, seize, become predominant&amp;nbsp;– not from any morality or immorality but because it is living and because life simply is will to power.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', §259.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
''Beyond Good and Evil'' has the most references to "will to power" in his published works, appearing in 11 aphorisms.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil'', §§ 22, 23 36, 44 ("''Macht-Willen''," translated "power-will"), 51, 186, 198, 211, 227, 257 ("''Willenskräfte und Macht-Begierden''", translated "strength of will and lust for power"), 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Rolph and its connection to "will to power" also continues in book 5 of ''Gay Science'' (1887) where Nietzsche describes "will to power" as the instinct for "expansion of power" fundamental to all life.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''The Gay Science'', §349.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli|Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli's]] 1884 book ''Mechanisch-physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre'', which Nietzsche acquired around 1886 and subsequently read closely,&lt;ref&gt;Brobjer says it is the most heavily annotated book of his 1886 reading, "Nietzsche’s Reading and Private Library", 679.&lt;/ref&gt; also had considerable influence on his theory of will to power. Nietzsche wrote a letter to Franz Overbeck about it, noting that it has "been sheepishly put aside by Darwinists".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite journal |first=Anette |last=Horn |title=Nietzsche’s interpretation of his sources on Darwinism: Idioplasma, Micells and military troops |journal=South African Journal of Philosophy |volume=24 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=260–272 |doi=10.4314/sajpem.v24i4.31426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nägeli believed in a "perfection principle", which led to greater complexity. He called the seat of heritability the idioplasma, and argued, with a military metaphor, that a more complex, complicatedly ordered idioplasma would usually defeat a simpler rival.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, "Nietzsche's Interpretation of his Sources", 265–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he is also arguing for internal evolution, similar to Roux, except emphasizing complexity as the main factor instead of strength.

Thus, Dumont’s pleasure in the expansion of power, Roux’s internal struggle, Nägeli’s drive towards complexity, and Rolph’s principle of insatiability and assimilation are fused together into the biological side of Nietzsche’s theory of will to power, which is developed in a number of places in his published writings.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Nietzsche, Biology, Metaphor'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Having derived the "will to power" from three anti-Darwin evolutionists, as well as Dumont, it seems appropriate that he should use his "will to power" as an anti-Darwinian explanation of evolution. He expresses a number of times&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'', §13; ''Gay Science'', §349; ''Genealogy of Morals'', II:12.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that adaptation and the struggle to survive is a secondary drive in the evolution of animals, behind the desire to expand one’s power – the "will to power".

Nonetheless, in his notebooks he continues to expand the theory of the will to power.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase will to power appears in "147 entries of the Colli and Montinari edition of the Nachlass. ... one-fifth of the occurrences of Wille zur Macht have to do with outlines of various lengths of the projected but ultimately abandoned book".  Linda L. Williams, "Will to Power in Nietzsche's Published Works and the Nachlass", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 57, no. 3 (1996): 447–63, 450.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by his earlier readings of Boscovich, he began to develop a physics of the will to power. The idea of matter as centers of force is translated into matter as centers of will to power. Nietzsche wanted to slough off the theory of matter, which he viewed as a relic of the metaphysics of substance.&lt;ref&gt;Whitlock, "Boscovich, Spinoza and Nietzsche", 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas of an all inclusive [[physics]] or [[metaphysics]] built upon the will to power do not appear to arise anywhere in his published works or in any of the final books published posthumously, except in the above-mentioned aphorism from ''Beyond Good &amp; Evil'', where he references Boscovich (section 12). It does recur in his notebooks, but not all scholars treat these ideas as part of his thought.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Williams, "Will to Power in Nietzsche's Published Works and the Nachlass".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Will to power and eternal recurrence ==

Throughout the 1880s, in his notebooks, Nietzsche developed a theory of the [[Eternal return|"eternal recurrence of the same"]] and much speculation on the physical possibility of this idea and the mechanics of its actualization occur in his later notebooks. Here, the will to power as a potential physics is integrated with the postulated eternal recurrence. Taken literally as a theory for how things are, Nietzsche appears to imagine a physical universe of perpetual struggle and force that repeatedly completes its cycle and returns to the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see Whitlock, "Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche"; Moles, "Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence as Riemannian Cosmology"; Christa Davis Acampora, "Between Mechanism and Teleology: Will to Power and Nietzsche’s Gay 'Science{{'"}}, in ''Nietzsche &amp; Science'', 171–188 (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004); Stack, "Nietzsche and Boscovich’s Natural Philosophy"; and Small "The Physics of Eternal Recurrence", in ''Nietzsche in Context'', 135–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars believe that Nietzsche used the concept of eternal recurrence metaphorically.  But others, such as Paul Loeb, have argued that "Nietzsche did indeed believe in the truth of cosmological eternal recurrence."&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Paul, The Death of Nietzsche's Zarathustra, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; By either interpretation the acceptance of eternal recurrence raises the question of whether it could justify a trans-valuation of one's life, and be a necessary precursor to the overman in her/his perfect acceptance of all that is, for the love of life itself and [[amor fati]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In contemporary Nietzschean scholarship, some interpreters have emphasized the will to power as a psychological principle because Nietzsche applies it most frequently to human behavior. However, in Nietzsche's unpublished notes (later published by his sister as "The Will to Power"), Nietzsche sometimes seemed to view the will to power as a more (metaphysical) general force underlying ''all'' reality, not just human behavior—thus making it more directly analogous to Schopenhauer's will to live. For example, Nietzsche claims the "''world is the will to power—and nothing besides!''".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''The Will To Power'', §1067&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in relation to the entire body of Nietzsche's published works, many scholars have insisted that Nietzsche's principle of the will to power is less metaphysical and more pragmatic than Schopenhauer's will to live: while Schopenhauer thought the will to live was what was most real in the universe, Nietzsche can be understood as claiming only that the will to power is a particularly useful principle for his purposes.

Some interpreters also upheld a biological interpretation of the ''Wille zur Macht'', making it equivalent with some kind of [[social Darwinism]]. For example, the concept was appropriated by some [[Nazi]]s such as [[Alfred Bäumler]], who may have drawn influence from it or used it to justify their expansive quest for power.

This reading was criticized by [[Martin Heidegger]] in his 1930s courses on Nietzsche—suggesting that raw physical or political power was not what Nietzsche had in mind.  This is reflected in the following passage from Nietzsche's notebooks:

{{Quote|I have found strength where one does not look for it: in simple, mild, and pleasant people, without the least desire to rule—and, conversely, the desire to rule has often appeared to me a sign of inward weakness: they fear their own slave soul and shroud it in a royal cloak (in the end, they still become the slaves of their followers, their fame, etc.) The powerful natures dominate, it is a necessity, they need not lift one finger. Even if, during their lifetime, they bury themselves in a garden house!&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche. ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Nachlass]]'', Fall 1880 6 [206]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Opposed to a biological and voluntary conception of the ''Wille zur Macht'', Heidegger also argued that the will to power must be considered in relation to the ''[[Übermensch]]'' and the ''[[Eternal return|thought of eternal recurrence]]''—although this reading itself has been criticized by [[Mazzino Montinari]] as a "macroscopic Nietzsche".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mazzino Montinari]], ''Friedrich Nietzsche'' (1974), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilles Deleuze]] also emphasized the connection between the will to power and eternal return.  Both Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze were careful to point out that the primary nature of will to power is unconscious.  This means that the drive to power is always already at work unconsciously, perpetually advancing the will of the one over the other.  This thus creates the state of things in the observable or conscious world still operating through the same tension.  Derrida is careful not to confine the will to power to human behavior, the mind, metaphysics, nor physical reality individually.  It is the underlying life principle inaugurating all aspects of life and behavior, a self-preserving force.  A sense of entropy and the eternal return, which are related, is always indissociable from the will to power.  The eternal return of all memory initiated by the will to power is an entropic force again inherent to all life.

Opposed to this interpretation, the "will to power" can be understood (or misunderstood) to mean a struggle against one's surroundings that culminates in personal growth, self-overcoming, and self-perfection, and assert that the power held over others as a result of this is coincidental. Thus Nietzsche wrote:

{{Quote|My idea is that every specific body strives to become master over all space and to extend its force (its will to power) and to thrust back all that resists its extension. But it continually encounters similar efforts on the part of other bodies and ends by coming to an arrangement ("union") with those of them that are sufficiently related to it: thus they then conspire together for power. And the process goes on.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''The Will to Power'', §636 = {{Cite book|title=Digitale kritische Gesamtausgabe, Nachgelassene Fragmente 1888, 14[186]|url=http://www.nietzschesource.org/#eKGWB/NF-1888,14[186]}} &lt;/ref&gt;}}

It would be possible to claim that rather than an attempt to 'dominate over others', the "will to power" is better understood as the tenuous equilibrium in a system of forces' relations to each other. While a rock, for instance, does not have a conscious (or unconscious) "will", it nevertheless acts as a site of resistance within the "will to power" dynamic. Moreover, rather than 'dominating over others', "will to power" is more accurately positioned in relation to the subject (a mere [[synecdoche]], both fictitious and necessary, for there is "no doer behind the deed," (see ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'')) and is an idea behind the statement that words are "seductions" within the process of [[Self-esteem|self-mastery]] and [[self-overcoming]]. The "will to power" is thus a "cosmic" inner force acting in and through both animate and inanimate objects. Not just instincts but also higher level behaviors (even in humans) were to be reduced to the ''will to power''. This includes both such apparently{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}} harmful acts as physical [[violence]], lying, and domination, on one hand, and such apparently non-harmful acts as gift-giving, [[love]], and praise on the other—though its manifestations can be altered significantly, such as through art and aesthetic experience. In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', he claims that philosophers' "will to truth" (i.e., their apparent desire to dispassionately seek objective, absolute truth) is actually nothing more than a manifestation of their will to power; this will can be life-affirming or a manifestation of [[nihilism]], but it is the will to power all the same.

Other Nietzschean interpreters dispute the suggestion that Nietzsche's concept of the will to power is merely and only a matter of narrow, harmless, humanistic self-perfection.  They suggest that, for Nietzsche, power means self-perfection ''as well as'' outward, political, elitist, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] domination. Nietzsche, in fact, explicitly and specifically defined the egalitarian state-idea as the embodiment of the will to power in decline:

{{Quote|To speak of just or unjust in itself is quite senseless; in itself, of course, no injury, assault, exploitation, destruction can be 'unjust,' since life operates essentially, that is in its basic functions, through injury, assault, exploitation, destruction and simply cannot be thought of at all without this character. One must indeed grant something even more unpalatable: that, from the highest biological standpoint, legal conditions can never be other than exceptional conditions, since they constitute a partial restriction of the will of life, which is bent upon power, and are subordinate to its total goal as a single means: namely, as a means of creating greater units of power. A legal order thought of as sovereign and universal, not as a means in the struggle between power complexes but as a means of preventing all struggle in general perhaps after the [[communism|communistic]] cliché of Dühring, that every will must consider every other will its equal—would be a principle hostile to life, an agent of the dissolution and destruction of man, an attempt to assassinate the future of man, a sign of weariness, a secret path to nothingness.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''On the Genealogy of Morals'', II:11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Individual psychology ===
{{main|Individual psychology}}
[[Alfred Adler]] borrowed heavily from Nietzsche's work to develop his second Viennese school of psychotherapy called individual psychology. Adler (1912) wrote in his important book ''Über den nervösen Charakter (The Neurotic Constitution)'':

{{quote|Nietzsche's "Will to power" and "Will to seem" embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of Féré and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness (Ohnmacht).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Adler, Alfred|authorlink=Alfred Adler|year=1912–1917|title=The Neurotic Constitution|pages=ix|publisher=Moffat, Yard and Company|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/neuroticconstitu00adle|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adler's adaptation of the will to power was and still is in contrast to Sigmund Freud's [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] or the "will to pleasure", and to Viktor Frankl's [[logotherapy]] or the "will to meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]. ''Mater Dei Institute''&lt;/ref&gt; Adler's intent was to build a movement that would rival, even supplant, others in psychology by arguing for the holistic integrity of psychological well-being with that of [[social equality]].  His interpretation of Nietzsche's will to power was concerned with the individual patient's overcoming of the [[Superiority complex|superiority-]][[Inferiority complex|inferiority]] dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ansbacher |first1= Heinz |authorlink1= Heinz Ansbacher |last2= Ansbacher |first2= Rowena R. |title= The Individual Psychology of Alfred Adler |year= 1956 |publisher= Harper Perennial (1964) |pages= 132–133 |isbn= 0-06-131154-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Man's Search for Meaning'', Frankl compared his third Viennese school of psychotherapy with Adler's psychoanalytic interpretation of the will to power:

{{quote|... the striving to find a meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man.  That is why I speak of a ''will to meaning'' in contrast to the pleasure principle (or, as we could also term it, the ''will to pleasure'') on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the ''will to power'' stressed by Adlerian psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Frankl |first= Viktor |authorlink= Viktor Frankl |title= Man's Search for Meaning |year= 1959 |publisher= Beacon Press |location= Boston, Massachusetts |page= 154 |isbn= 0-671-02337-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In fiction and popular culture ==

The 1999 [[4x]] strategy game [[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]] refers to the will to power by naming one of its available technologies by that name. A quote from ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' is given when the technology is discovered by the player.

The character of 'The Jackal' in the 2008 Ubisoft game Far Cry 2 quotes from Beyond Good and Evil and the Will to Power. 

The 2016 4x strategy game [[Stellaris (video game)|Stellaris]] also includes a technology with this name.

Bob Rosenberg, founder of [[freestyle music]] group [[Will to Power (band)|Will to Power]] chose the name for the group as an homage to German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s theory of an individual's fundamental "will to power".&lt;ref name="Bronson"&gt;[[Fred Bronson|Bronson, Fred]] (2003). ''The Billboard Book of No. 1 Hits'', 5th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 715.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first title in the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' trilogy is [[Xenosaga Episode I|''Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht'']].

On September 8th, 2017, melodic death metal band Arch Enemy released an album entitled "Will to Power". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.archenemy.net/en/band/discography&lt;/ref&gt;

The book makes an appearance in the 1933 Barbara Stanwyck movie ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]''.

In ''[[Smallville]]'' (Season 1, Episode 17), the Lex Luthor character reveals that his father gave him a copy of the book for his tenth birthday.
