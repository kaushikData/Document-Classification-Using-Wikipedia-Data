{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}

An '''adept''' is an individual identified as having attained a specific level of knowledge, skill, or aptitude in doctrines relevant to a particular author or organization.

==Etymology==
The word "adept" is derived from [[Latin]] ''adeptus'' 'one who has attained' (the secret of transmuting metals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adept?s=t|title=Adept - Define Adept at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authors==

===H. P. Blavatsky===
[[Madame Blavatsky]] makes liberal use of the term ''adept'' in her works&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater. ''The Inner Life''. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to their minor function as caretaker of ancient occult knowledge. She also mentions their great compassionate help for humanity and such lesser powers of the adept as being able to take active control of elemental spirits as well as the physical and [[Astral Projection|astral]] (conditions of non-adepts.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky. ''Isis Unveiled''. Vol II, pp. 588-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alice Bailey===
In [[Alice Bailey]]'s body of writing she outlines a hierarchy of spiritual evolution and an initiatory path along which an individual may choose to advance. In her works an Adept is defined as a being who has taken five of the seven initiations.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey. ''Initiation Human and Solar''. p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orders==
Various occult organizations have steps in which an initiate may ascend in their own magical system. Some call these steps degrees or grades.

===Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn===
In the initiatory system of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], an adept is one who has taken the oath of the 5=6 grade and has been granted the title Adeptus Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie. ''The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic'' Vol 7, p52.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolically this degree represents a spiritual aspirant who, having mastered the union of the [[Classical element|four elements]] under an upright and balanced spirit,&lt;ref&gt;Regardie. ''The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic'' Vol 7, p25. The symbol representing spirit over the [[Classical element|four elements]] in the Golden Dawn tradition is the upright [[pentagram]].&lt;/ref&gt; is allowed passage from the ''Portal of the Vault of the Adepti'' into the tomb of [[Christian Rosenkreutz]] in the center of the Rosicrucian Mountain of Initiation, [[Abiegnus]], at the center of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie. ''The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic'' Vol 7, p56.&lt;/ref&gt; The grade of Adeptus Minor and subsequent grades, Adeptus Major, and Adeptus Exemptus form the Second Order of the Golden Dawn, also called the Rosæ Rubeæ et Aureæ Crucis (The Ruby Rose and Golden Cross). These grades correspond to the [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[sephirah]] of [[Tiphereth]], [[Geburah]], and [[Chesed]] respectively.&lt;ref name="gd+aa grades"&gt;Eshelman. ''The Mystical &amp; Magical System of the A∴A∴''. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oath of the Adeptus Minor includes a provision to "unite myself with my higher and Divine Genius",&lt;ref&gt;Regardie. ''The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic'' Vol 7, p42.&lt;/ref&gt; a process which is more commonly referred to (by way of [[Aleister Crowley]]) as Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. To undertake this process the Adeptus Minor must reconfirm the work of earlier grades (Zelator through Philosophus) with their newfound knowledge before passing to the Adeptus Major degree, as a full-fledged adept.&lt;ref name="gd+aa grades" /&gt;

===A∴A∴===
[[Aleister Crowley]], who formed the [[A∴A∴]], restructured the Golden Dawn system. This system still holds to three forms of adept.&lt;ref name="gd+aa grades"/&gt;

*Student
*Probationer—The Order of the Golden Dawn--
*Neophyte
*Zelator
*Practicus
*Philosophus
*Dominus Liminis—The order of the RC (Rose Cross)--
*Adeptus Minor
*Adeptus Major
*Adeptus Exemptus
*Babe of the Abyss—The Order of the S. S. (Silver Star)--
*Magister Templi
*Magus
*Ipsissimus

===Temple of Set===
The [[Temple of Set]] calls their steps degrees, and places adept second.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Its system is as follows:

*Setian ( First Degree )
*Adept ( Second Degree )
*Priest / Priestess ( Third Degree )
*Magister / Magistra Templi ( Fourth Degree )
*Magus / Maga ( Fifth Degree )
*Ipsissimus / Ipsissima ( Sixth Degree )

===Illuminates of Thanateros===
Also distinguished as degrees, the [[Illuminates of Thanateros]], is a newer style of magic called [[chaos magic]], which places adept closer to the top of their system.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

*4° Neophyte
*3° Initiate
*2° Adept
*1° Magus

==Ceremonial magic and theurgic practices==
Those who practice [[Esotericism|esoteric]] arts such as [[theurgy]], and [[Practical Kabbalah|Kabbalah]] are familiar with the word "adept". In the traditions of [[esoteric Christianity]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|ritual magic]], an adept is one who is skilled or profound, but not a master in these arts.&lt;ref&gt;''Secrets of the Magickal Grimoires by Aaron Leitch''&lt;!--author and publishing date needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage''&lt;!--auhtor and publishing date needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

meaning "Effective for Aten"), known before the fifth year of his reign as '''Amenhotep IV''' (sometimes given its [[Hellenization|Greek form]], ''Amenophis IV'', and meaning "[[Amun]] Is Satisfied"), was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] of the [[18th Dynasty]] who ruled for 17 years and died perhaps in 1336 BC or 1334 BC. He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian [[polytheism]] and introducing worship centered on the [[Aten]], which is sometimes described as [[monolatristic]], [[henotheistic]], or even quasi-[[monotheism|monotheistic]]. An early inscription likens the Aten to the sun as compared to stars, and later official language avoids calling the Aten a god, giving the [[solar deity]] a status above mere gods.

Akhenaten tried to shift his culture from Egypt's [[Egyptian pantheon|traditional religion]], but the shifts were not widely accepted. After his death, [[Damnatio memoriae|his monuments were dismantled and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from the king lists]].&lt;ref&gt;Lise Manniche, ''Akhenaten Colossi of Karnak'' (Cairo 6G: American University in Cairo Press, 2000), ix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Traditional religious practice]] was gradually restored, and when some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the 18th Dynasty founded a new dynasty, they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors, referring to Akhenaten himself as "the enemy" or "that criminal" in archival records.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger et al. (2001), pp.186-7&lt;/ref&gt;

He was all but lost from history until the discovery during the 19th century of the site of Akhetaten, the city he built and designed for the worship of Aten, at [[Amarna]].&lt;ref&gt;''Egypt's Golden Empire: Pharaohs of the Sun'' (2002; New York, NY: PBS Distribution, 2009), Internet video.&lt;/ref&gt; Early excavations at Amarna by [[Flinders Petrie]] sparked interest in the enigmatic pharaoh, and a mummy found in the tomb [[KV55]], which was unearthed in 1907 in a dig led by [[Edward R. Ayrton]], is likely that of Akhenaten. [[DNA analysis]] has determined that the man buried in KV55 is the father of King [[Tutankhamun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anubis4_2000.tripod.com/mummypages1/18C.htm |title=See the KV 55 Mummy &amp; Tutankhamen |publisher=Anubis4_2000.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its identification as Akhenaten has been questioned.&lt;ref name="AkhenatenKV55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110427/full/472404a.html | doi=10.1038/472404a | pmid=21525906 | volume=472 | issue=7344 | title=Ancient DNA: Curse of the Pharaoh's DNA | journal=Nature | pages=404–406| year=2011 | last1=Marchant | first1=Jo }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NewScientist.com; January 2011;

Modern interest in Akhenaten and his queen [[Nefertiti]] comes partly from his connection with [[Tutankhamun]] (even though Tutankhamun's mother was not Nefertiti, but a woman named by archaeologists [[The Younger Lady]]), partly from the unique style and high quality of the pictorial [[Amarna art|arts he patronized]], and partly from ongoing interest in [[Atenism|the religion]] he attempted to establish.

==Early reign as Amenhotep IV==
[[File:Berlin Neues Museum - relief d'Amenhotep IV.jpg|thumb|Relief representing Amenhotep IV before he changed his name to Akhenaten, [[Neues Museum]], Berlin]]
The future Akhenaten was a younger son of [[Amenhotep III]] and Chief Queen [[Tiye]]. The eldest son [[Crown Prince Thutmose]] was recognized as the heir of Amenhotep III but he died relatively young and the next in line for the throne was a prince named Amenhotep.&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt;
[[File:Sandstone fragment from the temple of Amenhotep III showing a young prince, probably Akhenaten before he became a king. 18th Dynasty. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Sandstone fragment from the temple of Amenhotep III showing a young prince, probably Akhenaten before he became a king. 18th Dynasty. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
There is much controversy around whether Amenhotep IV succeeded to the throne on the death of his father Amenhotep III or whether there was a coregency (lasting as long as 12 years according to some [[Egyptologists]]). Current literature by Eric Cline, Nicholas Reeves, [[Peter Dorman]] and other scholars comes out strongly against the establishment of a long coregency between the two rulers and in favour of either no coregency or a brief one lasting one to two years at the most.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves (2000) p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Other literature by [[Donald Redford]], William Murnane, [[Alan Gardiner]] and more recently by Lawrence Berman in 1998 contests the view of any coregency whatsoever between Akhenaten and his father.&lt;ref&gt;Berman (1998) p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the Egyptian Ministry for Antiquities announced what it called conclusive evidence that Akhenaten shared power with his father for at least 8 years. The evidence came from the inscriptions found in the Luxor tomb of Vizier [[Amenhotep-Huy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/02/06/pharaoh-power-sharing-unearthed-egypt/ Pharaoh power-sharing unearthed in Egypt]

[[File: Amenhotep IV.jpg|thumb|right|x300px|Bronze plate with the titulary of Amenhotep IV before he changed his name to Akhenaten, [[British Museum]].]]
Amenhotep IV was crowned in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and there he started a building program. He decorated the southern entrance to the precincts of the [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of [[Amun-Re]] with scenes of his worshiping [[Re-Harakhti]]. He soon decreed the construction of a temple dedicated to the [[Aten]] in Eastern Karnak. This [[Temple of Amenhotep IV]] was called the Gempaaten ("The Aten is found in the estate of the Aten"). The Gempaaten consisted of a series of buildings, including a palace and a structure called the Hwt Benben (named after the [[Benben]] stone) which was dedicated to Queen [[Nefertiti]]. Other Aten temples constructed at Karnak during this time include the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV|Rud-menu]] and the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV|Teni-menu]], which may have been constructed near the Ninth Pylon. During this time he did not repress the worship of Amun, and the [[High Priest of Amun]] was still active in the fourth year of his reign.&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt, Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback), {{ISBN|0-500-27621-8}} p 259-268&lt;/ref&gt; 
The king appears as Amenhotep IV in the tombs of some of the nobles in Thebes:  
Kheruef ([[TT192]]), [[Ramose (TT55)|Ramose]] ([[TT55]]) and the tomb of [[Parennefer]] ([[TT188]]).&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;Charles F. Nims, The Transition from the Traditional to the New Style of Wall Relief under Amenhotep IV, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 32, No. 1/2 (Jan.–Apr. 1973), pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tomb of Ramose, Amenhotep IV appears on the west wall in the traditional style, seated on a throne with Ramose appearing before the king. On the other side of the doorway, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are shown in the window of appearance, with the Aten depicted as the sun disc. In the Theban tomb of Parennefer, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are seated on a throne with the sun disk depicted over the king and queen.&lt;ref name="Charles" /&gt;

Among the latter-known documents referring to Amenhotep IV are two copies of a letter from the Steward Of Memphis Apy (or Ipy) to the pharaoh. The documents were found in Gurob and are dated to regnal year 5, third month of the Growing Season, day 19.&lt;ref&gt;Murnane, William J., Texts from the Amarna Period in Egypt, Society of Biblical Literature, 1995 {{ISBN|1-55540-966-0}} p 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change==
On day 13, Month 8, in the fifth year of his reign, the king arrived at the site of the new city [[Akhetaten]] (now known as [[Amarna]]). A month before that Amenhotep IV had officially changed his name to Akhenaten.&lt;ref name="Aldred"/&gt; Amenhotep IV changed most of his [[Pharaoh#Titles|5 fold titulary]] in year 5 of his reign. The only name he kept was his prenomen or throne name of Neferkheperure.&lt;ref&gt;, Dodson, Aidan, Amarna Sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian Counter-Reformation.

[[File:Gempaaten talatats.jpg|thumb|right|[[Talatat]] blocks from Akhenaten's Aten temple in [[Karnak]]]]

Akhenaton placed much emphasis on the worship of the Egyptian sun which can be seen from many artistic depictions of a connection between the Pharoh and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crystalinks.com/akhenaten.html|title=Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt - Akhenaten|website=www.crystalinks.com|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some debate has focused on the extent to which Akhenaten forced his religious reforms on his people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hornung|first=Erik|date=1992-01-01|title=The Rediscovery of Akhenaten and His Place in Religion|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|volume=29|pages=43–49|doi=10.2307/40000483|jstor=40000483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, as time drew on, he revised the names of the Aten, and other religious language, to increasingly exclude references to other gods; at some point, also, he embarked on the wide-scale erasure of traditional gods' names, especially those of [[Amun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|last=Allen|first=James P|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=L|location=|pages=217–221|chapter=Akhenaton|quote=|via=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his court changed their names to remove them from the patronage of other gods and place them under that of Aten (or [[Ra]], with whom Akhenaten equated the Aten). Yet, even at Amarna itself, some courtiers kept such names as Ahmose ("child of the moon god", the owner of tomb 3), and the sculptor's workshop where the famous Nefertiti bust and other works of royal portraiture were found is associated with an artist known to have been called [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]] ("child of Thoth"). An overwhelmingly large number of [[Egyptian faience|faience]] amulets at Amarna also show that talismans of the household-and-childbirth gods Bes and Taweret, the eye of Horus, and amulets of other traditional deities, were openly worn by its citizens. Indeed, a cache of royal jewelry found buried near the Amarna royal tombs (now in the National Museum of Scotland) includes a finger ring referring to Mut, the wife of Amun. Such evidence suggests that though Akhenaten shifted funding away from traditional temples, his policies were fairly tolerant until some point, perhaps a particular event as yet unknown, toward the end of the reign.

Following Akhenaten's death, change was gradual at first. Within a decade a comprehensive political, religious and artistic reformation began promoting a return of Egyptian life to the norms it had followed during his father's reign. Much of the art and building infrastructure created during Akhenaten's reign was defaced or destroyed in the period following his death, particularly during the reigns of [[Horemheb]] and the early [[19th Dynasty]] kings. Stone building blocks from Akhenaten's construction projects were later used as foundation stones for subsequent rulers' temples and tombs.

Styles of art that flourished during this short period are markedly different from other Egyptian art. In some cases, representations are more naturalistic, especially in depictions of animals and plants, of commoners, and in a sense of action and movement for both non-royal and royal people. However, depictions of members of the court, especially members of the royal family, are extremely stylized, with elongated heads, protruding stomachs, heavy hips, thin arms and legs, and exaggerated facial features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/05/akhenaten-revolutionary-egypt-king-art-architecture/?sf72336685=1|title=The Age of Akhenaten|date=2017-04-20|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, and for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, Akhenaten's family are shown taking part in decidedly naturalistic activities, showing affection for each other, and being caught in mid-action (in traditional art, a pharaoh's divine nature was expressed by repose, even immobility). The depictions of action may correspond to the emphasis on the active, creative nurturing of the Aten emphasized in the "Great Hymn to the Aten" and elsewhere.  
[[File:Akhenaten with blue crown.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Small statue of Akhenaten wearing the Egyptian Blue Crown of War]]

Nefertiti also appears, both beside the king and alone (or with her daughters), in actions usually reserved for a pharaoh, suggesting that she enjoyed unusual status for a queen. Early artistic representations of her tend to be indistinguishable from her husband's except by her regalia, but soon after the move to the new capital, Nefertiti begins to be depicted with features specific to her. Questions remain whether the beauty of Nefertiti is portraiture or idealism.

Why representations of Akhenaten depict him in a bizarre, strikingly androgynous way, remains a vigorously debated question. Religious reasons have been suggested, such as to emulate the creative nature of the Aten, who is called in Amarna tomb texts "mother and father" of all that is. Or, it has been suggested, Akhenaten's (and his family's) portraiture exaggerates his distinctive physical traits. Until Akhenaten's mummy is positively identified, such theories remain speculative. Some scholars do identify Mummy 61074, found in KV55, an unfinished tomb in the Valley of the Kings, as Akhenaten's.&lt;ref&gt;S. McAvoy, "Mummy 61074: a Strange Case of Mistaken Identity", [[Antiguo Oriente]] 5 (2007): 183-194.&lt;/ref&gt; If so, or if the KV 55 mummy is that of his close relative, [[Smenkhkare]], its measurements tend to support the theory that Akhenaten's depictions exaggerate his actual appearance. Though the mummy consists only of disarticulated bones, the skull is long and has a prominent chin, and the limbs are light and long. In 2007, [[Zahi Hawass]] and a team of researchers made CT Scan images of Mummy 61074. They have concluded that the elongated skull, cheek bones, cleft palate, and impacted wisdom tooth suggest that the mummy is the father of Tutankhamun, and thus is Akhenaten.

[[File:Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their children.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Akhenaten, [[Nefertiti]] and their children&lt;/center&gt;]]
As Amenhotep IV, Akhenaten was married to Nefertiti at the very beginning of his reign, and six daughters were identified from inscriptions. Recent DNA analysis has revealed that with one of his biological sisters, the [[The Younger Lady (mummy)|"Younger Lady" mummy]], Akhenaten fathered Tutankhaten (later [[Tutankhamen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2010-02-16-king-tut_N.htm|title=A Frail King Tut Died From Malaria, Broken Leg | work=USA Today | first=Paul|last=Schemm|date=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parentage of Smenkhkare, his successor, is unknown, and Akhenaten and an unknown wife have been proposed to be his parents.

A secondary wife of Akhenaten named [[Kiya]] is known from inscriptions. Some have theorized that she gained her importance as the mother of Tutankhamen, Smenkhkare, or both.

This is a list of Akhenaten's children (known and theoretical) with suggested years of birth:

* [[Smenkhkare]] — year 35 or 36 of Amenhotep III's reign
* [[Meritaten]] — year 1.
* [[Meketaten]] — year 3, possibly earlier.
* [[Ankhesenpaaten]], later Queen of [[Tutankhamun]] — year 4.
* [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]] — year 8.
* [[Neferneferure]] — year 9.
* [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]] — year 9.
* [[Tutankhaten]] — year 8 or 9 — renamed Tutankhamun later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/ideology/king/familyakhenaton.html|title=The family of Akhenaton|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His known consorts were:
* [[Nefertiti]], his [[Great Royal Wife]].
* [[Kiya]], a lesser Royal Wife.
* A daughter of [[Šatiya]], ruler of [[Enišasi]]&lt;ref name="WG"&gt;Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens: A Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Golden House Publications, London, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-9547218-9-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A daughter of [[Burna-Buriash II|Burna-Buriash]], king of Babylon&lt;ref name="WG"/&gt;

It has been proposed that Akhenaten may have taken some of his daughters as sexual consorts, to attempt to father a male heir by them, but this is very debatable. It does seem certain that like his father, Amenhotep III, Akhenaten named at least one daughter as [[Great Royal Wife]], but this does not necessarily indicate she was his sexual consort as the position was also an important ceremonial position.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, G.; ''Women in Ancient Egypt'', [[Harvard University Press]] (1993) p 21-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* Meritaten is recorded as Great Royal Wife to Smenkhkare in the tomb of Meryre II in Akhet-Aten. She is also listed alongside King Akhenaten and King Neferneferuaten as Great Royal Wife on a box from the tomb of Tutankhamen. Letters written to Akhenaten from foreign rulers make reference to Meritaten as 'mistress of the house'.
* Meketaten, Akhenaten's second daughter. Meketaten's death, at perhaps the age of 10 to 12, is recorded in the royal tombs of Amarna about the year 13 or 14. Her death was attributed to possibly from childbirth, because of a depiction of an infant with her. Because no husband is known for Meketaten, the assumption has been that Akhenaten was the father. The inscription giving the filiation of the child is damaged, thereby preventing resolution of the issue; alternate explanations proposed have been that Meketaten died of plague, or that the child is a portrayal of Meketaten's ka (soul). 
* Various monuments, originally for Kiya, were reinscribed for Akhenaten's daughters Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten; the revised inscriptions list a Meritaten-tasherit ("junior") and an Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit. Some view this to indicate that Akhenaten fathered his own grandchildren. Others hold that, since these grandchildren are not attested to elsewhere, they are fictions invented to fill the space originally filled by Kiya's child.&lt;ref&gt;, Aidan Dodson &amp; Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson (2004), p.154&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other lovers have been suggested, but are not widely accepted:

* Smenkhkare, Akhenaten's successor and/or co-ruler for the last years of his reign. Rather than a lover, however, Smenkhkare is likely to have been a half-brother or a son to Akhenaten. Some have even suggested that Smenkhkare was actually an alias of Nefertiti or Kiya, and therefore one of Akhenaten's wives (see below).
* Tiye, his mother. Twelve years after the death of Amenhotep III, she is still mentioned in inscriptions as queen and beloved of the king, but kings' mothers often were. The few supporters of this theory (notably [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]) consider Akhenaten to be the historical model of legendary King [[Oedipus]] of [[Thebes, Greece]] and Tiye the model for his mother/wife [[Jocasta]].

The [[Amarna Letters]], a cache of diplomatic correspondence discovered in modern times at el-Amarna (the modern designation of the site of [[Akhetaten]]), have provided important evidence about Akhenaten's reign and foreign policy. This correspondence comprises a priceless collection of incoming messages on clay tablets sent to Akhetaten from various subject rulers through Egyptian military outposts and from the foreign rulers (recognized as "Great Kings") of the kingdom of [[Mitanni]], of Babylon, of Assyria, and of Hatti. The governors and kings of Egypt's subject domains also wrote frequently to plead for gold from the pharaoh, and also complained that he had snubbed and cheated them.

Early in his reign, Akhenaten had conflicts with [[Tushratta]], the king of Mitanni, who had courted favor with his father against the Hittites. Tushratta complains in numerous letters that Akhenaten had sent him gold-plated statues rather than statues made of solid gold; the statues formed part of the bride-price which Tushratta received for letting his daughter [[Tadukhepa]] marry Amenhotep III and then later marry Akhenaten. Amarna letter EA 27 preserves a complaint by Tushratta to Akhenaten about the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I...asked your father [[Amenhotep III|Mimmureya]] for statues of solid cast gold, one of myself and a second statue, a statue of Tadu-Heba [Tadukhepa], my daughter, and your father said, 'Don't talk of giving statues just of solid cast gold. I will give you ones made also of lapis lazuli. I will give you too, along with the statues, much additional gold and [other] goods beyond measure.' Every one of my messengers that were staying in Egypt saw the gold for the statues with their own eyes. Your father himself recast the statues [i]n the presence of my messengers, and he made them entirely of pure gold...He showed much additional gold, which was beyond measure and which he was sending to me. He said to my messengers, 'See with your own eyes, here the statues, there much gold and goods beyond measure, which I am sending to my brother.' And my messengers did see with their own eyes! But my brother [i.e., Akhenaten] has not sent the solid [gold] statues that your father was going to send. You have sent plated ones of wood. Nor have you sent me the goods that your father was going to send me, but you have reduced [them] greatly. Yet there is nothing I know of in which I have failed my brother. Any day that I hear the greetings of my brother, that day I make a festive occasion... May my brother send me much gold. [At] the kim[ru fe]ast...[...with] many goods [may my] brother honor me. In my brother's country gold is as plentiful as dust. May my brother cause me no distress. May he send me much gold in order that my brother [with the gold and m]any [good]s may honor me." (EA 27)&lt;ref&gt;Moran (1992), pp.87-89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Akhenaten was certainly not a close friend of Tushratta, he was evidently concerned at the expanding power of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] Empire under its powerful ruler [[Suppiluliuma I]]. A successful Hittite attack on Mitanni and its ruler Tushratta would have disrupted the entire international balance of power in the Ancient Middle East at a time when Egypt had made peace with Mitanni; this would cause some of Egypt's vassals to switch their allegiances to the Hittites, as time would prove. A group of Egypt's allies who attempted to rebel against the Hittites were captured, and wrote letters begging Akhenaten for troops, but he did not respond to most of their pleas. Evidence suggests that the troubles on the northern frontier led to difficulties in [[Canaan]], particularly in a struggle for power between [[Labaya]] of [[Shechem]] and [[Abdi-Heba]] of [[Jerusalem]], which required the pharaoh to intervene in the area by dispatching [[Medjay]] troops northwards. Akhenaten pointedly refused to save his vassal [[Rib-Hadda]] of [[Byblos]] — whose kingdom was being besieged by the expanding state of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] under [[Abdi-Ashirta]] and later [[Aziru]], son of Abdi-Ashirta — despite Rib-Hadda's numerous pleas for help from the pharaoh. Rib-Hadda wrote a total of 60 letters to Akhenaten pleading for aid from the pharaoh. Akhenaten wearied of Rib-Hadda's constant correspondences and once told Rib-Hadda: "You are the one that writes to me more than all the (other) mayors" or Egyptian vassals in EA 124.&lt;ref&gt;Moran (1992), p.203&lt;/ref&gt; What Rib-Hadda did not comprehend was that the Egyptian king would not organize and dispatch an entire army north just to preserve the political status quo of several minor city states on the fringes of Egypt's Asiatic Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199906/correspondence.in.clay.htm |title=Akhenaten and Rib Hadda from Byblos |journal=Saudi Aramco World |volume=50 |issue=6 |date=November–December 1999 |first=Barbara |last=Ross |pages=30–35 |access-date=2013-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113125402/http://saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199906/correspondence.in.clay.htm |archive-date=2010-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rib-Hadda would pay the ultimate price; his exile from Byblos due to a coup led by his brother [[Ili-Rapih|Ilirabih]] is mentioned in one letter. When Rib-Hadda appealed in vain for aid from Akhenaten and then turned to Aziru, his sworn enemy, to place him back on the throne of his city, Aziru promptly had him dispatched to the king of Sidon, where Rib-Hadda was almost certainly executed.&lt;ref name="bryce186"&gt;Bryce (1998), p.186&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William L. Moran]]&lt;ref&gt;Moran, (William L.) The Amarna Letters, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1992. p.xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the Amarna corpus of 380+ letters counters the conventional view that Akhenaten neglected Egypt's foreign territories in favour of his internal reforms. Several letters from Egyptian vassals notify the pharaoh that they have followed his instructions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the king, my lord, my god, my Sun, the Sun from the sky: Message of Yapahu, the ruler of [[Gezer|Gazru]], your servant, the dirt at your feet. I indeed prostrate myself at the feet of the king, my lord, my god, my Sun...7 times and 7 times, on the stomach and on the back. I am indeed guarding the place of the king, my lord, the Sun of the sky, where I am, and all the things the king, my lord, has written me, I am indeed carrying out — everything! Who am I, a dog, and what is my house... and what is anything I have, that the orders of the king, my lord, the Sun from the sky, should not obey constantly?'' (EA 378)&lt;ref&gt;Moran (2003) pp.368-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the loyal but unfortunate Rib-Hadda was killed at the instigation of Aziru,&lt;ref name="bryce186"/&gt; Akhenaten sent an angry letter to Aziru containing a barely veiled accusation of outright treachery on the latter's part.&lt;ref&gt;Moran (1992), pp.248-250&lt;/ref&gt; Akhenaten wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Say to Aziru, ruler of Amurru: Thus the king, your lord [Akhenaten], saying: The ruler of Gubla [Byblos], whose brother had cast him away at the gate, said to you, "Take me and get me into the city. There is much silver, and I will give it to you. Indeed there is an abundance of everything, but not with me [here]." Thus did the ruler [Rib-Hadda] speak to you. Did you not write to the king, my lord saying, "I am your servant like all the previous mayors [i.e., vassals] in his city"? Yet you acted delinquently by taking the mayor whose brother had cast him away at the gate, from his city.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Amenhotep.jpg|thumb|upright|left|&lt;center&gt;Head of Akhenaten&lt;/center&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He [Rib-Hadda] was residing in [[Sidon]] and, following your own judgment, you gave him to [some] mayors. Were you ignorant of the treacherousness of the men? If you really are the king's servant, why did you not denounce him before the king, your lord, saying, "This mayor has written to me saying, 'Take me to yourself and get me into my city'"? And if you did act loyally, still all the things you wrote were not true. In fact, the king has reflected on them as follows, "Everything you have said is not friendly."

Now the king has heard as follows, "You are at peace with the ruler of Qidsa. ([[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]) The two of you take food and strong drink together." And it is true. Why do you act so? Why are you at peace with a ruler whom the king is fighting? And even if you did act loyally, you considered your own judgment, and his judgment did not count. You have paid no attention to the things that you did earlier. What happened to you among them that you are not on the side of the king, your lord? Consider the people that are training you for their own advantage. They want to throw you into the fire...If for any reason whatsoever you prefer to do evil, and if you plot evil, treacherous things, then you, together with your entire family, shall die by the axe of the king. So perform your service for the king, your lord, and you will live. You yourself know that the king does not fail when he rages against all of Canaan. And when you wrote saying, 'May the king, my Lord, give me leave this year, and then I will go next year to the king, my Lord [i.e., to Egypt]. If this is impossible, I will send my son in my place' — the king, your lord, let you off this year in accordance with what you said. Come yourself, or send your son [now], and you will see the king at whose sight all lands live. (EA 162)&lt;ref&gt;Moran (1992), pp.248-249&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This letter shows that Akhenaten paid close attention to the affairs of his vassals in Canaan and Syria. Akhenaten commanded Aziru to come to Egypt and proceeded to detain him there for at least one year. In the end, Akhenaten was forced to release Aziru back to his homeland when the Hittites advanced southwards into [[Amqu|Amki]], thereby threatening Egypt's series of Asiatic vassal states, including Amurru.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1998), p.188&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after his return to Amurru, Aziru defected to the Hittite side with his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1998), p.p.189&lt;/ref&gt; While it is known from an Amarna letter by Rib-Hadda that the Hittites "seized all the countries that were vassals of the king of Mitanni" (EA 75)&lt;ref&gt;Moran (1992), p.145&lt;/ref&gt; Akhenaten managed to preserve Egypt's control over the core of her Near Eastern Empire (which consisted of present-day Israel as well as the Phoenician coast) while avoiding conflict with the increasingly powerful Hittite Empire of [[Suppiluliuma I]]. Only the Egyptian border province of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] in Syria around the Orontes river was permanently lost to the Hittites when its ruler Aziru defected to the Hittites. Finally, contrary to the conventional view of a ruler who neglected Egypt's international relations, Akhenaten is known to have initiated at least one campaign into [[Nubia]] in his regnal Year 12, where his campaign is mentioned in Amada stela CG 41806 and on a separate companion stela at [[Buhen]].&lt;ref&gt;Schulman (1982), pp.299-316&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, it was announced that a '''Year 16 III [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]] day 15''' inscription dated explicitly to Akhenaten's reign which mentions, in the same breath, the presence of a living Queen Nefertiti, was found in a limestone quarry at [[Deir el-Bersha]] just north of Amarna.&lt;ref&gt;Athena Van der Perre, "Nofretetes (vorerst) letzte dokumentierte Erwähnung," in: Im Licht von Amarna - 100 Jahre Fund der Nofretete.

Akhenaten planned to relocate Egyptian burials on the east side of the Nile (sunrise) rather than on the west side (sunset) to the [[Royal Wadi and tombs|Royal Wadi]] in Akhetaten.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} His body was removed after the court returned to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and recent genetic tests have confirmed that the body found buried in tomb [[KV55]] was the father of [[Tutankhamun]], and is therefore "most probably" Akhenaten,&lt;ref&gt;Hawass, Zahi et al. "Ancestry and Pathology in King Tutankhamun's Family" &lt;cite&gt;The Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/cite&gt; p.644&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb contained numerous Amarna era objects, including a royal funerary mask which had been deliberately destroyed. His sarcophagus was destroyed but has  been reconstructed and now sits outside in the [[Cairo Museum]].

Similarly, although it is accepted that Akhenaten himself died in Year 17 of his reign, the question of whether Smenkhkare became co-regent perhaps two or three years earlier or enjoyed a brief independent reign is unclear.&lt;ref name="allenp5"&gt;Allen (2006), p.5&lt;/ref&gt; If Smenkhkare outlived Akhenaten, and became sole pharaoh, he likely ruled Egypt for less than a year. The next successor was [[Neferneferuaten]], a female pharaoh who reigned in Egypt for two years and one month.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss and David Warburton (editors), Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill: 2006, pp.207 &amp; 493&lt;/ref&gt; She was, in turn, probably succeeded by Tutankhaten (later, Tutankhamun), with the country being administered by the chief [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], and future pharaoh, [[Ay]]. Tutankhamun was believed to be a younger brother of Smenkhkare and a son of Akhenaten, and possibly Kiya although one scholar has suggested that Tutankhamun may have been a son of Smenkhkare instead. DNA tests in 2010 indicated Tutankhamun was indeed the son of Akhenaten.&lt;ref name="associated"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=9850747 |title=A Frail King Tut Died From Malaria, Broken Leg - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218121628/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=9850747 |archivedate=February 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that after the death of Akhenaten, Nefertiti reigned with the name of Neferneferuaten&lt;ref&gt;''Pocket Guides: Egypt History'', p.37, Dorling Kindersley, London 1996.''(the Neferneferuaten part is taken from Wikipedia [[Nefertiti]] entry)''&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars believe this female ruler was rather Meritaten. The so-called [[Coregency Stela]], found in a tomb in [[Amarna]] possibly shows his queen [[Nefertiti]] as his coregent, ruling alongside him, but this is not certain as the names have been removed and recarved to show Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nicholasreeves.com/item.aspx?category=Writing&amp;id=71|title=Book Review: Rolf Krauss, Das Ende der Amarnazeit (Hildesheimer Ägyptologische Beiträge, 1978)|accessdate=2008-10-02|author=Nicholas Reeves|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531232226/http://www.nicholasreeves.com/item.aspx?category=Writing&amp;id=71|archivedate=2009-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2013}}

With Akhenaten's death, the Aten cult he had founded fell out of favor: at first gradually, and then with decisive finality. Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun in Year 2 of his reign (1332 BC) and abandoned the city of Akhetaten, which eventually fell into ruin. His successors Ay and [[Horemheb]] disassembled temples Akhenaten had built, including the temple at Thebes, using them as a source of easily available building materials and decorations for their own temples.

Finally, Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten, Smenkhkare, Tutankhamun, and Ay were excised from the official lists of pharaohs, which instead reported that Amenhotep III was immediately succeeded by Horemheb. This is thought to be part of an attempt by Horemheb to delete all trace of Atenism and the pharaohs associated with it from the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua J. Mark. "Horemheb," Ancient History Encyclopedia. Last modified April 22, 2014. http://www.ancient.eu/Horemheb/&lt;/ref&gt; Akhenaten's name does not appear on any of the king lists compiled by later pharaohs and it was not until the late 19th century that his identity was re-discovered and the surviving traces of his reign were unearthed by archaeologists.

The Inscription of Mes document which dates to Ramesside times refers to Akhenaten himself as "the enemy of Akhetaton" as Egyptians had fully rejected his revolution by this time and the crisis which it sparked.&lt;ref&gt;Alan H. Gardiner, The Inscriptions of Mes, A Contribution to the Study of Egyptian Judicial Procedure, J. C. Hinrichs publishers, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation of Atenism and later collapse==

In the early years of his reign, Amenhotep IV lived at Thebes with Nefertiti and his six daughters. Initially, he permitted worship of Egypt's traditional deities to continue but near the [[Temple of Karnak]] (Amun-Ra's great cult center), he erected several massive buildings including temples to the [[Aten]]. Aten was usually depicted as a sun disk with rays extending with long arms and tiny human hands at each end.&lt;ref&gt;Molefi Kete Asante and Ama Mazama, ''Encyclopedia of African Religion'' (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
These buildings at Thebes were later dismantled by his successors and used as infill for new constructions in the Temple of Karnak; when they were later dismantled by archaeologists, some 36,000 decorated blocks from the original Aton building here were revealed which preserve many elements of the original relief scenes and inscriptions.&lt;ref name="rosalie125"&gt;David (1998), p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Akhenaten as a Sphinx (Kestner Museum).jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Akhenaten depicted as a [[sphinx]] at [[Amarna]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Year 5 of his reign, Amenhotep IV took decisive steps to establish the Aten as the sole god of Egypt: the pharaoh "disbanded the priesthoods of all the other gods...and diverted the income from these [other] cults to support the Aten". To emphasize his complete allegiance to the [[Aten]], the king officially changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Akhenaten or 'Living Spirit of Aten.'&lt;ref name="rosalie125"/&gt; Akhenaten's fifth year also marked the beginning of construction on his new capital, [[Akhetaten]] or 'Horizon of Aten', at the site known today as [[Amarna]]. Very soon afterwards, he centralized Egyptian religious practices in Akhetaten, though construction of the city seems to have continued for several more years. In honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt. In these new temples, Aten was worshipped in the open sunlight rather than in dark temple enclosures as had been the previous custom. Akhenaten is also believed to have composed the [[Great Hymn to the Aten]].

Initially, Akhenaten presented Aten as a variant of the familiar supreme deity Amun-Re (itself the result of an earlier rise to prominence of the cult of Amun, resulting in Amun's becoming merged with the sun god [[Ra]]), in an attempt to put his ideas in a familiar Egyptian religious context. However, by Year 9 of his reign, Akhenaten declared that Aten was not merely the supreme god, but the only worshipable god, and that he, Akhenaten, was the only intermediary between Aten and his people. He ordered the defacing of Amun's temples throughout Egypt and, in a number of instances, inscriptions of the plural 'gods' were also removed.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

From Amarna, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]
Aten's name also is written differently after Year 9 to emphasize the radicalism of the new regime, which included a ban on [[Cult image|images]], with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten, who by then was evidently considered not merely a sun god, but rather a universal deity. Representations of the Aten were always accompanied with a sort of hieroglyphic footnote, stating that the representation of the sun as all-encompassing creator was to be taken as just that: a representation of something that, by its very nature as something transcending creation, cannot be fully or adequately represented by any one part of that creation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Archaeological discoveries at Akhetaten show that many ordinary residents of this city chose to gouge or chisel out all references to the god Amun on even minor personal items that they owned, such as commemorative scarabs or make-up pots, perhaps for fear of being accused of having Amunist sympathies. References to Amenhotep III, Akhenaten's father, were partly erased since they contained the traditional Amun form of his name: Nebmaatre Amunhotep.&lt;ref name="Nicholas Reeves 2001, pp.154-55"&gt;Nicholas Reeves, Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001, pp.154-55&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Egytologist Nicholas Reeves writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Such displays of frightening self-censorship and toadying loyalty are ominous indicators of the paranoia which was beginning to grip the country. Not only were the streets [of Akhetaten] filled with the pharaoh's soldiers; it seems the population now had to contend with the danger of malicious informers.&lt;ref name="Nicholas Reeves 2001, pp.154-55"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the end, Akhenaten's revolution collapsed from within after his death since the massive costs of founding a new capital city at El-Amarna and the closing of the Amun temples choked off the growth of the Egyptian economy. A notable result of Akhenaten's centralisation tendencies was the appearance of large-scale corruption among the king's state officials who held unprecedented control over all the wealth and produce of Egypt. This was a tendency that the last 18th Dynasty pharaoh [[Horemheb]] was compelled to deal with by threatening to cut off the nose of any officials who were found to be involved in state corruption or abuses in a major stela erected near the 10th pylon of [[Karnak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/edict_of_horemheb.htm The Great Edict of Horemheb] by J. H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, (1906) Part Three, §§ 50 to 67&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolas Grimal states that Akhenaten's closure or limitations on the activities of non-Aten temples and his confiscation of priestly goods for the benefit of the state directly led:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to an increase in centralization of both the administration and its executive arm, the army. The neglect of local government increased the problems of maintaining an effective administration and introduced a whole new [state] system characterized by corruption and arbitrariness... The construction of the new capital [at Akhetaten] and new temples was to the detriment of the economy in general and the temple-based economy in particular: the system of divine estates was, from a centralizing viewpoint, harmful, but its abandonment in the Amarna period led to the ruination of a whole [economic] system of production and distribution without providing any new structure to replace it.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, 1992 English edition, Blackwell Publishers Ltd., p.232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Speculative theories==
[[File:Akhenaten trial piece.jpg|thumb|left|Sculptor's trial piece of Akhenaten.]]
Akhenaten's status as a religious revolutionary has led to much [[speculative reason|speculation]], ranging from scholarly hypotheses to non-academic [[fringe science|fringe]] theories. Although some believe the religion he introduced was mostly monotheistic, many others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten [[monolatry]],&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Montserrat, ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt'', Routledge 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-18549-1}}, pp.36ff.&lt;/ref&gt; as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but the Aten while expecting the people to worship not Aten but him.

===Akhenaten and monotheism in Abrahamic religions===
The idea of Akhenaten as the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars.&lt;ref name="freud"&gt;Freud, S. (1939). Moses and Monotheism: Three Essays.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunther Siegmund Stent, ''Paradoxes of Free Will''. [[American Philosophical Society]], DIANE, 2002. 284 pages. Pages 34 - 38. {{ISBN|0-87169-926-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Assmann, ''Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism''. [[Harvard University Press]], 1997. 288 pages. {{ISBN|0-674-58739-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Shupak, ''The Monotheism of Moses and the Monotheism of Akhenaten''. Sevivot, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "mont"&gt;Montserrat, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albright | first1 = William F. | year = 1973 | title = From the Patriarchs to Moses II. Moses out of Egypt | url = | journal = The Biblical Archaeologist | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 48–76 | doi = 10.2307/3211050 | jstor = 3211050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to mention this was [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], in his book ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, Volume XXIII (1937-1939)'', "Moses and monotheism". London: [[Hogarth Press]], 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his arguments on a belief that the Exodus story was historical, Freud argued that Moses had been an Atenist priest forced to leave Egypt with his followers after Akhenaten's death. Freud argued that Akhenaten was striving to promote monotheism, something that the biblical Moses was able to achieve.&lt;ref name="freud"/&gt; Following his book, the concept entered popular consciousness and serious research.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Chaney]], 'Freudian Egypt', ''The London Magazine'', April/May 2006, pp. 62-69 and idem,'Egypt in England and America: The Cultural Memorials of Religion, Royalty and Revolution', in ''Sites of Exchange: European Crossroads and Faultlines'', eds. M. Ascari and A. Corrado (Amsterdam, Rodopi, 2006), pp. 39-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud commented on the connection between Adonai, the Egyptian Aten and the Syrian divine name of Adonis as a primeval unity of language between the factions;&lt;ref name="freud"/&gt; in this he was following the argument of Egyptologist [[Arthur Weigall]]. [[Jan Assmann]]'s opinion is that 'Aten' and 'Adonai' are not linguistically related.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann, Jan. (1997). ''Moses the Egyptian''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; pp. 23-24, fn. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely accepted that there are strong stylistic similarities between Akhenaten's [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] and the [[Book of Psalms|Biblical Psalm]] [[Psalm 104|104]], though this form is found widespread in ancient Near Eastern hymnology both before and after the period.

Others have likened some aspects of Akhenaten's relationship with the Aten to the relationship, in Christian tradition, of [[Jesus Christ]] with God, particularly in interpretations that emphasize a more monotheistic interpretation of Atenism than henotheistic. [[Donald B. Redford]] has noted that some have viewed Akhenaten as a harbinger of Jesus. "After  all, Akhenaten did call himself the son of the sole god: 'Thine only son that came forth from thy body'."&lt;ref name="redford"&gt;"The Monotheism of the Heretic Pharaoh: Precursor of Mosiac monotheism or Egyptian anomaly?", [[Donald B. Redford]], ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', May–June edition 1987&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Henry Breasted]] likened him to Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;"Creation and the persistence of evil", Jon Douglas Levenson, p. 60, [[Princeton University Press]], 1994, {{ISBN|0-691-02950-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur Weigall]] saw him as a failed precursor of Christ and [[Thomas Mann]] saw him "as right on the way and yet not the right one for the way".&lt;ref&gt;''Akhenaten and the religion of light'', Erik Hornung, David Lorton, p. 14, [[Cornell University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8725-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redford argued that while Akhenaten called himself the son of the Sun-Disc and acted as the chief mediator between god and creation, kings for thousands of years before Akhenaten's time had claimed the same relationship and priestly role. However Akhenaten's case may be different through the emphasis placed on the heavenly father and son relationship. Akhenaten described himself as "thy son who came forth from thy limbs", "thy child", "the eternal son that came forth from the Sun-Disc", and "thine only son that came forth from thy body".  The close relationship between father and son is such that only the king truly knows the heart of "his father", and in return his father listens to his son's prayers. He is his father's image on earth, and as Akhenaten is king on earth, his father is king in heaven. As high priest, prophet, king and divine he claimed the central position in the new religious system. Because only he knew his father's mind and will, Akhenaten alone could interpret that will for all mankind with true teaching coming only from him.&lt;ref name="redford"/&gt;

Redford concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before much of the archaeological evidence from Thebes and from Tell el-Amarna became available, wishful thinking sometimes turned Akhenaten into a humane teacher of the true God, a mentor of Moses, a christlike figure, a philosopher before his time. But these imaginary creatures are now fading away as the historical reality gradually emerges. There is little or no evidence to support the notion that Akhenaten was a progenitor of the full-blown monotheism that we find in the Bible. The monotheism of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament had its own separate development — one that began more than half a millennium after the pharaoh's death.&lt;ref&gt;"Aspects of Monotheism", Donald B. Redford, ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rather strange and eccentric portrayals of Akhenaten, with a sagging stomach, thick thighs, large breasts, and long, thin face — so different from the athletic norm in the portrayal of pharaohs — have led certain Egyptologists to suppose that Akhenaten suffered some kind of genetic abnormality. Various illnesses have been put forward. On the basis of his long jaw and his feminine appearance, [[Cyril Aldred]],&lt;ref&gt;Aldred, C. (1988). ''Akhenaten, King of Egypt''. (Thames and Hudson, Ltd.,)&lt;/ref&gt; following up earlier arguments of [[Grafton Elliot Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Smith, ''Tutankhamen and the discovery of his tomb by the late Earl of Canarvon and Mr Howard Carter'' (London: Routledge, 1923), pp. 83–88&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Strachey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strachey | first1 = J | year = 1939 | title = Preliminary Notes Upon the Problem of Akhenaten | url = | journal = Int. J. Psycho-Anal. | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 33–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested he may have suffered from [[Froelich's Syndrome]]. However, this is unlikely because this disorder results in [[Infertility|sterility]] and Akhenaten is known to have fathered numerous children. These children are repeatedly portrayed through years of archaeological and iconographic evidence — at least six daughters by Queen Nefertiti, well known as the King and Queen's six princesses of Amarna, as well as his successor [[Tutankhamun]] by a minor wife.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Another suggestion by Burridge&lt;ref&gt;Burridge, A., (1995) "Did Akhenaten Suffer From Marfan's Syndrome?" (Akhenaten Temple Project Newsletter No. 3, September 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; is that Akhenaten may have suffered from Marfan's Syndrome.  [[Marfan's syndrome]], unlike Froelich's, does not result in any lack of intelligence or sterility. It is associated with a sunken chest, long curved spider-like fingers ([[arachnodactyly]]), occasional congenital heart difficulties, a high curved or slightly cleft palate, and a highly curved cornea or dislocated lens of the eye, with the requirement for bright light to see well.

Recent CT scans of [[Tutankhamun]] report a [[cleft palate]] and a fairly long head, as well as an abnormal curvature of the spine and fusion of the upper vertebrae, a condition associated with [[scoliosis]], all conditions associated with Marfan's syndrome. However, DNA tests on Tutankhamun, in 2010, proved negative for Marfan Syndrome.&lt;ref name="Schemm, PaulAssociated Press 3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2010-02-16-king-tut_N.htm|title=Frail boy-king Tut died from malaria, broken leg|last=Schemm|first=Paul|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3065140 BBC.co.uk]. Retrieved June 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Homocystinuria]] was suggested as a possible diagnosis.&lt;ref name=" pmid = 20402329 "&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cavka M, Kelava T | title = Homocystinuria, a possible solution of the Akhenaten's mystery | journal = Coll Antropol. | volume = 34 | issue = |date=March 2010 | pmid = 20402329 | url =  http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/79191 | pages = 255–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients suffering from homocystinuria have Marfan habitus. However, as an autosomal recessive disease, it seems to fit better into Akhenaten's family tree — Akhenaten's parents, Amenhotep III and Tiye, were probably healthy, and Marfan Syndrome was ruled out following DNA tests on Tutankhamun in 2010.&lt;ref name="Schemm, PaulAssociated Press 3"/&gt;

However, [[Dominic Montserrat]] in ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt'' states that "there is now a broad consensus among Egyptologists that the exaggerated forms of Akhenaten's physical portrayal... are not to be read literally".&lt;ref name = "mont"/&gt; Montserrat and others&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Nicholas (2005) "Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet" (Thames and Hudson)&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the body-shape relates to some form of religious symbolism. Because the god Aten was referred to as "the mother and father of all humankind" it has been suggested that Akhenaten was made to look [[androgynous]] in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the god. This required "a symbolic gathering of all the attributes of the creator god into the physical body of the king himself", which will "display on earth the Aten's multiple life-giving functions".&lt;ref name = "mont"/&gt; Akhenaten did refer to himself as "The Unique One of Re", and he may have used his control of artistic expression to distance himself from the common people, though such a radical departure from the idealized traditional representation of the image of the pharaoh would be truly extraordinary.

&lt;!-- A – A 'fat' AIII or old Nefertiti are not "unrealistically stylized" if they are in fact fat or old.  Quite the contrary, it seems like Living In Truth.
B – I don't know of any depictions of him without headgear of some sort to support the "Furthermore..." portion without any citations (OR/NPOV) or clarification.
C – Note sure how A supports B, or how they relate at all.

Representations of other persons than Akhenaten in the 'Amarna style' are equally unrealistically stylized — for example, a carving of his father Amenhotep III as an overweight figure;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1998), p.91&lt;/ref&gt; Nefertiti is shown in some statues as well past her prime, with a severe face and a stomach swollen by repeated pregnancies.
Furthermore, we also possess many representations of Akhenaten where he is portrayed with a very rounded and not unusually shaped head{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}. Therefore, we should not presume the exaggerated images to be accurate, whilst failing to note the many realistic portrayals.
--&gt;
Another unfounded claim was made by [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], who hypothesized an incestuous relationship with his mother, Tiye. Velikovsky also posited that Akhenaten had swollen legs. Based on this, he identified Akhenaten as the history behind the [[Oedipus]] myth, Oedipus being Greek for "swollen feet", and moved the setting from the [[Greek Thebes]] to the [[Egyptian Thebes]]. As part of his argument, Velikovsky uses the fact that Akhenaten viciously carried out a campaign to erase the name of his father, which he argues could have developed into Oedipus killing his father.&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Velikovsky, ''Oedipus and Akhnaton, Myth and History'', Doubleday, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at [[Imperial College London]], published research into the early death of Akhenaten and the premature deaths of other 18th Dynasty pharaohs (including Tutankhamun and Thutmose IV). He identifies that their early deaths were probably a result of a [[temporal lobe epilepsy|Familial Temporal Epilepsy]]. This would account for the untimely death of Akhenaten, his abnormal endocrine body shape on sculptures and can also explain Akhenaten's religious conviction due to this type of epilepsy's association with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashrafian |first=Hutan |title=Familial epilepsy in the pharaohs of ancient Egypt's 18th Dynasty |journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |date=September 2012 |pages=23–31 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2012.06.014 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525505012004441 |subscription=yes |pmid=22980077}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because there is currently no definitive genetic test for epilepsy, the theory remains impossible to prove.&lt;ref&gt;Locker, Melissa. "Did King Tutankhamen Die From Epilepsy?" Time. 12 Sept. 2013. http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/09/13/did-king-tutankhamen-die-from-epilepsy/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smenkhkare===
{{Main|Smenkhkare}}
Various uninscribed and damaged stelae depict Akhenaten with what appears to be a coregent wearing a king's crown in familiar if not intimate settings (even naked). Since Smenkhkare was known to be a male, this led to the speculation that Akhenaten was homosexual. These notions were discarded once the coregent was identified as a female, most likely his wife.

In the 1970s, John Harris identified the figure pictured alongside Akhenaten as Nefertiti, arguing that she may have actually been elevated to coregent and perhaps even succeeded temporarily as an independent ruler, changing her name to Smenkhkare.&lt;ref name = "mont"/&gt;

Nicholas Reeves and other Egyptologists contend that Smenkhkare was the same person as [[Neferneferuaten]], who ruled together with Akhenaten as coregent for the final one or two years of Akhenaten's reign. On several monuments, the two are shown seated side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Reeves and Richard H. Wilkinson, ''The Complete Valley of the Kings''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent research by James Allen&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Allen, "Nefertiti and Smenkh-ka-re", GM 141 (1994), pp.7-17&lt;/ref&gt; and Marc Gabolde&lt;ref&gt;Gabolde, Marc. D'Akhenaton à Tout-ânkhamon, 1998; pp 156-157&lt;/ref&gt; has led to "a fair degree of consensus"&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J; Amarna Age Chronology and the Identity of Nibhururiya in Altoriental. Forsch. 34 (2007); p 272&lt;/ref&gt; that Neferneferuaten was a female ruler apart from Smenkhkare.

'''''Anadenanthera''''' is a genus of [[South America]]n trees in the [[Legume]] family, [[Fabaceae]]. The genus contains two to four species, including ''[[Anadenanthera colubrina|A. colubrina]]'' and ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina|A. peregrina]]''. These trees respectively are known to the western world primarily as sources of the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] snuffs [[Anadenanthera colubrina|Vilca]]/Cebil and [[Yopo]]/Cohoba.

The main active constituent of ''Anadenanthera'' is [[bufotenin]].

'''Anton Szandor LaVey'''&lt;ref name="rollingstone-1991"&gt;Wright, Lawrence – "It's Not Easy Being Evil in a World That's Gone to Hell", Rolling Stone, September 5, 1991: 63–68, 105–16.&lt;/ref&gt; (born '''Howard Stanton Levey'''; April 11, 1930 – October 29, 1997) was an American author, musician and [[occultist]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Harrington, Walt. "Anton LaVey America's Satanic Master of Devils, Magic, Music, and Madness". ''[[The Washington Post Magazine]]'', February 23, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of the [[Church of Satan]] and the religion of [[LaVeyan Satanism]]. He authored several books, including ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', ''[[The Satanic Rituals]]'', ''[[The Satanic Witch]]'', ''[[The Devil's Notebook]]'', and ''[[Satan Speaks!]]'' In addition, he released three albums, including ''[[The Satanic Mass]]'', ''[[Satan Takes a Holiday]]'', and ''[[Strange Music (album)|Strange Music]]''. He played a minor on-screen role and served as technical advisor for the 1975 film ''[[The Devil's Rain]]''{{sfn|The Devil on Screen: Feature Films Worldwide, 1913 through 2000|Charles P. Mitchell|2010|page=102}} and served as host and narrator for [[Nick Bougas]]' 1989 [[mondo film]] ''[[Death Scenes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Horror Film |editor-last=Prince |editor-first=Stephen |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=9780813533636 |first=Mikita |last=Brottman |chapter=Carnivalizing the Taboo |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaVey was the subject of numerous articles in news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', ''[[McCall's]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and men's magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as ''[[Joe Pyne Show|The Joe Pyne Show]]'', ''[[The Phil Donahue Show|Donahue]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', and in two feature-length documentaries: ''[[Satanis]]'' in 1970 and ''[[Speak of the Devil: The Canon of Anton LaVey]]'' in 1993. Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including ''The Devil's Avenger'' by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974, and ''[[The Secret Life of a Satanist]]'' by [[Blanche Barton]], published in 1990. 

Historian of Satanism Gareth J. Medway described LaVey as a "born showman",{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=21}} with anthropologist [[Jean La Fontaine]] describing him as a "colourful figure of considerable personal magnetism".{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} Academic scholars of Satanism Per Faxneld and Jesper Aa. Petersen described LaVey as "the most iconic figure in the Satanic milieu".{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=79}} LaVey was labeled many things by journalists, religious detractors and Satanists alike, including "The Father of Satanism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1ovVPyL6AmwC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=father+of+modern+satanism+lavey#v=onepage&amp;q=father%20of%20modern%20satanism%20lavey&amp;f=false |title=Contemporary Religious Satanism |isbn=9780754652861 |last1=Petersen |first1=Jesper Aagaard |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "St. Paul of Satanism", {{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=5}} "The Black Pope",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Anton-LaVey-Church-of-Satan-founder-3309154.php |title=Anton LaVey, Church of Satan founder |work=SFGate|date=1997-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "evilest man in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/rolling%20stone/920S-000-004.html |title=ROLLING STONE – SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL – 920S-000-004 |work=maryellenmark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

LaVey was born Howard Stanton Levey in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. His father, Michael Joseph Levey (1903–1992), from Chicago, Illinois, married LaVey's mother, the former Gertrude Augusta Coultron, who was born to a Russian father and mother, who had immigrated to [[Ohio]] in 1893; both became [[naturalized citizen|naturalized American citizens]] in 1900. LaVey's family moved to California, where he spent his early life in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. His parents supported his musical interests, as he tried a number of instruments; his favorites were keyboards such as the [[pipe organ]] and the [[Calliope (music)|calliope]]. He did covers of instrumentals like "[[Harlem Nocturne]]" by [[Earle Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|6FEV2F55g6A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Tamalpais High School]] in [[Mill Valley, California]], until the age of 16.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hatfield |first=Larry D. |title=Anton LaVey, Church of Satan founder |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Anton-LaVey-Church-of-Satan-founder-3309154.php |accessdate=January 3, 2013 |date=November 7, 1997 |newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stafford&gt;{{cite news |last=Stafford |first=Matthew (Tam 1978) |title=Cool for school: For 100 years, it's been one Tam thing after another... |url=http://www.pacificsun.com/story.php?story_id=2313 |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |newspaper=Pacific Sun |date=August 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314024245/http://www.pacificsun.com/story.php?story_id=2313 |archivedate=March 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LaVey claimed he left high school to join a [[circus]] and later [[carnival]]s, first as a [[roustabout]] and cage boy in an act with the big cats, then as a musician playing the calliope. LaVey later claimed to have seen that many of the same men attended both the bawdy Saturday night shows and the [[tent revival]] meetings on Sunday mornings, which reinforced his increasingly cynical view of religion. In the [[foreword]] to the German language edition of ''The Satanic Bible'', he cites this as the impetus to defy [[Christianity|Christian religion]] as he knew it. He explains why church-goers employ double moral standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaVey |first=Anton Szandor |title=Die Satanische Bible (Satanic Bible) |year=1999 |publisher=Second Sight Books |location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, journalist [[Lawrence Wright]] investigated LaVey's background and found no evidence LaVey ever worked in a circus either as a musician or a cage boy.&lt;ref name="rollingstone-1991"/&gt;

His "genius" on keyboards later garnered him work as an organist in bars, lounges and nightclubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Lloyd |title=Bright Lights |work=San Mateo Times |date=September 11, 1959 |page=17 |quote="Anton La Vey, genius of the calliope and organ entertains Sunday afternoon and evenings"}}&lt;/ref&gt; While playing organ in Los Angeles [[American burlesque|burlesque]] houses, he allegedly had a brief affair with then-unknown [[Marilyn Monroe]], when she was a dancer at the [[Mayan Theater]]. This is challenged by those who then knew Monroe, as well as the manager of the Mayan, Paul Valentine, who said she had never been one of his dancers, nor had the theater ever been used as a burlesque house.&lt;ref name="chuch"&gt;''The Church of Satan'' by Michael Aquino p. 17–19, detailing information from Harry Lipton, Monroe's agent, Paul Valentine and Edward Webber.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his biography, LaVey moved back to San Francisco, where he worked for three years as a photographer for the [[San Francisco Police Department]] (SFPD). He dabbled as a [[psychic investigator]], looking into "800 calls" referred to him by SFPD. Later biographers questioned whether LaVey ever worked with the SFPD, as there are no records substantiating the claim.&lt;ref name="rollingstone-1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James R. |title=Legitimating New Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdYSdts1udcC&amp;pg=PA109 |page=109 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0813533247}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, LaVey was friends with a number of writers associated with ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine; a picture of him with George Haas, [[Robert Barbour Johnson]] and [[Clark Ashton Smith]] appears in [[Blanche Barton]]'s biography ''The Secret Life of a Satanist''.

In 1950, LaVey met Carole Lansing, and they married the following year. Lansing gave birth to LaVey's first daughter, [[Karla LaVey]], born in 1952. They divorced in 1960, after LaVey became entranced by [[Diane Hegarty]]. Hegarty and LaVey never married; however, she was his companion for 25 years and mothered his second daughter, [[Zeena Schreck|Zeena Galatea Schreck (''nee'' LaVey)]], in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Don|last= Lattin|authorlink= |author2= |title=Satan's Den in Great Disrepair |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F1999%2F01%2F25%2FMN77329.DTL |quote=Both Karla LaVey {{sic}} and Schreck were the product of LaVey's common-law marriage to Diane Hegarty from 1962 to 1986.

==Church of Satan==

Becoming a local celebrity through his [[paranormal]] research and live performances as an organist, including playing the [[Wurlitzer]] at the Lost Weekend cocktail lounge, he attracted many San Francisco notables to his parties. Guests included Carin de Plessin, [[Michael Harner]], [[Gavin Arthur|Chester A. Arthur III]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Fritz Leiber]], Cecil E. Nixon and [[Kenneth Anger]]. LaVey formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, which later evolved into the governing body of the Church of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/cos-order-of-trapezoid.php |title=The Magic Circle / Order of the Trapezoid |author=High Priest, Magus Peter H. Gilmore |work=churchofsatan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Faxneld and Petersen, the Church of Satan represented "the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organisation which propounded a coherent Satanic discourse".{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=81}}

LaVey began presenting Friday night lectures on the occult and rituals. A member of this circle suggested that he had the basis for a new religion. According to LaVey himself, on [[Walpurgisnacht]], April 30, 1966, he ritualistically [[head shaving|shaved his head]], allegedly "in the tradition of ancient executioners", declared the founding of the Church of Satan and proclaimed 1966 as "the Year One", Anno Satanas-the first year of the Age of [[Satan]] (it was later demonstrated that LaVey in fact shaved his head because he lost a bet and made up the "ancient executioners" story after the fact&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Anton LaVey Legend and Reality |url = http://www.churchofsatan.org/aslv.html |website = www.churchofsatan.org |accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;). LaVey's image has been described as "[[wikt:Mephistophelean|Mephistophelian]]".{{sfn|LIFE Magazine|Shana Alexander|Feb 17, 1967|p=31}} Media attention followed the subsequent Satanic wedding ceremony of journalist John Raymond to New York City socialite Judith Case on February 1, 1967. ''The [[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' were among the newspapers that printed articles dubbing him "The Black Pope". LaVey performed Satanic baptisms (including the first Satanic baptism in history for his three-year-old daughter Zeena, dedicating her to Satan and the Left-Hand Path, which garnered world-wide publicity and was originally recorded on ''The Satanic Mass'' LP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Satanic Mass/Zeena's Baptism Track A9 go to 3:42 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_M09vuLQAc&amp;NR=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Satanic Mass, Track A9 (Zeena's Baptism) |url=http://www.discogs.com/Anton-LaVey-The-Satanic-Mass/release/1166426 |publisher=Murgenstrumm, 1968 Vinly LP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanist Anton LaVey Baptising Daughter |url=http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/U1556387/satanist-anton-lavey-baptising-daughter |publisher=Bettmann/CORBIS |location=San Francisco, California, USA |date=May 23, 1967 |quote=LaVey [...] said the mystic ceremony was the first such baptism in history. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525095013/http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/U1556387/satanist-anton-lavey-baptising-daughter |archivedate=May 25, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clippings of Zeena's baptism world wide |url=http://zeena.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=109%3Apress-coverage-of-zeenas-baptism-1967-1968&amp;catid=41&amp;Itemid=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Satanic funerals (including one for naval machinist-repairman third-class Edward Olsen, complete with a chrome-helmeted [[Guard of honour|honor guard]]), and released a record album entitled ''[[The Satanic Mass]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, LaVey melded ideological influences from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Ayn Rand]],&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R. "[http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/mjr/lewis2.html Who Serves Satan? A Demographic and Ideological Profile]". ''Marburg Journal of Religion''. June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. L. Mencken]], and [[Social Darwinism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Satanism: The Feared Religion by Magus Peter Gilmore references Social Darwinism as a Satanic philosophy |url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanism-the-feared-religion.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ideology and ritual practices of the Church of Satan. He wrote essays introduced with reworked excerpts from Ragnar Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'' and concluded with "Satanized" versions of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]'s ''[[Enochian]] Keys'' to create books such as ''The Complete Witch'' (re-released in 1989 as ''[[The Satanic Witch]]''), and ''The Satanic Rituals''. The latter book also included rituals drawing on the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. ''The Satanic Bible'' included excerpts from Ragnar Redbeard's ''[[Might Is Right]]'' and concluded with "Satanized" versions of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]'s ''[[Enochian]] Keys''.{{sfn|Gallagher|2013|p=103}}
Admitting his use of ''Might is Right'', LaVey stated that he did so in order to "immortalize a writer who had profoundly reached me".{{sfn|Gallagher|2013|p=104}}

In 1972, the public work at LaVey's [[Black House (Church of Satan)|Black House]] in San Francisco was curtailed and work was continued via sanctioned regional "grottoes". In early 1975 LaVey announced that higher degrees of initiation could be given in return for a financial contribution.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=21}} In June 1975, editor of the Church's newsletter, Michael Aquino, left the Church of Satan and formed the theistic [[Temple of Set]] {{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=21–22}} claiming to take an unknown number of dissenters with him. The Church maintains this policy announcement was designed to "clean house" of members who didn't understand Satanic philosophy. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pretenders To The Throne |url=https://www.churchofsatan.com/pretenders-to-the-throne.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==

In July 1984, Hegarty issued a restraining order against LaVey, which he did not contest.{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=100}} LaVey's third and final companion was Blanche Barton. On November 1, 1993, Barton gave birth to Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey. Barton succeeded LaVey as the head of the Church after his death and has since stepped down from that role and handed it to Magus [[Peter H. Gilmore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.churchofsatan.com/history-peter-h-gilmore/ | title=Peter H. Gilmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anton LaVey died on October 29, 1997, in [[St. Mary's Medical Center (San Francisco)|St. Mary's Medical Center]] in San Francisco of [[pulmonary edema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author2= |title=Anton LaVey; Founded the Church of Satan |quote=Anton LaVey, who founded the Church of Satan in 1966 and wrote the "Satanic Bible" as a guide for international followers, has died at the age of 67. LaVey was cremated Tuesday after a satanic funeral at Woodlawn Memorial Chapel in Colma. Security concerns led his daughter, Church of Satan High Priestess Karla LaVey, to demand "absolute secrecy from all who knew of LaVey's death and satanic funeral," family spokesman Lee Houskeeper said. ... |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 8, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to St. Mary's, a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] hospital, because it was the closest available. A secret Satanic funeral, attended by invitation only, was held in [[Colma, California|Colma]], after which LaVey's body was [[cremated]].

Three months after his death, his estranged daughter [[Zeena Schreck]] and her husband [[Nikolas Schreck]] published a nine-page "fact sheet", in which they endorsed Wright's earlier allegations and claimed that many more of LaVey's stories about his life had been false.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=6}}

LaVey included references to other esoteric and religious groups throughout his writings, claiming for instance that the [[Yezidis]] and [[Knight's Templar]] were carriers of a Satanic tradition that had been passed down to the twentieth-century.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=78}} Scholar of Satanism Per Faxneld believed that these references were deliberately tongue-in-cheek and ironic, however he noted that many Satanists who had read LaVey's writings had taken them to be literal historical claims about the past.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=78}}{{sfnm|1a1=Faxneld|1y=2013|1pp=82-83|2a1=Dyrendel|2y=2013|2p=133}} Although he regularly derided older esotericists, LaVey also relied upon their work; for instance making use of [[John Dee]]'s Enochian system in ''The Satanic Bible''.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=79}} Faxneld therefore believed that there was a tension in LaVey's thought between his desire to establish prestigious Satanic predecessors and his desire to be seen as the founder of the first real Satanic society.{{sfn|Faxneld|2013|p=81}}

Dyrendel argued that LaVey partook in conspiracy culture as he grew older, for he was greatly concerned with modern society's impact on individual agency.{{sfn|Dyrendel|2013|pp=137, 138}} LaVey was conservative in his attitude to law and order, and was opposed to drug use.{{sfn|Peterson|2009|p=9}} He supported [[eugenics]] and believed that it would be a necessity in the future.{{sfn|Lap|2013|p=95}} LaVey hated [[rock music|rock]] and [[heavy metal music|metal music]], with or without "Satanic" lyrics, and often expressed his distaste for it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==

Historian of Satanism Gareth J. Medway described LaVey as "A born showman",{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=21}} with anthropologist [[Jean La Fontaine]] describing him as "A colourful figure of considerable personal magnetism".{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} Medway contrasted LaVey from the likes of [[Jim Jones]], [[David Koresh]], and [[Charles Manson]], noting that whereas the latter were the charismatic leaders of apocalyptic communes, within the Church of Satan, "No one hung onto [LaVey's] every word, and church members [were] allowed considerable autonomy."{{sfn|Medway|2001|p=377}}

Academic scholars of Satanism Per Faxneld and Jesper Aa. Petersen described LaVey as "the most iconic figure in the satanic milieu",{{sfn|Faxneld|Petersen|2013|p=79}} while Asbjo/rn Dyrendel described him as "the founder of modern Satanism".{{sfn|Dyrendel|2013|p=124}}
In his 2001 examination of Satanists, the sociologist [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] noted that, to his surprise, his findings "consistently pointed to the centrality of LaVey's influence on modern Satanism". As a result he "concluded that - despite his heavy dependence on prior thinkers - LaVey was directly responsible for the genesis of Satanism as a serious religious (as opposed to a purely literary) movement".{{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=5}}

His books ''The Satanic Bible'' and ''The Satanic Rituals'', have been cited as having "an influence far beyond" the Church of Satan's membership.{{sfn|La Fontaine|1999|p=96}} In 1995, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey noted that although the Church had no organized presence in Britain, LaVey's writings were widely accessible in British bookshops.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=290}}

Due to increasing visibility through his books, LaVey was the subject of numerous articles in the news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', ''[[McCall's]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and men's magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as ''[[Joe Pyne Show|The Joe Pyne Show]]'', ''[[The Phil Donahue Show|Donahue]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', and in a feature-length documentary called ''[[Satanis]]'' in 1970. He would be credited for the mainstreaming of Satanism and witchcraft in the U.S. during the 1960s, 1970s and after.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} LaVey claimed that he had been appointed consultant to the film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', which revolved around a group of fictional Satanists, and that he also had a cameo appearance in the film as the Devil, however critics have argued that none of this was true.{{sfnm|1a1=La Fontaine|1y=1999|1p=96|2a1=Lewis|2y=2001b|2p=51}} In an article published in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine in 1991, the journalist Lawrence Wright revealed that through his own investigative work, he found that many of LaVey's claims about his life had been untrue.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=6}} Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including ''The Devil's Avenger'' by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974 and ''[[The Secret Life of a Satanist]]'' by [[Blanche Barton]], published in 1990.

'''Apollophanes of Antioch''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀπολλοφάνης}}; [[floruit|fl.]] 250 BC) was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosopher]]. During his life, he left [[Seleucia]] to migrate west to [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sM9LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Apollophanes+of+Antioch%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tv-gc5pv-y&amp;sig=XYQtXrnx0ut15it1FKQiubuC14s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n3NWU7-kNtO72QWWoYDACA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Apollophanes%20of%20Antioch%22&amp;f=false A History of the Jews in Babylonia, Part 1: The Parthian Period - Jacob Neusner - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There he became a pupil and friend of [[Aristo of Chios]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus7.html#281 ''The Deipnosophists'': Book 7, Chapter 14]&lt;/ref&gt; As a student of Aristo, he may have call himself an Aristonian. There is some assertion that he is the same as Apollophanes the physician who lived at the court of Antiochus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D33%3Aentry%3Dapollophanes-bio-1 A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, Abaeus, Apollonius, Apollo'phanes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Apollophanes' [[natural philosophy]] is similar to [[Poseidonius]]', that the world is one and finite, having a spherical form with a vacuum around it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/old/diogenes7c.html#140 ''The Lives of the Philosophers'' by Diogenes Laertius. Book: Stoic Doctrines, Section 140]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Stoics, there was much discussion concerning the number of virtues and parts of the soul. On the number of virtues [[Cleanthes]], [[Chrysippus]], and [[Antipater]] suggest that there are many; [[Poseidonius]] suggests that there are four; traditional Stoics suggest that there are three (the logical, the natural, and the ethical); [[Panaetius]] teaches that there are only two (the speculative and the practical); while Apollophanes taught that there is only one virtue - prudence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/old/diogenes7b.html#92 ''The Lives of the Philosophers'' by Diogenes Laertius. Book: Stoic Doctrines, Section 92]&lt;/ref&gt; On the parts of the soul Plato divided it into two parts; Zeno into three; Panaetius into five or six; Soranus into seven; Chrysippus into as many as eight; Apollophanes into as many as nine; while other Stoics declared as many as twelve parts in the soul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf03/anf03-22.htm#P2698_901986 ''De Anima'' by Tertullian. Book 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
According to [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]], Apollophanes had written a book about his master, [[Aristo of Chios]], entitled ''Ariston''. The book concerned Aristo's addiction to pleasure, despite being a stoic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who was also Aristo's pupil, wrote a similar book also concerning Aristo's addiction to luxury.

[[File:Assianism symbol.svg|thumb|150px|The symbol of Assianism, representing its theological trinity.]]
'''Assianism''' ({{lang-ru|Ассианство}}, ''Assianstvo''; meaning the "religion of the [[æsir|ese]]", in Russian асов, ''asov'') is a [[Scythian religion|Scythian]] movement of [[Slavic Native Faith|Native Faith]] practised in [[Russia]], based on the traditional folk religious beliefs of the [[Ossetians]], modern descendants of the [[Scythians]]. The religion is known as "Assianism" among its Russian adherents, and as ''[[Uatsdin]]'' (Уацдин, literally "True Faith") by Ossetians in [[Ossetian language|their own language]]. It started to be revived in a conscious and organised way in the 1980s, as an [[ethnic religion]] among the Ossetians, who have since largely embraced it. Scythian religious groups are also present in [[Ukraine]].

The religion has been incorporated by some organisations, chiefly the ''Atsætæ'' Church (Ossetian: Ацæтæ; Russian: Асата, ''Asata'') based in [[North Ossetia–Alania]]. Some Russians have embraced Assianism by virtue of the fact that most of the ancient Scythians were assimilated by the [[East Slavs]], and therefore modern Russians may reclaim Scythian culture. Among Russians, Assianism is advocated as a religion for all Slavs, Indo-Europeans, or even as a worldwide spiritual heritage.{{sfnp|Makeyev|2007}}&lt;ref name="Dugin-Assianism"/&gt;

==Relevance for Slavs and other Indo-Europeans==
In 2009, at the Center for Conservative Research of [[Moscow State University]], led by philosopher [[Alexander Dugin]], a conference was held about the role of Ossetians in Russian history. Among participants there was, among others, Daurbek Makeyev, the head of the ''Atsætæ'' Church. On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the ''Atsætæ'' Church was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because "what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage".&lt;ref name="Dugin-Assianism"&gt;{{cite web |title=Александр Дугин: Осетинский народ сделал возможным возвращение России на имперскую орбиту |trans-title=Alexander Dugin: The Ossetian people made it possible for Russia to return to the imperial orbit |date=7 October 2009 |website=iratta.com |url=http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163212/http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Assian resources present the religion as a universal truth "addressed to the whole world".&lt;ref name=wacdin.com/&gt;

==Theology and cosmology==
Assianism has a [[monism|monistic]] theory, expressed by three concepts:&lt;ref name=wacdin.com&gt;{{cite web |title=Основные положения традиционной осетинской веры |trans-title=Basic provisions of the traditional Ossetian faith |publisher=Ассианство / Уацдин (Assianism / True Faith) |website=wacdin.com |url=http://wacdin.com/assianstvo-wacdin/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426162824/http://wacdin.com/assianstvo-wacdin |archive-date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Xwytsau'' / ''Xuitsau'' (Хуыцау, "Heaven") — is the supreme God of the universe, the source of it and of the highest wisdom attainable by men. Creator and patron of worlds, he has neither image nor form, is incomprehensible and omnipresent;
* ''Iwag'' / ''Iuag'' (Иуаг) or Iuæg (Иуæг) — is the substance of everything, both uncreated and created worlds;
* ''Ud'' (Уд) — is the true universal [[self]], that is attained by an individual soul when it identifies with ''Mon'' (Мон), the universal mind-spirit, i.e. God's manifestation. Ultimately, Mon and Ud are the same, and they are Xwytsau's manifestation.

On the plane of the phenomenon, God's universal mind-spirit manifests as:&lt;ref name=wacdin.com/&gt;
* ''Uas'' / ''Was'' (Уас) — the good-spell or good-word, that is to say the well-being born of beings;
* ''Uastyrdzhi'' / ''Wastyrji'' (Уастырджи) — the good-spell as it embodies in men, who are bearers of divine wisdom, enlightened consciousnesses (as a symbol, Uastyrdzhi is the archetypal deity of the perfected man);
* ''Duagi'' / ''dwagi'' (дуаги; pl. дауджытæ → ''daudzhytæ'' / ''daujytæ''), otherwise called ''ass'' (асс, pl. асов → ''asov''; cf. the Germanic [[æsir|ese]]) — gods, divine forces endowed with measure and right that continuously mould the world, alternating forms. Among them, ''arvon daujita'' (арвон дауджита) are the divine forces underlying celestial bodies.

A further distinction is established between:&lt;ref name=wacdin.com/&gt;
* ''Zedy'' (зэды, pl. задтæ → ''zadtæ'') — forces who are worthy of veneration;
* ''Uayugi'' (уайуги, pl. уайгуытæ / уайгуыта → ''uayguytæ'' / ''uayguyta'') — parasitic forces accompanying the temporality of being and distancing from enlightenment; in mankind they are passions, fears, pride and nervous diseases;
* ''Dalimon'' (Далимон) or ''Dælimon'' (Дæлимон) — the lowest mind that corresponds to brute matter.

According to Assian theory, human nature is the same as all being's nature; in other words, man is a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm within a macrocosm]], or larger context, and the same applies to all other beings. In all contexts, ''Uas'' is the foundation of nobility and pure reason; ''daujita'' form both worlds and men according to this universal law, while ''uayguyta'' counter-act gods' action, and are the causes of illness and death. These forces manifest in humanity's power of consciousness and action; a man may take the side of gods or demons, and this choice manifests in this man's life and activity. If a man is able to subdue passions, not putting exclusively material motives in his actions, he becomes open to the ''Uas'', or its receptacle (Уасдан → ''Uasdan'', good-spell receptacle), a wise or noble who perceives the will of God and higher spirits and receives their energy. On the contrary, if a man's actions are driven by material ends, ''Dalimon'' and demons own him and he becomes a source of evil, lie and ugliness.&lt;ref name=wacdin.com/&gt;

Scythian Native Faith is popular in Russia and Ukraine among [[Cossacks]], especially those who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs. Some of them identify within the category of [[Rodnovery]], the general "Slavic Native Faith".{{sfnp|McKay|2009|pp=275–276}} Assianism is also practised without connection to Cossack ethnicism.

An '''assistant pastor''' is a person who assists the [[pastor]] in a [[Christian]] [[church (building)|church]]. The qualifications, responsibilities and duties vary depending on church and [[christian denomination|denomination]].

In many [[Christian]] [[church (building)|church]]es, an assistant pastor is a pastor-in-training, and in most cases, they are awaiting full [[ordination]]. In many instances, they are granted limited powers and authority to act with, or in the absence of, the [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]]'s [[Pastor]]. Some churches that have outreach programs, such as hospital visitations, in-home programs, prison ministries, or multiple [[chapel]]s, will appoint assistant pastors to perform duties while the Pastor is busy elsewhere. Some churches use the title ''brother'' or ''ordained brother'' in place of assistant pastor.  In larger [[Roman Catholic]] parishes, the duties of an assistant pastor can be broken up into duties performed by deacons and non-ordained lay people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1837">'''Atai Ulaan''', in [[Buryat people|Buryat]] mythology, is leader of the 44 [[Tengriism|tenger]] of the eastern skies, in contrast to his brother Han Hormasta, who is leader of the 55 tenger of the western skies. "Also known as Galta Ulaan...  He is a common person in Turkish and Mongol mythologies. He is husband of Mayas Hara Toodei. Abai Geser married his daughter  Gaguurai Nogoon."&lt;ref&gt;Sarangerel 2001, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The army of Atai Ulaan consisted of 6,666 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buryatmongol.org/2008/01/18/conclusion-of-the-first-branch/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106210140/http://buryatmongol.org/2008/01/18/conclusion-of-the-first-branch/ |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atai Ulaan "made thirteen magicks dance on his palm and twenty-three magicks dance on his fingers".&lt;ref&gt;Sarangerel 2001, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Han Hormasta's son "Bukhe Beligte threw a great black spear that smashed the big toe of Atai Ulaan’s right foot."&lt;ref&gt;Sarangerel 2001, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; "Malevolent disease spirits came out of the remains of Atai Ulaan and tormented humans"&lt;ref&gt;Sarangerel 2001, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; (, suggesting that the tale of the stubbing of Atai Ulaan toe may allude to the ailment [[gout]], which most commonly afflicts the big toe). The disease-spirits which thus originated were : Gal Nurma Khan, Sherem Minata Khan {cf. the "Sherem" in the ''[[Book of Jacob]]'', chapter 7 -- Yaʻqōb (Jacob) wrestled with the angel in like manner as did [[Zasa Mergen Baatar]]}, Abarga Sesen, Loir Hara Lobsogoldoi, and the "Yonhoboi sisters of  Loir Hara Lobsogoldoi".

A few miles from the swamp from which the [[Litani River|Litani]] (the classical Leontes) and the [[Asi River|Asi]] (the upper [[Orontes River|Orontes]]) flow, Baalbek may be the same as the {{sc|mbk nhrm}} ("Source of the Two Rivers"), the abode of [[El (god)|El]] in the [[Ugaritic religion|Ugaritic]] [[Baal Cycle]]&lt;ref&gt;KTU 1.4 IV 21.&lt;/ref&gt; discovered in the 1920s and a separate serpent incantation.&lt;ref&gt;KTU 1.100.3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Steiner|2009}}

Heliopolis is the [[Latinization of names|latinisation]] of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''Hēlioúpolis'' ({{lang|grc|Ἡλιούπολις}}), meaning "Sun City"{{sfnp|Lendering|2013}} in reference to the [[sun worship|solar cult]] there. It is the earlier attested of the two names, appearing under the [[Seleucids]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemies]].{{sfnp|Jidejian|1975|p=5}} [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], however, does note that earlier "[[Akkadian language|Assyrian]]" names of [[Levant]]ine towns continued to be used alongside the official Greek ones imposed by the [[Diadochi|successors]] of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus|Amm. Marc.]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/14*.html ''Hist.'', Bk&amp;nbsp;XIV, Ch.&amp;nbsp;8, §6].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greek religion|Greek religion]], [[Helios]] was both the [[sun]] in the sky and its [[personification]] as a [[Greek god|god]]. The local [[Canaanite religion|Semitic god]] [[Baʿal]] [[Hadad|Haddu]] was more often [[interpretatio graeca|equated]] with [[Zeus]] or [[Jupiter]] or simply called the "Great God of Heliopolis",{{sfnp|Jidejian|1975|p=57}}{{efn|The name also appears in the Hellenized form ''Balanios'' and ''Baal Helion'' in records describing the acts of [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]]'s reign.{{sfnp|Jessup|1881|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mzdQAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA473 473]}}}} but the name may refer to the Egyptians' association of [[Baʿal]] with their great god [[Ra]].{{sfnp|Jidejian|1975|p=5}}{{efn|The Egyptian priests' claims that Heliopolis represented a direct descendant of Ra's cult at [[Iunu]], however, is almost certainly mistaken.{{sfnp|Cook|1914|p=[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cook1914bd1/0633 550]}}}} It was sometimes described as {{nowrap|'''Heliopolis in Syria'''}} or '''Coelesyria''' ({{lang-la|Heliopolis Syriaca}} or ''{{lang|la|Syriae}}'') to distinguish it from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|its namesake in Egypt]]. In [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], its [[List of Catholic titular sees (B-K)|titular see]] is distinguished as '''{{nowrap|Heliopolis in Phoenicia}}''', from its former [[Roman province]] [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]]. The importance of the solar cult is also attested in the name Biḳāʿ al-ʿAzīz borne by the plateau surrounding Baalbek, as it [[paredros|references]] an earlier solar deity and not later men, named [[Aziz (disambiguation)|Aziz]]. In [[Hellenistic Period|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], it was known as '''Heliopolis'''. It still possesses some of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Lebanon, including one of the largest temples of the empire. The gods that were worshipped there ([[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Bacchus]]) were [[interpretatio graeca|equivalents]] of the [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] deities [[Hadad]], [[Atargatis]]. Local influences are seen in the planning and layout of the temples, as they vary from the classic Roman design.

===Early modernity===
In 1516, Baalbek was conquered with the [[Ottoman Syria|rest of Syria]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Selim the Grim]].{{sfnp|''EI''|1913|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zJU3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA544 544]}} In recognition of their prominence among the [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] of the [[Beqaa Valley]], the Ottomans awarded the [[sanjak of Homs]] and local ''[[iltizam]]'' concessions to Baalbek's  [[Harfush clan|Harfush family]].Like the Hamadas, the Harfush emirs were involved on more than one occasion in the selection of Church officials and the running of local monasteries.&lt;br/&gt; Tradition holds that many Christians quit the Baalbek region in the eighteenth century for the newer, more secure town of Zahlé on account of the Harfushes’ oppression and rapacity, but more critical studies have questioned this interpretation, pointing out that the Harfushes were closely allied to the Orthodox Ma‘luf family of Zahlé (where indeed Mustafa Harfush took refuge some years later) and showing that depredations from various quarters as well as Zahlé's growing commercial attractiveness accounted for Baalbek's decline in the eighteenth century.What repression there was did not always target the Christian community per se. The Shiite ‘Usayran family, for example, is also said to have left Baalbek in this period to avoid expropriation by the Harfushes, establishing itself as one of the premier commercial households of Sidon and later even serving as consuls of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Winter (11 March 2010).

The nearby [[Qubbat Duris]], a 13th-century [[qubba|Muslim shrine]] on the old road to Damascus, is built out of granite columns, apparently removed from Baalbek.{{sfnp|''DGRG''|1878|p=1038}} Further, the jointed columns were once banded together with iron; many were gouged open{{sfnp|Jessup|1881|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mzdQAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA459 459]}} or toppled by the emirs of Damascus to get at the metal.{{sfnp|''DGRG''|1878|p=1038}} As late as the 16th century, the Temple of Jupiter still held 27 standing columns{{sfnp|Thevet|1554}} out of an original 58;{{sfnp|Cook|1914|p=[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cook1914bd1/0643 560]}} there were only nine before the [[Near East earthquakes of 1759|1759 earthquakes]]{{sfnp|Wood|1757}} and six today.{{When|date=January 2017}}

== Ecclesiastical History ==
Heliopolis (in Phoenicia; not to be confused with the Egyptian bishopric [[Heliopolis in Augustamnica]]) was a bishopric under Roman and Byzantine rule, but it was wiped out by Islam.

In 1701, Eastern Catholics ([[Byzantine Rite]]) established anew an [[Melkite Greek Catholic Eparchy of Baalbek|Eparchy of Baalbek]], which in 1964 was promoted to the present [[Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Baalbek]].

=== Titular see ===
In the Latin rite, the Ancient diocese was only nominally restored (no later than 1876) as [[Titular archbishopric]] of Heliopolis (Latin) / Eliopoli (Curiate Italian), demoted in 1925 to Episcopal [[Titular bishopric]], promoted back in 1932, with its name changed (avoiding Egyptian confusion) in 1933 to (non-Metropolitan) Titular archbishopric of '''Heliopolis in Phoenicia'''.

It is vacant since decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting ranks (Archi- or Episcopal) at the time :&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0704.htm GCatholic&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bezalel school''' was an [[art movement]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the late Ottoman and [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] periods.  Named for the Bezalel Art School, predecessor of the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]], it has been described as "a fusion of [[Asian art|oriental art]] and [[Jugendstil]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artatthecenter.com/HTML/Artists.cfm?ID=35 AATC Artists - Ze'ev Raban]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and themes==

The Bezalel school artists blended varied strands of surroundings, tradition and innovationin paintings and craft objects that  invoked biblical themes, Islamic design and European traditions in their effort to carve out a distinctive style of Jewish art for the new nation planned in the ancient Jewish homeland.&lt;ref&gt;MUSEUM REVIEW | DERFNER JUDAICA MUSEUM, Jewish Art, the Hudson and Bingo in the Bronx, [[Edward Rothstein]], ''The New York Times'', June 10, 2009, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/arts/design/11muse.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts]&lt;/ref&gt;
The works of art created by the group contributed significantly to the creation of a distinctive [[Culture of Israel|Israeli national culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Nationalism, Zionism and ethnic mobilization of the Jews in 1900 and beyond, Michael Berkowitz, BRILL, 2004  p.93ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the school was [[Boris Schatz]], who left his position as  head of the Royal Academy of Arts in Sofia, Bulgaria, to make aliyah 1906 and established an academy for Jewish arts in [[Jerusalem]].  The artists were Zionist immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, with all the psychological and social upheaval that this implies.&lt;ref&gt;Bezalel School turns 100 years old, by Shulamit Reinharz, Jewish Advocate, Tuesday March 4, 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.thejewishadvocate.com/this_weeks_issue/columnists/reinharz/?content_id%3D2076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207235245/http://www.thejewishadvocate.com/this_weeks_issue/columnists/reinharz/?content_id=2076 |archivedate=2007-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement developed a distinctive style combining Biblical and Zionist subjects with [[art nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]  and traditional Persian and Syrian artistry.&lt;ref&gt;SOTHEBY'S BEZALEL AND ISRAELIANA CATALOG, TEL-AVIV, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bezalel School produced decorative art objects in a wide range of materials: silver, leather, wood, brass and fabric. While the artists and designers were European-trained, the craftsmen who executed the works were often members of the [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish community]], which had a long tradition of craftsmanship in precious metals, and began to make aliyah about 1880. In Yemen, filigree jewelry making was a respected profession among the Jews, with cultural as well as religious applications. [[Yemenite Jewish silversmiths]] worked primarily with silver, creating pieces by hand using traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyndiesstudiodesigns.com/filigreehistory.html A History of Filigree]&lt;/ref&gt; Yemenite immigrants wearing colorful traditional costumes were also frequent subjects of Bezalel School artists.

Leading members of the school were Boris Schatz, [[Ephraim Moses Lilien|E. M. Lilien]], [[Ya'akov Stark]], [[Meir Gur-Aryeh]], [[Ze'ev Raban]], [[Jacob Eisenberg]], [[Jacob Steinhardt]], [[Shmuel Ben David]], and [[Hermann Struck]].

The artists produced not only paintings and etchings, but objects sold as Judaica and souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2000/08/25/27362.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, ''[[The New York Times]]''  praised the “Exquisite examples of filigree work, copper inlay, carving in ivory and in wood,” in a touring exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;REVIVE JEWISH ARTISTRY.; Bezalel School of Jerusalem Shows Distinctive Works of Art, ''The New York Times'', Nov. 14, 1915  query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D15FF3A5812738DDDAD0994D9415B858DF1D3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the metalwork Moorish patterns predominated, and the damascene work, in particular, showed both artistic feeling and skill in execution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F04E3DF1E39E633A2575AC0A9679C946596D6CF, Work of Bezalel School of Handicrafts, ''The New York Times'', Jan. 9, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dafydd ap Phylip ap Rhys''' was a 16th century Welsh poet (probably from Llangyfelach, near [[Swansea]]). He may have been a member of a holy order. A [[cywydd]] in praise of [[Sir Rhys ap Thomas]] (q.v.) is thought to be his only surviving work. He is mentioned in the [[Iolo Morganwg manuscripts]], held by the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dafydd ap Phylip ap Rhys|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAFY-APP-1500.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dionysos Mosaik.png|thumb|300px|Part of the Dionysus mosaic]]
The '''Dionysus mosaic''' is the largest preserved mosaic found in [[Archaeological Park of Dion|excavations]] in [[Dion, Pieria|Dion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/dion-the-archaeological-site-and-the-museum/oclc/38938069&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Dion: the archaeological site and the museum|last=Pantermalēs|first=Dēmētrios|date=1997|publisher=Adam Editions|isbn=9605000806|location=Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the epiphany of the triumphant [[Dionysus]].

==Location==

The ancient site, with significant excavations and an [[Archaeological Museum of Dion|archaeological museum]], is located just outside the modern village of Dion in the Greek region of [[Central Macedonia]] in the coastal plain at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]], about 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Katerini]] and about 17&amp;nbsp;km from the ancient city of [[Leivithra]].

==Description==

In the center of the large mosaic, Dionysus is depicted in a chariot. Next to him stands a mature Silenus, who is more a helper of the god than a driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/gods-and-mortals-at-olympus-ancient-dion-city-of-zeus/oclc/942839583&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Gods and mortals at Olympus: ancient Dion, city of Zeus|last=Pantermalēs|first=Dēmētrios|last2=Boli|first2=Katerina|last3=Chaniotis|first3=Angelo|last4=Graf|first4=Fritz|last5=Katsakiori|first5=Maria|last6=Kremydi|first6=Sophia|last7=Martin|first7=Richard P|last8=Pingiatoglou|first8=Semeli|date=2016|isbn=0990614220|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carriage is drawn by two panthers, two centaurs hold their reins. One of the two centaurs is a mature, bearded man carrying a vessel (crater) that probably contains wine. The other Kentauer carries on his shoulder a closed vessel in which presumably the sacred symbols of the Dionysus cult are located. The light background highlights the figure of Dionysus.

The mosaic artist used mosaic stones ([[Tessera|tesserae]]) of different sizes and several dozens of shades of color to show details. He thereby gave his work the character of a painting. Surely he was inspired to his work by an important Hellenistic painting.

[[File:Dionysosmosaik Dionysos.jpg|thumb|left|Dionysus mask]]
Of high quality are also the masks under and above the central mosaic. Three on the eastern and three on the western side.

The middle of the three masks of the lower (eastern) side shows Dionysus with long curls. The mask to his left shows a mature satyr with a snub nose.

The mask to the right of him shows a barbarian. The eyes sting, his eyes are lowered. Probably it is Lycurgus, King of Thrace, and an enemy of Dionysus. He pursued the young god, who threw himself into the sea and was saved by Thetis.

The masks above (west) of the Dionysosmosa form a young Satyr on the left and an older Silenius on the right. The mask in between shows the face of a woman with blue eyes and curly hair. This may be the nymph Thetis, the savior of Dionysus.

The central mosaic of the epiphany of Dionysus has the dimensions of 220&amp;nbsp;cm by 150&amp;nbsp;cm; The entire mosaic has a floor area of approximately 100 m².

==Excavations==

In the summer of 1987 archaeologists found the most important [[mosaic]] of the extensive excavation site ({{as of|February 2018}}, excavations are still under way). Protected by the covering soil layer it is almost completely preserved.

Of course this precious find had to be protected but should also be accessible to the public. The archaeologists decided to name the place where the mosaic was unearthed "Villa of Dionysus". For over 20 years, the mosaic was sheltered under a roof structure. In order to be able to see the work from all sides, a footbridge was built, on which visitors could orbit it. The roof helped against the rays of the sun, but it was powerless against water and general decay. From year to year the condition became worse: single mosaic stones dissolved from the ground, plants grew in the cracks, it was only a matter of time before this mosaic, which had remained largely intact for nearly two millennia, would be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= 2016|title= Restoration of Mosaic of the Epiphany of Dionysus|trans-title= |medium= Video|language= English|url= https://vimeo.com/161478891|access-date= 2018-02-04|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Arbeiten am Dionysos Mosaik.jpg|thumb|Works at the mosaic]]
It was decided to create a special building for this work of art. It is located just west of the museum, the Archaiothiki. After completion of the building the mosaic had to be removed from the "Villa of Dionysos". In the fall of 2015, conservators, archaeologists and workers began this project. In order to be able to divide the mosaic into several parts, the position and shape of the individual mosaic stones were first recorded on the intended dividing lines. They were then removed. A special adhesive fabric and textile strips were applied to fix the remaining stones in their place. The mosaic was divided into several, transportable, plates. After that, these plates had to be separated from the underlying ground. At the edge, with long drills, close to each other, holes were drilled into the ground beneath the fixed object. With flat steel blades, which were cut into the holes at certain intervals, experts separated the mosaic from the ground. Then it was carefully raised to allow a suitable steel plate to be driven underneath. The helpers covered the surface with a wooden plate. With several belt tensioners, the plates (steel plate and wooden plate) were fixed against each other so that no movement was possible during transportation. Via a ramp the parts, weighing up to 500&amp;nbsp;kg, reached a trailer and were transported to the Archaiothiki.

Meanwhile, in the Archaiothiki, a precise image of the entire mosaic was spread on the ground. It was made on a scale of 1:1 to show the restorers where to place each single part. In order to stabilize the mosaic stones, in the next step, the carrier layer under the mosaic was removed and replaced by mortar. With steam, the curators dissolved the special adhesive fabric and removed the attached protective materials. In June 2017 the works had been finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= 2016|title= Restoration of Mosaic of the Epiphany of Dionysus|trans-title= |medium= Video|language= English|url= https://vimeo.com/161478891|access-date= 2018-02-04|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edvige Carboni''' (2 May 1880 – 17 February 1952) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] from [[Sardinia]] who relocated to [[Rome]] and became well-known among the faithful and religious alike for her [[Ecstasy (religion)|ecstasies]] and [[Religious vision|angelic visions]].&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/94545|title=Servant of God Edvige Carboni|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recorded an extensive spiritual journal in which she recorded appearances from [[Jesus Christ]] as well as saints such as [[Gemma Galgani]] and [[John Bosco]]. Carboni also experienced demonic experiences and was said to possess the [[stigmata]].&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysticsofthechurch.com/2014/02/edvige-carboni.html|title=Edvige Carboni|date=|publisher=Mystics of the Church|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause for beatification commenced in 1968 though she was accorded the title of [[Servant of God]] on 29 April 1994.&lt;ref name=PD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharist/misc/PHP/par_sge_carboni.pdf|title=Servant of God Edvige Carboni|date=|publisher=The Real Presence|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Francis]] titled her as [[Venerable]] on 4 May 2017 upon the confirmation of her life of [[heroic virtue]]. Francis later confirmed a miracle attributed to her intercession in late 2018 and she is to be beatified in her native Sardinia sometime in 2019.

==Life==
Edvige Carboni was born in [[Sassari]] on the evening of 2 May 1880 as the second of six children to Giovanni Battista Carboni (d. 1937) and Maria Domenica Pinna (d. 1910); her sister was Paulina (b. 1895) and she also had four brothers (including Galdino (15 April 1889 – 7 March 1977)) and at least one other sister. Carboni received her [[baptism]] on the following 4 May 1880 from the vice-parish priest Sanna. She received her [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] in 1884 from [[Monsignor|Mgr.]] Eliseo Giordano and made a vow to remain chaste in 1885. She started school in 1886 and finished three grades of education.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Her mother recalled Edvige's birth and told her that on that occasion she had seen a luminous host in the monstrance and would tell her daughter this because: "If I die, you must receive [[Holy Communion]] every day and you should be very good, because [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]], a few moments after you were born, showed me a host, as I have told you".&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Another odd phenomenon that took place after her birth was a supernatural branding of the Cross on her breast formed from her own flesh.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

Her mother taught her [[embroidery]] as a child and she would work with her father in the embroidery business. She also spent time in the convent of the Sisters of Saint Vincent in [[Alghero]] where the [[nun]]s led a course in embroidery. Her mother's frail health saw her tend to the education and care of her younger siblings as well as other domestic duties.

Carboni made her First Communion in 1891. She wanted to become a nun in 1895 but her mother disapproved of it and she took this disapproval as a sign of the will of [[God]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; In 1895 her sister Paulina was born; at that point she had brothers and no sister. From 1896 her visions of Jesus and Mary became ever more frequent. She became a professed member of the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] in 1906 and belonged to an association known as the Friends of Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus; she began recording her thoughts in a spiritual journal.&lt;ref name=PD/&gt; Her mother died in 1910 and her responsibilities tripled.

In her grandmother's home remained a replica of [[Raphael|Raphael's]] painting of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] with the Infant Jesus: she would climb a chair to reach the image and would say to the Blessed Mother: "My mother, I love you. Give me your child so that I can play with Him".&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Carboni was required to do the shopping due to her mother's ill health despite being fearful of having to shop in the evening. But her [[guardian angel]] appeared to her and told her: "Don't be afraid. I am with you and I keep you good company".&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

She attended her brother Galdino's marriage to Penelope Gerundini (8 May 1899 – 31 December 1979).

Her spiritual gifts included [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and the reading of hearts as well as the discernment of spirits and frequent visits from the souls in [[Purgatory]].&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; She also had several visions of [[Aloysius Gonzaga|Saint Aloysius Gonzaga]] and on their first encounter he asked her: "Do you know me?" to which she replied that she did not. Gonzaga said: "I am Saint Aloysius Gonzaga. I have come to tell you that I love you very much and that you should love Jesus always".&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Carboni noted in her spiritual journal on 16 November 1938 how she received the [[stigmata]] – for she wanted to suffer for the glory of God – while she recorded in her journal on 12 June 1941 her first encounter with [[John Bosco|Saint John Bosco]]. Bosco even invited her to enroll as a [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] in an appearance on 25 September 1941.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Carboni also received the [[transverberation]] and recorded a case of demonic encounter in December 1941.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Her experiences with the [[Devil]] became more aggressive as time progressed. On one occasion she was kicked in the legs and on another her gold fillings were stolen. She once was confined to her bed for a while after a hammer hit her in the knees.

Carboni experienced a number of visions from saints:
* [[Dominic Savio|St. Dominic Savio]]
* [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]]
* [[Saint Sebastian|St. Sebastian]]
* [[Januarius|St. Genaro]]
* [[Rita of Cascia|St. Rita of Cascia]] – during a pilgrimage to the saint's shrine
* [[Thérèse of Lisieux|St. Thérèse of Lisieux]]
* [[Gemma Galgani|St. Gemma Galgani]] – whom she admired; Carboni also attended her canonization in 1940
* [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]]
* [[Catherine of Siena|St. Catherine of Siena]] – on a 9 April 1950 pilgrimage to her shrine
* [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]]
Carboni also had visits from [[Pio of Pietrelcina|Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina]] in her visions despite the fact that the priest was in fact alive. Padre Pio knew of Carboni and referred to her as a "saint". She also knew [[Luigi Orione|Saint Luigi Orione]].

She began to experience [[bilocation]] in 1925 and this grew greater during [[World War II]]. In 1929 her sister Paulina found a job as a teacher in Marcellina Scalo – a small town between [[Rome]] and [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]]. Her father did not want Paulina to leave so the entire family relocated from [[Sardinia]] to the mainland. In 1934 she moved to [[Albano Laziale]] until the death of her father in 1937 and she finally settled in Rome in 1938.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; From 1941 she became part of the Confraternity of the Passion of Scala Santa in Rome.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; On 11 August 1941 she wrote of Jesus allowing her a view of [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]].&lt;ref name=PD/&gt;

Carboni spent the last fourteen years of her life living with her sister Paulina in Rome.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Her final [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] was the [[Passionist]] priest Ignacio Parmeggiani. Her time in Rome saw her teach [[catechism]] while tending to the poor and the ill. She received praise for her piety from the [[Servant of God]] Giovanni Battista Manzella and priests such as Ernesto Maria Piovella and Felice Cappello.

On 17 February 1952 she got up in the morning to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and came home for a meal before going back to church to hear Father Lombardi preach a sermon. She and her sister arrived home via train at 8:30pm when she complained that she did not feel well. Her sister summoned a doctor and two priests from their parish who gave her the [[Anointing of the Sick|Last Rites]]. Carboni died of [[angina pectoris]] at 10:30pm and was buried in Albano Laziale.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Her grave was with that of her brother Galdino and his wife.

Her remains from a white [[coffin]] were exhumed in October 2015 for canonical inspection as part of the canonization cause. Her remains were relocated as a result of this.

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened in the [[Diocese of Rome]] in a diocesan process that opened in December 1968 and concluded sometime later after having taken all of the available documents and interrogatories – this also included her spiritual journal.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

On 29 April 1994 she became a [[Servant of God]] – under [[Pope John Paul II]] – with the formal commencement of the cause following the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] granting the "[[nihil obstat]]" ('nothing against') to the cause.

The second process opened on 18 October 1999 and concluded on 1 June 2001 after which the C.C.S. validated the process on 1 March 2002.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The postulation submitted the [[Positio]] in 2008 while theologians could not come up with conclusive approval the cause on 10 October 2013 after debating the extent of her mysticism and the depth of her spiritual writings with some aspects still requiring greater investigation; the theologians met again and provided their definitive approval to the cause on 29 November 2016. The C.C.S. approved her cause on 2 May 2017; [[Pope Francis]] confirmed her [[heroic virtue]] on 4 May 2017 and named her as [[Venerable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher = Holy See Press Office|accessdate =28 May 2018 | url = https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2017/05/04/170504b.html | date= 4 May 2017 | title =Promulgation of Decrees of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, 04.05.2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The miracle required for her beatification was investigated in the place of its origin and received C.C.S. validation on 6 October 2000. Medical examiners inspected and approved the documents pertaining to this alleged miracle on 23 November 2017. Theologians later confirmed the miracle on 26 April 2018 and the C.C.S. members meet and approved this healing on 6 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.edvigecarboni.it/2018/edvige-carboni-a-fine-2018-il-decreto-di-beatificazione|title=Edvige Carboni: a fine 2018 il Decreto di Beatificazione|date=|publisher=Edvige Carboni sito ufficiale|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis approved this miracle in a decree on 7 November 2018 which allows for Carboni's beatification; it shall be held in her native Sardinia in 2019.

The current [[postulator]] assigned to the cause is Dr. Andrea Ambrosi.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2987">'''Elisabeth Haich''' - original name: '''Haich Erzsébet''' - (1897-1994) was a [[spirituality|spiritual teacher]] and author of several books on spirituality.

==Life==
She was born and raised in [[Budapest, Hungary]]. In 1941 with [[Selvarajan Yesudian]], who arrived in Hungary from India in 1937, they founded Europe's first [[yoga]] school in Budapest. After the end of [[World War II]] in 1948, due to the communist regime, they had to close their school and flee to [[Switzerland]], where they founded a new [[yoga]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Mayer, ''Les nouvelles voies spirituelles : enquête sur la religiosité parallèle en Suisse'', Nationales Forschungsprogramm 21—Kulturelle Vielfalt und Nationale Identität, L'Âge d'Homme, 1993, {{ISBN|978-2-8251-0412-5}}, p.&amp;nbsp;195.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her best known book, ''[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/619040.Initiation Initiation]'', Haich describes early experiences of her life in Hungary, as well as details of her supposed [[Reincarnation|past life]] during which she claimed to have been initiated as a priestess of Ra by her supposed uncle, [[Ptahhotep]], in what she refers to as ancient [[Egypt]].  The book also describes a little of a more recent claimed previous life in which she was a washing-woman, was abandoned by her lover, lost contact with her daughter, and ended up a beggar on the streets.

Her book ''The Wisdom of the Tarot'' is based on the Oswald Wirth deck's images (but some colors are different, for some details), and it is about the archetypes of human  development, each Tarot card identifying one archetype and its meaning.

Her book ''Sexual Energy &amp; Yoga'' identifies how sexual energy, when contained, builds among one's chakras, boiling the ignorance resident among them, eventually awakening them, and making possible enlightenment.

Elisabeth Haich claimed to have attained "ego-death". It was described by her followers (mentioned in the introductions to her book) as visible in her gaze: "her gaze wasn't the gaze of a person, it was the gaze of infinity, and it wasn't blind to one's unconsciousness or ignoring: a gaze that cut right through one's unconsciousness, a gaze very difficult to bear."

'''Florinda Donner''' (originally '''Regine Margarita Thal''', later '''Florinda Donner-Grau''') is an American writer and [[anthropology|anthropologist]] known as one of [[Carlos Castaneda]]'s "witches" (the term for three women who were friends of Castaneda).

She studied anthropology at UCLA but did not complete her degree, letting her graduate studies lapse in 1977, after having advanced to doctoral candidacy.&lt;ref name=AAANEWS/&gt; While studying she met Castaneda and worked with him on developing his thinking.
In addition to working on Castaneda's books, she has written several books about indigenous healing, sorcery and [[lucid dreaming]].

==''Shabono''==
In 1982 Florinda Donner published a book, ''Shabono: A Visit to a Remote and Magical World in the South American Rain Forest'', named after the [[Yanomami]] [[Shabono|word for shelter]], a narrative of her life among the [[Yanomami]] Indians in the [[Amazon rainforest]].

While initially praised as a compelling account of Yanomami culture, in 1983 controversy broke out when an article in ''[[American Anthropologist]]''&lt;ref&gt;De Holmes, R. B. (1983), Shabono: Scandal or Superb Social Science?. American Anthropologist, 85: 664–667.&lt;/ref&gt; accused the book of not being based on original ethnographic work, but instead being a patchwork made of previously published ethnographic accounts. Rebecca De Holmes, the author of the critique, stated that it was unlikely that Donner had spent any amount of time among the Yanomami. Particularly she criticized Donner for having plagiarized the biographical account of the Brazilian woman [[Helena Valero]], who grew up as a captive among the Yanomami, without acknowledging having borrowed large parts of her life-story. Another critical review, by Dr. Debra Picchi, argues that the book was invalid as social science because of the author's auto-biographical focus on her personal development and experience, rather than on describing the Yanomami people.&lt;ref&gt;Picchi, D. (1983), Cultural/Ethnology: Shabono: A Visit to a Remote and Magical World in the Heart of the South American Jungle. Florinda Donner. New York. American Anthropologist, 85: 674–675&lt;/ref&gt; One critic suspected that Donner might have worked from the many ethnographic movies about the Yanomami and argued that in that case her book could be considered an interpretive study of the visual documentary data.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, John. Jr. 1988. "Visual Anthropology and the future of ethnographic film". in ''Anthropological filmmaking:
anthropological perspectives on the production of film and video for general public audiences''. Jack R. Rollwagen (ed.) Psychology Press. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of De Holmes' critique was largely accepted by the anthropological community. Even though Donner did not anywhere claim that her book was based on having actually lived among the Yanomami, she was roundly criticized for having used the ethnographic writing genre without her work in fact being based on anthropological methods. Eventually her former doctoral committee at UCLA published a letter in the Newsletter of the [[American Anthropological Association]], in which they expressed their disbelief in Donner's account, stating that she was present in Los Angeles during the period in which she supposedly lived among the Yanomami. When the book was published they were not aware that the author was their former student, due to her having changed her name in the meantime.&lt;ref name=AAANEWS&gt;D. R. Price-Williams, R. B. Edgerton and L. L. Langness. "Journey to a Shabono" (pages 2–7).  ''Anthropology News''. Volume 24, Issue 9. December 1983. American Anthropological Association [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/an.1983.24.9.2.6/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars later wondered why her book was criticized for being unscientific, even though it never made any explicit claims to scientific authority.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Mary Louise. 1988. "Fieldwork in Common Places." In Writing Culture: The Poetics and Politics of Ethnography, edited by James Clifford and George Marcus&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the controversy generated by the writings of Carlos Castaneda, the controversy about Donner's book contributed to sparking the [[ethnography]] "crisis of representation" of the 1980s, represented by the "Writing Culture" movement. The book is now generally considered "anthropologically-inspired fiction".&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, A. R. (1987), Reflecting on the Yanomami: Ethnographic Images and the Pursuit of the Exotic. Cultural Anthropology, 2: 284–304. {{doi|10.1525/can.1987.2.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life in Malaysia}}
Freedom of religion is enshrined in the Malaysian Constitution. First, Article 11 provides that every person has the right to profess and to practice his or her religion and (subject to applicable laws restricting the propagation of other religions to Muslims) to propagate it. Second, the Constitution also provides that Islam is the religion of the country but other religions may be practised in peace and harmony (Article 3).

The status of '''freedom of religion in Malaysia''' is a controversial issue. Questions including whether [[Malaysia]] is an [[Islamic state]] or [[secular state]] remains unresolved. In recent times, there has been a number of contentious issues and incidents which has tested the relationship between the different religious groups in Malaysia.

== Religious demography ==
Malaysia has a population of just over 27&amp;nbsp;million. As of the 2010 Population and Housing Census, 61.3 percent of the population practices [[Islam]]; 19.8 percent [[Buddhism]]; 9.2 percent Christianity; 6.3 percent [[Hinduism]]; and 1.3 percent traditional [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religions]]. The remainder is accounted for by other faiths, including [[Animism]], [[Folk religion]], [[Sikhism]], [[Baha'i]] and other belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011081938/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these figures may be misleading as professing the religion of Islam is a requirement for being a [[Malaysian Malay|Malay in the sense of the Malaysian Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of Malaysia#Article 160|Constitution of Malaysia on Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Muslims who wish to leave Islam face strong disincentives.

==Scope of Islamic law in Malaysia==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2007}}

The nation maintains two parallel justice systems in the country (see: [[Courts of Malaysia]]). One is the secular justice system based upon laws gazetted by [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]]. The other is [[sharia]] (syariah, Islamic law). Ostensibly [[Syariah Court]]s only have jurisdiction over persons who declare themselves to be Muslims. Consequently, this results in non-Muslims not having legal standing in Syariah Courts.

Where decisions of the syariah court affect a non-Muslim, he or she can seek recourse in the secular courts which, in theory, overrule the syariah courts as the Syariah courts are limited in their jurisdiction by Article 121 of the Federal constitution. In 2006 a judge ruled that Article 121 limited the federal courts from ruling on matters ruled on by the Syariah court when it touches Islamic matters. This was seen as a misinterpretation of the article by some, and the case is under appeal in the court of appeals.

The rules of sharia are set by the various [[sultan]]s of the states. Historically a sultan had absolute authority over the state. Prior to independence, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] managed to convince the sultans to cede some states' powers to the [[Politics of Malaysia|federal government]]. One of the terms of this agreement is that the sultans still are the ultimate authority of Islamic law in their respective states. The same arrangement was long held even during British colonial rule. In Selangor, the Selangor Non-Islamic Religions (Control of Propagation Among Muslims) Enactment 1988 was signed by the [[Sultan of Selangor]] into law forbidding non-Muslims from using the word "Allah"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/jais-flexes-muscles-over-non-muslim-usage-of-allah |title=Jais flexes muscles over non-Muslim usage of 'Allah' &amp;#124; Malaysia |publisher=The Malay Mail Online |date=10 September 2013 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/in-pursuit-of-christians-jais-set-to-test-limits-of-allah-ban |title=In pursuit of Christians, Jais set to test limits of 'Allah' ban &amp;#124; Malaysia |publisher=The Malay Mail Online |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutionally (in [[Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia]]), one of the four tests for entitlement to the privileges accorded to a [[Malaysian Malay]] is that one must be a Muslim. The rationale for this is that Islam is considered intrinsic to Malay ethnic identity, which culturally and historically is ruled by a Sultan who is a Muslim. Another test is that one must follow the Malay culture. Controversially, court rulings have assumed that all [[ethnic Malays]] must automatically satisfy this constitutional definition of a [[Malaysian Malay]], and have therefore concluded that they must satisfy all of its requirements, so they have to be Muslim.

On 29 September 2001, the then [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]], Tun Dr. [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] declared that the country was an [[Islamic state]] (''negara Islam''). The opposition leader at the time, [[Lim Kit Siang]], is now actively seeking support to declare Mahathir's move as unconstitutional by repeatedly clarifying that Malaysia is a [[secular state]] with Islam as its official religion as enshrined in the Constitution. However, the coalition government headed by Mahathir at the time held more than two-thirds of the seats in parliament. A two-thirds majority vote in Parliament is required for constitutional amendments in Malaysia.

== Status of religious freedom ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2007}}

Government in general supports Islamic religious establishment and it is the official policy to "infuse Islamic values" into the administration of the country.

However, Sunday which is the Christian traditional holiday is the official weekend holiday in the Federal Territories and ten out of thirteen states, unlike practices in Middle Eastern Muslim countries. The exception are the states of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu, where the weekend falls on Friday and Saturday. Most Muslims in Malaysia accept this, although some have expressed disquiet since the most holy period in a Muslim's week is between Thursday evening and Friday afternoon, when the congregational Jumaat prayer is held. The practice of having Sunday as the weekend holiday is a departure from traditional Islamic practices, dating to British colonial days when the British started bringing in non-Muslim immigrants into the country.

In May 2001, the government decided not to approve the [[Falun Gong]] Preparatory Committee's application to register as a legal organisation. This action is believed to be more related to the government's wish to improve relations with China rather than an attempt to undermine the Falun Gong in favour of Islam. The government has not prevented Falun Gong members from carrying out their activities in public.

For Muslim children, religious education according to a government-approved curriculum is compulsory in public schools. There are no restrictions on [[homeschooling]], although primary school is compulsory. However, private schools and colleges do have some legal requirements.

Several religious holidays are recognised as official holidays, including [[Eid ul-Fitr#Eid ul-Fitr in Malaysia and Singapore|Hari Raya Puasa]] (Muslim), [[Eid ul-Adha|Hari Raya Haji]] (Muslim), the Prophet's birthday (Muslim), [[Wesak]] Day (Buddhist), [[Deepavali]] (Hindu), [[Thaipusam]] (Hindu), Christmas (Christian), and, in [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], [[Good Friday]] (Christian).

[[Judaism]] is not a recognized religion in Malaysia and movements within the religion which incorporate Zionism or prayers for the state of Israel or even the rebuilding of Jerusalem as found in the [[Amidah]] in Traditional or Orthodox Judaism which may not necessarily be political or Zionist but an expression of a [spiritual connection to Jerusalem] are outrightly illegal. [http://www.jpost.com/Christian-News/Jerusalem-event-in-Malaysia-canceled-after-Islamic-party-complaint-494895] The same law applies to non Jews who organize prayer gatherings for the same reason who would then also be accused of promoting "Jewish culture". [https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/4396/] Individuals who express support for the state of Israel openly can be charged under Section 4(1)(a) of the Sedition Act. [http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/penang-teen-who-liked-i-love-israel-facebook-page-under-sedition-probe] The sedition law prescribes a maximum fine of RM5,000 or a jail sentence of three years for a convicted first-time offender, or both, and raises the jail term to five years for subsequent offenses. The use of Jewish symbols is seen as being insensitive in a multi-racial country and therefore prohibited. This is especially true for the Menorah (Chanukiah) because it also commemorates the re-dedication of the holy temple in Jerusalem.[https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/06/246008/christian-leader-questions-insensitive-jerusalem-jubilee-celebration] Even Jewish prayer items such as a Torah scroll delivered into the country may be confiscated by customs [if it was made known to them that its purpose was for the observance of Judaism]; thus (in reality) the practice of Judaism be it Zionist or not is forbidden.

===Inter-faith efforts in Malaysia===
&lt;!--[[File:Discrimination against the shia.jpg|thumb|right|In this letter purporting to be from the [[International Islamic University Malaysia]], the university is denying employment to a person based on what it claims to be government policy "against employing staff from a particular denomination, [[Shia]]".

In April 2002, the Human Rights Commission ([[Suhakam]]) initiated an interfaith dialogue aimed at promoting better understanding and respect among the country's different religious groups. Participants included representatives from the Malaysian Islamic Development Department, the Malaysian Ulama Association, and the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism (MCCBCHS).

In early 2005, much debate was stirred up by a proposed Inter-Faith Commission put forward by various individuals, some of which included academics and lawyers from the Bar Council.

The steering committee behind the proposal for a draft bill for the commission organised a national conference that saw about 200+ people from all religious backgrounds attending it. There they hashed out the framework for a commission that could advise the relevant parties on the many interfaith issues that arise in pluralistic Malaysia such as conversion from Islam to another faith, which is deemed as apostasy in Malaysia.

[[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]], member of parliament [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]], stated that he is against religious pluralism saying that it has "relativised" truth claims, by implying that Islam is the same as other religions.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ahmad|first=Dzulkefly|title=The religious pluralism debate |publisher=The Malaysian Insider}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 April 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ahmad went on to make a distinction between promoting relativism of religions and co-operation with people in a "multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-cultural, and multi-lingual" society, and that the latter was necessary to build a strong country.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"/&gt;

After much coverage in the local newspapers, the draft bill was put on hold by Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], due to the controversy surrounding it.

Subashini, applied to Kuala Lumpur High Court for an injunction against her husband seeking divorce in the Syariah Court. The High Court dismissed her application. This was affirmed in the Court of Appeal, where the court also ordered Subashini to take her case to the Syariah Court. As of September 2007, their case is pending in the Federal Court after an appeal by Subashini.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110521080009/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F9%2F24%2Fnation%2F20070924191019&amp;sec=nation "Federal Court needs time over Subashini appeal"], ''The Star'', 24 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Subashini is also seeking to stop or declare void the conversion of their children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110521075937/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F9%2F19%2Fcourts%2F18927515&amp;sec=courts "Lawyer: Syariah Court has no jurisdiction over Subashini"], ''The Star'', 19 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 27 December 2007, R.

===Voluntary conversion of minors===
Conversion to other faiths is allowed in Malaysia once one has reached an age of majority. A minor may not convert to another faith without explicit permission of his or her guardian as described in the Guardianship of Infants Act (1961) and the Federal Constitution (Articles 11 (1) and 12 (3) and (4)).

This case was tested by Teoh Eng Huat vs Kadhi mot of Pasir Mas Kelantan in 1986.&lt;ref name=aliran&gt;[http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004b/9e.html "A view on infant conversions to Islam"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114080721/http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004b/9e.html |date=14 November 2007 }}, ''Aliran Monthly''. Accessed 23 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Teoh Eng Huat's daughter was a ward of the state. She married a Muslim. Hence then a minor, converted to Islam. The high court ruled that the father's right to decide the religion and upbringing of the infant is allowed "subject to the condition that it does not conflict with the principles of the infant's choice of religion guaranteed to her under the Federal Constitution". Through the proceedings, Susie Teoh never appeared in court to testify.

The decision was over-ruled on appeal to the Supreme Court, who held "in all the circumstances and in the wider interests of the nation no infant shall have the automatic right to receive instruction relating to any other religion other than (her) own without the permission of the parent or guardian".

The Supreme Court further held that this was "only of academic interest" as Susie Teoh was no longer a minor at the time of hearing.

In response several states (Islamic laws are passed by individual states) passed laws providing for conversion by 15 (defined as "baligh" in Islam or the age of puberty). Federal law still provides for the age of majority as 18.

===Automatic conversion of minors following parental conversion===
The state of Selangor passed a legal amendment in 1989 that if an adult converts to Islam, any infant children become converted at the same moment. This passed over the opposition of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] and the [[Democratic Action Party]], and became law. However, after public outcry, it was quietly removed by its non-inclusion in future amendments of the state bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aliran.com/archives/monthly/2004b/9e.html|title=Civil-shariah conflict, Malaysia: A view on infant conversions to Islam|website=aliran.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion of minor by one parent===
In the case of Chang Ah Mee v Jbt. Hal Ehwal Agama Islam (2003) heard in the Sabah High Court,&lt;ref name="aliran" /&gt; the father converted to Islam and converted the child to Islam without consent or knowledge of the mother, Chang Ah Mee, on 28 July 1998. The mother gained custody of the child on 13 November 1998 and subsequently sued to declare the conversion void.

The court determined that as a state court, it had jurisdiction over all state matters even those concerning Islam. Further, based upon the Federal Constitution (article 12), The Guardianship of Infants Ordinance (Sabah) 1999, The Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act, 1976 and The Administration of Islamic Law Enactment 1992 (Sabah) determined the conversion of a two-year-old child to be void.

In 2003, this issue became prominent again in the case of Shamala Sathiyaseelan v Dr. Jeyaganesh C. Mogarajah.&lt;ref name="aliran" /&gt; In the first hearing before the High Court, Shamala Sathiyaseelan sought (1) to bring committal proceedings against the father of the infants for breach of the interim custody order of the High Court of 17 April 2003, and (2) to declare that she was not bound by any decisions, order or proceedings of the syariah court.

Earlier the High Court had granted custody to Shamala Sathiyaseelan with access for the father. He failed to return the children to her on 25 May 2003. Shamala and Jeyaganesh were married under Hindu rites registered under the jurisdiction of the Law Reform Act. The husband converted to Islam on 19 November 2002. On 25 November 2002 he converted the children without the mother's knowledge or consent. They were still not divorced at the time.

Without knowledge of Shamala he then obtained a custody order in the syariah court on 30 January 2003.
The High Court ruled that the custody order issued by the syariah court "did not change the interim civil court order". They ruled that the syariah court order "is not binding on the plaintiff wife who is non-Muslim". The interim custody order of the High Court and proceedings were binding on the now Muslim husband as matters arising out of the Hindu marriage registered under the Law Reform Act. As his Hindu wife did not file for divorce, she remains "his unconverted wife" under this law.

On 13 April 2004 Shamala once again went to the high court. This time to seek an order that the conversion of the infants was void. As in Chang Ah Mee, she cited the Federal Constitution (Article 12), the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961 and the Administration of Islamic Law (Federal Territories) Act, 1993.

The Guardianship of Infants Act for the Federal Territories differed from that of Sabah in one aspect as it used the term "parent or guardian" and not "both parents or a guardian" as in AMLE Sabah.

In this case the High Court ruled that only the consent of one parent is required in the conversion to Islam of a person below 18 in the Federal Territories.

Article 12(4) of the Federal Constitution reads "For the purposes of cl. (3) the religion of a person under the age of eighteen years shall be decided by his parent or guardian."

The High Court interpreted the term parent to mean father. The equality of rights granted to both parents under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1961 was held inapplicable on the Muslim father.

In its judgement the High Court held the fatwa or the Mufti of the Federal Territory as persuasive (legal term). The Mufti stated that the father had the right to unilaterally convert the infants to Islam.

Shamala once again went to the high court on 20 July 2004 to apply inter alia for custody, care and control of the infants. The court awarded it with access for the father. In its judgement, it stated that "the right of religious practice of the two infant children shall be exercised equally by both parents" based on the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961. This was in spite of the earlier ruling that this act does not apply to Jeyaganesh who was now a Muslim.

The court also held that the applicable law at the time of conversion was civil law. It even ruled that the infants were "still Hindus at the time of conversion" and that the father should have consulted the mother before converting the infants.

However the court explicitly cautioned the mother from "influencing the infants'
religious belief by teaching them her articles of faith or by making them eat pork" or she would risk losing her children. The rationale given was that the court "cannot run away from the fact that the two infant children are now muallaf" (converts to Islam).

As the case has gained prominence various religious organisations, human rights organisations and women's issues organisations have registered watching briefs. En. Haris Bin Mohamed Ibrahim has registered a watching brief on behalf of the Women's Aid Organisation, (WAO), All Women's Action Society (AWAM), Women's Center for Change, Penang (WCC) and Sisters in Islam (SIS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wao.org.my/news/20070102MEMO15LRA.htm "Safeguard Rights Of Wives And Children Upon Conversion Of Husbands To Islam"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922202752/http://www.wao.org.my/news/20070102MEMO15LRA.htm |date=22 September 2007 }}, ''[[Women's Aid Organisation]]'', 5 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A. Kanesalingam, held watching brief for the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism (MCCBCHS). Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Bar Council are also holding watching briefs for this case. The various organisations holding watching brief in this case now call themselves loosely Article 11 after the article of the Federal Constitution guaranteeing freedom of religion.

In 2014, the [[Seremban]] High Court over-ruled a Shariah Court, granting custody of Muslim children to their Hindu mother over that of their father who converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Malaysia |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/high-court-overrides-syariah-court-orders-custody-of-muslim-children-to-the |title=High Court overrides Shariah Court, orders custody of Muslim children to their Hindu mother |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408203153/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/high-court-overrides-syariah-court-orders-custody-of-muslim-children-to-the |archivedate=8 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=editor |url=http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/custody-of-two-converted-kids-goes-to-hindu-mom/ |title=Custody of two converted kids goes to Hindu mom |publisher=The Malaysian Times |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the father Izwan Viran Abdullah abducted the son from the mother after the ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/04/09/muslim-convert-grabs-son-from-ex-wife/ |title=Muslim convert grabs son from ex-wife |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in which the police refused to help the mother retrieve the son citing the original Shariah custody ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sarban singh |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/04/11/Cops-No-probe-on-Izwan-Father-who-allegedly-took-son-has-custody-order-too-says-OCPD/ |title=Father who allegedly took son has custody order too, says OCPD – Nation &amp;#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/igp-cans-child-abduction-complaint-says-muslim-dad-didnt-kidnap-son |title=IGP cans child abduction complaint, says Muslim dad didn't 'kidnap' son &amp;#124; Malaysia |publisher=The Malay Mail Online |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police inaction was criticised by Women's Aid Organisation&lt;ref name="theedgemalaysia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=284781&amp;Itemid=77|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140413061000/http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=284781&amp;Itemid=77|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 April 2014|title=Son snatch: WAO takes IGP to task for not acting against Deepa's ex-husband|publisher=theedgemalaysia.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both governing and opposition politicians.&lt;ref name="freemalaysiatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/04/12/take-action-against-izwan/|title=‘Take action against Izwan’ &amp;#124; Free Malaysia Today|publisher=freemalaysiatoday.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="malaysia-chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysia-chronicle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=261311:police-are-being-irresponsible-talk-only-mca-mic-slam-inaction-over-muslim-convert-kidnap-case&amp;Itemid=2#axzz2ykBZjA5a|title=POLICE ARE BEING IRRESPONSIBLE: 'Talk-only' MCA, MIC slam inaction over Muslim convert kidnap case|publisher=malaysia-chronicle.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conversion from Islam ==
Muslims who wish to convert from Islam face severe obstacles. For Muslims, particularly ethnic Malays, the right to leave the Islamic faith and adhere to another religion is a controversial question. The legal process of conversion is also unclear; in practice it is very difficult for Muslims to change their religion legally.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent case history, see: {{cite news | first = Jane| last = Perlez | author2 = | title = Once Muslim, Now Christian and Caught in the Courts| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/world/asia/24malaysia.html| work = | publisher = New York Times| pages = | page = | date = 24 August 2006| accessdate = 25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the High Court ruled that secular courts have no jurisdiction to hear applications by Muslims to change religions. According to the ruling, the religious conversion of Muslims lies solely within the jurisdiction of Islamic courts.

The issue of [[Apostasy in Islam|Muslim apostasy]] is very sensitive. In 1998 after a controversial incident of attempted conversion, the Government stated that apostates (i.e., Muslims who wish to leave or have left Islam for another religion) would not face government punishment so long as they did not defame Islam after their conversion. However, whether the very act of conversion was an "insult to Islam" was not clarified at the time. The Government opposes what it considers deviant interpretations of Islam, maintaining that the "deviant" groups' extreme views endanger national security. In 2005 international media attention focused on the [[Sky Kingdom]] sect whose founder [[Ayah Pin]] claimed to be God, and whose members – mostly Malays – were accordingly charged with religious "deviancy" and "humiliating Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4648581.stm | work=BBC News | title=Malaysian sect members arrested | date=4 July 2005 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the Government imposed restrictions on certain Islamic groups, primarily the small number of [[Shi'a]]. The Government continues to monitor the activities of the Shi'a minority.

In April 2000, the state of [[Perlis]] passed a sharia law subjecting Islamic "deviants" and apostates to 1 year of "rehabilitation" (under the Constitution, religion, including sharia law, is a state matter). Leaders of the opposition Islamic party, PAS, have stated the penalty for apostasy – after the apostates are given a period of time to repent and they do not repent – is death.

Many Muslims who have converted to Christianity, [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and other religions lead "double lives", hiding their new faith from friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;Pressly, Linda (15 November 2006). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/6150340.stm Life as a secret Christian convert]. ''BBC News''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnholz, Katrin (28 June 2006).

''sydneyanglicans.net''.&lt;/ref&gt;

General interpretation about the freedom of religion as described in the constitution in Malaysia is that a person has a right to practice his or her religion freely. This freedom does not grant a person a right to change his or her religion "at a whim and fancy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/05/30/malaysias_lina_joy_loses_islam_conversion_case Boston News about Lina Joy conversion case]/&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a Muslim who wants to convert to another religion must get an explicit permission from a syariah court. The syariah courts rarely grant such requests, except in cases where a person has actually lived his or her whole adult life as a person of different religion, and only wants to change the official documents to reflect this fact. The Islamic interpretation of the situation is that only the syariah courts can decide who is a Muslim and who is not. A person does not have such freedom, and so cannot have a say in the judgement given in a syariah court.

The [[Lina Joy]] case challenged this view of the situation by taking the problem of apostasy to the Federal Court in 2007. Lina Joy lost the case and was denied identification as a Christian on her identification card. This cleared the situation about the overlapping areas of jurisdiction between the Islamic and the secular courts in Malaysia.

===Apostasy under state law===
As Malaysia is a federation, certain matters, such as religion, are handled by state governments. There is subsequently some amount of divergence between different states in the treatment of converts from Islam.

Statistics indicate that [[Negeri Sembilan]] has the largest number of converts, with 840 applications made to officially renounce Islam in 2005, 62 of which succeeded.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} An academic{{Who|date=May 2011}} has suggested that this is because [[Negeri Sembilan]] is the only state which (officially) permits conversion. A convert must first apply to the Shariah Court for a declaration that he or she is no longer a Muslim; the convert will then be counselled for about a year by a [[Mufti]]. If, after this period, the convert still wants to convert, the judge may permit the application. This process is unique to the state; no other state allows Muslims to officially convert.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In 2006, the Negeri Sembilan Court also permitted [[Wong Ah Kiu]], a convert from Islam to Buddhism legally known as Nyonya binti Tahir, to be buried in the Buddhist fashion, although her conversion had not been legally recognised while she was still alive. The case marked the first time non-Muslims had testified in a Shariah court in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Bernama"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=177118|publisher=Bernama|date=23 January 2006|title=Syariah Court Decides Nyonya Tahir Not A Muslim|accessdate=2 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111516/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=177118|archive-date=29 September 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In five states (Perak, Pahang, Malacca, Sabah, and Terengganu) conversion is a crime punishable by a fine or imprisonment. In Pahang, conversion can also be punished with up to six strokes of the cane.

===Lina Joy===
{{main|Lina Joy}}
Lina Joy, who was born Azalina Jailani, converted from Islam to Christianity, arguing that it came under her right to freedom of religion under Article 11 of the Constitution of Malaysia. She first approached the National Registration Department (NRD) in February 1997, seeking permission to change her name to Lina Joy, and also her religious status. The application was rejected in August 1997 on the grounds that the Syariah Court had not granted permission for her to renounce Islam. In 1998, the NRD allowed the name change, but refused to change the religious status on her [[MyKad|identity card]].

Joy appealed against this decision in the High Court, arguing that she should not be subject to sharia law, having converted to Christianity. In April 2001, Judge Datuk Faiza Tamby Chik ruled that she could not change her religious identity, because ethnic Malays are defined as Muslims under the Constitution. Joy then took her case to the Court of Appeal. On 19 September 2005, the court ruled in a 2–1 majority decision against Joy. Justice Abdul Aziz and Justice Arifin Zakaria agreed that the NRD was correct in rejecting Joy's application and said it was up to the Syariah Court to settle the issue (Justice Gopal Sri Ram said it was null and void. ). Joy further appealed to the Federal Court of Malaysia, the highest court and the court of last resort in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=206548 "Lina Joy's Case: Court Will Give Decision As Fast As Possible"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518232534/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=206548 |date=18 May 2007 }}, ''Bernama'', 4 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Court heard the appeal in July 2006, and it was presided by the [[Chief Justice of Malaysia]] [[Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim]], Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Richard Malanjum, and Federal Court Judge Alauddin Sheriff.

On 30 May 2007, the Federal Court, in a 2–1 decision, dismissed Joy's appeal. The Court's panel ruled that only the Syariah Court had the power to allow Joy to remove her religious designation of Islam from her national identity card. Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim and Federal Court judge Justice Alauddin Mohd Sheriff delivered the majority decision dismissing her appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/5/30/nation/20070530115251&amp;sec=nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601170354/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F5%2F30%2Fnation%2F20070530115251&amp;sec=nation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 June 2007|title=Lina Joy Loses Appeal|publisher=theStarOnline|accessdate=30 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Justice Richard Malanjum dissented.

===Revathi Massosai===
Revathi Massosai is a Malaysian woman who was raised as a Hindu but her identity card designates her as a Muslim. She has declared her religion to be Hindu and has petitioned unsuccessfully to have the word "Islam" removed from her identity card. Massosai married a Hindu man, but her marriage is not recognised by the Malaysian government because of the religion issue. Massosai was incarcerated for six months in an Islamic re-education camp because of her attempts to renounce Islam in favour of the Hindu religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6278568.stm|title=Malaysia 'convert' claims cruelty|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 July 2007 | date=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Revathi was denied the guardianship of her new born baby and was not allowed to meet her Hindu husband.

===Persecution===
There have been a few high-profile incidences and accounts of persecution of people from Muslim backgrounds attempting to convert from the Islamic faith. Some notable cases include:
* '''Hilmy Mohd Noor'''
Hilmy Mohd Noor, in his book ''"Circumcised Heart"'', describes his experiences during his detention under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] of Malaysia in what he described as resulting from religious persecution by Malaysian authorities. In the book, he also mentioned incidences of lobbying by some Muslims in his place of employment—a multinational oil company—to get his job terminated.&lt;ref&gt;Nor, Hilmy: "Circumcised Heart", Petaling Jaya: Kairos Research Centre, 1999, {{ISBN|983-9506-05-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interlit Magazine: [http://www.cookministries.com/international/training/resources/InterLit_June04.pdf.

* '''Nur'aishah Bokhari'''

:Nur'aishah Bokhari made a writ of [[habeas corpus]] by statutory declaration claiming that she was detained involuntarily by her own family members for wanting to convert out of Islam before marrying her Roman Catholic boyfriend. She subsequently escaped and has since left the country.&lt;ref&gt;Isu Murtad Nur'aishah Bokhari: [http://aishahb.tripod.com/the_statutory_declaration.htm Statutory Declaration by Nur'aishah Bokhari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604162531/http://aishahb.tripod.com/the_statutory_declaration.htm |date=4 June 2007 }} (URL last accessed on 21 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Abdullah or Jeffrey'''

:Jeffrey also known as Abdullah and Or Boon Hua, 36, made the application on the grounds that he had not practised the Islamic teachings since converting to the religion 14 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;News from www.TheStar.com.my: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080821093955/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F18%2Fnation%2F20080818192650&amp;sec=nation] (URL last accessed on 18 August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a court in Sarawak state allowed a Muslim to convert back to Christianity since he had become a Muslim when he was underage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2016/march/malaysia-rules-muslim-can-convert-to-christianity.html|title=Malaysia Rules Muslim Man Can Convert to Christianity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian proselytisation==

===Proselytising===
[[Proselytising]] of Muslims by members of other religions is not prohibited by federal law, even though Muslims may proselytise. It is however prohibited in 10 of the 13 states (i.e. excepting Penang, Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territories) and can lead to lengthy jail sentences and many strokes of the ''rotan'' (whipping). Most Christian and a few other religious groups in Malaysia put a standard disclaimer on literature and advertisements stating "For non-Muslims only".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8151352.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 July 2009|title=Religious row flares in Malaysia |date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious Materials ===
In 2002 the government banned the Bible in Malay (Alkitab) and in Iban (Bup Kudus). The Kudus uses the term "Allah Taala" for God. The ban has since been rescinded. [[Abdullah Badawi]], when in office as Home Minister, claimed it was the work of an overzealous bureaucrat and he had the ban repealed personally.

Some states have laws that prohibit the use of Malay-language religious terms such as usage of the term "Allah" for God by Christians, but the authorities do not enforce them actively.

Distribution of other materials such as books or tapes translated into Bahasa Melayu (local Malay) or [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is also discouraged. However, Malay-language Christian materials are available. Prior to the banning of the Bup Kudus in 2002, the distribution of Malay-language Christian materials faced few restrictions in East Malaysia.

=== Visas and other restrictions ===
In recent years, visas for foreign clergy no longer are restricted, and most visas were approved during the period covered by this report. Beginning in March 2000, representative non-Muslims were invited to sit on the immigration committee that approves such visa requests.

==Persecution of non-Sunni Muslims==
{{See also|Persecution of Ahmadis}}
According to government figures there are about 40,000 Shiites living in Malaysia, however there are unofficial figures such as that ballooning to 100,000. Shiites are subjected to persecutions and raids by various state religious authorities in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ariffin |first=Lisa J. |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/01/14/malaysian-shiites-face-growing-persecution/ |title=Malaysian Shiites face growing persecution |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date= |accessdate=6 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106142547/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2012/01/14/malaysian-shiites-face-growing-persecution/ |archive-date=6 January 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, a decree by the National Fatwa Council was issued that called for curbs on the Shia minority's right to practise their faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Malaysia |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ignorance-extremist-sunnis-fuelling-anti-shia-sentiments-in-malaysia-says-a |title=Ignorance, extremist Sunnis fuelling anti-Shia sentiments in Malaysia, says academic |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date= |accessdate=6 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106124912/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ignorance-extremist-sunnis-fuelling-anti-shia-sentiments-in-malaysia-says-a |archivedate=6 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing many Shias to practice their religion underground.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/asia/28iht-malay28.html?_r=0|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the Selangor Islamic Religious Council of Malaysia issued a letter which forbade members of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] to offer [[Jumah|Friday prayers]] at their central mosque with immediate effect. Moreover, its failure by the Ahmadis to comply with the terms of the order will result in imprisonment of up to one year and/or a fine up to 3000 Malaysian [[ringgit]]. A large notice has been place outside the mosque which states ''Qadiani Bukan Agama Islam'' which translates to ''Qadiani [Ahmadiyyat] is not an Islamic Religion.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/mais-forbids-ahmadiyya-worship/|title=MAIS forbids Ahmadiyya worship|publisher=thenutgraph|accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepersecution.org/press/09/my090428.html|title=ISLAMIC COUNCIL IN MALAYSIA ISSUES NOTICE TO AHMADIYYA MUSLIM JAMAAT PREVENTING USE OF CENTRAL MOSQUE|publisher=thepersecution|accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination against atheists==
The state has come under criticism from [[human rights]] organisations for its discrimination against atheists.&lt;ref name=reuters131210&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/10/us-religion-atheists-idUSBRE9B900G20131210|title=Atheists face death in 13 countries, global discrimination: study|author=Robert Evans|date=9 December 2013|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, Minister in the [[Prime Minister's Department]] [[Shahidan Kassim]] declared that "atheism is against the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]] and the basic human rights" in Malaysia since "there is no provision on atheism" in the Constitution. Shahidan wanted atheists and atheist groups like the Kuala Lumpur chapter of [[Atheist Republic]] to be identified and hunted down. He also stated that "we need to restore the faith back in them, especially for Muslims. Actually they don't really want to be an atheist, but they lack knowledge about religion and that is why they are easily swayed to the [[new age]] teaching".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minister urges govt to hunt down atheist group|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/08/08/minister-urges-govt-hunt-down-atheist-group|work=[[The Sun (Malaysia)]]|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki]], Deputy Minister in the [[Prime Minister's Department (Malaysia)|Prime Minister's Department]] in charge of Islamic affairs, stated that the group Atheist Republic will be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kumar|first1=Kamles|title=Atheists in Malaysia should be hunted down, minister says|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/atheists-malaysia-hunted-down-minister-says-100400984.html|accessdate=9 August 2017|work=[[Yahoo News]]|date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places of worship==
The government generally respects non-Muslims' right of worship; however, state governments carefully control the building of non-Muslim places of worship and the allocation of land for non-Muslim cemeteries. Approvals for such permits sometimes are granted very slowly.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The [[Catholic]] Society of [[Shah Alam]] had been lobbying the state government for a permit to build a church in that city for more than 10 years. It was not until recently that the permit was finally granted. The church opened its doors on 10 September 2005.

The new pre-planned capital of Malaysia, [[Putrajaya]], features a grand mosque as a prominent feature of the planned community. On 16 November 2005, Archbishop [[Murphy Pakiam]] announced that the Malaysian government had generously allocated a parcel of land in Putrajaya to the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur for building a Catholic church-run community centre. The Putrajaya Catholic Church Building Committee was set up on 3 October 2005. According to the committee, "The architectural planning and design will conform to the Liturgical requirements complimenting the ambience of Putrajaya's lush greenery and landscape. We envisage the Putrajaya church to be a hallmark of the Catholic community in Malaysia and showcase the rich heritage of the Malaysian Catholics."

==Destruction of Hindu Temples==
{{See also|Hinduism in Malaysia|Cow head protests|HINDRAF|2007 HINDRAF rally}}

Approximately nine percent of the population of [[Malaysia]] are Indians, of whom nearly 90 percent are practising [[Hindus]]. Indian settlers came to Malaysia from India in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

After a violent conflict in [[Penang]] between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s in March 1998, the government announced a nationwide review of unlicensed Hindu temples and shrines. However, implementation was not vigorous and the program was not a subject of public debate. In April 2006, local authorities demolished several Hindu temples to make way for developmental projects. Their excuse was that these temples were unlicensed and squatting on government land.

Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row – a dab of sensibility please],''malaysiakini.com''&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061104235008/http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html Muslims Destroy Century-Old Hindu Temple,''gatago.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the Consumers Association of [[Subang, Selangor|Subang]] and [[Shah Alam]] in [[Selangor]] had been helping to organise efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of [[Shah Alam]] from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4965580.stm Pressure on multi-faith Malaysia],''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus. The "Hindu Rights Action Force", a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the Malaysian Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |date=4 July 2007 }},''Financial Express''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a lawyer for the Hindu Rights Action Task Force, a [[Hindu temple]] is demolished in [[Malaysia]] once every three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-30397720071108?pageNumber=1 Malaysia ethnic Indians in uphill fight on religion] Reuters India – 8 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian Muslims have also grown more [[anti-Hindu]] over the years. In response to the proposed construction of a temple in [[Selangor]], Muslims chopped off the head of a cow to protest, with leaders saying there would be blood if a temple was constructed in [[Shah Alam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h5RWG2ScAdC9V7eo-B6-KfUL3QjgD9ABV6U81 Malaysia Muslims protest proposed Hindu temple] Associated Press – 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws in the country, especially those concerning religious identity, are generally slanted towards compulsion into converting to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailypioneer.com/230183/Malaysia-strips-Hindus-of-rights.html Malaysia strips Hindus of rights] Daily Pioneer – 19 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Azan==
The first Islamic call to prayer or Azan (also spelt [[Adhan]]), known as [[Fajr|"subuh"]] (or dawn), occurs between as early as 4.30&amp;nbsp;AM to as late as 6.15&amp;nbsp;AM (depending on which region, city and state) with the exact time drifting throughout the year. Most Malaysian businesses start work as early as 7&amp;nbsp;AM up till as late as 9&amp;nbsp;AM.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Many mosques amplify the early prayer call by way of loud speakers, and while in some cases only a few neighbouring homes are affected, some large mosques (for example the State Mosque of Selangor which has speakers on its minarets) have prayer calls which can be heard in a large surrounding area.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2004 the [[Bar Council of Malaysia]] journal "Infoline" carried an article which questioned the need for the Azan as it was disturbing to non-Muslims and not needful.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} The article was condemned because Azan is a religious requirement.{{citation needed|reason=By who?|date=March 2016}}

In December 2004, Minister of Culture, Arts and Heritage Datuk Seri Utama Dr [[Rais Yatim]] mentioned in an interview that the Azan may be disturbing. He stated "...the Muslim call for Subuh (dawn) prayer may disturb the sleep of non-Muslims but they have accepted this as a fundamental part of [[Islam]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} But how loud the volume of the [[Public address|PA]] system in the mosque should be, is another matter."&lt;ref&gt;New Strait Times, 20 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive noise however is common matter of uneasiness among some Malaysians because non-Muslims also often practise rituals that cause much discomfort to others (Muslims and non-Muslims alike).{{citation needed|reason=Seems to be a very childish retort without fact |date=March 2016}} Among these are Chinese funeral processions that are often accompanied by drums and cymbals, and other rituals not exclusive to the Chinese.{{citation needed|reason=Seems to be a very childish retort without fact |date=March 2016}}

A local daily, The Star reported that a proposal by Kepong MP Dr [[Tan Seng Giaw]] to regulate the Azan so that it will not be too loud or disturb non-Muslims caused a stir in the [[Dewan Rakyat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2005%2F9%2F28%2Fparliament%2F12168612&amp;sec=parliament|title=28-Sep-2005 issue|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713060706/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2005%2F9%2F28%2Fparliament%2F12168612&amp;sec=parliament|archivedate=13 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim MPs accused him of being insensitive and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk [[Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz]] blasted the DAP member for allegedly trying to destroy the multi-religious tolerance in the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Taxation==
In Malaysia, there is a rebate in [[income tax]] for money paid to the government in form of "[[zakat]]", or the obligatory alms Muslims must give to the poor. However, money paid to other causes in the name of other religions under similar circumstances is given only income tax relief, and such relief is given only if the particular beneficiary has obtained approved status from the Malaysian Government, which is difficult in practice. Money donated to such approved beneficiary is only deducted from the income on which the amount of tax is based, while zakat is deducted from the amount of tax itself. For example, suppose a person earning RM 50,000 owes a tax of RM 3,000 and donates RM 1,000 to zakat, the whole of the RM 1,000 is directly deducted from the RM 3,000, whereas donations to other approved beneficiary would permit only a deduction of the RM 1,000 against the RM 50,000. The former being a tax credit and the latter being a tax deduction.

Zakat (or tithe) monies, however, are paid by Muslims directly to official organisations run by state governments. Receipts are issued out and must be submitted to apply for tax relief.
The zakat organisations themselves are governed by specific Islamic rulings defining the categories of people who qualify to receive the alms as well as the amount to be paid out by Muslims based on their income.

In contrast, charities in Malaysia are run privately by voluntary organisations, collecting voluntary donations from the general public, not compulsory tithes – thus the difference in treatment by the government.

Additionally, income tax relief granted to companies for donation made to tax exempt charities is restricted to 5% of the aggregate income of the company. Not all non-Muslim charities are granted tax exempt status, it is only given to registered and approved charities, partly to prevent abuse. There are stringent requirements to gain this advantage. Having earned this advantage these charities are further disadvantage in that their prospective donors are discouraged from donating monies to these charities because the donors are given tax relief for up to 5% of their aggregate income only.

==Inheritance under Sharia law==
Upon the death of a Muslim, his or her [[Estate (law)|estate]] shall be distributed according to [[sharia|sharia law]]. This is called the ''Faraid'' or the Islamic law of Inheritance. A Muslim is allowed to make a [[Will (law)|will]], called a ''wasiat'', but only one-third of his estate shall be disposed of according to the will. Furthermore, the requirement under sharia law is that disposition according to wills shall not benefit any person opposed to Islam as a religion. This situation applies throughout [[Peninsula Malaysia]] and [[Sabah]]. In [[Sarawak]], a Muslim testator may dispose one-third of his property to anyone he or she wishes.

==Freedom of expression==

=== Films ===
Movies which depict people considered prophets in Islam are generally censored or banned as the depiction of prophets is considered "[[haraam]]" (not allowed) under Islam. One notable case was the banning of ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' when its producers would not accept censorship of the character [[Moses]] (Musa in Islam).

However, in a more recent case, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' was allowed, after the intervention of the Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, under strict conditions restricting its viewership to Christians with sales of tickets being carried out by various churches and para-church organisations.

In 2004, Yasmin Ahmad's (herself a Malaysian Muslim) film ''[[Sepet]]'' was rejected by censors who asked that scenes be removed. 10 scenes were objectionable. Among objectionable material queried in the movie was why the movie did not depict any attempt to convert Jason (the Chinese non-Muslim main character) to Islam after he had fallen in love with a Malay girl.

In 2014 the biblical film [[Noah (2014 film)|Noah]] was banned by the Malaysian authorities reasoning that the film was un-Islamic.

The Catholic Church began its challenge of the government gag order prohibiting it from using the word "Allah" in its Herald-The Catholic Weekly- through a judicial review. The government had earlier argued that the church's application is frivolous and had urged the court to throw it out but [[Madam Justice]] Lau Bee Lan disagreed and allowed the application by the Titular Roman [[Catholic]] [[Archbishop]] of Kuala Lumpur, Datuk [[Murphy Pakiam]], for leave to sue the government regarding the use of the word "Allah" to proceed. Three points that were raised in the lawsuit. The first is for the court to declare that the government's action in prohibiting The Herald from using the word "Allah" is illegal and null and void. The second is for a court declaration that the Archbishop as publisher of The Herald is entitled to use the word "Allah" and lastly, that the court should declare that the word "Allah" is not exclusive to the religion of Islam.&lt;ref name="SinChew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/10953?tid=4|publisher=Sin Chew|date=5 May 2008|title=Court Allows Archbishop To Sue Govt|accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual words ===
Under subsection 48(3) and (4) of the Penang Islamic Religious Administration Enactment 2004, the Mufti of Penang state is allowed to pass legally binding religious rulings, or ''fatwa''. In 2010, this power was used to pass a fatwa which would penalize non-Muslims for using the following words, or to write or publish them, in any form, version or translation in any language or for use in any publicity material in any medium:
''"Allah", "Firman Allah", "Ulama", "Hadith", "Ibadah", "Kaabah", "Qadhi'", "Illahi", "Wahyu", "Mubaligh", "Syariah", "Qiblat", "Haji", "Mufti", "Rasul", "Iman", "Dakwah", "Wali", "Fatwa", "Imam", "Nabi", "Sheikh", "Khutbah", "Tabligh", "Akhirat", "Azan", "Al Quran", "As Sunnah", "Auliya'", "Karamah", "Syahadah", "Baitullah", "Musolla", "Zakat Fitrah", "Hajjah", "Taqwa" and "Soleh".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penang mufti outlaws 40 words to non-Muslims|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/penang-mufti-outlaws-40-words-to-non-muslims-1.459685|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111074402/http://www.nst.com.my/nation/general/penang-mufti-outlaws-40-words-to-non-muslims-1.459685|archivedate=11 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="penang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mufti.penang.gov.my/index.php/en/fatwa/islamic-religious-administration-enactment-2004 |title=ENACTMENT |publisher=mufti.penang.gov.my |accessdate=14 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421082325/http://mufti.penang.gov.my/index.php/en/fatwa/islamic-religious-administration-enactment-2004 |archivedate=21 April 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling caused uproar, particularly in the [[Sikh]] community, as Sikh religious texts use the term "Allah", with members of the community calling the law unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/check-law-first-karpal-asks-penang-government-over-decree-banning-muslim-wo|title=Check law first, Karpal asks Penang government over decree banning 'Islamic words'|newspaper=Malaysia Insider|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115063512/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/check-law-first-karpal-asks-penang-government-over-decree-banning-muslim-wo|archivedate=15 January 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was overturned in 2014, as Penang lawmakers decreed that the Penang Islamic Religious Administration Enactment law only gave the Mufti permission to pass ''fatwas'' for the Muslim community, and that these bans were not enforceable on non-Muslim individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/non-muslims-can-use-word-allah-penang|title=Non-Muslims can use the word ‘Allah’ in Penang|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2014|website=TODAYonline|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests against religious freedom==

On 5 November 2006, a group of Muslims gathered outside the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, Silibin, in the town of Ipoh, Perak to protest an alleged conversion of Muslim Malays out of Islam. The allegation was spread via a text message that claimed the church would baptise a group of Muslim Malays. The message proved to be false as the church celebrated only a Holy Communion service for 110 Indian children. The message further alleged that a famous Malaysian sportsman [[Azhar Mansor]] was leaving Islam to embrace Christianity. The police had traced the message to a lady who had met [[Harussani Zakaria]], mufti of the state of Perak in a meeting. He has stated that the message was to remain within the confines of the meeting but had made no attempt to verify the authenticity of the message nor report it to the police as converting Muslims is illegal under Malaysian law. On 17 November, Azhar Mansor declared that he had not renounced Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=16145 Mariner Azhar: I have not renounced Islam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208155950/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=16145 |date=8 December 2008 }}, theSun, 17 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and Umno president Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that there should now be an end to the speculation.

[[Image:EASS Temple Nairobi.jpg|200px|thumb|Right|[[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Nairobi (EASS)|Swaminarayan temple]] in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]]]
[[Mauritius]] is the only [[African Union]] country where Hinduism is the dominant religion, with 56.4%  of the population as followers in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Pew Research Center (December 18, 2012). [https://web.archive.org/web/20130101080244/http://features.pewforum.org/grl/population-percentage.php Religious Composition by Country 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hinduism took root in Africa from the late 19th century onwards through the spread of the [[British Empire]], which colonized huge swaths of land throughout [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], including almost the entirety of the Indian subcontinent. Many Indians were recruited as indentured servants throughout the British Empire, settling mainly in the British colonies of [[British Empire#Cape to Cairo|Southern]] and [[British East Africa|Eastern Africa]]. The descendants of these settlers often chose to remain in Africa after the end of colonial rule, developing Indo-African communities that remain to this day.

Hinduism is non-proselytizing religion and was usually not propagated to the same lengths or through the same means as Christianity and Islam.  As such, it has mostly been confined to practise by the Indo-African communities of these countries. However, in post-colonial Africa, a small-scale movement for Hinduism and its propagation ''outside'' the Indo-African community has occurred, spearheaded by such individuals as [[Swami Ghanananda (Ghana)|Swami Ghanananda]], the first Hindu [[swami]] of [[Ghana]].  Today, [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]], which did not receive an original influx of Indian migrants as did countries such as South Africa and Uganda, is home to over 25,000 Hindus, mostly local converts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206063957/http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter8.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent, post-independence Indian immigrants.  This was primarily the work of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON) missionaries.

While Hinduism has been cited as possessing many parallels to traditional African religions,&lt;ref&gt;https://ramanan50.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/african-religion-hinduism-similatities/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://history-of-hinduism.blogspot.co.nz/2010/07/hinduism-and-ancient-egyptian-religion.html&lt;/ref&gt; it has received opposition from the entrenched Christian elites and Muslim minorities of these countries. The [[Swaminarayan faith]] has a sizable following in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=tPkexi2EhAIC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=swaminarayan+africa+population&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uif6WoiE7W&amp;sig=F8WhSuhapKjUn-GjR_S_OORhCh4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mq37VPmqBYe68gWnnYCgBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=swaminarayan%20africa%20population&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Several temples belonging to the faith have been built in [[Hinduism in Kenya|Kenya]], [[Hinduism in Uganda|Uganda]], [[Hinduism in Tanzania|Tanzania]] and [[Hinduism in Zambia|Zambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.swaminarayan.info/MainMandirs.aspx | title=Swaminarayan Mandirs | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506054600/http://www.swaminarayan.info/MainMandirs.aspx | archivedate=2009-05-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]] is a recent phenomenon in [[West Africa]] most notably [[Ghana]] where it is said to be the fastest growing religion. However the [[Hindu]] presence in other West African states is limited to [[South Asian]] people residing in countries like [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]].

==Central Africa==
According to the PEW Research Centre, there are more than 100,000 [[Hindus]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

==East Africa==

The Eastern region of Africa is home to many migrant communities from [[India]]. This region is home to various [[Hindu temples]] mainly in [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]]. The country of [[Mauritius]], retaining a Hindu majority is found in Eastern Africa.

==Southern Africa==

{{Nihongo|'''Hōonkō'''|報恩講}} is a holiday in the tradition of Japanese [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhism that observes the memorial of its founder, [[Shinran]] Shonin.  Depending on whether the old Japanese lunar calendar is used, or the western [[Gregorian calendar]], typically this holiday is observed either in around November 28 (as in the Higashi Honganji) or early January from the 9th to the 16th (as in the Nishi Honganji) respectively.  This holiday is among the most important observed in the Jodo Shinshu tradition.  The observance began after Shinran's daughter, [[Kakushinni]] carried on administration of Shinran's mausoleum, as did her descendants, who ultimately became the [[Monshu]] of Jodo Shinshu. In the word ''hōonkō''; 'hōon' means "return of 
gratitude" and 'ko' means "to clarify the meaning of" or "gathering"'.

A typical service for Hoonko will consist of reciting Shinran's hymn, the [[Shoshinge]], and a reading from the life of Shinran.  Followers will sometimes observe a strict diet that day, preferring to eat ''shōjin ryōri'' or "[[Buddhist cuisine]]", though this is strictly optional.  Temple services will often serve Buddhist cuisine after service including vegetarian [[Zōni|ozoni]], [[adzuki]] and [[mochi]].

[[Image:llorona.jpg|thumb|Mexican Police arresting ''La Llorona'']]
In Mexican  folklore, '''La Llorona''' ({{IPA-es|la ʝo.ˈɾo.na|pron}}, "The Weeping Woman") is a ghost of a woman who lost her children and now cries while looking for them in the river, often causing misfortune to those who are near, or who hear her. There is no credible source or evidence to the events that inspired the tale/legend of La Llorona.

==Legend==
The legend is said that in a rural village there lived a young woman named Maria. Maria came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman traveled through her village. He stopped in his tracks when he saw Maria. Maria was charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Maria's family was thrilled that she was marrying into a wealthy family, but the nobleman's father was extremely disappointed that his son was marrying into poverty. Maria and her new husband built a house in the village to be away from his disapproving father. Eventually Maria gave birth to twins: a boy and a girl. Her husband was always traveling, and stopped spending time with his family. When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and Maria knew her husband was falling out of love with her. One day, he left and never returned. Years later, as Maria and her twins were walking by a river, she saw a familiar carriage with a younger, beautiful woman next to her husband. Maria was so angry and confused that, without thinking, she picked up her two children and threw them into the river, drowning them. Only after she saw their bodies floating in the river did she realize what she had done and she then jumped into the river, hoping to die with her children. Now she spends eternity looking for her children around that river. It is said that if you hear her crying, you are to run the opposite way. If you hear her cries, they could bring misfortune or even death. Many parents in Mexico and Guatemala use this story to scare their children from staying out too late.

At the gates of [[heaven]], she was challenged over the whereabouts of her children, and not permitted to enter the afterlife until she found them. Llorona is forced to wander the Earth for all eternity, searching in vain for her drowned offspring. She constantly weeps, hence her name "La Llorona."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|title=LA LLORONA - A HISPANIC LEGEND|website=www.literacynet.org|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is caught between the living world and the spirit world.&lt;ref name="The Legend of La Llorona"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Aragon|first1=Ray John|title=The Legend of La Llorona|date=2006|publisher=Sunstone Press|location=Santa Fe, NM|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some versions of the tale, La Llorona kidnaps wandering children who resemble her missing children, asks them for forgiveness, then kills them to take the place of her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/mexico/mexicomix/article/Mexico-s-legend-of-La-Llorona-continues-to-3933072.php|title=Mexico's legend of La Llorona continues to terrify|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who claim to have seen her say she appears at night or in the late evening by rivers or lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imaginespirit.com/the-chilling-legend-of-la-llorona/|title=Chilling Legend of La Llorona {{!}} Psychic-Mediumship Training|website=imaginespirit.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe those who hear the wails of La Llorona are marked for death but those who escape in time are not, as in the Gaelic [[banshee]] legend.&lt;ref name="The Legend of La Llorona"/&gt; Amongst her wails she is noted as crying "¡Ay mis hijos!" which translates to "Oh my children!" In the Guatemalan version of the legend, it is said that when her wails sounds near she is actually far and when she sounds distant- she is actually very near.[https://books.google.com/books?id=pUAhNtrO-xYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=la+calle+donde+tu+vives+la+llorona&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_2MWHWv9ef&amp;sig=N5VM6ATvSD2F2A4GGJTRNQavXQY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwibyuPPj5veAhVj94MKHSLICRkQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=la%20calle%20donde%20tu%20vives%20la%20llorona&amp;f=false] 

It should be noted that the folklore will vary dependent on the location as it is not specific to any one region and is known throughout numerous Latin American countries.

==Other folktales==
La Llorona is also sometimes identified with [[La Malinche]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Llorona (The Weeping Woman)|last=Hayes|first=Joe|publisher=Cinco Puntos Press; Bilingual edition|year=2006|isbn=|location=El Paso, Texas|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Nahua woman who served as Cortés' interpreter and mistress who bore his children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.donquijote.org/culture/mexico/history/la-malinche|title=La Malinche - Spanish Conquest of Mexico {{!}} don Quijote|website=donQuijote|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who some say was betrayed by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s. In one folk story of La Malinche, she became [[Hernán Cortés]]' mistress and bore him a child, only to be abandoned so that he could marry a Spanish lady (although no evidence exists that La Malinche killed her children). Aztec pride drove La Malinche to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of the [[New World]] and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with La Llorona's loss.

The [[Chumash people|Chumash]] of Southern California have their own connection to La Llorona. [[Chumash traditional narratives|Chumash mythology]] mentions La Llorona when explaining nunašɨš (creatures of the other world) called the "maxulaw" or "mamismis." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mythology says the Chumash believe in both the nunašɨš and La Llorona and specifically hear the maxulaw cry up in the trees. The maxulaw cry is considered an omen of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Maxulaw is described as looking like a cat with skin of rawhide leather.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e2lC7XcLrzoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=december's%20child%20chumash&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ed. Blackburn, Thomas C. "December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives" p. 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Americas, La Llorona bears a resemblance to the ancient [[Greece|Greek]] tale of the demonic [[demigod]]ess [[Lamia]].&lt;ref name="Folklore: In All of Us, In All We Do"&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklore: In All of Us, In All We Do|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bl39j_0xZfMC&amp;pg=PA110|publisher=University of North Texas Press|isbn=9781574412239|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hera]], Zeus' wife, learned of his affair with Lamia and, out of anger, killed all the children Lamia had with Zeus.&lt;ref name="Folklore: In All of Us, In All We Do" /&gt; Out of jealousy over the loss of her own children, Lamia steals other women's children.&lt;ref name="Folklore: In All of Us, In All We Do" /&gt; In Greek mythology, [[Medea]] killed the two children fathered by [[Jason]] (one of the Argonauts) after he left her for another woman.

Author [[Ben Radford]]'s investigation into the legend of La Llorona, published in ''[[Mysterious New Mexico]]'', traced elements of the story back to a German folktale dating from 1486.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|title=Mysterious New Mexico|date=2014|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=978-0-8263-5450-1|page=228|quote=While the classic image of La Llorona was likely taken from an Aztec goddess named Cihuacoatl, the narrative of her legend has other origins. As Bacil Kirtley (1960) wrote in Western Folklore, "During the same decade that La Llorona was first mentioned in Mexico, a story, seemingly already quite old, of 'Die Weisse Frau' ('The White Lady')—which reproduces many of the features consistently recurring in the more developed versions of 'La Llorona,' was recorded in Germany"; references to "Die Weisse Frau" date back as early as 1486. The story of the White Lady follows a virtually identical plot to the classical La Llorona story.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Natural history==
The legend of La Llorona persists in areas where [[mountain lion]]s are active. The ''[[National Audubon Society|Audubon]] [[Field guide|Field Guide]] to North American Mammals'' notes that the mountain lion's "blood curdling mating call has been likened to a woman's scream."{{fact|date=June 2017}}

==In popular culture==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The plot of the 1961 [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican film]] ''[[The Curse of the Crying Woman]]'' ''(La maldición de la llorona)'' involves the resurrection of the spirit of La Llorona.

La Llorona appeared as the "monster of the week" in the [[NBC]] TV series ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]'', in the ninth episode of [[Grimm (season 2)|the second season]] which first aired on October 2012. In this storyline, she is a ghost-like creature (her exact origin and nature is undefined) who appears in different cities at yearly intervals around Halloween, always luring three children to a point where three rivers meet, attempting to 'sacrifice' these children to regain her own. In the episode, series protagonist Nick Burkhardt and his partner Hank Griffin work with ''wesen'' detective Valentina Espinosa, who lost her nephew to La Llorana some years ago, and manage to save her latest victims, although La Llorana simply vanishes into the water.

La Llorona appeared as the first antagonist in the 2005 [[Pilot (Supernatural)|pilot]] episode of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''. [[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character Sam Winchester destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.

La Llorona briefly appears in the 1973 Mexican film ''Leyendas macabras de la colonia''. La Llorona is mentioned and appears in several episodes of "El Chavo del Ocho" and "El Chapulín Colorado", both comic series written by Roberto Gómez Bolaños, aka Chespirito.

La Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.

In 1995, Mexican playwright Josefina Lopez wrote "Unconquered Spirits", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the "La Malinche" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938  amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker. The play is well noted for its sympathetic portrayal of La Llorona as a victim of oppression.

In Nancy Farmer's 2002 science fiction novel, ''The House of the Scorpion'', and its 2013 sequel book, ''The Lord of Opium'', the main character, Matt, makes several references to La Llorona, often when retelling the story to other main characters or during self-reflection.

La Llorona is mentioned in the 2003 film ''[[Chasing Papi]]'' starring [[Sofía Vergara]], [[Roselyn Sánchez]], [[Jaci Velasquez]], and [[Eduardo Verástegui]]. Her screams can be heard when Thomas (Eduardo) is under stress or confronted by the three women in his life. La Llorona's image is shown a few times in the film too.

The song "She Turned Into Llorona" appears on the 2003 [[Manic Hispanic]] album ''Mijo Goes to Jr. College''.

2006 Mexican horror film ''[[Kilometer 31]]'' is inspired by the legend of La Llorona, and the main evil entity in the film is based on her and her story,

La Llorona has also been the theme character of several of [[Universal Studios]]'s haunted houses during their annual Halloween event, [[Halloween Horror Nights]] (Both Hollywood and Orlando locations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Llorona comes to "Halloween Horror Nights"|url=http://www.latimes.com/visuals/video/65277378-132.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of La Llorona has been turned into a short comic book story by ''Love and Rockets'' writer/artist Gilbert Hernandez. La Llorona is also one of the various names used by Hopey and Terry's punk band in Jaime Hernandez's ''Mechanics ''series.

La Llorana appeared as a ghost in ''Batwoman #1'' (Volume 2) in November 2011. 

"La Llorona" is the ninth episode of Season 2 of Grimm and the thirty-first episode overall. It first aired on October 26, 2012 on NBC. In the episode, La Llorona steals two boys and one girl once a year and drowns them in a river right at midnight on Halloween. While drowning them she asked her dead children to appear and asks them for forgiveness and drowns the other children to take their place. The legend told in the episode is that La Llorona drowned her children after her husband left her for a younger woman. She cries in a river and appears to be killing herself and when someone jumps in to save her, she steals their child. The episode ends with her vanishing in the river while Detective Nick Burnhardt tries to drown her.  

La Llorona appears in Josh Walker's 2014 novel, Luke Coles and the Flower of Chiloe where the Llorona is the mark of one of Luke's hunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Josh|title=Luke Coles and the Flower of Chiloe|date=2015|publisher=Titan InKorp Limited|isbn=978-1785200694|url=https://books.google.com/?id=86_wrQEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Llorona also is a short film which was released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Llorona (2015)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4006248/|website=IMDb|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Llorona is the basis for the "monster of the week" in the fifth episode of the [[Sleepy Hollow (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Sleepy Hollow (TV series)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' entitled "The Weeping Lady".

Morgana, a playable character in ''[[League of Legends]]'', has a skin called "Ghost Bride" (named "La Llorona" in Spanish). She has different voiceover lines in the Latin American regions (North and South) and the skin was released as a way to celebrate the launch of Latin American servers.

The sixteenth track of the [[Frida_(soundtrack)|Frida Soundtrack]] is titled "La Llorona".  It is sung by [[Chavela Vargas]].

The twelfth track from the self-titled album by the Latina punk band FEA is "La Llorona", and is based on the legend, with the cry/lyrics in the chorus of "mis hijos, mis hijos!".

The song “La Llorona” is featured in the 2017 Disney-Pixar film ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'', sung by Imelda Rivera (voiced by Alanna Ubach) during the sunrise concert as she attempts to evade Ernesto de la Cruz who sings the song in duet with her (voiced by Benjamin Bratt with his singing voice provided by Marco Antonio Solís).

In the 2000 Sci-Fi series, ''[[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]]'', La Llorona is the code-name for a Chrysalis' agent modified to be able to consume large amounts of water and spew them out forcibly and at-will.

The debut studio album of [[Lhasa de Sela]] is called "La Llorona".

On March 7, 2018 Primero Soy Mexicana by Angela Aguilar was released on which "La Llorona" is the 7th track. 

[[James Wan]] and [[Gary Dauberman]] are producing a film about La Llorona, titled ''[[The Curse of La Llorona]]''. It is scheduled to be released on April 19, 2019 by [[New Line Cinema]] and [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film will be directed by [[Michael Chaves (director)|Michael Chaves]] and star [[Linda Cardellini]], [[Raymond Cruz]], and [[Patricia Velasquez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloody Disgusting about James Wan's The Curse of La Llorona|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3511144/saw-footage-chapter-2-nun-la-llorona-new-lines-scarediego/|website=Bloody Disgusting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manavta Mandir''' or '''Be Man Temple''' in [[Hoshiarpur]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[India]] was established in 1962 by [[Baba Faqir Chand]] (1886-1981).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=david+lane+m+r+bhagat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YCGfCjI4xC&amp;sig=BIFNBv2u0XwE3op6hEnuKvXDtuk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oDfUSur3FtCV8AaP24yLDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20lane%20m%20r%20bhagat&amp;f=false.|Google Books]  p.154&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to carry forward the mission of his [[religion of humanity]], Faqir, with the financial help from Seth Durga Das established the temple which remained his center of activity till he died in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==The Mission==
There is a tomb (Hindi:समाधि) erected in the premises where Faqir's remains (bones) have been interred. A flag of humanity has been unfurled on it. Though, there is no place of 'tomb' etc. in his Sant Mat (Dayal Faqir Mat), however, his last will in this regard intended a message of selfless service to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He supported the revolution in that city in 1809 and  was elected by [[Sucre|Charcas]] to the [[Tucumán Congress]], serving in 1816 for the declaration. He backed the idea of an [[Inca]]n constitutional monarchy for the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]].

After the Congress moved to [[Buenos Aires]], Sánchez de Loria continued his work there. Around 1817 his wife died and he returned to his hometown and was ordained a priest, becoming a cannon at Charcas Cathedral. When he died he was a priest at [[Tacobamba]] in [[Potosí]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5033">The '''Middle Belt''' is a term used in [[human geography]] to designate a belt region stretching across central [[Nigeria]] longitudinally and forming a transition zone between [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and Southern Nigeria. It is characterised by its lack of a clear majority ethnic group, and is the location of Nigeria's [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]]. The eminence of manifold minority groups, to some degree, constitutes an [[ethno-linguistic]] barrier in the country and draws a separation between the principally [[Islamic]] North and the mainly [[Christian]] south.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Johannes Harnischfeger}}, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ftfXThvfQHkC&amp;pg=PA38 Democratization and Islamic Law: The Sharia Conflict in Nigeria]'' (Frankfurt am Main 2008) p. 38. Campus Verlag. {{ISBN|3593382563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region is a convergence of these cultural domains and maintains a tremendous degree of ethno-linguistic diversity. [[Afro-Asiatic]], [[Nilo-Saharan]], and [[Niger–Congo]] languages are all spoken, which are three of the primary [[African language]] families.

== Dynamics ==
Minorities in Nigeria tend to be dominated by the three largest ethnic groups, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] of North, the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of the Southwest and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] of the Southeast. Surrounded by divergent religious, economic, and cultural histories, the middle belt has been the melting pot where small and large ethno-religious groups in Nigeria have long coexisted, but where they have also increasingly collided over land, resources, identity and political power.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/nigeria/07812.pdf|title = The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy|last = Higazi|first = Adam|date = January 2011|journal = Working Paper|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|issue = 2|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|pages = 3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result is a mixture of recurring conflicts and occasional political unity and solidarity amongst these highly differentiated peoples. An example for the latter was the [[United Middle Belt Congress]] that emerged following Nigeria's independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1960.

In particular, [[Jos]] city in [[Plateau State]] has been a centre for ethno-religious disputes and violence since the 1990s. The [[The Jos Forum Inter-communal Dialogue Process|Jos Forum Inter-Communal Dialogue process]] spanned 16 months from August 2013 - December 2014, and refers to a peace process undertaken by communities living in Jos that concluded in a “Declaration of Commitment to Peace”.

In 2018 violence escalated, with battles for scarce resources leading to over 500 deaths and 50 towns being destroyed. The clashes were largely between Muslim [[Fulani]] [[pastoralists]] and Christian [[Berom people| Berom]] farmers.  Over 300,000 people have been displaced by the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/africa/nigeria-herders-farmers.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=9&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/africa/nigeria-herders-farmers.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click|title=Nigeria’s Farmers and Herders Fight a Deadly Battle for Scarce Resources|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle Belt Area Definition ==
{{unsourced section|date=September 2018}}
Areas of Nigeria which are generally referred to as belonging to the Middle Belt are: [[Kwara State]], [[Kogi State]], [[Benue State]], [[Taraba State]], [[Plateau State]], [[Nasarawa State]], [[Niger State]], [[Adamawa State]], the [[Federal Capital Territory]] ([[Abuja]]), as well as the southern parts of [[Kaduna State]], [[Kebbi State]], [[Bauchi State]], [[Gombe State]], [[Yobe State]] and [[Borno State]].

The definition of the Middle Belt areas are subject to great debate due to the presence of significant number of ethnic [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Fula people|Fulani]] and [[Kanuri people|Kanuri groups]]. In addition, the Yoruba of [[Kwara State|Kwara]] and [[Kogi State|Kogi]] have a strong affinity with the larger Yoruba body and frequently prefer not to be associated with the Middle Belt identity.
The population of the middle belt is estimated to be over 35 million or more who are predominantly Christians and some few Muslim converts. The area also has a very large significant number of the Hausa-Fulanis who are roughly 20% percent of the population.
The Christians make about 70-75% of the population while the Muslims constitute 25-30% of the population.

'''Mount Sembrano''' is a [[mountain]] located between [[Rizal]] and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] of the [[Regions of the Philippines|CALABARZON region]] in the [[Philippines]]. Mt. Sembrano is situated about {{convert|60|km}} east by road from the capital city of [[Manila]].
[[File:Pililla,Rizaljf6742 13.JPG|thumb|Mount Sembrano as seen from Boulevard, Barangay Wawa, [[Pililla, Rizal]] ([[Laguna de Bay]]).]]

==Geography==
Mount Sembrano lies between the boundaries of the towns of [[Jalajala, Rizal|Jalajala]] and [[Pililla, Rizal|Pililla]] in Rizal province and the town of [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]].  The mountain sits at the helm of Jalajala [[peninsula]] along the shore of [[Laguna de Bay]] and is surrounded by the lake on three sides.  Along with [[Talim Island]], the mountain forms the southeastern rim of the [[Laguna Caldera]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0703-08= "Laguna Caldera"]. Global Volcanism Program. Retrieved on 2011-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hiking==
Once a haven of [[New People's Army]] insurgents, the mountain is now a popular hiking destination offering a commanding view of [[Laguna de Bay]], [[Talim Island]], and the [[CALABARZON|Tagalog]] provinces of [[Rizal]] and [[Laguna Province|Laguna]].&lt;ref name="Henson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Modina"&gt;{{Citation | last=Modina  | first=Cesar  | title=Waypoint:Mount Sembrano | date= | year=2007 | url=http://www.waypoints.ph/detail_gen.html?wpt=mtsemb | accessdate=2007-09-30  }}&lt;/ref&gt;   ''Mount Susong Dalaga'' (Maiden's breast Mountain), a conical hill resembling the [[breast|female breast]] which is the highest peak of neighboring [[Talim Island]], is best observed from Mt. Sembrano.&lt;ref name="Henson"/&gt;  Other mountains visible from the summit are [[Mount Banahaw]], [[Mount Makiling]] and the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre Mountains]].

===Starting point===
The most common starting point for the climb up the mountain is from the [[Barangay]] Hall in Brgy. Malaya in [[Pililla, Rizal]] where climbers must register themselves. The hike to the grassy summit which is fully exposed to the sun, takes about three to four hours. Another trail starts from the Laguna side of the mountain in the town of Pakil, but is rarely used.&lt;ref name="pinoymountaineer"&gt;{{Citation | last= | first= | author-link= | title=PinoyMountaineer: Mount Sembrano | date=13 September 2007  | url=http://pinoymountaineer.blogspot.com/2007/09/mt-sembrano-745.html | accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Our Lady of Maulawin===
Mount Sembrano is considered sacred by some people and known for the legend of the miraculous discovery of the icon of [[Our Lady of Maulawin]]. In 1909, a group of loggers climbed Mt. Sembrano to cut logs. Felipe Reyno was the one who cut a ''maulawin'' tree. The 5 logs was sold in Sta. Cruz, Laguna. In 1910, when an intended shelter for cows was started, the posts was prepared first. A carpenter took the ''maulawin'' log (molave) but his saw broke because not only it was young, it was also very hard. He borrowed another saw to continue the cutting, he was completely amazed to see an image of the Virgin Mary imprinted in it. It was completely supernatural because resembling like lead in a pencil, any part of the log if cut it has the same image even to the trunks and branches. Two chops of wood is now enshrined at the [[Philippine Independent Church|Aglipayan church]] of [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], one in the side altar and another in an adjacent chapel dedicated for her. A small chapel is placed on the site where the image was discovered.&lt;ref name="Henson"&gt;{{Citation | last=Henson | first=Long | title=Destination: Mt. Sembrano | date= | year= | url= http://www.metropolitanms.org/IT/Mount%20Sembrano.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other points of interest===
Another point along the trail is a big boulder referred to as the ''Simbahan'' (Church) where pilgrims leave candles on the huge rock where footprints imprinted on top are supposedly left by the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name="Henson"/&gt;

Five minutes off the trail is the small Manggahan waterfall, located left of the campsite if you are on your way up. The falls provide water for overnight campers and day trekkers.&lt;ref name="pinoymountaineer"/&gt;

An '''oracionista''' is a specific type of [[curandero|curandera]] who works through prayer and prayer songs (oraciones) to heal the sick.  As with other methods of modern [[Curandero|curanderismo]], this form of prayer healing is heavily influenced by Roman Catholicism as well as the indigenous traditions of a given region. The ability to heal is thought to work through a spiritual gift known as “el don”. The oracionista is thought to have received her healing gift through an apprenticeship, family lineage or visionary experience.

The cult of '''Our Lady of Begoña''' (''Nuestra Señora de Begoña, la Madre de Dios de Begoña'') celebrates an [[Marian apparition|apparition of the Virgin Mary]] at the site of the [[Basilica of Begoña]], in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]].  Affectionately called "Amatxu" (meaning "little mother" in [[Basque language|Basque]]), she is said to have appeared to local people in the early 16th century. The feast day of Our Lady of Begona is 11 October.

==History==
The title was established in Bilbao, at Biscay, Spain where, according to local legend, an 8th-century statue of Our Lady was found the hollow of an oak tree on Mount Artagan.&lt;ref name=Santoro/&gt; In 1672, the Lord of Vizcaya published and engraving of the Virgin along with his coat of arms.

The Basque Country has a long tradition of fishing and seafaring. Basque ship captains travelled regularly to the ports of France, England, the Netherlands and Ireland. Since the 15th century many boats out of Bilbao have carried the name, ''Virgin of Begoña'' or simply ''Begoña''. In 1779 Captain Jaun Bautista de Ajeo and two other Bilbao merchants owned a ship, with a capacity of fifty tons, known as ''Nuestra Senora de Begoña''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3rUNRj05deoC&amp;pg=PA55 Lamikiz, Xabier. ''Trade and Trust in the Eighteenth-century Atlantic World: Spanish Merchants and Their Overseas Networks'', Chap. 2, "Basque Ship Captains and Seamen", Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2010] {{ISBN|9780861933068}}&lt;/ref&gt; Votives left by sailors indicate that Our Lady of Begoña is believed to have helped seamen in distress, who then offered thanks for their safe deliverance.&lt;ref name=Santoro&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXWRgP-0KBkC&amp;pg=PA306 Santoro, Nicholas J., ''Mary In Our Life: Atlas of the Names and Titles of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and Their Place In Marian Devotion'', p. 305, iUniverse, 2011] {{ISBN|9781462040223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tradition tells of an apparition to the people of Bilbao at the site of the present Basilica. Work began on the basilica in 1511. Behind the high altar is what is referred to as "the Virgin's chamber". She is credited with helping to stem the cholera epidemic of 1855.

==Description==
The image, made of linden wood, depicts the Blessed Mother seated in an armless chair wearing a crown, and holding the Child Jesus on her knees, with a red rose in her right hand. Christ is giving a blessing with his right hand and holds and open book in his left. The statue appears to be from the early 14th century, and may have been donated the church by Diego Lopez de Haro, Lord of Biscay, or one of his predecessors.

==Veneration==
In 1900 Our Lady of Begoña received a gold crown during a Pontifical Mass attended by the Apostolic Delegate. In 1903 [[Pius X]] declared her the [[patron saint]] of [[Biscay]]. In 1908 Pius X raised the shrine of Our Lady of Begona to a minor Basilica.

The annual Feria de Nuestra Senora de Begoña has been an important August stop for ''toreros'' for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Lewine, Edward. ''Death and the Sun: A Matador's Season in the Heart of Spain'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, {{ISBN|9780618872305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2012, when many of Spain's politicians attended religious services invoking Mary under various titles, for help with the country's deepening economic crisis, Mayor of Bilbao, Inaki Azkuna, prayed to Our Lady of Begona. "“Those of us who are believers continue to believe that we could be given some help and that we need it. All of society, and not only politicians, is going to have to make a tremendous effort,” he added."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/spanish-politicians-implore-virgin-marys-help-amid-economic-crisis/ "Spanish politicians implore Virgin Mary's help amid economic crisis", Catholic News Agency, August 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phalaris''''' is a genus of [[grass]]es. Various species of ''Phalaris'' grow on every continent except Antarctica. They can be found in a broad range of habitats from below sea level to thousands of feet above sea level and from wet marshy areas to dry places. ''P. arundinacea'' and ''P. aquatica'' are sometimes invasive species in wetlands.

==Alkaloids==
Some ''Phalaris'' species contain [[gramine]], which, in sheep and to a lesser extent in cattle, is [[grass tetany|toxic]] and can cause brain damage, other organ damage, [[central nervous system]] damage, and death.&lt;ref&gt;

''[[Phalaris arundinacea]]'', ''[[Phalaris aquatica]]'', and ''[[Phalaris brachystachys]]'' are known to contain the alkaloids [[dimethyltryptamine|''N'',''N''-DMT]], [[5-MeO-DMT]], and [[Bufotenin|5-OH-DMT]] (bufotenin). Some research has been done into the variability of alkaloids in the ''Phalaris'' grasses.  Strains with high levels of alkaloids are best avoided in locations with grazing cattle and sheep, due to potential toxicity. Such high-alkaloid strains include ''Phalaris aquatica AQ-1'' and the species ''P. brachystachys''. Seasonal and weather patterns also appear to affect alkaloid concentration, as most toxicity occurs in autumn and in times of drought.  Regrowth after grazing or mowing also shows a considerable increase in alkaloids.

In June 2018, mobs of wild [[kangaroo]]s were observed&lt;ref name=""&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-21/grass-to-blame-for-staggering-kangaroos/9886884 Kangaroos under the influence: Grass to blame for staggering death of 'drunken' kangaroos], Jo Printz and Mark Kearney, [[ABC News Online]], 2018-06-21&lt;/ref&gt; suffering from "phalaris staggers" which causes head tremors, a loss of co-ordination and collapse. When phalaris is used to feed livestock, farmers can administer [[cobalt]] to their animals or spray it on their pastures, to protect animals against the effects of phalaris. However, this treatment is not available to wild kangaroos and they suffer from the alkaloid poisoning. The staggers syndrome is more common in livestock in areas with [[limestone]] soils, which contained less cobalt than [[basalt]] soils.

None of the above alkaloids is said to have been found in ''P. californica'', ''P. canariensis'', ''P. minor'' and hybrids of ''P. arundinacea'' together with ''P. aquatica''.&lt;ref name="lycaeum" /&gt;

==Uses==
Some species are used in dried flower arrangements. ''Phalaris canariensis'' is commonly used for [[Bird food|birdseed]].

''Phalaris arundinacea'' is also being trialled as a potential bioenergy crop in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teagasc.ie/publications/2010/863/863_ReedCanaryGrass.pdf Reed Canary Grass.] Teagasc. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in recent centuries the temporal authority of the papacy has declined and the office is now almost exclusively focused on religious matters.&lt;ref name = "World History" /&gt; By contrast, papal claims of spiritual authority have been increasingly firmly expressed over time, culminating in 1870 with the proclamation of the [[Roman Catholic dogma|dogma]] of [[papal infallibility]] for rare occasions when the pope speaks ''[[ex cathedra]]''—literally "from the [[Chair of Saint Peter|chair (of Saint Peter)]]"—to issue a formal definition of [[dogma|faith]] or [[morals]].&lt;ref name = "World History" /&gt; Still, the Pope is considered one of the world's most powerful people because of his extensive diplomatic, cultural, and spiritual influence on 1.3 billion Catholics and beyond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/HUMANITY/VATMOD.HTM|title=THE ROLE OF THE VATICAN IN THE MODERN WORLD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The World's Most Powerful People|author= |url= https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/#tab:overall/|newspaper= Forbes|date= November 2014|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The World's Most Powerful People|author= |url= https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/|newspaper= Forbes|date= January 2013|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the official representative of the Catholic Church being the largest non-government provider of [[Catholic education|education]] and [[Catholic Church and health care|health care]] in the world,&lt;ref name=Geopolitics&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnew|first=John|title=Deus Vult: The Geopolitics of Catholic Church|journal=Geopolitics|date=12 February 2010|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.1080/14650040903420388}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a vast international network of [[Catholic charities|charities]].

===Title and etymology===
The word ''pope'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] πάππας meaning "father". In the early centuries of [[Christianity]], this title was applied, especially in the east, to all bishops&lt;ref name=ODCC:Pope&gt;{{citation |title=Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-280290-3 |contribution=Pope}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other senior clergy, and later became reserved in the west to the Bishop of Rome, a reservation made official only in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Elwell+%22term+pappa%22 |first=Walter A. |last=Elwell|title='&amp;#39;Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'&amp;#39; |publisher=Baker Academic|year= 2001|isbn= 9780801020759|page=888|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Greer+Lewis+%22any+bishop+or%22 |first=Thomas H.|last= Greer|author2=Gavin Lewis|title=A Brief History of the Western World|publisher=Cengage Learning|year= 2004|isbn=9780534642365|page=172  |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Mazza+%22synonymous+with+bishop%22 |first=Enrico|last= Mazza|title=The Eucharistic Prayers of the Roman Rite|publisher=Liturgical Press|year= 2004|isbn=9780814660782|page=63 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=O%27Malley+%22term+was+applied+to+all+bishops%22 |first=John W.|last= O'Malley|title=A History of the Popes|publisher=Government Institutes|year= 2009|isbn= 9781580512275| page=xv|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Schatz+%22number+of+individual+bishops%22 |first=Klaus|last= Schatz|title=Papal Primacy|publisher=Liturgical Press|year= 1996|isbn=9780814655221|pages=28–29|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record of the use of this title was in regard to the by then deceased [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria]] (232–248).&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica Book VII, chapter 7.7&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the title "pope" in English dates to the mid-10th century, when it was used in reference to [[Pope Vitalian]] in an Old English translation of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"pope, n.1".

===Position within the Church===
The Catholic Church teaches that the pastoral office, the office of [[Shepherd#In religion|shepherding]] the Church, that was held by the apostles, as a group or "college" with [[Saint Peter]] as their head, is now held by their successors, the bishops, with the bishop of Rome (the pope) as their head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Christ's Faithful - Hierarchy, Laity, Consecrated Life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, is derived another title by which the pope is known, that of "Supreme Pontiff".

The Catholic Church teaches that Jesus personally appointed Peter as leader of the Church, and the Catholic Church's dogmatic constitution ''[[Lumen gentium]]'' makes a clear distinction between apostles and bishops, presenting the latter as the successors of the former, with the pope as successor of Peter, in that he is head of the bishops as Peter was head of the apostles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |title='&amp;#39;Lumen gentium'&amp;#39;, 22 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians argue against the notion that Peter was the first bishop of Rome, noting that the episcopal see in Rome can be traced back no earlier than the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 146"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=O'Grady |title=The Roman Catholic church: its origins and nature |page=146 |isbn=0-8091-3740-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of the [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]] who wrote around AD 180 reflect a belief that Peter "founded and organized" the Church at Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J |last=Stevenson |title=A New Eusebius |page=114 |isbn=0-281-00802-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Irenaeus was not the first to write of Peter's presence in the early Roman Church. [[Pope Clement I|Clement of Rome]] wrote in a letter to the Corinthians, ''c.'' 96,&lt;ref name="fn_2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1010.htm |title=Letter to the Corinthians (Clement)|publisher=New Advent |work=Catholic Encyclopedia: The Fathers of the Church|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the persecution of Christians in Rome as the "struggles in our time" and presented to the Corinthians its heroes, "first, the greatest and most just columns", the "good apostles" Peter and Paul.&lt;ref name="Gröber, 510"&gt;Gröber, 510&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius of Antioch]] wrote shortly after Clement and in his letter from the city of Smyrna to the Romans he said he would not command them as Peter and Paul did.&lt;ref name="fn_3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossroadsinitiative.com/library_article/244/Letter_of_Ignatius_of_Antioch_to_the_Romans.html |title=Letter of Ignatius of Antioch to the Romans |publisher=Crossroads Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this and other evidence, such as Emperor Constantine's erection of the "Old St. Peter's Basilica" on the location of St. Peter's tomb, as held and given to him by Rome's Christian community, many scholars agree that Peter was martyred in Rome under [[Nero]], although some scholars argue that he may have been martyred in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Saint Peter the Apostle|year=2013|author=O'Connor, Daniel William|encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/453832/Saint-Peter-the-Apostle/5632/Tradition-of-Peter-in-Rome|page=5|accessdate=14 April 2013|quote=[M]any scholars… accept Rome as the location of the martyrdom and the reign of Nero as the time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |language=German |title=Zeitschr. fur Kirchengesch. |year=1901 |pages=1 sqq., 161 sqq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Secrets of the 12 Disciples'', [[Channel 4]], transmitted on 23 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

First-century Christian communities would have had a group of presbyter-bishops functioning as leaders of their local churches. Gradually, episcopacies were established in metropolitan areas.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 140"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=O'Grady |title=The Roman Catholic church: its origins and nature |page=140 |isbn=0-8091-3740-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioch may have developed such a structure before Rome.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 140"/&gt; In Rome, there were many who claimed to be the rightful bishop, though again Irenaeus stressed the validity of one line of bishops from the time of St. Peter up to his contemporary [[Pope Victor I]] and listed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J |last=Stevenson |title=A New Eusebius |pages=114–115 |isbn=0-281-00802-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers claim that the emergence of a single bishop in Rome probably did not occur until the middle of the 2nd century. In their view, Linus, Cletus and Clement were possibly prominent presbyter-bishops, but not necessarily monarchical bishops.&lt;ref name="O'Grady 146"/&gt;

Documents of the 1st century and early 2nd century indicate that the bishop of Rome had some kind of pre-eminence and prominence in the Church as a whole, as even a letter from the bishop, or patriarch, of Antioch acknowledged the Bishop of Rome as "a first among equals",&lt;ref&gt;{{The Early Christian Church by Chadwick}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the detail of what this meant is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;"From an historical perspective, there is no conclusive documentary evidence from the 1st century or the early decades of the second of the exercise of, or even the claim to, a primacy of the Roman bishop or to a connection with Peter, although documents from this period accord the church at Rome some kind of pre‑eminence" ([http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8523 Emmanuel Clapsis, Papal Primacy], extract from ''Orthodoxy in Conversation'' (2000), p. 110); and "The see of Rome, whose prominence was associated with the deaths of Peter and Paul, became the principle center in matters concerning the universal Church" (Clapsis, p. 102). The same writer quotes with approval the words of [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]]: "In Phanar, on 25 July 1976, when [[Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Patriarch Athenegoras]] addressed [[Pope Paul VI|the visiting pope]] as Peter's successor, the first in honor among us, and the presider over charity, this great church leader was expressing the essential content of the declarations of the primacy of the first millennium" (Clapsis, p. 113).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Christianity (c. 30–325)===
It seems that at first the terms "episcopos" and "presbyter" were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1997 edition revised 2005, page 211: "It seems that at first the terms 'episcopos' and 'presbyter' were used interchangeably".&lt;/ref&gt;  The consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the 1st and 2nd centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Christianity, volume 1, 2006, "The general consensus among scholars has been that, at the turn of the first and second centuries, local congregations were led by bishops and presbyters whose offices were overlapping or indistinguishable."&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that there was probably "no single 'monarchical' bishop in Rome before the middle of the 2nd century...and likely later."&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Christianity, volume 1, 2006, page 418&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars and historians disagree, citing the historical records of [[Ignatius of Antioch|St. Ignatius of Antioch]] (d 107) and [[Irenaeus|St. Irenaeus]] who recorded the linear succession of Bishops of Rome (the popes) up until their own times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} They also cite the importance accorded to the Bishops of Rome in the [[ecumenical council]]s, including the early ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=Brian W. |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9101fea2.asp |title=Papal Authority at the Earliest Councils |journal=This Rock |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=January 1991 |publisher=[[Catholic Answers]] |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002305/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/1991/9101fea2.asp |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early Christian era, Rome and a few other cities had claims on the leadership of worldwide Church. [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], known as "the brother of the Lord", served as head of the [[Jerusalem]] church, which is still honored as the "Mother Church" in Orthodox tradition. [[Alexandria]] had been a center of Jewish learning and became a center of Christian learning. Rome had a large congregation early in the apostolic period whom Paul the Apostle addressed in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], and according to tradition Paul was martyred there. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

During the 1st century of the Church (c. 30–130), the Roman capital became recognized as a Christian center of exceptional importance. [[Pope Clement I|Clement I]], at the end of the 1st century, wrote an epistle to the Church in [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] intervening in a major dispute, and apologizing for not having taken action earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Henry, ''Oxford History of Christianity'', OUP, quote: "Towards the latter part of the 1st century, Rome's presiding cleric, named Clement, wrote on behalf of his church to remonstrate with the Corinthian Christians who had ejected clergy without either financial or charismatic endowment in favor of a fresh lot; Clement apologized not for intervening but for not having acted sooner. Moreover, during the 2nd century the Roman community's leadership was evident in its generous alms to poorer churches. About 165, they erected monuments to their martyred apostles, to Peter in a necropolis on the Vatican Hill, to Paul on the road to Ostia, at the traditional sites of their burial. Roman bishops were already conscious of being custodians of the authentic tradition of true interpretation of the apostolic writings. In the conflict with Gnosticism Rome played a decisive role, and likewise in the deep division in Asia Minor created by the claims of the Montanist prophets."&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are only a few other references of that time to recognition of the [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|authoritative primacy]] of the [[Holy See|Roman See]] outside of Rome. In the [[Declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, theologians chosen by the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches stated: "41. Both sides agree ... that Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St [[Ignatius of Antioch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossroadsinitiative.com/library_article/244/Letter_of_Ignatius_of_Antioch_to_the_Romans.html |title=Letter of Ignatius of Antioch to the Romans: Prologue|publisher=Crossroads Productions |accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the [[bishop]] of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs. Translated into English, the statement means "first among equals". What form that should take is still a matter of disagreement, just as it was when the Catholic and Orthodox Churches split in the Great East-West Schism. They also disagree on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the Bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium." {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the late 2nd century AD, there were more manifestations of Roman authority over other churches. In 189, assertion of the primacy of the Church of Rome may be indicated in [[Irenaeus]]'s ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (3:3:2): "With [the Church of Rome], because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree ... and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the apostolic tradition." In AD 195, [[Pope Victor I]], in what is seen as an exercise of Roman authority over other churches, excommunicated the [[Quartodecimans]] for observing Easter on the 14th of [[Nisan]], the date of the Jewish [[Passover]], a tradition handed down by [[John the Evangelist]] (see [[Easter controversy]]). Celebration of Easter on a [[Sunday]], as insisted on by the pope, is the system that has prevailed (see [[computus]]).

====Middle Ages====
[[File:Gregorythegreat.jpg|thumb|upright|Gregory the Great (''c'' 540–604) who established medieval themes in the Church, in a painting by [[Carlo Saraceni]], c. 1610, Rome.]]
After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the pope served as a source of authority and continuity. [[Pope Gregory I]] (''c'' 540–604) administered the church with strict reform. From an ancient senatorial family, Gregory worked with the stern judgement and discipline typical of ancient Roman rule. Theologically, he represents the shift from the classical to the medieval outlook; his popular writings are full of dramatic [[miracle]]s, potent [[relic]]s, [[demon]]s, [[angel]]s, [[ghost]]s, and the [[Eschatology|approaching end of the world]].{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=517–551}}

Gregory's successors were largely dominated by the [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Exarch of Ravenna]], the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]]'s representative in the [[Italian Peninsula]]. These humiliations, the weakening of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the face of the [[Muslim conquests]], and the inability of the emperor to protect the papal estates against the [[Lombards]], made [[Pope Stephen II]] turn from Emperor [[Constantine V]]. He appealed to the [[Franks]] to protect his lands. [[Pepin the Short]] subdued the Lombards and donated Italian land to the papacy. When [[Pope Leo III]] crowned [[Charlemagne]] (800) as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]], he established the precedent that, in [[Western Europe]], no man would be emperor without being crowned by a Pope.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=517–551}}

The low point of the papacy was 867–1049.{{sfn|Durant|1950|loc=chpt. 4}} This period includes the [[Saeculum obscurum]], the [[Crescentii]] era, and the [[Tusculan Papacy]]. The papacy came under the control of vying political factions. Popes were variously imprisoned, starved, killed, and deposed by force. The family of a certain papal official made and unmade popes for fifty years. The official's great-grandson, [[Pope John XII]], held orgies of debauchery in the [[Lateran Palace]]. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]] had John accused in an ecclesiastical court, which deposed him and elected a layman as [[Pope Leo VIII]]. John mutilated the Imperial representatives in Rome and had himself reinstated as pope. [[History of the papacy (1048–1257)|Conflict between the Emperor and the papacy]] continued, and eventually dukes in league with the emperor were buying bishops and popes almost openly.{{sfn|Durant|1950|loc=chpt. 4}}

In 1049, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]] became pope, at last a pope with the character to face the papacy's problems. He traveled to the major cities of Europe to deal with the church's moral problems firsthand, notably [[simony]] and [[clerical marriage]] and [[concubinage]]. With his long journey, he restored the prestige of the papacy in [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Durant|1950|loc=chpt. 4}}

From the 7th century it became common for European monarchies and nobility to found churches and perform [[investiture]] or deposition of clergy in their states and fiefdoms, their personal interests causing corruption among the clergy.&lt;ref name="H.G.B"&gt;''História Global Brasil e Geral''.

===East–West Schism to Reformation (1054–1517)===
[[File:Mediterranean1400.png|thumb|upright=1.8|A historical map of the Mediterranean states in 1400. The [[Western Schism]] lasted from 1378 to 1417.]]
With the [[East–West Schism]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the Catholic Church split definitively in 1054. This fracture was caused more by political events than by [[Eastern Orthodox – Roman Catholic theological differences|slight divergences of creed]]. Popes had galled the Byzantine emperors by siding with the king of the Franks, crowning a rival Roman emperor, appropriating the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], and driving into Greek Italy.{{sfn|Durant|1950|loc=chpt. 4}}

In the [[Middle Ages]], popes struggled with monarchs over power.&lt;ref name="World History"/&gt;

From 1309 to 1377, the pope resided not in Rome but in [[Avignon]]. The [[Avignon Papacy]] was notorious for greed and corruption.{{sfn|Durant|1957|pp=3–25}} During this period, the pope was effectively an ally of the [[Kingdom of France]], alienating France's enemies, such as the [[Kingdom of England]].{{sfn|Durant|1957|pp=26–57}}

The pope was understood to have the power to draw on the [[Treasury of Merit]] built up by the saints and by Christ, so that he could grant [[indulgence]]s, reducing one's time in [[purgatory]].  The concept that a monetary fine or donation accompanied contrition, confession, and prayer eventually gave way to the common assumption that indulgences depended on a simple monetary contribution.  The popes condemned misunderstandings and abuses, but were too pressed for income to exercise effective control over indulgences.{{sfn|Durant|1957|pp=3–25}}

Popes also contended with the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], who sometimes attempted to assert the authority of [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils]] over the pope's. [[Conciliarism]] holds that the supreme authority of the church lies with a General Council, not with the pope.  Its foundations were laid early in the 13th century, and it culminated in the 15th century.  The failure of Conciliarism to gain broad acceptance after the 15th century is taken as a factor in the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Conciliar theory". Cross, FL, ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Antipope]]s challenged papal authority, especially during the [[Western Schism]] (1378–1417). In this schism, the papacy had returned to Rome from Avignon, but an antipope was installed in Avignon, as if to extend the papacy there.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Eastern Church continued to decline with the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, undercutting Constantinople's claim to equality with Rome. Twice an Eastern Emperor tried to force the Eastern Church to reunify with the West. First in the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1272–1274) and secondly in the [[Council of Florence]] (1431–1449). [[Primacy of the Bishop of Rome|Papal claims of superiority]] were a sticking point in reunification, which failed in any event. In the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] captured [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Reformation to present (1517 to today)===
[[File:Council Trent.jpg|thumb|As part of the Catholic Reformation, [[Pope Paul III]] (1534–49) initiated the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), which established the triumph of the papacy over those who sought to reconcile with Protestants or oppose Papal claims.]]

Popes instituted a [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Reformation]]&lt;ref name="World History"/&gt; (1560–1648), which addressed the challenges of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and instituted internal reforms. [[Pope Paul III]] initiated the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563), whose definitions of doctrine and whose reforms sealed the triumph of the papacy over elements in the church that sought conciliation with Protestants and opposed papal claims.&lt;ref&gt;"Counter-Reformation". Cross, FL, ed., ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.&lt;ref name="World History"/&gt;

In 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] proclaimed the [[dogma]] of [[papal infallibility]] for those rare occasions the pope speaks ''[[ex cathedra]]'' when issuing a solemn definition of faith or [[morals]].&lt;ref name="World History"&gt;Wetterau, Bruce. World history. New York: Henry Holt &amp; co. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the same year, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] [[Capture of Rome|seized Rome]] from the pope's control and substantially completed the [[Italian unification]].&lt;ref name="World History"/&gt;

In 1929, the [[Lateran Treaty]] between the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Holy See]] established [[Vatican City]] as an independent [[city-state]], guaranteeing papal independence from secular rule.&lt;ref name="World History"/&gt;

In 1950, [[Pope Pius XII]] defined the [[Assumption of Mary]] as dogma, the only time that a pope has spoken ''ex cathedra'' since papal infallibility was explicitly declared.

The [[Primacy of Simon Peter|Petrine Doctrine]] is still controversial as an issue of doctrine that continues to divide the eastern and western churches and separate Protestants from Rome.

== Saint Peter and the origin of the papal office ==
{{See also|Primacy of Simon Peter}}
The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that, within the Christian community, the bishops as a body have succeeded to the body of the apostles (''[[apostolic succession]]'') and the Bishop of Rome has succeeded to Saint Peter.&lt;ref name="section880"/&gt;

Scriptural texts proposed in support of Peter's special position in relation to the church include:
*[[Matthew 16]]: {{quote|I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|16:18–19|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*[[Luke 22]]: {{quote|Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|22:31–32|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*[[John 21]]:{{quote|Feed my sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|21:17|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The symbolic keys in the [[Papal coats of arms]] are a reference to the phrase "[[Keys of Heaven|the keys of the kingdom of heaven]]" in the first of these texts. Some Protestant writers have maintained that the "rock" that Jesus speaks of in this text is Jesus himself or the faith expressed by Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lightfoot |first=John |authorlink=John Lightfoot|title=Commentary on Matthew 16:18 |url=http://www.studylight.org/com/jlc/view.cgi?book=mt&amp;chapter=16&amp;verse=18#Mt16_18|work=Commentary on the Gospels |accessdate=23 May 2013 |publisher=StudyLight.org |quote=It is readily answered by the Papists, that "Peter was the rock."

==Election, death and resignation==
===Election===
{{Main|Papal conclave}}
[[File:Christ Handing the Keys to St. Peter by Pietro Perugino.jpg|thumb|''The Giving of the Keys to Saint Peter'' painted by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1492)]]

The pope was originally chosen by those senior [[clergy]]men resident in and near Rome. In 1059 the electorate was restricted to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] of the Holy Roman Church, and the individual votes of all Cardinal Electors were made equal in 1179. The electors are now limited to those who have not reached 80 on the day before the death or resignation of a pope.{{sfn|John Paul II|1996|p=Introduction}} The pope does not need to be a Cardinal Elector or indeed a Cardinal; however, since the pope is the Bishop of Rome, only those who can be ordained a bishop can be elected, which means that any male baptized Catholic is eligible. The last to be elected when not yet a bishop was [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1831, and the last to be elected when not even a priest was [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513, and the last to be elected when not a cardinal was [[Pope Urban VI]] in 1378.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religionnews.com/2013/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-popes-and-conclaves/|title=Popes and conclaves: everything you need to know|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If someone who is not a bishop is elected, he must be given episcopal ordination before the election is announced to the people.{{sfn|John Paul II|1996|pp=88–89}}

The [[Second Council of Lyon]] was convened on 7 May 1274, to regulate the election of the pope. This Council decreed that the cardinal electors must meet within ten days of the pope's death, and that they must remain in seclusion until a pope has been elected; this was prompted by the three-year ''[[sede vacante]]'' following the death of [[Pope Clement IV]] in 1268. By the mid-16th century, the electoral process had evolved into its present form, allowing for variation in the time between the death of the pope and the meeting of the cardinal electors. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Traditionally, the vote was conducted by [[acclamation (Papal elections)|Acclamation]], by selection (by committee), or by plenary vote. Acclamation was the simplest procedure, consisting entirely of a voice vote.

[[File:Konklave Konzilsgebaude Konstanz.jpg|thumb|left|The conclave in [[Konstanz]] where [[Pope Martin V]] was elected]]
The election of the pope almost always takes place in the [[Sistine Chapel]], in a sequestered meeting called a "[[Papal conclave|conclave]]" (so called because the cardinal electors are theoretically locked in, ''cum clave'', i.e., with key, until they elect a new pope). Three cardinals are chosen by lot to collect the votes of absent cardinal electors (by reason of illness), three are chosen by lot to count the votes, and three are chosen by lot to review the count of the votes. The ballots are distributed and each cardinal elector writes the name of his choice on it and pledges aloud that he is voting for "one whom under God I think ought to be elected" before folding and depositing his vote on a plate atop a large chalice placed on the altar. For the [[Papal conclave, 2005]], a special urn was used for this purpose instead of a chalice and plate. The plate is then used to drop the ballot into the chalice, making it difficult for electors to insert multiple ballots. Before being read, the ballots are counted while still folded; if the number of ballots does not match the number of electors, the ballots are burned unopened and a new vote is held. Otherwise, each ballot is read aloud by the presiding Cardinal, who pierces the ballot with a needle and thread, stringing all the ballots together and tying the ends of the thread to ensure accuracy and honesty. Balloting continues until someone is elected by a two-thirds majority. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;With the promulgation of ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]'' in 1996, a simple majority after a deadlock of twelve days was allowed, but this was revoked by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] by ''[[motu proprio]]'' in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Habemus Papam 1415.jpg|thumb|The formal declaration of "[[Habemus Papam]]" after the election of Pope Martin V]]

One of the most prominent aspects of the papal election process is the means by which the results of a ballot are announced to the world. Once the ballots are counted and bound together, they are burned in a special stove erected in the Sistine Chapel, with the smoke escaping through a small chimney visible from [[Saint Peter's Square]]. The ballots from an unsuccessful vote are burned along with a chemical compound to create black smoke, or ''[[fumata nera]]''. (Traditionally, wet straw was used to produce the black smoke, but this was not completely reliable. The chemical compound is more reliable than the straw.) When a vote is successful, the ballots are burned alone, sending white smoke (''[[fumata bianca]]'') through the chimney and announcing to the world the election of a new pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/International/white-smoke-pope-black-smoke-nope-conclave-smoke/story?id=18719208|title = White Smoke, Pope; Black Smoke, Nope: How Conclave Smoke Gets Its Color|date = March 2013|website = ABC News|publisher = |last = Effron|first = Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the [[Papal conclave, 2005]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Conference on the Tenth General Congregations of the College of Cardinals (11 March) and Regarding Events of the Coming Days: Tenth and Last General Congregation|url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/30611.php?index=30611&amp;lang=en|publisher=Holy See Press Office|accessdate=15 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[church bell]]s are also rung as a signal that a new pope has been chosen. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] then asks two solemn questions of the cardinal who has been elected. First he asks, "Do you freely accept your election as Supreme Pontiff?" If he replies with the word ''"Accepto"'', his reign begins at that instant. If he replies ''not'', his reign begins at the inauguration ceremony several days afterward. The Dean asks next, "By what name shall you be called?" The new pope announces the [[regnal name]] he has chosen. If the Dean himself is elected pope, the Vice Dean performs this task. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The new pope is led through the "Door of Tears" to a dressing room where three sets of white papal vestments (''immantatio'') await: small, medium, and large. Donning the appropriate vestments and reemerging into the Sistine Chapel, the new pope is given the "[[Ring of the Fisherman|Fisherman's Ring]]" by the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]], whom he first either reconfirms or reappoints. The pope assumes a place of honor as the rest of the cardinals wait in turn to offer their first "obedience" (''adoratio'') and to receive his blessing. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Cardinal protodeacon|Senior Cardinal Deacon]] announces from a balcony over [[St. Peter's Square]] the following proclamation: ''Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum! [[Habemus Papam]]!'' ("I announce to you a great joy! We have a pope!"). He announces the new pope's [[Christian name]] along with his newly chosen regnal name. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Until 1978 the pope's election was followed in a few days by the [[Papal coronation]], which started with a procession with great pomp and circumstance from the [[Sistine Chapel]] to [[St. Peter's Basilica]], with the newly elected pope borne in the ''[[sedia gestatoria]]''. After a solemn [[Papal Mass]], the new pope was crowned with the ''[[Papal tiara|triregnum]]'' (papal tiara) and he gave for the first time as pope the famous blessing ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' ("to the City [Rome] and to the World"). Another renowned part of the coronation was the lighting of a bundle of [[flax]] at the top of a gilded pole, which would flare brightly for a moment and then promptly extinguish, as he said, ''[[Sic transit gloria mundi]]'' ("Thus passes worldly glory"). A similar warning against papal [[hubris]] made on this occasion was the traditional exclamation, ''"Annos Petri non videbis"'', reminding the newly crowned pope that he would not live to see his rule lasting as long as that of St. Peter. According to tradition, he headed the church for 35 years and has thus far been the longest-reigning pope in the history of the Catholic Church.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;St [[Augustine of Hippo]], speaking of the honours paid to bishops in his time, mentions the ''absides gradatae'' ([[Apse]]s with steps, a reference to the seating arrangement for the presbyters in the apse of the church, with the bishop in the middle ([https://books.google.com/books?id=LTb6zWm5PMcC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22cathedrae+velatae%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3ZR8Te7EM8fOhAeA3uHeBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cathedrae%20velatae%22&amp;f=false William Smith, Samuel Cheetham, ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Christian Antiquities], "elevated stalls" in the [https://www.scribd.com/doc/2512021/Letters-of-Augustine-of-Hippo Sparrow-Simpson translation] (p. 83), and appearing as "thrones ascended by flights of steps" in [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf101.vii.1.XXIII.html the Cunningham translation]), and ''[[cathedra]]e velatae'' (canopied thrones, appearing as "canopied pulpits" in both those translations) – [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ms7AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Augustinus+epistolae&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=knJ8TYm5Hc26hAeE5Yz4Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=maximino&amp;f=false Letter 203 in the old arrangement], 23 in the chronological rearrangement&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[traditionalist Catholic]] belief that lacks reliable authority claims that a [[Papal Oath (Traditionalist Catholic)|Papal Oath]] was sworn, at their coronation, by all popes from [[Pope Agatho]] to [[Pope Paul VI]] and that it was omitted with the abolition of the coronation ceremony.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Latin]] term, ''[[sede vacante]]'' ("while the see is vacant"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ablative absolute]], equivalent to a temporal clause&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a papal [[interregnum]], the period between the death or resignation of a pope and the election of his successor. From this term is derived the term [[sedevacantism]], which designates a category of dissident Catholics who maintain that there is no canonically and legitimately elected pope, and that there is therefore a ''sede vacante''. One of the most common reasons for holding this belief is the idea that the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]], and especially the reform of the [[Tridentine Mass]] with the [[Mass of Paul VI]], are heretical and that those responsible for initiating and maintaining these changes are heretics and not true popes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

For centuries, from 1378 on, those elected to the papacy were predominantly [[Italians]]. Prior to the election of the [[Poles|Polish]] cardinal [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyla]] as Pope John Paul II in 1978, the last non-Italian was [[Pope Adrian VI]] of the [[Netherlands]], elected in 1522. John Paul II was followed by election of the [[Germans|German-born]] [[Pope Benedict XVI]], who was in turn followed by [[Argentines|Argentine-born]] [[Pope Francis]], who is the first non-European after 1272 years and the first Latin American, despite having an Italian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21777141|title=Profile: Pope Francis|date=2017-12-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The current regulations regarding a papal [[interregnum]]—that is, a ''[[sede vacante]]'' ("vacant seat")—were promulgated by [[Pope John Paul II]] in his 1996 document ''[[Universi Dominici Gregis]]''. During the "sede vacante" period, the [[College of Cardinals]]  is collectively responsible for the government of the Church and of the Vatican itself, under the direction of the [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]]; however, [[canon law]] specifically forbids the cardinals from introducing any innovation in the government of the Church during the vacancy of the [[Holy See]]. Any decision that requires the assent of the pope has to wait until the new pope has been elected and accepts office. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In recent centuries, when a pope was judged to have died, it was reportedly traditional for the Cardinal Camerlengo to confirm the death ceremonially by gently tapping the pope's head thrice with a silver hammer, calling his birth name each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.snopes.com/religion/hammer.asp|title = Hammer Time|date = 5 April 2005|accessdate = 2 November 2014|website = Snopes.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not done on the deaths of popes [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]]&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, George E.

A nine-day period of [[mourning]] (''novendialis'') follows the interment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Resignation===
{{Main|Papal resignation}}
It is highly unusual for a pope to resign.&lt;ref&gt;As the reign of the pope has conventionally been from election until death, papal resignation is an uncommon event. Before the 21st century, only five popes unambiguously resigned with historical certainty, all between the 10th and 15th centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P16.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, "If it happens that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that the resignation is made freely and properly manifested but not that it is accepted by anyone." [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], who vacated the [[Holy See]] on 28 February 2013, was the most recent to do so since [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory XII]]'s resignation in 1415.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/11/benedict-placehold-pope-weakened-church | title=Benedict, the placeholder pope who leaves a battered, weakened church | work=The Guardian | date=11 February 2013 | accessdate=12 February 2013 | author=Brown, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regnal name===
Popes adopt a new name on their accession, known as [[papal name|papal]] or [[pontifical name|pontifical]] name. [[Annuario Pontificio|Officially]], the Pope is given an Italian name by virtue of his [[Vatican City|Vatican]] citizenship and a Latin name by virtue of his status as Bishop of the [[Holy See]] of Rome. Currently, after a new pope is elected and accepts the election, he is asked "By what name shall you be called?". The new pope chooses the name by which he will be known from that point on. The senior Cardinal Deacon, or Cardinal Protodeacon, then appears on the balcony of Saint Peter's to proclaim the new pope by his birth name, and announce his papal name in Latin. It's costumary when referring to popes to translate the regnal name into all local languages. Thus, for example, Papa Franciscus is Papa Francesco in Italian, but he is also known as Papa Francisco in his native Spanish, Pope Francis in English, etc.

===Official list of titles===
The official list of titles of the pope, in the order in which they are given in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', is:

{{quote|Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], [[Vicar of Christ|Vicar of Jesus Christ]], Successor of the [[Saint Peter|Prince of the Apostles]], [[Pontifex Maximus|Supreme]] [[Pontiff#Christianity|Pontiff]] of the Universal Church, [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Italy, [[Metropolitan bishop|Archbishop and Metropolitan]] of the [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy#Ecclesiastical Province of Rome|Roman]] [[Ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|Province]], [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]], [[Servant of the servants of God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'', published annually by Libreria Editrice Vaticana, p. 23*. ISBN of the 2012 edition: 978-88-209-8722-0.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The best-known title, that of "Pope", does not appear in the official list, but is commonly used in the titles of documents, and appears, in abbreviated form, in their signatures. Thus [[Pope Paul VI]] signed as "Paulus PP. VI", the "PP." standing for "''papa pontifex''" ("pope and pontiff").&lt;ref&gt;{{cathEncy|author=Shahan, Thomas Joseph|wstitle=Ecclesiastical Abbreviations|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2013|title =Pope |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469994/pope}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkunabeln.ub.uni-koeln.de/vdibDevelop/handapparat/nachs_w/cappelli/cappelli.html |author=Adriano Cappelli |title= Lexicon Abbreviaturarum |page=283 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_11.html |title=Contractions and Abbreviations |publisher=Ndl.go.jp |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Papa+Pontifex |title=What Does PP Stand For? |publisher=Acronyms.thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title "Pope" was from the early 3rd century an honorific designation used for ''any'' bishop in the West.&lt;ref name=ODCC:Pope/&gt; In the East, it was used only for the [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Bishop of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=ODCC:Pope/&gt; [[Pope Marcellinus]] (d. 304) is the first Bishop of Rome shown in sources to have had the title "Pope" used of him. From the 6th century, the imperial chancery of [[Byzantine Empire|Constantinople]] normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome.&lt;ref name=ODCC:Pope/&gt; From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century,&lt;ref name=ODCC:Pope/&gt; when [[Pope Gregory VII]] declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In [[Eastern Christianity]], where the title "Pope" is used also of the Bishop of Alexandria, the Bishop of Rome is often referred to as the "Pope of Rome", regardless of whether the speaker or writer is in communion with Rome or not. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Vicar of Jesus Christ===
"Vicar of Jesus Christ" (''Vicarius Iesu Christi'') is one of the official titles of the Pope given in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. It is commonly used in the slightly abbreviated form "Vicar of Christ" (''Vicarius Christi''). While it is only one of the terms with which the pope is referred to as "Vicar", it is "more expressive of his supreme headship of the Church on Earth, which he bears in virtue of the commission of Christ and with vicarial power derived from him", a vicarial power believed to have been conferred on Saint Peter when Christ said to him: "Feed my lambs...Feed my sheep" ({{bibleverse||John|21:16–17}}).&lt;ref name="New Advent - Vicar of Christ"&gt;{{cathEncy|wstitle=Vicar of Christ|author=Fanning, William Henry Windsor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first record of the application of this title to a Bishop of Rome appears in a synod of 495 with reference to [[Pope Gelasius I]].&lt;ref name="Macbrien"&gt;McBrien, Richard P. ''Os Papas. Os Pontífices de São Pedro a João Paulo II'' (original title: ''Lives of the Popes. The Pontiffs from St. Peter to John Paul II'' 1997. {{ISBN|0-06-065303-5}}), pp. 37, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; But at that time, and down to the 9th century, other bishops too referred to themselves as vicars of Christ, and for another four centuries this description was sometimes used of kings and even judges,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Vicar of Christ''&lt;/ref&gt; as it had been used in the 5th and 6th centuries to refer to the [[Byzantine emperor]].&lt;ref name="New Commentary"/&gt; Earlier still, in the 3rd century, [[Tertullian]] used "vicar of Christ" to refer to the [[Holy Spirit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0311.htm| title= Prescription against Heretics (Chapter 28) | accessdate=14 April 2013|publisher=New Advent| work= Catholic Encyclopedia: The Fathers of the Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0403.htm| title= On the Veiling of Virgins (Chapter 1) | accessdate=14 April 2013|publisher=New Advent| work= Catholic Encyclopedia: The Fathers of the Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; sent by Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{bibleverse||John|16:7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use specifically for the pope appears in the 13th century in connection with the reforms of [[Pope Innocent III]],&lt;ref name="New Commentary"&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/?id=JKgZEjvB5cEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=New+commentary+on+the+Code+of+Canon+Law&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| last= John P.

"''Autoridade da Verdade – Momentos Obscuros do Magistério Eclesiástico''" (Edições Loyola. {{ISBN|85-15-01750-4}}), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians suggest that this title was already used in this way in association with the pontificate of [[Pope Eugene III]] (1145–1153).&lt;ref name="Macbrien"/&gt;

This title "Vicar of Christ" is thus not used of the pope alone and has been used of all bishops since the early centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=7bjDsZHPiSYC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=%22vicar+of+Christ%22+title#v=onepage&amp;q=%22vicar%20of%20Christ%22%20title&amp;f=false |title=The Practical Prophet: Pastoral Writings |page=264 |publisher=Paulist Press |location=New York |year=2007 |author1= Untener, Ken |author2= Picken, Elizabeth |accessdate=21 November 2011|isbn=9780809144297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Vatican Council]] referred to all bishops as "vicars and ambassadors of Christ",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html  |title= Second Vatican Council, Dogmatic Constitution ''Lumen gentium'', 27 | accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this description of the bishops was repeated by [[Pope John Paul II]] in his encyclical ''[http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0221/__PT.HTM Ut unum sint,]'' 95. The difference is that the other bishops are vicars of Christ for their own local churches, the pope is vicar of Christ for the whole Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ78Vd4O9d4C&amp;pg=PA991 |page=991 |first=Russell B. |last=Shaw |location=Huntington, Ind|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor|year=1979 |title=Church &amp; State: A Novel of Politics and Power|accessdate=14 April 2013|isbn=9780879736699 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On at least one occasion the title "Vicar of God" (a reference to Christ as God) was used of the pope.&lt;ref name="New Advent - Vicar of Christ"/&gt;

The title "Vicar of Peter" (''Vicarius Petri'') is used only of the pope, not of other bishops. Variations of it include: "Vicar of the Prince of the Apostles" (''Vicarius Principis Apostolorum'') and "Vicar of the Apostolic See" (''Vicarius Sedis Apostolicae'').&lt;ref name="New Advent - Vicar of Christ"/&gt; [[Saint Boniface]] described [[Pope Gregory II]] as vicar of Peter in the oath of fealty that he took in 722.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/boniface1.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's [[Roman Missal]], the description "vicar of Peter" is found also in the [[collect]] of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] for a saint who was a pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clerus.org/bibliaclerusonline/en/end.htm#cml |title='&amp;#39;Missale Romanum'&amp;#39;, Vatican City, 2008, p. 928 |publisher=Clerus.org |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[pontiff]]" is derived from the {{lang-la|pontifex}}, which literally means "bridge builder" (''pons'' + ''facere'') and which designated a member of the [[College of Pontiffs|principal college of priests]] in ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2013|title =Pontifex|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469745/pontifex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The bridge making has been interpreted in terms of "one who smoothes the way for the gods and to the gods" (Van Haeperen, Françoise, 2002.

In Christian use, ''pontifex'' appears in the [[Vulgate]] translation of the [[New Testament]] to indicate the [[High Priest of Israel]] (in the original [[Koine Greek]], {{lang|grc-x-koine|ἀρχιερεύς}}).&lt;ref&gt;There are 35 instances of the use of this term in the Vulgate: {{bibleverse||Mark|15:11}}; {{bibleverse||John|7:45}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|11:47}},{{bibleverse-nb||John|11:49}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|11:51}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|11:57}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:3}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:10}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:13}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:15–16}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:22}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:24}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|18:35}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|19:6}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|19:15}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|19:21}}; {{bibleverse||Hebrews|2:17}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|3:1}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|4:14–15}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|5:1}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|5:5}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|5:10}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|6:20}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|7:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|8:1}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|8:3}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|9:7}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|9:11}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|9:25}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|13:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term came to be applied to any Christian [[bishop]],&lt;ref name="New Advent - Pope"&gt;{{cathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

The use of the term to refer to bishops in general is reflected in the terms "[[Roman Pontifical]]" (a book containing rites reserved for bishops, such as [[confirmation]] and [[ordination]]), and "pontificals" (the insignia of bishops).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=pontifical |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/pontifical|work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annuario Pontificio'' lists as one of the official titles of the pope that of "Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church" ({{lang-la|Summus Pontifex Ecclesiae Universalis}}).&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2008 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana {{ISBN|978-88-209-8021-4}}), p. 23*&lt;/ref&gt; He is also commonly called the Supreme Pontiff or the Sovereign Pontiff ({{lang-la|Summus Pontifex}}). {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

''Pontifex Maximus'', similar in meaning to ''Summus Pontifex'', is a title commonly found in inscriptions on papal buildings, paintings, statues and coins, usually abbreviated as "Pont. Max" or "P.M." The office of [[Pontifex Maximus]], or head of the [[College of Pontiffs]], was held by [[Julius Caesar]] and thereafter, by the Roman emperors, until [[Gratian]] (375–383) relinquished it.&lt;ref name="smithpontifex"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Gratian|year=2013|encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/242251/Gratian|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/pn-po/pontifex/maximus.html Pontifex Maximus] Livius.org article by Jona Lendering retrieved 15 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]], when he had become a [[Montanist]], used the title derisively of either the pope or the [[episcopal see of Carthage|Bishop of Carthage]].&lt;ref name=ODCC:PM/&gt; The popes began to use this title regularly only in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=ODCC:PM&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Pontifex Maximus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Servant of the servants of God===
Although the description "[[servant of the servants of God]]" ({{lang-la|servus servorum Dei}}) was also used by other Church leaders, including [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Benedict of Nursia]], it was first used extensively as a papal title by [[Pope Gregory I]], reportedly as a lesson in humility for the Patriarch of Constantinople, [[Patriarch John IV of Constantinople|John the Faster]], who had assumed the title "[[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]]". It became reserved for the pope in the 12th century and is used in [[papal bull]]s and similar important papal documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Servus servorum Dei|author=Meehan, Andrew Brennan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patriarch of the West===
{{See also|Patriarch|Pentarchy}}
From 1863 until 2005, the ''Annuario Pontificio'' also included the title "[[Patriarch]] of the West". This title was first used by [[Pope Theodore I]] in 642, and was only used occasionally. Indeed, it did not begin to appear in the pontifical yearbook until 1863. On 22 March 2006, the Vatican released a statement explaining this omission on the grounds of expressing a "historical and theological reality" and of "being useful to ecumenical dialogue". The title Patriarch of the West symbolized the pope's special relationship with, and jurisdiction over, the [[Latin Church]]—and the omission of the title neither symbolizes in any way a change in this relationship, nor distorts the relationship between the Holy See and the [[Eastern Churches]], as solemnly proclaimed by the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/general-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_20060322_patriarca-occidente_fr.html |title=Communiqué concernant la suppression du titre "Patriarche d'Occident" dans l'Annuaire pontifical 2006 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other titles===
Other titles commonly used are "[[His Holiness]]" (either used alone or as an honorific prefix "His Holiness Pope Francis"; and as "Your Holiness" as a form of address), "Holy Father". In Spanish and Italian, "''Beatísimo/Beatissimo Padre''" (Most Blessed Father) is often used in preference to "''Santísimo/Santissimo Padre''" (Most Holy Father). In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], "''[[Dominus Apostolicus]]''" ("the [[Saint Peter|Apostolic]] Lord") was also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1WWdGYowvIC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=medieval+and+%22dominus+apostolicus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9vEyQYS7Fv&amp;sig=s4mfpTPqkt96kLAYvCzOr6aAtEE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwitl73uotHaAhWf2YMKHajqAtAQ6AEwB3oECAAQPw#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20and%20%22dominus%20apostolicus%22&amp;f=false|title=Popes and the Tale of Their Names|last=Guruge|first=Anura|date=2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781434384409|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Francis signs some documents with his name alone, either in Latin ("Franciscus", as in an [[encyclical]] dated 29 June 2013)&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20130629_enciclica-lumen-fidei.html Encyclical letter ''Lumen fidei'']&lt;/ref&gt; or in another language.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are "Francesco" in the frontispiece of the 2013 ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' published in Italian shortly after his election (''Annuario Pontificio 2013'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}) and [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/it/letters/2014/documents/papa-francesco_20140401_cardinale-baldisseri.html a letter in Italian dated 1 April 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; Other documents he signs in accordance with the tradition of using Latin only and including, in the abbreviated form "PP.",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01022a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia:''Ecclesiastical Abbreviations'']&lt;/ref&gt; for the Latin ''Papa Pontifex'' ("Pope and Pontiff").&lt;ref&gt;Examples are documents dated [http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/motu_proprio/documents/papa-francesco-motu-proprio_20130808_prevenzione-contrasto.html 8 August 2013]; [http://www.holyseemission.org/press/release.aspx?id=452 17 January 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514214821/http://www.holyseemission.org/press/release.aspx?id=452 |date=14 May 2014 }}; [http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/de/bollettino/pubblico/2014/04/04/0238/00534.html 2 April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Popes who have an ordinal numeral in their name traditionally place the abbreviation "PP." before the ordinal numeral, as in "Benedictus PP. XVI" (Pope Benedict&amp;nbsp;XVI), except in [[papal bull|bulls]] of canonization and decrees of ecumenical councils, which a pope signs with the formula, "Ego N. Episcopus Ecclesiae catholicae", without the numeral, as in "Ego Benedictus Episcopus Ecclesiae catholicae" (I, Benedict, Bishop of the Catholic Church). The pope's signature is followed, in bulls of canonization, by those of all the cardinals resident in Rome, and in decrees of ecumenical councils, by the signatures of the other bishops participating in the council, each signing as Bishop of a particular see.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Papal bull]]s are headed ''N. Episcopus [[Servant of the servants of God|Servus Servorum Dei]]'' ("Name, Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God"). In general, they are not signed by the pope, but [[Pope John Paul II]] introduced in the mid-1980s the custom by which the pope signs not only bulls of canonization but also, using his normal signature, such as "Benedictus PP. XVI", bulls of nomination of bishops. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Regalia and insignia==
{{Main|Papal regalia and insignia}}
* ''[[Papal tiara|Triregnum]]'', also called the "tiara" or "triple crown", represents the pope's three functions as "supreme pastor", "supreme teacher" and "supreme priest". Recent popes have not, however, worn the ''triregnum'', though it remains the symbol of the papacy and has not been abolished. In liturgical ceremonies the pope wears an episcopal [[mitre]] (an erect cloth hat). {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Crosier]] topped by a [[crucifix]], a custom established before the 13th century (see [[Papal ferula]]). {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Pallium]], or pall, a circular band of fabric worn around the neck over the [[chasuble]]. It forms a yoke about the neck, breast and shoulders and has two pendants hanging down in front and behind, and is ornamented with six crosses. Previously, the pallium worn by the pope was identical to those he granted to the [[Primate (bishop)|primates]], but in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI began to use a distinct papal pallium that is larger than the primatial, and was adorned with red crosses instead of black. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* "Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven", the image of two keys, one gold and one silver. The silver key symbolizes the power to bind and loose on [[Earth]], and the gold key the power to bind and loose in [[Heaven]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* [[Ring of the Fisherman]], a gold or gilt ring decorated with a depiction of St. Peter in a boat casting his net, with the pope's name around it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* ''[[Umbraculum]]'' (better known in the Italian form ''ombrellino'') is a canopy or umbrella consisting of alternating red and gold stripes, which used to be carried above the pope in processions. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
* ''[[Sedia gestatoria]]'', a mobile throne carried by twelve [[footmen]] (''palafrenieri'') in red uniforms, accompanied by two attendants bearing ''[[flabella]]'' (fans made of white ostrich feathers), and sometimes a large [[baldachin|canopy]], carried by eight attendants. The use of the ''flabella'' was discontinued by [[Pope John Paul I]]. The use of the ''sedia gestatoria'' was discontinued by [[Pope John Paul II]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
[[File:Coat of arms Holy See.svg|thumb|upright|The [[coat of arms]] of the Holy See. That of the State of Vatican City is the same except that the positions of the gold and silver keys are interchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/va).html |title=Vatican City (Holy See) – The Keys and Coat of Arms |publisher=Fotw.net |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[heraldry]], each pope has his own [[papal coats of arms|personal coat of arms]]. Though unique for each pope, the arms have for several centuries been traditionally accompanied by two keys in [[saltire]] (i.e., crossed over one another so as to form an ''X'') behind the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] (shield) (one silver key and one gold key, tied with a red cord), and above them a silver ''triregnum'' with three gold crowns and red ''infulae'' ([[lappet]]s—two strips of fabric hanging from the back of the triregnum which fall over the neck and shoulders when worn). This is [[blazon]]ed: "two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or". The 21st century has seen departures from this tradition. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI, while maintaining the crossed keys behind the shield, omitted the papal tiara from his personal coat of arms, replacing it with a [[mitre]] with three horizontal lines. Beneath the shield he added the pallium, a papal symbol of authority more ancient than the tiara, the use of which is also granted to metropolitan [[archbishop]]s as a sign of communion with the See of Rome. Although the tiara was omitted in the pope's personal coat of arms, the coat of arms of the Holy See, which includes the tiara, remained unaltered. In 2013, Pope Francis maintained the mitre that replaced the tiara, but omitted the pallium. He also departed from papal tradition by adding beneath the shield his personal pastoral motto: ''[[Coat of arms of Pope Francis#Motto|Miserando atque eligendo]]''. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[flag]] most frequently associated with the pope is the yellow and white [[flag of Vatican City]], with the arms of the Holy See (blazoned: "Gules, two keys in saltire or and argent, interlacing in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or") on the right-hand side (the "fly") in the white half of the flag (the left-hand side—the "hoist"—is yellow). The pope's escucheon does not appear on the flag. This flag was first adopted in 1808, whereas the previous flag had been red and gold. Although Pope Benedict XVI replaced the triregnum with a mitre on his personal coat of arms, it has been retained on the flag. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Papal garments===
[[Pope Pius V]] (reigned 1566–1572), is often credited with having originated the custom whereby the pope wears white, by continuing after his election to wear the white [[Religious habit|habit]] of the [[Dominican order]]. In reality, the basic papal attire was white long before. The earliest document that describes it as such is the ''Ordo XIII'', a book of ceremonies compiled in about 1274. Later books of ceremonies describe the pope as wearing a red mantle, [[mozzetta]], [[camauro]] and shoes, and a white [[cassock]] and stockings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bagliani|first1=Agostino Paravicini|title=From red to white|url=http://www.osservatoreromano.va/en/news/from-red-to-white|accessdate=29 June 2014|work=Osservatore Romano|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vatican newspaper examines history of red, white papal garb|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=18897|accessdate=29 June 2014|work=Catholic Culture|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary portraits of 15th and 16th-century predecessors of Pius V show them wearing a white cassock similar to his.&lt;ref&gt;Compare the portrait reproduced in the article on Pius V with those in the articles on his immediate predecessors [[Pope Pius IV]] and [[Pope Paul IV]] and in the articles on [[Pope Julius III]], [[Pope Paul III]], [[Pope Clement VII]], [[Pope Adrian VI]], [[Pope Leo X]], [[Pope Julius II]], [[Pope Pius II]], [[Pope Callixtus III]], [[Pope Nicholas V]], and [[Pope Eugene IV]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status and authority==

[[File:Kruisheren uden bij paus pius xii Crosiers from Uden Holland with PiusXII.jpg|thumb|To maintain contacts with local clergymen and Catholic communities, the popes grant private audiences as well as public ones. Here the [[Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross|Canons Regular of the Holy Cross]] from [[Uden]] (Netherlands) are received by [[Pope Pius XII]].]]

===First Vatican Council===
The status and authority of the Pope in the Catholic Church was [[dogma]]tically [[Papal infallibility|defined]] by the [[First Vatican Council]] on 18 July 1870. In its Dogmatic Constitution of the Church of Christ, the Council established the following canons:&lt;ref&gt;The texts of these canons are given in [[Denzinger]], [http://catho.org/9.php?d=byj#dez Latin original;] [http://denzinger.patristica.net/ English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If anyone says that the blessed Apostle Peter was not established by the Lord Christ as the chief of all the [[twelve apostles|apostles]], and the visible head of the whole [[Church militant and church triumphant|militant Church]], or, that the same received great honour but did not receive from the same our Lord Jesus Christ directly and immediately the primacy in true and proper jurisdiction: let him be [[anathema]].&lt;ref&gt;Denzinger 3055 (old numbering, 1823)&lt;/ref&gt;

If anyone says that it is not from the institution of Christ the Lord Himself, or by divine right that the blessed Peter has perpetual successors in the primacy over the universal Church, or that the Roman Pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in the same primacy, let him be anathema.&lt;ref&gt;Denzinger 3058 (old numbering, 1825)&lt;/ref&gt;

If anyone thus speaks, that the Roman Pontiff has only the office of inspection or direction, but not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the universal Church, not only in things which pertain to faith and morals, but also in those which pertain to the discipline and government of the Church spread over the whole world; or, that he possesses only the more important parts, but not the whole plenitude of this supreme power; or that this power of his is not ordinary and immediate, or over the churches altogether and individually, and over the pastors and the faithful altogether and individually: let him be anathema.&lt;ref&gt;Denzinger 3064 (old numbering, 1831)&lt;/ref&gt;

We, adhering faithfully to the tradition received from the beginning of the Christian faith, to the glory of God, our Saviour, the elevation of the Catholic religion and the salvation of Christian peoples, with the approbation of the sacred Council, teach and explain that the dogma has been divinely revealed: that the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when carrying out the duty of the pastor and teacher of all Christians by his supreme apostolic authority he defines a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the universal Church, through the divine assistance promised him in blessed Peter, operates with that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer wished that His church be instructed in defining doctrine on faith and morals; and so such definitions of the Roman Pontiff from himself, but not from the consensus of the Church, are unalterable. But if anyone presumes to contradict this definition of Ours, which may God forbid: let him be anathema.&lt;ref&gt;Denzinger 3073–3075 (old numbering, 1839–1840)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Second Vatican Council===
[[File:GestatorialChair1.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Pius XII]], wearing the traditional 1877 [[Papal tiara]], is carried through St. Peter's Basilica on a ''[[sedia gestatoria]]'' c. 1955.]]
In its [[Lumen gentium|Dogmatic Constitution on the Church]] (1964), the [[Second Vatican Council]] declared:

{{quote|Among the principal duties of bishops the [[Evangelism|preaching of the Gospel]] occupies an eminent place. For bishops are [[preacher]]s of the faith, who lead new disciples to Christ, and they are authentic teachers, that is, teachers endowed with the authority of Christ, who preach to the people committed to them the faith they must believe and put into practice, and by the light of the [[Holy Spirit]] illustrate that faith. They bring forth from the treasury of Revelation new things and old, making it bear fruit and vigilantly warding off any errors that threaten their flock. Bishops, teaching in communion with the Roman Pontiff, are to be respected by all as witnesses to divine and Catholic truth. In matters of faith and morals, the bishops speak in the name of Christ and the faithful are to accept their teaching and adhere to it with a religious assent. This religious submission of mind and will must be shown in a special way to the authentic [[magisterium]] of the Roman Pontiff, even when he is not speaking ex cathedra; that is, it must be shown so that his supreme magisterium is acknowledged with reverence, the judgments made by him are sincerely adhered to, according to his manifest mind and will. His mind and will in the matter may be known either from the character of the documents, from his frequent repetition of the same doctrine, or from his manner of speaking.

... this infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer willed His Church to be endowed in defining doctrine of faith and morals, extends as far as the deposit of Revelation extends, which must be religiously guarded and faithfully expounded. And this is the infallibility which the Roman Pontiff, the head of the [[College of Bishops|college of bishops]], enjoys in virtue of his office, when, as the supreme shepherd and teacher of all the faithful, who confirms his brethren in their faith, by a definitive act he proclaims a doctrine of faith or morals. And therefore his definitions, of themselves, and not from the consent of the Church, are justly styled irreformable, since they are pronounced with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, promised to him in blessed Peter, and therefore they need no approval of others, nor do they allow an appeal to any other judgment. For then the Roman Pontiff is not pronouncing judgment as a private person, but as the supreme teacher of the universal Church, in whom the [[charism]] of infallibility of the Church itself is individually present, he is expounding or defending a doctrine of Catholic faith. The infallibility promised to the Church resides also in the body of Bishops, when that body exercises the supreme magisterium with the successor of Peter. To these definitions the assent of the Church can never be wanting, on account of the activity of that same Holy Spirit, by which the whole flock of Christ is preserved and progresses in unity of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |title='&amp;#39;Lumen gentium'&amp;#39;, 25 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 11 October 2012, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council 60 prominent theologians, (including [[Hans Küng]]), put out a Declaration, stating that the intention of Vatican II to balance authority in the Church has not been realised. "Many of the key insights of Vatican II have not at all, or only partially, been implemented . . . A principal source of present-day stagnation lies in misunderstanding and abuse affecting the exercise of authority in our Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchauthority.org/index.asp |title='&amp;#39;the JUBILEE DECLARATION'&amp;#39;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics of the Holy See==
{{Politics of the Holy See}}
[[File:433px-Pope Pius VII.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Pius VII]], bishop of Rome, seated, and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Caprara.]]

===Residence and jurisdiction===
The pope's [[cathedra|official seat]] or [[cathedral]] is the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], and his official residence is the [[Apostolic Palace]]. He also possesses a [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo|summer residence]] at [[Castel Gandolfo]], situated on the site of the ancient city of [[Alba Longa]]. Until the time of the [[Avignon Papacy]], the residence of the pope was the [[Lateran Palace]], donated by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The pope's ecclesiastical jurisdiction (the [[Holy See]]) is distinct from his secular jurisdiction ([[Vatican City]]). It is the Holy See that conducts international relations; for hundreds of years, the papal court (the [[Roman Curia]]) has functioned as the government of the Catholic Church. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The names "Holy See" and "[[Apostolic see]]" are ecclesiastical terminology for the [[ordinary jurisdiction]] of the Bishop of Rome (including the Roman Curia); the pope's various honors, powers, and privileges within the Catholic Church and the international community derive from his Episcopate of Rome in lineal succession from the [[Twelve apostles|Apostle]] [[Saint Peter]] (see [[Apostolic succession]]). Consequently, Rome has traditionally occupied a central position in the Catholic Church, although this is not necessarily so. The pope derives his pontificate from being Bishop of Rome but is not required to live there; according to the Latin formula ''ubi Papa, ibi Curia'', wherever the pope resides is the central government of the Church, provided that the pope is Bishop of Rome. As such, between 1309 and 1378, the popes lived in [[Avignon]], France (see [[Avignon Papacy]]), a period often called the [[Avignon Papacy|Babylonian captivity]] in allusion to the [[Bible|Biblical]] narrative of [[Jews]] of the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]] living as captives in [[Babylonia]].

Though the pope is the diocesan Bishop of the [[Diocese of Rome]], he delegates most of the day-to-day work of leading the diocese to the [[Cardinal Vicar]], who assures direct episcopal oversight of the diocese's pastoral needs, not in his own name but in that of the pope. The current Cardinal Vicar is [[Agostino Vallini]], who was appointed to the office in June 2008. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:PapalPolitics2.JPG|left|thumb|upright|''Antichristus'', a woodcut by Lucas Cranach of the pope using the temporal power to grant authority to a generously contributing ruler]]

Though the progressive [[Christianization|Christianisation]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 4th century did not confer upon bishops civil authority within the state, the gradual withdrawal of imperial authority during the 5th century left the pope the senior imperial civilian official in Rome, as bishops were increasingly directing civil affairs in other cities of the Western Empire. This status as a secular and civil ruler was vividly displayed by [[Pope Leo I]]'s confrontation with [[Attila]] in 452. The first expansion of papal rule outside of Rome came in 728 with the [[Donation of Sutri]], which in turn was substantially increased in 754, when the [[Franks|Frankish]] ruler [[Pippin the Younger]] gave to the pope the land from his conquest of the [[Lombards]]. The pope may have utilized the forged [[Donation of Constantine]] to gain this land, which formed the core of the [[Papal States]]. This document, accepted as genuine until the 15th century, states that [[Constantine the Great]] placed the entire Western Empire of Rome under papal rule. In 800, [[Pope Leo III]] [[coronation|crowned]] the Frankish ruler [[Charlemagne]] as [[Roman Emperor]], a major step toward establishing what later became known as the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; from that date onward the popes claimed the prerogative to crown the Emperor, though the right fell into disuse after the coronation of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530. [[Pope Pius VII]] was present at the [[coronation of Napoleon I]] in 1804 but did not actually perform the crowning. As mentioned above, the pope's sovereignty over the Papal States ended in 1870 with their annexation by Italy.

Popes like [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]], an ambitious if spectacularly corrupt politician, and [[Pope Julius II]], a formidable general and statesman, were not afraid to use power to achieve their own ends, which included increasing the power of the papacy. This political and temporal authority was demonstrated through the papal role in the Holy Roman Empire (especially prominent during periods of contention with the Emperors, such as during the Pontificates of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Pope Alexander III]]). [[Papal bull]]s, [[interdict]], and [[excommunication]] (or the threat thereof) have been used many times to increase papal power. The Bull ''[[Laudabiliter]]'' in 1155 authorized [[Henry II of England]] to invade Ireland. In 1207, [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] placed England under interdict until [[John, King of England|King John]] made his kingdom a [[fiefdom]] to the Pope, complete with yearly [[tribute]], saying, "we offer and freely yield...to our lord Pope Innocent III and his catholic successors, the whole kingdom of England and the whole kingdom of Ireland with all their rights and appurtenences for the remission of our sins".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from the [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/innIII-policies.html Medieval Sourcebook]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'' in 1493 led to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which divided the world into areas of Spanish and Portuguese rule. The Bull ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'' in 1570 excommunicated [[Elizabeth I of England]] and declared that all her subjects were released from all allegiance to her. The Bull, ''[[Inter gravissimas]]'', in 1582 established the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://tera-3.ul.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/getImage.pl?target=/data/www/NASD/4a7f1db4-5792-415c-be79-266f41eef20a/009/499/PTIFF/00000673.tif&amp;rs=2 selection from ''Concordia Cyclopedia'': Roman Catholic Church, History of] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144949/http://tera-3.ul.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/getImage.pl?target=%2Fdata%2Fwww%2FNASD%2F4a7f1db4-5792-415c-be79-266f41eef20a%2F009%2F499%2FPTIFF%2F00000673.tif&amp;rs=2 |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International position===
Under international law, a serving [[head of state]] has [[sovereign immunity]] from the jurisdiction of the courts of other countries, though not from that of international tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofwar.org/commentary/the-icc-bashir-and-the-immunity-of-heads-of-state/ |title=Anthony Dworkin and Katherine Iliopoulos, '&amp;#39;The International Criminal Court, Bashir, and the Immunity of Heads of State'&amp;#39; |publisher=Crimesofwar.org |accessdate=11 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809081228/http://www.crimesofwar.org/commentary/the-icc-bashir-and-the-immunity-of-heads-of-state/ |archivedate=9 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fZNZ7r4hYL8C&amp;dq=%22head+of+state%22+%22diplomatic+immunity%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Yitiha Simbeye, ''Immunity and International Criminal Law''], p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; This immunity is sometimes loosely referred to as "[[diplomatic immunity]]", which is, strictly speaking, the immunity enjoyed by the ''diplomatic representatives'' of a head of state.

International law treats the [[Holy See]], essentially the central government of the Catholic Church, as the juridical equal of a state. It is distinct from the state of [[Vatican City]], existing for many centuries before the foundation of the latter. (It is common for publications and news media to use "the Vatican", "Vatican City", and even "Rome" as [[metonym]]s for the Holy See.)  Most countries of the world maintain the same form of diplomatic relations with the Holy See that they entertain with other states. Even countries without those diplomatic relations participate in international organizations of which the Holy See is a full member.

It is as head of the state-equivalent worldwide religious jurisdiction of the Holy See (not of the territory of Vatican City) that the [[U.S. Justice Department]] ruled that the pope enjoys head-of-state immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,169909,00.html |title=U.S. Says Pope Immune From Molestation Lawsuit, 2005 |publisher=Fox News |date=20 September 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128045143/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,169909,00.html# |archive-date=28 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This head-of-state immunity, recognized by the United States, must be distinguished from that envisaged under the United States' [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] of 1976, which, while recognizing the basic immunity of foreign governments from being sued in American courts, lays down nine exceptions, including commercial activity and actions in the United States by agents or employees of the foreign governments. It was in relation to the latter that, in November 2008, the [[United States Court of Appeals]] in [[Cincinnati]] decided that a case over [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sexual abuse by Catholic priests]] could proceed, provided the plaintiffs could prove that the bishops accused of negligent supervision were acting as employees or agents of the Holy See and were following official Holy See policy.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, John L.

In April 2010, there was press coverage in Britain concerning a proposed plan by [[atheist]] campaigners and a prominent [[barrister]] to have Pope Benedict XVI arrested and prosecuted in the UK for alleged offences, dating from several decades before, in failing to take appropriate action regarding Catholic sex abuse cases and concerning their disputing his immunity from prosecution in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Horne |first=Mark |title=Richard Dawkins calls for arrest of Pope Benedict XVI |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/5415 |work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=15 April 2013 |date=10 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423111338/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/5415 |archivedate=23 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was generally dismissed as "unrealistic and spurious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Ivor |title=Is the Holy See above the law? |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/article2475567.ece |accessdate=15 April 2013 |newspaper=The Times |date=13 April 2010 |location= London |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another barrister said that it was a "matter of embarrassment that a senior British lawyer would want to allow himself to be associated with such a silly idea".&lt;ref name=Zenit&gt;[[Zenit News Agency]], 15 April 2010: [http://zenit.org/article-28914?l=english Arrest the Pope?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420025614/http://www.zenit.org/article-28914?l=english |date=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antichrist1.jpg|thumb|upright|''Antichristus'', by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], from Luther's 1521 ''Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist''. The pope is signing and selling [[indulgence]]s.]]

The pope's claim to authority is either disputed or not recognised at all by other churches. The reasons for these objections differ from denomination to denomination.

===Orthodox, Anglican and Old Catholic churches===
Other traditional Christian churches ([[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Old Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Independent Catholic churches]], etc.) accept the doctrine of [[Apostolic succession]] and, to varying extents, papal claims to a primacy of honour, while generally rejecting the pope as the successor to Peter in any other sense than that of other bishops. Primacy is regarded as a consequence of the pope's position as bishop of the original capital city of the [[Roman Empire]], a definition explicitly spelled out in the 28th [[canon law|canon]] of the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. These churches see no foundation to papal claims of ''universal immediate jurisdiction'', or to claims of [[papal infallibility]]. Several of these churches refer to such claims as ''[[ultramontanism]]''.

===Protestant denominations===
{{Main|Historicism (Christianity)}}
[[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations of Christianity reject the claims of [[Primacy of Simon Peter|Petrine primacy]] of honor, Petrine primacy of jurisdiction, and papal infallibility. These denominations vary from simply not accepting the pope's claim to authority as legitimate and valid, to believing that the pope is the [[Antichrist]]&lt;ref&gt;"Therefore, on the basis of a renewed study of the pertinent Scriptures we reaffirm the statement of the Lutheran Confessions, that 'the Pope is the very Antichrist'" from [http://www.wels.net/about-wels/doctrinal-statements/antichrist Statement on the Antichrist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222233710/http://www.wels.net/about-wels/doctrinal-statements/antichrist |date=22 February 2013 }} from the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]], also [http://www.ianpaisley.org/antichrist.asp Ian Paisley, ''The Pope is the Antichrist]&lt;/ref&gt; from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:18;&amp;version=9; 1 John 2:18], the [[Man of Sin]] from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thessalonians%202:3-12&amp;version=9 2 Thessalonians 2:3–12],&lt;ref&gt;See Kretzmann's [http://www.kretzmannproject.org/EP_MINOR/2TH_2.htm ''Popular Commentary''], 2 Thessalonians chapter two and [http://www.wlsessays.net/files/JeskeThessalonians.pdf An Exegesis of 2 Thessalonians 2:1–10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321144249/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/JeskeThessalonians.pdf |date=21 March 2014 }} by Mark Jeske&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast out of the Earth]] from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013:11-18;&amp;version=9; Revelation 13:11–18].&lt;ref&gt;See See Kretzmann's [http://www.kretzmannproject.org/REV/REV_13.htm ''Popular Commentary''], Revelation Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;

This sweeping rejection is held by, among others, some denominations of Lutherans: [[Confessional Lutheran]]s hold that the pope is the Antichrist, stating that this article of faith is part of a ''quia'' ("because") rather than ''quatenus'' ("insofar as") subscription to the [[Book of Concord]]. In 1932, one of these Confessional churches, the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS), adopted ''A Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod'', which a small number of Lutheran church bodies now hold. The [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation]][http://www.lcrusa.org/a-brief-statement-of-doctrinal-position.html], the [[Concordia Lutheran Conference]][http://www.concordialutheranconf.com/doctrine/1932-2.cfm], the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession]][http://clclutheran.org/library/BriefStatement.html], and the Illinois Lutheran Conference [https://web.archive.org/web/20070819173407/http://www.illinoislutheranconference.org/our-solid-foundation/doctrinal-position-of-the-ilc.lwp/odyframe.htm] all hold to the ''Brief Statement'', which the LCMS places on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/page.aspx?pid=415|title=Doctrinal Position - The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), another Confessional Lutheran church that declares the Papacy to be the Antichrist, released its own statement, the "Statement on the Antichrist", in 1959. The WELS still holds to this statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/antichrist/|title=Antichrist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Protestants objected to the papacy's claim of temporal power over all secular governments, including territorial claims in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;See the [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr3lGJei6fkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r#PPA168,M1 Baltimore Catechism] on the temporal power of the pope over governments and Innocent III's [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/innIII-policies.html Letter to the prefect Acerbius and the nobles of Tuscany]. For objection to this, see the [https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia], p. 564 and 750.&lt;/ref&gt; the papacy's complex relationship with secular states such as the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Empires, and the autocratic character of the papal office.&lt;ref&gt;See Luther, [http://www.bookofconcord.com/smalcald.html#article4 Smalcald Articles, Article four]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western Christianity]] these objections both contributed to and are products of the [[Protestant Reformation]].

==Antipopes==
{{Main|Antipope|Western Schism}}
Groups sometimes form around [[antipope]]s, who claim the Pontificate without being canonically and properly elected to it.

Traditionally, this term was reserved for claimants with a significant following of cardinals or other clergy. The existence of an antipope is usually due either to doctrinal controversy within the Church ([[heresy]]) or to confusion as to who is the legitimate pope at the time (schism). Briefly in the 15th century, three separate lines of popes claimed authenticity (see [[Western Schism|Papal Schism]]). Even Catholics do not all agree whether certain historical figures were popes or antipopes. Though antipope movements were significant at one time, they are now overwhelmingly minor fringe causes.

==Other uses of the title "Pope"==
In the earlier centuries of Christianity, the title "Pope", meaning "father", had been used by all bishops. Some popes used the term and others did not. Eventually, the title became associated especially with the Bishop of Rome. In a few cases, the term is used for other Christian clerical authorities.

In English, Catholic priests are still addressed as "father", but the term "pope" is reserved for the head of the church hierarchy.

===In the Catholic Church===
"Black Pope" is a name that was popularly, but unofficially, given to the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]] due to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits']] importance within the Church. This name, based on the black colour of his cassock, was used to suggest a parallel between him and the "White Pope" (since the time of [[Pope Pius V]] the popes dress in white) and the Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]] (formerly called the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith), whose red cardinal's cassock gave him the name of the "Red Pope" in view of the authority over all territories that were not considered in some way Catholic. In the present time this cardinal has power over mission territories for Catholicism, essentially the Churches of Africa and Asia,&lt;ref name="Magister"&gt;[http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=7049&amp;eng=ylink Sandro Magister] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621082856/http://www.chiesa.espressonline.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=7049 |date=21 June 2006 }}, Espresso Online.&lt;/ref&gt; but in the past his competence extended also to all lands where [[Protestantism|Protestants]] or [[Eastern Christianity]] was dominant. Some remnants of this situation remain, with the result that, for instance, New Zealand is still in the care of this Congregation.

===In the Eastern Churches===
Since the [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria|papacy of Heraclas]] in the 3rd century, the [[Metropolitan Archbishop|Bishop]] of [[Alexandria]] in both the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] continues to be called "Pope", the former being called "Coptic Pope" or, more properly, "[[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Orthodox and Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle]]" and the latter called "[[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria|Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriarchateofalexandria.com/index.php?lang=en|title=-- [ Greek Orthodox ] --|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], it is not unusual for a village priest to be called a "pope" ("поп" ''pop''). However, this should be differentiated from the words used for the head of the Catholic Church (Bulgarian "папа" ''papa'', Russian "папа римский" ''papa rimskiy'').{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===In new religious movements and other Christian-related new religious movements===
Some [[new religious movement]]s within Christianity, especially those that have [[Independent Catholicism|disassociated themselves from the Catholic Church]] yet retain a Catholic hierarchical framework, have used the designation "pope" for a founder or current leader. Examples include the African [[Legio Maria|Legio Maria Church]] and the European [[Palmarian Catholic Church]] in Spain. The [[Cao Dai]], a Vietnamese faith that duplicates the Roman Catholic hierarchy, is similarly headed by a pope.

==Lengths of papal reign==
===Longest-reigning popes===
[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Pius IX]], is the pope with the longest verifiable reign]]

Although the average reign of the pope from the [[Middle Ages]] was a decade, a number of those whose reign lengths can be determined from contemporary historical data are the following:

# [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] (c. 30–64/67): c. 34 – c. 37 years (12,410–13,505 days).
# [[Pope Pius IX|Bl. Pius IX]] (1846–1878): 31 years, 7 months and 23 days (11,560 days).
# [[Pope John Paul II|St. John Paul II]] (1978–2005): 26 years, 5 months and 18 days (9,665 days).
# [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] (1878–1903): 25 years, 5 months and 1 day (9,281 days).
# [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]] (1775–1799): 24 years, 6 months and 15 days (8,962 days).
# [[Pope Adrian I|Adrian I]] (772–795): 23 years, 10 months and 25 days (8,729 days).
# [[Pope Pius VII|Pius VII]] (1800–1823): 23 years, 5 months and 7 days (8,560 days).
# [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] (1159–1181): 21 years, 11 months and 24 days (8,029 days).
# [[Pope Sylvester I|St. Sylvester I]] (314–335): 21 years, 11 months and 1 day (8,005 days).
# [[Pope Leo I|St. Leo I]] (440–461): 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days (7,713 days).
# [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623–1644): 20 years, 11 months and 24 days (7,664 days).

During the [[Western Schism]], [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII]] (1394–1423) ruled for 28 years, seven months and 12 days, which would place him third in the above list. However, since he is regarded as an [[anti-pope]], he is not mentioned in the list above.

===Shortest-reigning popes===
[[File:Urban VII.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope Urban VII]], the shortest-reigning pope]]
There have been a number of popes whose reign lasted about a month or less. In the following list the number of calendar days includes partial days. Thus, for example, if a pope's reign commenced on 1 August and he died on 2 August, this would count as having reigned for two calendar days.
#[[Pope Urban VII|Urban VII]] (15–27 September 1590): reigned for 13 calendar days, died before [[papal coronation|coronation]].
#[[Pope Boniface VI|Boniface VI]] (April 896): reigned for 16 calendar days
#[[Pope Celestine IV|Celestine IV]] (25 October&amp;nbsp;– 10 November 1241): reigned for 17 calendar days, died before coronation.
#[[Pope Theodore II|Theodore II]] (December 897): reigned for 20 calendar days
#[[Pope Sisinnius|Sisinnius]] (15 January&amp;nbsp;– 4 February 708): reigned for 21 calendar days
#[[Pope Marcellus II|Marcellus II]] (9 April&amp;nbsp;– 1 May 1555): reigned for 23 calendar days
#[[Pope Damasus II|Damasus II]] (17 July&amp;nbsp;– 9 August 1048): reigned for 24 calendar days
#[[Pope Pius III|Pius III]] (22 September&amp;nbsp;– 18 October 1503): reigned for 27 calendar days
#[[Pope Leo XI|Leo XI]] (1–27 April 1605): reigned for 28 calendar days
#[[Pope Benedict V|Benedict V]] (22 May&amp;nbsp;– 23 June 964): reigned for 33 calendar days
#[[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] (26 August&amp;nbsp;– 28 September 1978): reigned for 34 calendar days.

[[Pope-elect Stephen|Stephen]] (23–26 March 752) died of [[stroke]] three days after his election, and before his [[consecration]] as a bishop. He is not recognized as a valid pope, but was added to the lists of popes in the 15th century as ''Stephen II'', causing difficulties in enumerating later popes named Stephen. The [[Holy See]]'s ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', in its [[list of popes]] and antipopes, attaches a footnote to its mention of [[Pope Stephen II|Stephen II (III)]]:

{{quote|On the death of [[Pope Zachary|Zachary]] the Roman priest Stephen was elected; but, since four days later he died, before his ''[[episcopal consecration|consecratio]]'', which according to the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the time was the true commencement of his pontificate, his name is not registered in the ''Liber Pontificalis'' nor in other lists of the popes.&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 11*&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Published every year by the [[Roman Curia]], the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' attaches no consecutive numbers to the popes, stating that it is impossible to decide which side represented at various times the legitimate succession, in particular regarding [[Pope Leo VIII]], [[Pope Benedict V]] and some mid-11th-century popes.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2012'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2012 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 12*&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria''' is the leader of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], a faith with ancient [[Christian Church|Christian]] roots in [[Egypt]].  The current holder of this position is Pope Tawadros II, who was selected as the  118th pope on November 18, 2012.

Following the traditions of the church, the pope is chairman and head of the [[Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria]] as a [[first among equals]]. The Holy Synod is the highest authority in the Church of Alexandria, which has between 12 and 18 million members worldwide, 10 to 14 million of whom are in Egypt. It formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of the church's organization, faith, and order. The pope is also the chairman of the church's [[General Congregation Council]].

Although historically associated with the city of [[Alexandria]], the residence and [[Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria]] has been located in [[Cairo]] since 1047. The pope is currently established in [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]], inside a compound which includes the Patriarchal Palace, with an additional residence at the [[Monastery of Saint Pishoy]].

After the death of [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Shenouda III]] on March 17, 2012 the [[Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church]] voted.  The names of the three candidates who received most votes were put in a glass chalice.  The name then picked became the new Patriarch of Alexandria. It is believed the name is picked by 'Divine Choice', by a blindfolded boy.  He is believed to be guided by the hand of God.

The liturgy of the Altar Ballot took place on November 4, 2012.  The 60-year-old Bishop Tawadoros, Auxiliary Bishop of Beheira, assistant to Metropolitan Pachomios of Beheira, was chosen as the 118th Pope of Alexandria.  He then chose the name of Theodoros II. He was formally enthroned on November 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20384446]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|List of Coptic Orthodox Popes of Alexandria}}
The early [[Christian Church]] recognized the special significance of several cities as leaders of the worldwide "[[Catholic church|catholic" (universal) Church]]. The [[Church of Alexandria]] is one of these original [[patriarchate]]s, but the succession to the role of [[patriarch]] in Alexandria is still disputed after the separation which followed the [[Council of Chalcedon]].

The later development of the ''[[Pentarchy (Christianity)|Pentarchy]]'' also granted secular recognition to these religious leaders.  Because of this split, the leadership of this church is not part of this system.

Members of the church recognize its head as a successor of [[Mark the Evangelist]], considered the first Bishop of Alexandria, who founded the Church in the 1st century, and therefore marked the beginning of [[Christianity in Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of an ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 AD.

==Episcopal title==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
[[File:Chuck Kennedy - The Official White House Photostream - P060409CK-0199 (pd).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Pope Shenouda III]], the 117th Pope of Alexandria and the Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of Saint Mark]]

“Pope and Lord Archbishop of the Great City of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy Apostolic [[Holy See of St. Mark]] the Evangelist and Holy Apostle”.

The appellation of ''pope'' has been attributed to the Bishop of Alexandria since the episcopate of [[Heraclas of Alexandria|Heraclas]], the thirteenth Bishop of Alexandria. All the clergy of Alexandria and [[Lower Egypt]] honored him with the appellation ''papas'', which means ''father'', as the senior and elder bishop among all bishops, within the Egyptian province, who are under his jurisdiction, three centuries before it was assumed{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} by [[Pope John I]] Bishop of Rome (523–526), who ratified the Alexandrian computation of the date of Easter. Bestowing the title on Rome's pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this ecclesiastical fact.

Since Alexandria was the capital of the province, the preaching center and the place of martyrdom of [[Saint Mark]] the Evangelist and Holy Apostle, the title “Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle". also known as “Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa” in short, was that of the Bishop of Alexandria.

The appellation of ''pope'' became recognized as a title, but this did not mean that it represented a title different or higher than the title of  ''patriarch''. Only the Patriarch of Alexandria, however, has the double title of Pope and Patriarch among the [[Oriental Orthodox]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] thrones.

'''Pope''' ({{lang-cop|Ⲡⲁⲡⲁ}}, ''papa'') has been the specific designation for the Archbishop of Alexandria, Patriarch of Egypt, and the See of Saint Mark, whose ecclessiastic title is, Papa Abba, the Abba stands for the devotion of all monastics, from Pentapolis in the West to Constantinople in the East, to his guidance.

Historically, this office has held the title of Papa, Father in Coptic, since Papa [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria|Heracleus]], 13th Alexandrine Patriarch (232–249 AD) was first to associate with the title three centuries before it was assumed by [[Pope John I|John I]], the [[Bishop of Rome]] (523–526), who ratified the Alexandrian computation of the date of Easter. Bestowing the title on Rome's Pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} In the Roman Catholic viewpoint, this title does not have the same meaning as that of the Bishop of Rome, who was the only Primate in the West to be given the title of ''Pope'' in the beginning of the 5th century. The Pope of Rome is considered by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as the ''Supreme Pontiff'', holding the office of the Roman See (being one of the successors of [[Saint Peter]]). On the other hand, both the [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Orthodox|Byzantine Orthodox]] Churches respond by saying that their respective heads are equal with Rome and also note that Rome has deviated too much already from their original understanding{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}.

The Roman Catholic Church considers that the Pope of Rome ranks higher than the four other popes and patriarchs of the Major Apostolic Thrones ([[Alexandria]], [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem]]). This viewpoint is not accepted by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]].

The title ''[[patriarch]]'' means the head or the leader of a tribe or a community.  Ecclesiastically it means the head of the fathers (bishops) and their congregation of faithful.  This title is historically known as “Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa on the Holy Apostolic [[Throne of Saint Mark]] the Evangelist,” that is “of Alexandria and of all Africa.”  The title of “patriarch” was first used around the time of the Third Ecumenical [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], convened in 431 AD, and ratified at [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in 451 AD.

The Bishop of Alexandria also has the title of ''[[archbishop]].'' This is a natural jurisdictional title for the ecclesiastical dignity of the [[Bishop of Alexandria]]. Ruling as a ''[[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]'', the bishop of the metropolis (i.e. Alexandria), had jurisdiction over the Roman Provinces of Egypt ([[Lower Egypt]] I and II, [[Arcadia Ægypti]], [[Upper Egypt]] I and II (aka [[Thebaid|Thebais]] Prima and Thebais Secunda), Pentapolis, Libya and Nubia, which were at that time, the extent of the “Egyptian Provinces” within the [[Roman Empire]]. As set by the Ecumenical [[First Council of Nicaea]] 325 AD, the jurisdiction of the Archiepiscopate of Alexandria covered the above-mentioned provinces.

But since the demise of the Latin (Roman) [[North Africa]]n Archiepiscopate of [[Carthage]] (which covered all of North and [[West Africa]], apart from Egypt, Pentapolis and Libya) in the 8th century, Alexandria became the sole apostolic throne in the entire continent of [[Africa]]. It is to be noted that actually, the historical evangelization of the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria in Africa, apart from Egypt, Pentapolis, Libya, Nubia and the Sudan, does extend to:

'''[[Ethiopia]]:'''

It constituted a major archdiocese of the [[Church of Alexandria]], which was always governed by an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] patriarchal [[vicar]] in the rank of [[archbishop]], and named Aboune Salama by the [[Ethiopian Church]]. By 1929, the Alexandrine Throne allowed the Ethiopian Clergy to participate in the governing of their own Church, and the first native Ethiopian archbishop was enthroned in 1930 (thus becoming an autonomous church).

In 1959, an agreement was reached between the Ethiopian Holy Synod and the Alexandrine throne to have their own patriarch-[[catholicos]] in a transitional period. The Ethiopian archbishop ordained as primate of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church back in 1950, was elevated by the [[Coptic Orthodox]] Pope of Alexandria [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria|Joseph II]] in Cairo and enthroned in [[Addis Ababa]] by the members of the Ethiopian Holy Synod and an Alexandrine delegation. The first prelate, Aboune Basilius I (1959–1971), patriarch-catholicos of [[Addis Ababa]] and all [[Ethiopia]], was ordained and enthroned in 1959, by [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]].

Aboune Paulos I became the 5th patriarch of the Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and of all Ethiopia in 1992. This is after the patriarchates of Aboune Theophilus I (1971–1979) (deposed in a non-canonical way in 1976, sent to prison and murdered in prison in 1979){{Citation needed|date=February 2013|reason=whole section needs sources, but allegations of murder etc. particularly}}, Aboune Thecla Hemanote I (1976–1988) (who was elected in a non-canonical manner by pressure of the then Communist government to replace his predecessor) and Abouna Mercurios I (1988–1991), (who resigned under pressure, due to the accusation of collaborating with the (Dereg) Menghistu Communist Regime, and who is now living in self-exile in Kenya).

Aboune Paulos I has requested from the Alexandrine throne complete independence to his patriarchate. The Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia was granted its independence in 1994, by [[Shenouda III]] Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria, thus making the Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia hierarchically and jurisdictionally independent “[[autocephalous]] patriarchate.”

'''[[Eritrea]]:'''

Whose own prelate, Aboune Philipos I (1998–2002), Patriarch of [[Asmara]] and of all [[Eritrea]], was ordained and enthroned in May 1998, by Pope Shenouda III Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria. This made the new Patriarchate of Asmara and of all Eritrea a hierarchically and jurisdictionally independent “[[autocephalous]] patriarchate.” The current prelate, Aboune Antonius I (2004–&amp;nbsp;), is the third Patriarch of Asmara and all Eritrea, who succeeded Yacob I (2003–2004), the second Patriarch of Asmara and all Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tewahdo.org/Pat_Antonios/Pat_Bio-Eng.html Eritrean Orthodox Church Diocese of North America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was deposed non-canonically in January 2006, and replaced by Aboune Discoros I. This action is, however, not approved by the Alexandrine throne and is still under debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tewahdo.org/Pat_Antonios/newsEven_HHAntonios_Letter11506.htm news&amp;Events&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia and the Patriarchate of Asmara and all Eritrea are daughter Churches of the Holy Apostolic [[Patriarchate of Alexandria]].
 
In addition to the above, the countries of [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Congo]], [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]] are under the jurisdiction and the evangelization of the Throne of Alexandria.

===Honorary titles===
'''The Dean of the Great Catechetical School of Theology of Alexandria:'''
This is a customary title, which many patriarchs of Alexandria have held since the episcopacy of St. [[Justus of Alexandria|Justus]] (the 6th Bishop of Alexandria), and which was recently revived by [[Pope Shenouda III]].
 
'''The Ecumenical Judge of the Holy Apostolic and Orthodox Church of God:'''
 
This was a title given to St. [[Pope Alexander I of Alexandria|Alexander I]] (the 19th Archbishop of Alexandria), in honor of the canonical responsibilities bestowed upon the Primates of Alexandria thereafter, to determine the date of the Pascha, and to convey ecclesiastical letters of notification to all Hierarchies of the Universal Church, along with the Paschal encyclical.  This was officially agreed upon and ratified at the Ecumenical [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325 AD).
 
'''The Thirteenth among the Holy Apostles:'''
 
This title was given to [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius I]] (the 20th Archbishop of Alexandria), in honor of his apostolic defiance against [[Heresy|heresies]], especially the [[Arian heresy]].   He was exiled five times before his final victory over them. He is known as "The Apostolic," meaning that he reached the level of the Holy Apostles.
 
'''The Pillar and Defender of the Holy Catholic Church and of the Orthodox Doctrine:'''
 
This title was given to St. [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril I]], the Great (the 24th Archbishop of Alexandria) in memory of his defense against the [[Nestorian heresy]] and his defense of the Title of “[[Theotokos]]," attributed to the Virgin Mary.
 
All these hierarchical and honorary titles were bestowed upon the bishop who occupies the Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria.

==Historical evolution of the ecclesiastical title==

===Bishop===
The head of the church of Alexandria was known just as ''Bishop of Alexandria'' since the time of St. Ananius, the first Bishop of Alexandria, who was ordained by St. Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle, where the latter preached and evangelized in the City of Alexandria. The title remained simply ''bishop'' until the Church grew within and all over the Egyptian Province, and many bishops were consecrated for the newly founded parishes all over the towns and cities.

The Bishop of Alexandria, being the successor of the first bishop, the one who was first consecrated by St. Mark, was honored by the other bishops as first among equals ''(Primus inter Pares)'' as a means of church hierarchical recognition and organization.  This was in addition to the appropriate honorary dignity, which was due by virtue of being the senior bishop of the main metropolis of the Province of Alexandria, being also the capital and the main port of the province.

===Archbishop===
This honor was bestowed by making the senior bishop an archbishop, thus presiding in dignity of honor over all the Alexandrine and Egyptian bishops. So was the case among other provinces in the Roman Empire East and West ([[Rome]], [[Antioch]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Ephesus]], [[Caesarea]], [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], [[Seleucia]] and many others major metropolitanates), as the bishops of these major cities, and those who were presiding over the churches, which were first established within the region, became to be known as archbishops.

===Pope===
The word ''pope'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] '''πάππας''' meaning "father". This title was first assumed by the [[Pope of Alexandria|Patriarchs of Alexandria]], long before it was assumed by the Bishops of Rome. In fact, the first person known to carry the title of pope was the [[Metropolitan Archbishop|Archbishop]] of Alexandria, [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria|Pope Heracleus]] (232–249 AD), the 13th Alexandrine [[Metropolitan Archbishop|Archbishop]].&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/W4O42BT6T7FQ Get to Know Popes of East &amp; West]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first record in history of the term "pope" is assigned to [[Pope Heraclas of Alexandria]] in a letter written by the bishop of Rome, [[Pope Dionysius|Dionysius]], to Philemon:
{{cquote|τοῦτον ἐγὼ τὸν κανόνα καὶ τὸν τύπον παρὰ τοῦ μακαρίου πάπα ἡμῶν Ἡρακλᾶ παρέλαβον.}}&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica Book VII, chapter 7.7&lt;/ref&gt;
which translates into:
{{cquote|I received this rule and ordinance from our blessed pope, Heraclas.}}

''Papa'' has been the specific designation for the Archbishop of Alexandria, Patriarch of all Africa on the See of Saint Mark, whose ecclesiastic title is "Papa Abba", the Abba stands for the devotion of all monastics, from [[Cyrenaica#Christianization|Pentapolis]] in the West to [[Constantinople]] in the East, to his guidance. Abba is the most powerful designation, that for all monks in the East to voluntarily follow his spiritual authority.&lt;ref name="amazon"/&gt;

The Bishop of Carthage was also known as ''papas'' by the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries, most probably taken from Alexandria or from the common tradition of Pentapolis (under Alexandrine jurisdiction) as it was quite common to call the Senior Bishop of Alexandria and the Senior Bishop of Pentapolis (who was the second in importance and command after the Bishop of Alexandria and known as the Elder of Pentapolis) ''papas.''

It is difficult to ascertain the identity of the first [[Bishop of Rome]] to carry the title [[Pope of Rome]]. Some sources suggest that it was [[Pope Marcellinus]] (died 304 AD),&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article Pope&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources suggest that this did not happen until the 6th century, with [[Pope John I]] (523–526 AD) the first to assume this title.&lt;ref name="amazon2"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/W4O42BT6T7FQ Get to Know Popes of East &amp; West&lt;/ref&gt; Bestowing the title on Rome's pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this.&lt;ref name="amazon2"/&gt;

From the 6th century, the imperial chancery of Constantinople normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome.[47] From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century,[47] when Pope Gregory VII declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

===Patriarch===
Between the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (431 AD) and the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), the archbishops of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires (i.e. the archbishops of Alexandria, Antioch, Rome, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, also known as the Archbishops of the Ancient Apostolic Thrones), were given the title of ''patriarch''. These titles were ratified at the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), and henceforth were known historically as the Ancient Patriarchates of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Orthodox Church or otherwise as the Pentarchy.
 
The Bishop of Alexandria was first known as the Bishop of Alexandria.  Later, due to the importance and dignity of Alexandria as a major Christian center and as an Ancient Apostolic Throne, and in addition to the fact that the Bishop of Alexandria is the successor of the first Bishop on the Throne of Alexandria, he was given the title of archbishop by the late 3rd century. He was already called by the Alexandrine clergy and by all the Egyptian bishops ''papas,'' since the middle of the 3rd century.
 
By the middle of the 5th century, the title of ''patriarch'' was bestowed upon all major Apostolic thrones of the Holy Catholic, Apostolic and Orthodox Church (ratified by the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD).  By this title, it meant that these patriarchates have geographical jurisdiction based upon either the extent (domain) of the natural borders of their provinces, or as set by Church Ecumenical Councils and/or Church Tradition.
 
Later, between the 5th and 7th century, the appellation of ''“papas”'' or ''“pope”'' became somehow a title along with the archiepiscopal and patriarchal titles of the Bishop of Alexandria.  This, however, did not mean that the title of ''“pope”'' denoted a higher hierarchical or ecclesiastical dignity or rank than that of the title and rank of ''“patriarch”'' given to the Bishop of Alexandria.

==Polity in extending pastoral care==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}
Patriarchal delegates known as "Patriarchal Exarchs" are designated for areas outside the region of the canonical jurisdiction of the Bishop of Alexandria, or any other throne that has set jurisdictional boundaries.

In this way, the [[Apostolic Exarchate]]s are not in contradiction with the Canon Laws of the Church, but are considered “Embassies of the Patriarchate of Alexandria”, rather than “Jurisdictional Dioceses" outside the defined canonical jurisdiction.

==Jurisdiction==

===Administrative divisions===
* 9 [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolises]], out of which 6  metropolises are in [[Egypt]], 1 metropolis is elsewhere in the  [[Near East]] and 2 metropolises are in [[Europe]]; served by 3 [[metropolitan archbishop]]s, 4 [[metropolitan bishop]]s and 1 metropolis in the [[British Orthodox Church|United Kingdom]]; out of the 8 hierarchs, 1 [[metropolitan archbishop]] is in the [[Near East]], 3 in [[metropolitan archbishop]]s are in [[Egypt]] and 1 [[metropolitan archbishop]] is in [[British Orthodox Church|The United Kingdom]], while all 4 [[metropolitan bishop]]s are in [[Egypt]]; one metropolis in France remains vacant.
* 63 [[diocese]]s with 46 [[diocesan bishop]]s  are in [[Egypt]], 7 [[diocesan bishop]]s  are in [[Europe]], 3 [[diocesan bishop]]s are in [[North America]], 2 [[diocesan bishop]]s are in [[South America]], 2 [[diocesan bishop]]s are in [[Sudan]] and 2 [[diocesan bishop]]s are in Australia.
* 2 [[Suffragan Diocese]]s, with 1 [[suffragan bishop]] in [[Europe]] and 1 [[suffragan bishop]] in [[North America]].
* 1 [[auxiliary bishop]] for 1 [[Eparchy|diocese]] in [[Egypt]].
* 6 [[assistant bishop]]s in [[Egypt]] for 6 [[suffragan diocese]]s within an [[Archdiocese]] under the pope's jurisdiction.
* 6 [[Exarch|patriarchal exarchate]]s, with 2 patriarchal exarchs in [[North America]], 2 patriarchal exarchs in [[Europe]] and 2 patriarchal exarchs in [[Africa]].
* 11 [[Abbot|bishop abbots]] for 10 patriarchal monasteries in [[Egypt]] and 1 patriarchal monastery in Australia.
* 3 [[Bishop|general bishop]]s, patriarchal emissary at large in [[Egypt]] and abroad

* 1 [[hegumen]] in the capacity of [[Oeconomus|grand economos]], [[Vicar|patriarchal vicar]] for [[Alexandria]].
* 1 [[hegumen]] as [[Vicar|administrative patriarchal vicar]] for [[Cairo]].

==Patriarchal elections==
Until 1928 Patriarchal elections were carried out according to oral and written Church tradition.  The patriarchal election of 1928 was the first in modern history to invoke written bylaws.  The elections of 1928, 1942 and 1946 inspired controversy by pitting relatively young monks versus older, more experienced bishops.  Supporters of each group argued that the other should be disqualified: the advocates of the younger monks claimed that the bishops were wedded to their dioceses for life and that their election to the patriarchate would lead to an unnatural divorce of bishop and diocese, while the bishops' partisans countered that a bishop might continue to provide diocesan pastoral care from the apostolic throne, while observing that the pastoral experience of the more seasoned bishops would be indispensable to the patriarchate of the entire church; they further noted that the patriarchs of every other apostolic church, such as those of the Greek, Russian and Catholic churches, were nearly always Bishops or Abbots prior to election.

This controversy ultimately led to the development of a new set of bylaws in 1957.  The bylaws state that a candidate for election to the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria must be a man of at least 40 years of age and must be a [[monk]] with at least 15 years of monastic service (in that Coptic bishops are always drawn from the ranks of monks), but he may be of any ecclesiastical rank: monk, hieromonk (monk priest or monk archpriest), abbot, or bishop.

A potential candidate who meets the requirements of the bylaws must be endorsed by six bishops or twelve of the 24 members of the [[General Congregation Council|General Lay Council of the Church]], a church governing body composed primarily of laypeople elected by the congregation to five year terms.  A Nominations Committee is then formed by nine bishops appointed by the Holy Synod and nine laypersons elected by the General Community Council.  The Nominations Committee, chaired by the [[locum tenens]] patriarch, narrows the field of candidates to a group of five or seven.  Each diocese then contributes twelve electors to an Electoral College; their numbers are augmented by the members of [[The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church]], the General Community Council, Coptic Orthodox political leaders and journalists and envoys of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.  The voting of the Electoral College results in a ranking of the remaining five or seven candidates, and the three highest-ranked candidates advance to the final stage of the selection process.

The name of each candidate is written on a slip of paper in a box placed on the altar of St. Mark Cathedral in Cairo during a Sunday eucharistic liturgy presided over by the [[Locum tenens]] of the throne, and attended by all members of the Holy Synod, General Congregation Council and the laity.  A five-year-old child selected from the congregation then draws a slip, sight unseen, from the box; the name it bears determines the next Patriarch.

The last three Coptic Popes were selected in this manner: [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Cyril VI]] in 1959, [[Shenouda III]] in 1971, and Tawadros II in 2012.

==Pontifical duties==
The duties of the Coptic Orthodox pope, apart from his diocesan duties, are:
*To guide the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in accordance to the orthodox faith.
*To guide the various dioceses under his jurisdiction and nominate candidates for episcopal advancement.
*To consecrate bishops for various dioceses or bishoprics, to elevate bishops to the metropolitan dignity and to consecrate and enthrone Patriarchs for daughter autonomous or autocephalous churches of the Church of Alexandria.
*Being first among equals among the bishops of the Church of Alexandria, he leads in all interorganizational matters among all dioceses.
*Being the Chairman of the Supreme Ecclesiastical Court, he acts as the Supreme Judge in all matters of ecclesiastical discipline with Holy Synod approval.
*To chair the Holy Synod of the Church of Alexandria as first among equals.
*To promulgate [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] to preach Christianity to various parts of the world.
*To canonize saints, through the approval of the Holy Synod. A requirement of the Coptic Orthodox faith is that at least 50 years must pass from a [[saint]]'s death to canonization.
*Erection and consecration of new [[dioceses]] and [[church (building)|churches]], and erection of new or reviving old monasteries and maintaining their monastic communities. Under the papacy of [[Pope Shenouda III]], many new Coptic Orthodox churches were established in North America, Europe, Australia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and elsewhere.

[[File:Denarius C. Memmius C. F. Romulus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Denarius]] picturing Quirinus on the [[obverse]], and [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] enthroned on the reverse, a commemoration by a [[moneyer]] in 56 BC of a [[Cerealia|Cerialia]] presented by an earlier [[Memmia (gens)|Gaius Memmius]] as [[aedile]]&lt;ref&gt;Eric Orlin, ''Foreign Cults in Rome: Creating a Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[Roman mythology]] and religion, '''Quirinus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|ɪ|ˈ|r|aɪ|n|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/quirinus?showCookiePolicy=true |title=Quirinus
|accessdate=24 September 2014 |work=Collins Dictionary |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Lang-la|Quirīnus}}, {{IPA-la|kʷɪˈriːnʊs|}}) is an early god of the Roman state. In Augustan Rome, ''Quirinus'' was also an [[epithet]] of [[Janus]], as ''Janus Quirinus''.&lt;ref&gt;In the prayer of the [[fetiales]] quoted by [[Livy]] (I.32.10); [[Macrobius]] (''Sat.'' I.9.15);&lt;/ref&gt; His name may be derived from the Sabine word ''quiris'' "spear".

==Etymology==
Quirinus is probably an adjective meaning "wielder of the spear" (Quiris, in the Sabine language, cf. Janus Quirinus). Other suggested etymologies are: (i) from the Sabine town Cures; (2) from curia, i.e. he was the god of the Roman state as represented by the thirty curies, first proposed by Krestchmer. A. B. Cook (Class. Rev. xviii., p.&amp;nbsp;368) explains Quirinus as the oak-god (''quercus''), and [[Quirites]] as the men of the oaken spear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/q/quirinus.html |title=Quirinus |work=Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further information|Ancient Roman religion|Flamen Quirinalis#Quirinalia}}
Quirinus was most likely a [[Sabines|Sabine]] god of war. The Sabines had a settlement near the eventual site of [[Rome]], and erected an altar to Quirinus on the ''Collis Quirinalis'' [[Quirinal Hill]], one of the [[Seven hills of Rome]]. When the Romans settled in the area, the cult of Quirinus became part of their early belief system. This occurred before the later influences from the classical Greek culture.

In [[Plutarch]]'s [[Parallel Lives|''Life of Romulus'']], he writes that shortly after Rome's founder had disappeared under what some considered suspicious circumstances, a Roman noble named [[Proculus Julius]] reported that [[Romulus]] had came to him while he was travelling. He claimed that the king had instructed him to tell his countrymen that he, Romulus was Quirinus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Lives'', ''Romulus'', ch.28 p.2 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/romulus*.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the first century BC, Quirinus would be considered to be the deified legendary king.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwich, Duncan ''The Imperial Cult in the Latin West'' Brill, 2nd edition, 1993 {{ISBN|978-90-04-07179-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4II_mqxM8s0C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=romulus+quirinus&amp;ei=Rfz-SOKiGpDwsgPk4_DrDA&amp;client=firefox-a]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Jane DeRose ''The Art of Persuasion'' University of Michigan Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-472-10282-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=2AsRrF3ej38C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=romulus+quirinus&amp;ei=Rfz-SOKiGpDwsgPk4_DrDA&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA103,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Angelo Brelich]] has argued that Quirinus and [[Romulus]] were originally the same divine entity which was split into a founder hero and a god when Roman religion became demythicised. To support this, he points to the association of both Romulus and Quirinus with the grain [[spelt]], through the ''[[Fornacalia]]'' or ''Stultorum Feriae'', according to Ovid's ''Fasti''.&lt;ref&gt;II 481 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last day of the festival is called the ''[[Quirinalia]]'' and corresponds with the traditional day of Romulus' death.  On that day, the Romans would toast spelt as an offering to the goddess [[Fornax (mythology)|Fornax]]. In one version of the legend of Romulus' death cited by Plutarch, he was killed and cut into pieces by the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|nobles]] and each of them took a part of his body home and buried it on their land.

Brelich claims that this pattern – a festival involving a staple crop, a god, and a tale of a slain founding hero whose body parts are buried in the soil – is a recognized [[Dema Deity|archetype]] that arises when such a split takes place in a culture's mythology. The possible presence of the [[flamen Quirinalis]] at the festival of [[Acca Larentia]] would corroborate this thesis, given the fact that Romulus is a stepson of hers, and one of the original twelve arval brethren ([[Fratres Arvales]]).&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius ''Noctes Atticae'' 7. 7. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The association of Quirinus and Romulus is further supported by a connection with Vofionos, the third god in the triad of the Grabovian gods of Iguvium. Vofionos would be the equivalent of [[Liber]] or [[Teutates]], in Latium and among the Celts respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Brelich ''Quirinus: una divinita' romana alla luce della comparazione storica'' "Studi e Materiali di Storia delle religioni" 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

His early importance led to his inclusion in the first [[Capitoline Triad]], along with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (then an agriculture god) and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Inez Scott Ryberg, "Was the Capitoline Triad Etruscan or Italic?" ''The American Journal of Philology'' '''52'''.2 (1931), pp. 145-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, however, he became less significant, and he was absent from the later, more widely known triad (he and Mars had been replaced by [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]]). [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] mentions the ''Capitolium Vetus'', an earlier cult site on the Quirinal, devoted to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva,&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' V.158. The Capitolium Vetus was demolished in 1625 by order of Pope Barberini. See Lanciani's work on the "Shrines of Pagan Rome".&lt;/ref&gt; among whom [[Martial]] makes a distinction between the "old Jupiter" and the "new".&lt;ref&gt;Martial, (V, 22.4) remarks on a position on the [[Esquiline Hill]] from which one might see ''hinc novum Iovem, inde veterem'', "here the new Jupiter, there the old."&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, Romans began to favor personal and mystical cults over the official state belief system. These included those of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], [[Cybele]], and [[Isis]], leaving only his flamen to worship him. The [[Flamen Quirinalis]] who remained, however, was one of the patrician ''flamines maiores'' ("greater flamens") who had oversight over the [[Pontifex Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], 198, L: "''Quirinalis, socio imperii Romani Curibus ascito Quirino"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depiction==
In earlier Roman [[art]], he was portrayed as a bearded man with religious and military clothing. However, he was almost never depicted in later Roman belief systems. He was also often associated with the [[Myrtus|myrtle]].

==Festivals==

His [[festival]] was the '''Quirinalia''', held on February 17.

==Legacy==
Even centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, the [[Quirinal]] hill in Rome, originally named from the deified [[Romulus]], was still associated with power – it was chosen as the seat of the royal house after the taking of Rome by the [[House of Savoy|Savoia]] and later it became the residence of the [[President of Italy|Presidents of the Italian Republic]].

'''Romaozinho''' (Portuguese: ''Romãozinho'' [xomãw'ziɲu]) is a character from [[Brazil]]ian [[folklore]] who bears the burden of immortality.  Because he is cursed with unending life, he is somewhat similar to the character [[Ahasvero]].

In the parable which bears his name, he is the son of a [[serf]], and is disobedient from birth. He takes great pleasure in treating animals cruelly and destroying plants.

Sometimes, his mother orders him to carry a meal to his father, who works in a garden, and Romãozinho goes, albeit unwillingly. One afternoon en route to delivery, he eats the chicken his mother has sent, puts its [[bone]]s back in the box, and carries it to his father. Upon opening the box, the perplexed father asks what the bones mean. Romãozinho replies:

"That's what they gave me. I thought that my mother had eaten a chicken with a man who always goes to our home when you're not there, and sent you just the bones."

Mad with rage, the father immediately returns home, whereupon he pulls out a dagger and kills his wife. Before dying, the mother curses the laughing son, saying:

"You will never die! You won't know [[heaven]] or [[hell]], or even rest until there's just one person left living on Earth!"

Romãozinho laughs at the curse and leaves. From that moment onward, the boy never grows. He breaks roof tiles with stones, frightens people and [[torture]]s chickens, and is presumably walking through the streets and causing mischief to this day.

However, despite his sadistic and sociopathic personality, Romãozinho isn't pure evil and has been known to occasionally use his mischief for noble and selfless reasons. For example, there is a pregnant woman in labor, but there was no midwife to help, so she begged for help, and Romãozinho promptly does by scaring a local midwife's chicken to the woman, thing that helped the woman to give birth.

==Etymology and meaning==
'Sadaqa' literally means 'righteousness' and refers to the voluntary giving of alms or charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Wayne Visser |title=The Age of Responsibility: CSR 2.0 and the New DNA of Business|publisher=Wiley.com| year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bs7g0O4eLYC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in Islamic terminology; Sadaqah has been defined as an act of "Giving something to somebody without seeking a substitute in return and with the intention of pleasing Allah."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage /index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=84354&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, according to Ar-Rageeb al-Asfahaani “Sadaqa is what the person gives from what he possesses, like Zakat, hoping to get closer to Allah."

The term 'Sadaqah' stems from the Arabic root word ‘sidq’ (s-d-q) ص،د،ق, which means sincerity and It is considered as a sign of sincere faith.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ikca.org.uk/get-involved/sadaqah-donations/&lt;/ref&gt; The three-letter root of this word, S-D-Q, also means, "to speak the truth," "to be sincere," and "to fulfill one's promise." All of these aspects of honorable behavior indicate the links between generosity and a healthy society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Vincent J. Cornell|title=Voices of Islam: Voices of tradition|publisher= Amazon.com| year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bs7g0O4eLYC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern researchers also try to etymologically link the word ''sadaqa'' to the Hebrew {{Hebrew|צדקה}} ''[[Tzedakah|sedāḳā]]'' (almsgiving). Some experts hence conclude that ''sadaqa'' is a loanword.&lt;ref name="Alms"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Nanji|first=Azim|author-link= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |encyclopedia= Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|title= Almsgiving|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-the-quran/almsgiving-EQCOM_00008?s.num=17 |access-date= 29 November 2016 |edition= |date= |year= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islamic texts==
===Quran===

*The word zakah occurs thirty times in the Quran, out of which, twenty seven times it is linked with prayer. There are three places where it has not been linked ... (Suratul Fussilat, 41: 7). The zakah mentioned in these thirty places is in reference to the obligatory zakah. However, Sadaqah (non-obligatory charity) and its plural (sadaqat) occur thirteen times in the Qur'an; five times as Sadaqah, eight times as its plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=  Prof. Muhammad Zulfiqar |title=Zakah According To Quran &amp; Sunnah|publisher=Darussalam Publishers| year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bs7g0O4eLYC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sadaqat is very wide term and used in the Quran to cover all kinds of charity. Sadaqat means to give alms and also legal alms for which the word zakat is used in the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad. Zakat has been called sadaqat because it is also a kind of compulsory charity. It is an obligatory sadaqa while ordinary sadaqa are voluntary. Thus, zakat has to be collected by the muhtasib (collector) or the government — the Islamic state as a Compulsory levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Mohammad Maulana|title=Encyclopaedia Of Quranic Studies(Set Of 26 Vols.)|publisher= Anmol Publications Pvt. Ltd| year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bs7g0O4eLYC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to [[Quran]], Sadaqa leads into the purification of the benefactor.&lt;ref name="Tax" /&gt; Quran says that sadaqa should not be necessarily be in a material form&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Michael D.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stanley M.|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Religion and Social Justice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781405195478|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4W4fg2xZAOwC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=sadaqa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilq4Pc_dXQAhXL2ywKHfDfAFI4ChDoAQg2MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=sadaqa&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be a "voluntary effort", or a kind word.&lt;ref name="Alms"/&gt; This is in agreement with a ''[[hadith|narration]]'' attributed to [[Muhammad]] which says "every good deed is a form of ''sadaq''."&lt;ref name="Ibrahim" /&gt; Kind words and "compassion" are better than ''sadaqa'' accompanied by "insult", from the viewpoint of Quran, and it is better for the donations to be offered "discreetly" to those in need rather than doing it in public in order to be acknowledged by them. The Quran also criticizes donating aimed at appearing generous or compromising the value of ''sadaqa'' by "ostentatious public behavior" done just to "render a normally charitable act purely self-serving." Quran suggests that ''sadaqa'' is not meant only to support the poor, but also can be donated to others who "were not visibly in need" and also who either needed assistance to enhance their life or required to be directed towards new jobs and "economic opportunities".&lt;ref name="Alms"/&gt;

There are many verses on Sadaqat (Charity), either voluntary or obligatory. Among whom are stated below: 
*And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in worship).&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|2|43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*They ask thee what they should spend (In charity). Say: Whatever ye spend that is good, is for parents and kindred and orphans and those in want and for wayfarers. And whatever ye do that is good, -Allah knoweth it well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|2|215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kind words and the covering of faults are better than charity followed by injury. Allah is free of all wants, and He is Most-Forbearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|2|263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Allah will deprive usury of all blessing, but will give increase for deeds of charity: For He loveth not creatures ungrateful and wicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|2|276}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and establish regular prayers and regular charity, will have their reward with their Lord: on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|2|277}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*So fear Allah as much as ye can; listen and obey and spend in charity for the benefit of your own soul and those saved from the covetousness of their own souls, they are the ones that achieve prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|64|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadith===
According to some ''[[hadith]]s'', "a kind word and smile" can be considered as ''sadaqa'' and the best form of it is "passing on knowledge."&lt;ref name="Ibrahim" /&gt; Also, Muhammad said in a hadith that ''sadaqa'' removes seventy gates of evil.&lt;ref name="GUP"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neusner|first1=Jacob|last2=Chilton|first2=Bruce|title=Altruism in World Religions|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=1589012356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy-6HiyApXsC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=sadaqa+seventy+gates+of+evil&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZt-Cnn-HQAhXJKWMKHb7JDt8Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sadaqa%20seventy%20gates%20of%20evil&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from ''zakat''==

*The word is interchangeably used with ''[[Zakat]]'' and ''[[Nafaqa]]'' in some contexts,&lt;ref name="Tax"/&gt; but while ''zakat'' is obligatory, Sadaqa usually refers to voluntary donations.&lt;ref name="Ibrahim"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibrahim|first1=Barbara|last2=Sherif|first2=Dina H.|title=From Charity to Social Change: Trends in Arab Philanthropy|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=9789774162077|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3ahODkMBVAC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=sadaqa+charity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX7eDOvNDQAhXICSwKHUurD7cQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sadaqa%20charity&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Zakat is a required minimum contribution by Muslims in terms of money and property or goods that can help the muslims who mostly need assistance, while Sadaqah can be in forms of money, deeds, property or salutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Mohamad Tajuddin Mohamad Rasdi |title=Rethinking the Mosque In the Modern Muslim Society|publisher=ITBM| year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bs7g0O4eLYC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The term 'sadaqah' was used in Qur'an and Sunnah for both zakat and charity. Among the differences between  them is that in the case of Zakat, the amount is fixed, utilized according to that which has been stated by the Islamic Law and is paid only once a year. Meanwhile, charity has no fixed percentage and one is free to pay it as many times as one can afford or feel inclined to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Mohammed Higab |title=Islam is the All-divine Messages in One, Volume 1|publisher=Islamic Publications Bureau| year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bs7g0O4eLYC&amp;pg=PA145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sadaqah should be from what(possessions) you love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|3|92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">[[Image:Meher Baba Samadhi2.jpg|thumb|260px|Meher Baba's samadhi today]]
'''Meher Baba's samadhi''' is the [[Samadhi (shrine)|samadhi]] and [[tomb]] of [[Meher Baba]] located in [[Meherabad]], India and is a place of [[pilgrimage]] for his followers. Located about six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Ahmednagar]], the samadhi structure itself was completed in August 1938, more than 30 years before Baba's death in January 1969.

== History of the samadhi ==
[[Image:Samadhi construction.jpg|thumb|250px|Construction of the dome, 1938]] 
In June 1927 a cabin of bamboo matting and tin was built for Meher Baba on Meherabad Hill. It had a door and window on the east side.  In July of the same year, a pit four feet wide and six feet deep was dug in it, lined with stone and masonry and covered by wooden planks.  It was referred to as the Khadda – the Ditch or Pit-Room, by the [[Mandali (Meher Baba)|mandali]].  Later the tin was replaced by mud-mortared stones and more windows were added.  From August 16 Baba started using this crypt-cabin mostly for staying in seclusion.  In December, five temporary rooms (meditation cells) were built next to the building for some of his mandali.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986. pp. 956, 989&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1934 a severe hail storm tore away the tin roof and it had to be repaired.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986.  p. 1869&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 Baba ordered a dome to be built over it, at which time everyone came to know that this was to be the site of Meher Baba's future tomb.

The old stone walls were torn down and replaced by black stones which came from the original Post Office building on the estate. The Post Office had to be demolished the year before, after an order of the British government, because of its close proximity to the railway tracks.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau, ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', Manifestation, Inc. 1986. p. 1806&lt;/ref&gt;  In  the first part of August, 1938, the completed dome had four concrete models - a Christian cross, a Hindu temple, a Muslim mosque, and a [[Atar|Zoroastrian fire]] - fitted onto the corners of the roof.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986.  p. 2307&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Swiss artist [[Helen Dahm]] painted colorful murals on the inside walls of the tomb, completing them in November 1938. The sign over the entrance bears Baba's motto, "Mastery in Servitude".

== Interment ==

On January 31, 1969 at 12:15 in the afternoon after having his favorite poet [[Hafez|Hafiz]]'s couplets recited, Meher Baba died. His body was brought to the samadhi at Upper Meherabad by an ambulance from [[Meherazad]] and was interred on February 7, 1969. The ambulance had been sent by Dr. Brieseman from Booth Hospital. Afterwards, the ambulance itself died; it went out of commission and had to be replaced. The trip it made to Meherabad was its last. The stretcher which carried Baba's body is still preserved in his tin seclusion cabin on the hill. During those seven days, in compliance with Meher Baba's wish, [[Cole Porter|Cole Porter's]] song "[[Begin the Beguine]]" was played repeatedly on a record player.&lt;ref&gt;''The Awakener Magazine'', 1970, Volume 13, Numbers 1 and 2, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; During this time people came from all over India and a few from the west to take darshan and to see his physical form for one last time. During these seven days Mecca was flooded and closed for this exact period of Meher Baba's darshan after he dropped his physical form.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986.  p. 6740&lt;/ref&gt; [[All India Radio]] mistakenly announced Baba's passing as 10:00 P.M. on the 31st (his actual time of death was 12:15 P.M.).  The next day, announcements were made on the radio several times during the day and [[BBC]] also broadcast the news. True to Meher Baba's words, in death he gave [[Darśana|darshan]] in a reclining position during the summer of 1969 in what became known as [[1969 Darshan|The Last Darshan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986.  p. 6721, 6722&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
Today the samadhi is a place of pilgrimage for the followers of Meher Baba from around the world, drawing its largest crowds at [[Amartithi]] celebration, the date commemorating Baba's death.

'''Singhai'''  (also '''Sanghvi''' Shanghvi or '''Singhi''' from Sanskrit '''Sanghapati''' (संघपति), literally chief of the [[Sangha (Jainism)|Sangha]]) is a hereditary title awarded in the past to leaders of the [[Jain]] Sangha.&lt;ref&gt;Siddhantacharya Phulachandra Shastri, Parvaar Jain Samaj ka Itihas, 1990, Jabalpur&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Digambara]] [[Jain]]s the title is awarded for building a Jain temple with formal installation ([[Panch-kalyanak Pratishtha]]) of [[Tirthankara]] images  with festivities, often accompanied with a [[gajrath]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaina-siddhānta-bhāskara, Volume 52, Devkumar Jain Oriental Research Institute., 1999, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parsai Rachanavali-V-2, Hariśaṅkara Parasai, Rajkamal Prakashan Pvt Ltd, 2005  p. 46-47 (originally published in Parivartan in 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Shvetambar]] [[Jain]]s it is awarded for conducting a mass pilgrimage to major [[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cūrū Maṇḍala kā śodhapūrṇa itihāsa, Volume 1, Govinda Agravāla, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bundelkhand titles==
In most north Indian Jain communities, the honorific "[[Shah|Sah]]" (Sanskrit Sadhu) has been widely used. It can be used by any Jain.

In Bundelkhand a system of titles, which are inherited, has been in use for several centuries.

===Award of Singhai===
A 1436 AD inscription at Deogarh uses the terms Singhai and Sanghadhipati. It mentions a pratishtha conducted by Bhattaraka Devendrakirti of Chanderi.&lt;ref&gt;Siddhantacharya Phulachandra Shastri, Parwar Jain Samaj ka Itihas, 1990, Jabalpur, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; A 1467 AD inscription on a metal image in Bhind uses the term Sanghai for the male members of a family and Sanghaini  for two female members.&lt;ref&gt;["Barhad (Jila Bhind) ki jain Pratimayen Yantrapatta aur unke Abhilekh", Navnit Kumar jain, Arvind Kumar Singh, Prachin Tirth Jirnoddhar, April 2016, p. 25]&lt;/ref&gt; These and other 15th century inscriptions suggest the presence of the title in Bundelkhand.

The tradition of the title Singhai exists in Bundelkhand among the Parvaars, Golapurvas&lt;ref&gt;Golapurva Directory, Ed. Mohanlal Jain Kaavyatirth, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; and the Golarare. It also exists in the Bhadawar/Gwalior region among the Kharaua,&lt;ref&gt;Shri Digambar jain Kharaua Samaj ka Itihas, Ramjit Jain, Gayelia Jain Dharmath Trust, Gwalior, 1990, p. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; and Varaiya communities.&lt;ref&gt;Shri Digambar Jain Variya Samaj ka Itihas, Ramjit Jain, Lalmani Prasad Jain, Gwalior, 1987, p. 140-142&lt;/ref&gt; The terms Sanghavi, Sanghadhip and Sanghapati were used in the time of poet [[Raighu]] (1383–1468) for Gwalior Shravakas belonging to [[Agrawal Jain|Agrawal]] and [[Golalare]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;Gopachal Siddhakshetra, Ramjit Jain, 1987, Mahavir Paramagam Seva Samiti, p. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Navalsah Chanderia has described an elaborate Pratishtha with Gajrath conducted by his ancestors in 1594 at Bhelsi where they were awarded the title of Singhai.&lt;ref&gt;Tirthankar_Mahavir_Aur_Unki_Acharya_Parampara, Part IV, Nemichandra Shastri, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; The temple built on this occasion still exists in Bhelsi. Vinodilal (about in 1690) his Phulamala Pachchisi mentions that organizing a pratishtha is rewarded by the tile Sanghahi.

At the conclusion of the pratishtha function, a turban of [[chanderi]] cloth was formally placed on the head of the organizing shraavaka,&lt;ref&gt;History of Chanderi Sarees, {{cite web |url=http://chanderi.net/jml/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=54&amp;lang=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104004249/http://chanderi.net/jml/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=54&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and people in the congregation ritually saluted him saying "Singhaiji Juhaar".

===Higher titles===
In Bundelkhand a raking of titles had existed in the past. A person who already has the rank Singhai, receives the title "Savaai Singhai" upon another gaja-ratha pratishtha.&lt;ref&gt;Yatra men Ek Lakh Ka Chittha, (Gadyana Gajrath), Parwar Bandhu, March 1924, p. 118-125&lt;/ref&gt; On a third occasion they receive the title "Seth", and following that the title "Shrimant Seth" is conferred.&lt;ref&gt;Census of India, 1901, Volume 13, Part 1, India. Census Commissioner 1902, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Khurai]] Zamindar Nandlal had conducted gaja-ratha pratishtha on three occasions, 1834, 1839 and 1863 and thus had earned the titles Singhai, Savaai Singhai and Seth.&lt;ref&gt;p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson Mohanlal had conducted pratishtha in 1893 and thus had earned the title [[Shrimant Seth]].&lt;ref&gt;Volume 1 of The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Robert Vane Russell, Macmillan and Company, Limited, 1916, p.228&lt;/ref&gt;  Gopal Sao Puran Sao of Seoni&lt;ref&gt;Shrimant Seth Gopal Sao Puran Sao vs Municipal Council on 1 August 2011, http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1545534/&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded the title for conducting pratishthas in 1849 in Jabalpur and 1877, 1895 and 1902 at Seoni.&lt;ref&gt;Siddhantacharya Phulachandra Shastri, Parvaar Jain Samaj ka Itihas, 1990, Jabalpur, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jain Itishas Series No 1, Jain Itihas Society, Agra, 1902, p. 83 &lt;/ref&gt;   In [[Vidisha]], in 1933, Sitab Rai Laxmi Chand was given the title Shrimant Seth in Itawa for the funding the publication of [[Shatkhandagam]] text.&lt;ref&gt;Vidyarthi Jain Dharm Shiksha, Brahmachari Sitalprasad, Mulchand Kisandas Kapadia, 1933,  p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Mathuradas Taraiya of Lalitpur was awarded the title in 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Parvaar Directory, 1924, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Khag clan families in Karitoran, Lalitpur hold the title  Savaai Seth, which is equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Golapurva Directory, Ed. Mohanlal Jain Kavyatirth, 1940, p. d, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, among the Parwars, 1022 families held the title Singhai, 161 Sawai Singhai, 130 Seth, 1 Sawai Seth and 3 Shrimat Seth.&lt;ref&gt;Parvaar Directory, 1924, p. 166-167&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Golapurvas, in 1941, 1186 individuals held the title Singhai, 281 Sawai Singhai, 487 Seh and 8 Sawai Seth, out of a total population of 12569.&lt;ref&gt;Golapurva Directory, Ed. Mohanlal Jain Kaavyatirth, 1940, p. "d"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taranpanth]] Samaj officially does not support idols and thus do not conduct bimba pratishtas, however they conduct vedi pratishta. They now award titles Seth and Sawai Seth based on contributions to Taranpanthi institutions.&lt;ref&gt;फुटेराकलां मंगलवार को स्थानीय चैत्यालय में, 2010, dainik Bhaskar, http://www.bhaskar.com/article/MP-OTH-1940730-3055849.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagwandas Jain of Sagar&lt;ref&gt;Siddhantacharya Pandit Phulchandra Shastri Abhinandan Granth, 1985,&lt;/ref&gt; and his descendants were awarded the title Shrimant Seth by the Taranpanth Samaj in 1980s. Oneof the highest rink holder in Jainism

Yarden Mariuma, sociologist at Columbia University, writes: "Taqiyya is an Islamic juridical term whose shifting meaning relates to when a Muslim is allowed, under [[Sharia]] law, to lie. A concept whose meaning has varied significantly among Islamic sects, scholars, countries, and political regimes, it nevertheless is one of the key terms used by recent anti-Muslim polemicists."&lt;ref&gt;Mariuma, Yarden.

The Muslim World 104.1-2 (2014): 89-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and related terms==
The term ''taqiyya'' ({{lang-ar|تقیة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|taqiyyah}}/{{transl|ar|ALA|taqīyah}}'') is derived from the [[Arabic]] [[triliteral root]] ''wāw-qāf-yā'', denoting literally caution, fear,&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; "prudence, guarding against (a danger)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corpus.quran.com/search.jsp?q=pos%3Av+%28VIII%29+root%3Awqy |title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus - Quran Search}}&lt;/ref&gt; carefulness, wariness.&lt;ref&gt;''Muslim-Jewish encounters'' by Nettler&lt;/ref&gt; In the sense of "prudence, fear" it can be used synonymously with the terms ''tuqa(n)'', ''tuqāt'', ''taqwā'' and ''ittiqāʾ'', derived from the same root.&lt;ref name=EI2-syn&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |author=Strothmann, R. and Djebli, Moktar |year=2012 |title=Taḳiyya |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition=Second |publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_7341 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms also have other meanings. For example, the term ''[[taqwa]]'' generally means "piety" (lit. "fear [of God]") in an Islamic context.&lt;ref&gt;Lewisohn, L. "Taḳwā (a.)." ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman; , Th. Bianquis; , C.E. Bosworth; , E. van Donzel; and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Brill Online. University of Toronto. 13 July 2010 [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-1457]&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative term for religious dissimulation is ''kitmān'' "action of covering, dissimulation".&lt;ref name=EI2-syn/&gt; The terms ''taqiyya'' and ''kitman'' may be used synonymously, although the former has the more inclusive meaning of "dissimulation" in general, while the latter refers to the "concealment" of one's convictions by silence or omission.&lt;ref name="Virani47"/&gt;

==Quranic basis==
The technical meaning of the term ''taqiyya'' is derived from the [[Quran]]ic reference to religious dissimulation in [[Sura 3]]:28:
{{quote|Let not the believers take the unbelievers for protectors rather than believers; and whoever does this, he shall have nothing of (the guardianship of) Allah, but &lt;u&gt;you should guard yourselves&lt;/u&gt; against them, &lt;u&gt;guarding carefully&lt;/u&gt; (''illā an &lt;u&gt;tattaqū&lt;/u&gt; minhum &lt;u&gt;tuqāt&lt;/u&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-3/verse-28/ Quran Surah Aal-i-Imraan ( Verse 28 )]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The two words ''tattaqū'' ("you fear") and ''tuqāt'' "in fear" are derived from the same root as ''taqiya'', and use of the abstract noun ''taqiya'' in reference to the general principle described in this passage is first recorded in a Qur'anic gloss by [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Al-Bukhari]] (9th century).&lt;ref&gt;Goldziher (1906:216).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding 3:28, [[Ibn Kathir]] writes, "meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly." He quotes [[Muhammad]]'s companion, [[Abu Ad-Darda']], who said "we smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them," and [[Al-Hasan]] who said "the Tuqyah is acceptable till the Day of Resurrection."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Tafsir ibn Kathir|Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim]] |date=26 October 2002 |first=Isma'il bin 'Umar |last=bin Kathir |authorlink=Ibn Kathir |publisher=Dar-us-Salaam Publishing |chapter=The Prohibition of Supporting the Disbelievers |chapterurl=http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=3&amp;tid=8052 |accessdate=25 May 2011 |origyear=c. 1370 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092927/http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=3&amp;tid=8052 |archivedate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar instance of the Qur'an permitting dissimulation under compulsion is found in [[Sura 16]]:106.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|16|106 |style=ref}} "He who disbelieves in Allah after his having believed, not he who is compelled while his heart is at rest on account of faith, but he who opens (his) breast to disbelief-- on these is the wrath of Allah, and they shall have a grievous chastisement." ([http://quran.com/16/106 Arabic original])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-16/verse-106/ Quran Surah An-Nahl ( Verse 106 )]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sunni and Shia commentators alike observe that verse 16:106 refers to the case of [[Ammar ibn Yasir|'Ammar b. Yasir]], who was forced to renounce his beliefs under physical duress and torture.&lt;ref name=Virani47&gt;{{cite book |last=Virani |first=Shafique N. |title=The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, a Search for Salvation |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-531173-0 |page=47f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shia Islam view==
===Twelver Shia view===
The doctrine of taqiyya was developed at the time of [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] (d. 148 AH/765 AD), the sixth Imamiya [[Shia Imams|Imam]]. It served to protect Shias when [[Al-Mansur]], the [[Abbasid]] caliph, conducted a brutal and oppressive campaign against [[Alids]] and their supporters.&lt;ref name=Momen39&gt;{{cite book |last=Momen |first=Moojan |title=An Introduction to Shi'i Islam |year=1985 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=39 |isbn=978-0-300-03531-5 |quote=The doctrine of taqiyya (religious dissimulation) was also developed at this time. It served to protect the followers of as-Sadiq at a time when al-Mansur was conducting a brutally repressive campaign against `Alids and their supporters.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious dissimulation or Taqiyya while maintaining mental reservation is considered lawful in Shi'ism "in situations where there is overwhelming danger of loss of life or property and where no danger to religion would occur thereby". Shi'is lived mostly as a minority among a frequently-hostile Sunni majority until the rise of [[Safavid dynasty]]. This condition made taqiyya doctrine important to Shias.&lt;ref name=Momen183/&gt;

Taqiyya holds a central place in [[Twelver]] Shia Islam. This is sometimes explained by the minority position Shias had under the political dominance of Sunni Muslims, requiring them to protect themselves through concealment and dissimulation. In Shia legal literature, there is a range of situations in which taqiyya may be used or even required. For Shia Muslims, taqiyya is to conceal their association with their faith when revealing it would result in danger. Taqiyya is done for reasons of safety. For example, a person may fear that he might be killed or harmed if he does not observe taqiyya. In this case, taqiyya is allowed. However, in some circumstances taqiyya may lead to the death of an innocent person; if so, it is not permissible; it is [[haraam]] (forbidden) to kill a human being to save one's own life.&lt;ref name=al-Islamtaqiyya3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter6b/3.html |title=AlTaqiyya, Dissimulation Part 3 |publisher=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Shias, though, advance taqiyya as a form of [[jihad]], a sort of fighting against their adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Israeli |first=Raphael |title=Islam in China: religion, ethnicity, culture, and politics |year=2002 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739103753 |pages=152 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoiD_yafPT8C&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others relate it to the [[esoteric]] nature of early Shia Islam. The knowledge (''‘[[Ilm (Arabic)|Ilm]]'') given to the Imams by God had to be protected and the truth would have to be hidden before the uninitiated or their adversaries until the coming of the [[Twelfth Imam]], when this knowledge and ultimate meaning can become known to everyone.&lt;ref name="Etan345"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Etan |title=Secrecy and Concealment |year=1995 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |isbn=9789004102354 |pages=345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=korHuwmTTQQC&amp;pg=PA345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=L. |first=Clarke |title=Reason and inspiration in Islam |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9781850434702 |pages=46–47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9zSbNr8gIC&amp;pg=PA46 |editor=Todd Lawson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious rulings of the Shia Imams was also influenced by taqiyya. Without it, basic articles of early Shiism do not make sense and lose coherence because of contradictions. Some of the traditions from the Imams make taqiyya a central element of Shiism: "He who has no taqiyya has no faith"; "he who forsakes taqiyya is like him who forsakes prayer"; "taqiyya is the believers shield, but for taqiyya, God would not have been worshipped". It is unclear whether those traditions only refer to taqiyya under risk or also taqiyya to conceal the esoteric doctrines of Shiism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Etan |title=Secrecy and Concealment |year=1995 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |isbn=9789004102354 |page=373 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=korHuwmTTQQC&amp;pg=PA345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Shias today deny that taqiyya has any significance in their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gleave |first=Robert |title=Inevitable doubt: two theories of Shīʻī jurisprudence |year=2000 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004115958 |page=75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZVZN7AOG0C&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ismaili Shia view===
{{Ismailis|Concepts}}
For the [[Ismailis]] in the aftermath of the [[Mongol]] onslaught of the [[Alamut]] state in 1256 CE, the need to practice taqiyya became necessary, not only for the protection of the community itself, which was now stateless, but also for safeguarding the line of the [[Nizari]] [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|Ismaili Imamate]] during this period of unrest.&lt;ref name="Virani12"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, a Search for Salvation |isbn=978-0-19-531173-0 |first=Shafique N. |last=Virani |authorlink=Shafique Virani |year=2007 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the Shia [[Imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] stated "Taqiyya is my religion and the religion of my ancestors",&lt;ref name=al-Islamtaqiyya3 /&gt; a tradition recorded in various sources including ''Kitāb al-Maḥāsin'' of Aḥmad b. Muhammad al-Barqī and the ''[[Da‘ā’im al-Islām]]'' of [[Qadi al-Nu'man|al-Qāḍī al-Nu‘mān]].&lt;ref name="Virani53"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, a Search for Salvation |isbn=978-0-19-531173-0 |first=Shafique N. |last=Virani |authorlink=Shafique Virani |year=2007 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such periods in which the Imams are concealed are known as ''satr'', however the term may also refer to times when the Imams were not physically hidden from view but rather when the community was required to practice precautionary dissimulation. During ''satr'' the Imam could only be accessed by his community and in extremely dangerous circumstances, would be accessible only to the highest-ranking members of the Ismaili hierarchy (ḥudūd), whose function it was to transmit the teachings of the Imam to the community.

According to Shia scholar Muhammad Husain Javari Sabinal, Shiism would not have spread at all if not for taqiyya, referring to instances where Shia have been ruthlessly persecuted by the Sunni political elite during the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;Tarikhush Shi'ah, p.230&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, for the Ismailis, the persistence and prosperity of the community today owes largely to the careful safeguarding of the beliefs and teachings of the Imams during the [[Ilkhanate]], the [[Safawid]] dynasty, and other periods of persecution. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Alawite]]s beliefs have never been confirmed by their modern religious authorities.&lt;ref name="Yunis 1992, p. 63"&gt;'Abd al‑Latif al‑Yunis, Mudhakkirat al‑Duktur 'Abd al‑Latif al‑Yunis, Damascus: Dar al‑`Ilm, 1992, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Alawites tend to conceal their beliefs (''taqiyya'') due to historical persecution.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8684113/Secretive-sect-of-the-rulers-of-Syria.html Secretive sect of the rulers of Syria], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], 05 Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some tenets of the faith are secret, known only to a select few;&lt;ref name="GlobSec"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-alawi.htm |title=Alawi Islam |publisher=Globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GB31QSFmVYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Yaron+Friedman&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dEyTTuy7D8KKsgLKy-CNAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Nuṣayrī-ʻAlawīs |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, they have been described as a [[Mysticism|mystical]] sect.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-JVOKeNkllgC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=alawi+syncretic#v=onepage&amp;q=alawi%20syncretic&amp;f=false |title=Lebanon: current issues and background, John C.

===Druze view===
Because of the [[Druze]]'s Ismaili Shia origin, they have also been associated with taqiyya. When the Druze were a minority being persecuted they took the appearance of another religion externally, usually the ruling religion in the area, and for the most part adhered to Muslim customs by this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogan |first=Eugene L. |title=The war for Palestine: Rewriting the History of 1948 |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=74–75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oi8cmbTa6qMC&amp;pg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunni Islam view==
The basic principle of taqiyya is agreed upon by scholars, though they tend to restrict it to dealing with non-Muslims and when under compulsion (''ikrāh''), while Shia jurists also allow it in interactions with Muslims and in all necessary matters (''ḍarūriyāt'').&lt;ref&gt;Louis Medoff, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/taqiya-i-shiism "TAQIYA i. In Shiʿism,"] Encyclopædia Iranica, online edition, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  In Sunni jurisprudence protecting one's belief during extreme or exigent circumstances is called ''idtirar'' (إضطرار), which translates to "being forced" or "being coerced", and this word is not specific to concealing the faith; for example, under the jurisprudence of ''idtirar'' one is allowed to consume prohibited food to avoid starving to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iqbal |first=Javid |last2='Umar |first2=Muhammad Suhail |title=The concept of state in Islam: a reassessment (Volume 13 of Iqbal Academy brochure series) |page=12 |year=2000 |publisher=Iqbal Academy Pakistan, original from the University of Michigan |ISBN=978-969-416-294-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, denying one's faith under duress is "only at most permitted and not under all circumstances obligatory".&lt;ref name=STROT&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] |chapter=Takkiyya |volume=10 |year=2000 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-11211-7 |pages=134–135 |author=R.

Heinrichs}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] comments on sura XVI, verse 106 (Tafsir, Bulak 1323, xxiv, 122): "If any one is compelled and professes unbelief with his tongue, while his heart contradicts him, in order to escape his enemies, no blame falls on him, because God takes his servants as their hearts believe." This verse was recorded after [[Ammar Yasir]] was forced by the idolaters of [[Mecca]] to recant his faith and denounce the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. Al-Tabari explains that concealing one's faith is only justified if the person is in mortal danger, and even then [[Shahid|martyrdom]] is considered a noble alternative. If threatened, it would be preferable for a Muslim to migrate to a more peaceful place where a person may practice their faith openly, "since God's earth is wide."&lt;ref name=STROT/&gt; In [[Hadith]], in the Sunni commentary of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], known as the [[Fath al-Bari]], it is stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hadith.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=192&amp;TOCID=3825&amp;BookID=33&amp;PID=12714 |title=عرض صفحة الكتاب - الحديث - موقع الإسلام}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote| أجمعوا على أن من أكره على الكفر واختار القتل أنه أعظم أجرا عند الله ممن اختار الرخصة ، وأما غير الكفر فإن أكره على أكل الخنزير وشرب الخمر مثلا فالفعل أولى }}
Which translates to:  {{Quote|There is a consensus that whomsoever is forced into apostasy and chooses death has a greater reward than a person who takes the license [to deny one's faith under duress], but if a person is being forced to eat pork or drink wine, then they should do that [instead of choosing death].}}

===Examples===
When [[Al-Ma'mun|Mamun]] became [[Caliphate|caliph]] (813 AD), he tried to impose his religious views on the status of the Qur'an over all his subjects, in an ordeal called the [[mihna]], or "inquisition". His views were disputed, and many of those who refused to follow his views were imprisoned, tortured, or threatened with the sword.&lt;ref&gt;Patton, Walter Melville (1897). [https://archive.org/details/ahmedibnhanbalan00pattuoft ''Ahmed Ibn Hanbal and the Mihna'']. Leiden: Brill. pp. 79–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Sunni scholars chose to affirm Mamun's view that the Qur'an was created in spite of their beliefs,&lt;ref name=Virani47/&gt; though a notable exception to this was noted scholar and theologian [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], who chose to endure torture rather than to lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kadaoQrEo_0C&amp;pg=PA149 |page=149 |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-137-30811-5 |author=M.

Following the end of the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 1492, Muslims were persecuted by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] and [[forced to convert to Christianity]] or face expulsion. The principle of taqiyya became very important for Muslims during the [[Inquisition]] in sixteenth century Spain, as it allowed them to convert to Christianity while remaining [[crypto-Muslims]], practicing Islam in secret. In 1504, [[Ahmad bin Abi Jum'ah|Ubayd Allah al-Wahrani]], a [[Maliki]] [[mufti]] in [[Oran]], [[Oran fatwa|issued a fatwā]] allowing Muslims to make extensive use of concealment in order to maintain their faith.&lt;ref name="StewartNYUEssay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orjqSmYJhqoC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;lpg=PA220&amp;dq=morisco+taqiyya+fatwa#v=onepage&amp;q=morisco%20taqiyya%20fatwa&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-300-07522-9 |first=Henry |last=Kamen |authorlink=Henry Kamen |year=1998 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven |pages=219–220 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller2008-114&gt;{{Cite book |title=Guardians of Islam: Religious Authority and Muslim Communities of Late Medieval Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-_4E4-_QNYC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=al-wahrani+taqiyya#v=onepage&amp;q=al-wahrani%20taqiyya&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-231-13612-9 |first=Kathryn A. |last=Miller |year=2008 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |page=114 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |quote=Unlike the majority of Maliki scholars before him, he openly embraced the idea of a Mudejar jihad that was bound to the notion of inner steadfastness under persecution...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen as an exceptional case, since Islamic law prohibits conversion except in cases of mortal danger, and even then requires recantation as quickly as possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Maimonides: The Life and World of One of Civilization's Greatest Minds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeSjPrAjF0kC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=morisco+taqiyya+fatwa#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-385-51200-8 |first=Joel L. |last=Kraemer |year=2010 |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=New York |pages=100–101 |quote=A responsum (fatwa) by 'Ubaydallah al-Wahrani, issued in December 1504, permitted [the Moriscos] to exercise prudent dissimulation (''taqiyya'') by pretending to be Christians. ...

==Contemporary debate==

[[Raymond Ibrahim]] wrote an article on taqiya in 2008. In it he mentioned a translation of Lebanese [[Druze]] scholar [[Sami Makarem]]'s monograph ''Al Taqiyya Fi Al Islam'' ("Dissimulation in Islam"), stating Sami argued that the concept should be considered "mainstream" and ubiquitous in modern Islamic politics, "Taqiyya is of fundamental importance in Islam. Practically every Islamic sect agrees to it and practices it. We can go so far as to say that the practice of taqiyya is mainstream in Islam, and that those few sects not practicing it diverge from the mainstream...Taqiyya is very prevalent in Islamic politics, especially in the modern era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/2094/taqiyya-revisited|title=Taqiyya Revisited: A Response to the Critics|first=Raymond|last=Ibrahim|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jiaa.janes.com/public/jiaa/special_reports.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303150030/http://jiaa.janes.com/public/jiaa/special_reports.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later characterized by another author in ''[[Jane's Information Group|Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst]]'' as being "well-researched, factual in places but ... ultimately misleading".&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Islamic-Affairs-Analyst-2008/Interpreting-Taqiyya.html "Interpreting Taqiyya: Special Report"], ''Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst''.

{{Social teachings of the popes}}
'''Theology of Pope Francis''' is a description of his pronouncements and statements on Christian beliefs and practices. This article deals with salient features, what he ''emphasized'' during his [[Pope|pontificate]], as distinct from his time as [[Jesuit]] [[Provincial superior|provincial]] or as [[archbishop]] in [[Argentina]]. He is the first member of the [[Society of Jesus]] to be appointed [[List of popes#21st century|Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]], elected on 13&amp;nbsp;March 2013.

[[Pope Francis|Francis]] has been described as being in close continuity with the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962-1965). With the Vatican II, according to the ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'', "the monopoly exercised by [[Neo Thomism|neo-Thomists]] in the church collapsed" and Christianity increased its appeal to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Thomism|title=Thomism {{!}} theology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been popular with people across religious lines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-35888289|title=Pope tops leaders' popularity poll|date=2016-03-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the start of his papacy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Through much of Francis' thought there is an insistence on retaining contrasting notions in tension, such as Church doctrine which "must constantly be re-rooted in pastoral realities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/book-review/2017/11/18/new-book-looks-intellectual-history-francis-pope-polarity/|title=New book looks at intellectual history of Francis, and why he is 'pope of polarity'|last=|first=|date=2017-11-18|work=Crux|access-date=2018-04-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|quote=|postscript=. The title of Bergoglio's unpublished thesis was “Polar opposition as Structure of Daily Thought and Christian Proclamation”. He is said to have continued work on this for several years after his 1986 studies in Germany.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new balance he has struck in Church teaching can be seen in his emphasis on God's merciful love for all people, regardless of religious belief, and his intolerance of triumphalism and smugness in the Church. It appears in the way he handles the various polarities that arise in topic after topic, as regards the Church's mission and leadership, pastoral sense and liturgy, and charity as the foundation for morality and motivation for [[environmentalism]] today. Francis has also become known for his "sharp and unscripted remarks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/13/the-pope-said-what/comment-page-1/|title=The pope said what? Six stunners from Francis|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'', released eight months after his election, has been described as his programmatic, "a core document of this pontificate",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2013/11/25/vaticaninsider/eng/the-vatican/francis-this-is-how-the-joy-of-the-gospel-can-reform-the-church-hzx32nyzFfdI3XAEppsB8M/pagina.html|title=Francis: This is how the joy of the Gospel can reform the Church|website=LaStampa.it|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his own words "pointing out new paths for the Church's journey for years to come".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html|title=Evangelii Gaudium: Apostolic Exhortation on the Proclamation of the Gospel in Today's World |date=24 November 2013 |author=Pope Francis |website=Vatican |at=Opening paragraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vatican II revisited==
It is suggested that the pontificate of Pope Francis will be looked back upon as the "decisive moment in the history of the church in which the full force of the Second Vatican Council's reformist vision was finally realized".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|178}} Francis returned to the Vatican II theme of ''ressourcement,'' making the church "more faithful to the original sources in scripture and early traditions than to the social, political, and cultural aspects of more recent times".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|54}} In contrast to John Paul II who emphasized continuity with the past in Vatican II's teachings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-NND2SMQswC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=pope+john+paul,+discontinuity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2g_4EUFvEk&amp;sig=e40XszOAp7Mlv-BYmZyweNIj54k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi12bzE14zbAhVE74MKHew1C7kQ6AEIngEwFA#v=onepage&amp;q=pope%20john%20paul,%20discontinuity&amp;f=false|title=The Moral Theology of Pope John Paul II|last=Curran|first=Charles E.|date=2005-01-06|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=|isbn=1589014510|location=|pages=207|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crisismagazine.com/2013/how-john-paul-ii-restored-liturgical-sanity|title=How John Paul II Restored Liturgical Sanity  - Crisis Magazine|date=2013-07-08|work=Crisis Magazine|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reconciling discontinuities, Francis' papacy from the start emphasized discontinuities: a "church that is poor and for the poor"; "disposal of the baroque trappings" in liturgical celebrations; revision of the institutional aspects of the church, and emphasizing mercy; the need to go into the margins of the world, with a bias toward appointing cardinals from the southern hemisphere; and implementing "one of the original proposals of Vatican II" in constituting a council of eight cardinals who would be above the Roman Curia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}}

[[Brendan Leahy]], Bishop of [[Limerick]], sees Francis' priorities as: formation of the clergy and laity to be capable of warming peoples' hearts, walking with them, dialoguing, and mending their brokenness; solidarity and collegiality; being in a permanent state of mission, with a maternal heart; and speaking up on social justice issues, for the improvement of society.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Francis-Factor-New-Departure/dp/1782181466|title=The Francis Factor: A New Departure|last=Littleton|first=John|last2=Maher|first2=Eamon|date=2014-02-28|publisher=Columba Press|year=|isbn=9781782181460|location=|pages=xviii|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97,98}}

According to the editors of a collection of essays on Francis, "the essence of Francis' theology is formed by a commitment to the poor and the marginalized, and unwillingness to pass moral judgment on others, a dislike of legalism and decrees from on high, and a distrust of monolithic institutions."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}} Francis is very much at home with Dostoyevsky's phrase, "Beauty will save the world". "He's encouraging the Church to live joyfully in the power of Christ's presence, open to the wisdom of the Spirit."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{rp|204–205}}

== The Church's mission ==
In Chapter One of ''Evangelii gaudium'' on “The Church’s Missionary Transformation”, Pope Francis speaks of his dream of "a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything, so that the Church’s customs ... and structures can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today’s world rather than for her self-preservation" (EG 27). For Francis, "missionary outreach is ''paradigmatic for all the Church’s activity''” (EG15) and it is “the entire People of God which evangelizes” (EG 17), called by their baptism to be missionary disciples (EG 120).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69m7DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=pope+francis+and+the+missionary+impulse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uH027i-rxv&amp;sig=8_g0-OF9lIfkbWU6WjWmp4zNFRY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf85-R39XXAhWDH5QKHTUtD0sQ6AEIkgEwFQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pope%20francis%20and%20the%20missionary%20impulse&amp;f=false|title=Pope Francis and the Future of Catholicism: Evangelii Gaudium and the Papal Agenda|last=Mannion|first=Gerard|date=2017-02-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781108132749|location=|pages=130|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Men-Mercy-Francis-Speaks-Priests/dp/1942611978|title=Men of Mercy: Pope Francis Speaks to Priests|last=Francis|first=Pope|date=2016-10-21|publisher=Beacon Publishing|year=|isbn=9781942611974|location=Erlanger, Kentucky|pages=201|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; They should be troubled in conscience that so many, our brothers and sisters, live without the sense of purpose and consolation that come from knowing Jesus Christ and without a faith community for support (EG 49). His emphasis on joy ''([[Evangelii gaudium|Joy of the Gospel]], [[Gaudete et exsultate|Rejoice and be glad]])'' "is an antidote to the disenchantment and melancholy of the world today", the joy of "doing good with the aim of reviving the spirit of the church".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{rp|15,17}}

As regards the Catholic's approach to those of other faiths, he says that "the worst thing of all is religious proselytism, which paralyzes: 'I am talking with you in order to persuade you' ". He calls for dialogue that allows for mutual growth, by attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2014/in-latest-interview-pope-francis-reveals-top-10-secrets-to-happiness.cfm|title=In latest interview, Pope Francis reveals top 10 secrets to happiness|last=Glatz|first=Carol|date=29 July 2014|work=Catholic News Service|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes [[Vatican II]] on the Church's continual need for reform (EG 26). He speaks of the Church as "a mother with an open heart", constantly in need of communicating better, becoming "weak with the weak, ... everything for everyone" (1 Cor 9:22).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contagiouslycatholic.com/2015/11/02/a-mother-with-an-open-heart/|title=A Mother with an Open Heart {{!}} Contagiously Catholic|website=www.contagiouslycatholic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He repeats what he told the Church in Buenos Aires, that he prefers a Church that is “bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security, ... caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures” (EG 49).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/11/26/pope-francis-poverty/3759005/|title=Pope Francis: 'I prefer a church which is bruised, hurting and dirty'|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Evangelii gaudium'' he wrote: “In many places an administrative approach prevails over a pastoral approach, as does a concentration on administering the sacraments apart from other forms of evangelization” (63). In line with this he has said: "When the church does not emerge from itself to evangelize, it becomes self-referential and therefore becomes sick. ... The evils that, over time, occur in ecclesiastical institutions have their root in self-referentiality, a kind of theological narcissism."&lt;ref name="US news"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Steven |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2013/03/26/pope-francis-theological-narcissism-speech|title=Pope Francis Reportedly Blasted 'Theological Narcissism' Before Election |work=US News and World Report|date=2013-03-26|accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, Kathryn Jean Lopez, editor at large of ''National Review,'' responded to conservative criticism of Francis by observing: ''"''Pope Francis didn’t start the fires that divide the Catholic Church. Under Francis, they are out in the open more, at the highest levels. There is certainly sunlight that is being shone on things that have been previously in the dark. ...He may just trust the Holy Spirit more than the rest of us to sort it out."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/10/pope-francis-catholic-church-crisis-symposium/|title=The Crisis of the Catholic Church under Pope Francis {{!}} National Review|date=2018-10-21|work=National Review|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Church leadership ==
=== Decentralization ===
Francis argues for “sound 'decentralization'. ... It is not advisable for the Pope to take the place of local Bishops in the discernment of every issue which arises in their territory” (EG 16). He finds little progress in finding a new way of exercising [[Papal primacy]] as requested by John Paul II (EG 32) in continuity with the desire of the Bishops at Vatican II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Lumen gentium, 19, 22 |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html|last=|first= |date=|website=www.vatican.va|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He seeks to give episcopal conferences "genuine doctrinal authority", and foresees decentralization as facilitating Church life and missionary outreach (EG 32).&lt;ref name="apost letter magnum principium" /&gt; Francis decries the imbalance that can occur “when we speak more about law than about grace, more about the Church than about Christ, more about the Pope than about God’s word” (EG 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Reese |first=Thomas |url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/faith-and-justice/church-reform-requires-decentralization-synodality|title=Church reform requires decentralization, synodality |date=2016-02-11|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2017-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Francis Calls for Decentralization And ‘Conversion’ of the Papacy|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/issue/francis-calls-decentralization-and-conversion-papacy|date=2015-10-21 |work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He speaks of consensus building (EG 240) and calls for attention to the [[Sensus fidelium|''sensus fidei'']] or "instinct of faith" especially of the poor (EG 198), whereby the Catholic faithful discern what is of God through a connaturality or intuitive wisdom (EG 119).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OOBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=connaturality+of+intuitive+wisdom+pope+francis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YjfNMEYCyn&amp;sig=5AIr4cJAc3qe1YxeujYubUrhEks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjivOO-7dXXAhXIEpQKHWzWAvIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=connaturality%20of%20intuitive%20wisdom%20pope%20francis&amp;f=false|title=Pope Francis and the Future of Catholicism: Evangelii Gaudium and the Papal Agenda|last=Mannion|first=Gerard|date=2017-04-27|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107142541|location=|pages=46|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/world/europe/vatican-meeting-reveals-divisions-among-catholics-on-family-issues.html|title=Pope Francis’ Plans for Inclusiveness Divide Bishops|last=Goodstein|first=Laurie|date=2015-10-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-23|last2=Povoledo|first2=Elisabetta|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clericalism ===
Francis emphasizes that the "hour of the laity" has arrived and decries&amp;nbsp;clericalism as rife in the Church, saying that it "leads to the functionalization of the laity, treating them as 'messengers' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://zenit.org/articles/text-of-popes-letter-to-pontifical-commission-for-latin-america/|title=Text of Pope’s Letter to Pontifical Commission for Latin America|date=2016-04-27|work=Zenit|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; And through clericalism a priest "can become seduced by the prospect of a career, ... turning him into a functionary, a cleric worried more about himself, about organizations and structures, than about the true good of the People of God".&lt;ref name="culture-of-encounter"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/storico/2013/05/22/pope_at_mass_culture_of_encounter_is_the_foundation_of_peace/en1-694445 |title=Pope at Mass: Culture of encounter is the foundation of peace |work=Vatican Radio|language=en |access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks of the "eighth sacrament" that some priests would create – the "pastoral customs office" that would close doors on people instead of facilitating their reception of the sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/cotidie/2013/documents/papa-francesco-cotidie_20130525_christian-acceptance.html|title=Christian acceptance |date=25 May 2013 |author=Pope Francis |website=Vatican |access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Catholic-popes-enjoy-lifestyle-of-kings-contrasting-the-simplicity-of-Jesus|title=Why do Catholic popes enjoy lifestyle of kings contrasting the simplicity of Jesus? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing apostolic nuncios, who recommend to the pope good candidates for [[Episcopal see|episcopal]] appointment, he said:

Francis wants "a church based not on fancy vestments and infallible pronouncements, but on love of God and love of others."&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;{{rp|xx}} He is critical of a church that is preoccupied with small-minded rules and is a museum for the saintly few rather than, with missionary zeal, being a place of welcome for the many.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{rp|32}} For the church's clergy he sees "the need to hold both action and contemplation in creative tension", to be leaders who are led by God's grace, contemplatives in action.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{rp|109}} He has castigated and taken action against clerics who he sees as living a princely life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christiantoday.com/article/pope.francis.blasts.cardinals.extravagant.penthouse/37833.htm|title=Pope Francis blasts cardinal's extravagant penthouse |work=Christian Today |access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.episcopalcafe.com/pope-francis-continues-to-clean-house/|title=Pope Francis continues to clean house|date=2015-07-18|work=Episcopal Cafe|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis said clergy should be shepherds looking after the people, but knows they can be tempted and corrupted by power.  When they take from the people instead of giving, [[simony]] and other corruption can follow. Love between the clergy and the people is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/05/15/pope_francis_at_mass:_bishops_and_priests_need_prayers_of_faithful/en1-692314 |title=Pope at Mass: bishops and priests need prayers of faithful |date=2013-05-15 |work=Vatican Radio |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis fears some clerics "become wolves and not shepherds; ... careerism and the search for a promotion [to the hierarchy] come under the category of spiritual worldliness", deceitfully trying to appear holy.

Speaking to 120 superiors of religious orders, Francis kept up his campaign against clericalism, that seminary formation must be “a work of art, not a police action” where seminarians “grit their teeth, try not to make mistakes, follow the rules smiling a lot, just waiting for the day when they are told ‘Good, you have finished formation’. ...This is hypocrisy that is the result of clericalism, which is one of the worst evils”. Priestly formation "must form their hearts. Otherwise we are creating little monsters. And then these little monsters mold the people of God. This really gives me goose bumps”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/pope-warns-poorly-trained-priests-can-become-little-monsters|title=Pope: Warns that Poorly Trained Priests Can Become ‘Little Monsters’|date=2014-01-04|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picking up on Bishop de Smedt's much-quoted remark at the Second Vatican Council, that the Catholic church was suffering from triumphalism, clericalism, and legalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/mutual-presence|title=A Mutual Presence {{!}} Commonweal Magazine|website=www.commonwealmagazine.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis described the Church’s “temptation to triumphalism, ... a Church that is content with what it is or has&amp;nbsp;– well sorted, well organized, with all its offices, everything in order, everything perfect, efficient”. But this, he said, is “a Church that denies its martyrs, because it does not know that martyrs are needed”. A healthy Church, on the other hand, recognizes “triumph through failure&amp;nbsp;– human failure&amp;nbsp;– the failure of the Cross”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pope at Mass: The temptation of triumphalism | work=Vatican Radio | date=29 May 2013 | url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/storico/2013/05/29/pope_at_mass_the_temptation_of_triumphalism/en1-696517 | access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
[[Austen Ivereigh]], in writing a biography of Francis, describes him as having the rare combination of "the political genius of a charismatic leader and the prophetic holiness of a desert saint", the later being a characteristic of his theology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889324005|title=The great reformer : Francis and the making of a radical pope|last=Austen,|first=Ivereigh,|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=1250074991|edition= First|location=New York|pages=|oclc=889324005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|357}} But those who say that Francis "speaks to the emotions and not to the intelligence ... don't know Bergoglio, who has had an impressive formation in many fields".&lt;ref name=Pique&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pope-Francis-Revolution-Biography-Bergoglio/dp/0829442170|title=Pope Francis: Life and Revolution: A Biography of Jorge Bergoglio|last=Piqué|first=Elisabetta|last2=|first2=|date=2014-10-21|publisher=Loyola Press|year=|isbn=9780829442175|edition= 1st|location=Chicago, Ill|pages=236|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his dissertation work Francis studied Romano Guardini's idea of holding conflicting notions in tension in a multicultural world; to respect "polar tensions" without negating any of them or reducing them to a higher synthesis; to respond to each in the light of the gospel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

To find God in today's world, Francis frequently calls for “discernment”, an important notion from the Jesuit founder’s [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|''Spiritual Exercises'']]. The word occurs twenty times in ''Evangelii gaudium''. Francis says that by discernment one could “avoid a kind of legalism” and help people conform to the image of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=To understand Pope Francis, you have to understand the Jesuits|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/to-understand-pope-francis-you-have-to-understand-the-jesuits-23526/|work=Catholic News Agency|access-date=2017-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions the need for discernment to adapt the sign of Christian initiation to each cultural context (EG 166) – to see Christ in endless diversity (EG 181) and in all others whoever they may be (EG 179), in the particularity of each situation in which we are to deliver God's call to people (EG 154). This requires “rethinking of goals, structures, style, and methods” (EG 33) and "deeper discernment about our experiences and life itself" enlightened by the Gospel (EG 77). Francis is saying that "ultimately people have responsibility for their own lives and salvation", that "he does not have all the answers", and "that he can live with doubt. He often points to the importance of discernment. ... He is critical of 'those who today always look for the disciplinarian solutions, those who long for an exaggerated doctrinal 'security'. ... He is steering Catholics away from the dogmatism and legalism of the past and the old-time religion and proposing a more nuanced approach to morality".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{rp|75}} He is seen as following a more inductive rather than deductive approach to situations arising, following the “See-Judge-Act” method in applying Catholic social teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/news-analysis/2018/07/24/recalling-the-belgian-cardinal-who-truly-shaped-franciss-destiny/|title=Recalling the Belgian cardinal who truly shaped Francis's destiny|date=2018-07-24|work=Crux|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a matter of months, Francis has elevated the healing mission of the church&amp;nbsp;– the church as servant and comforter of hurting people in an often harsh world&amp;nbsp;– above the doctrinal police work so important to his recent predecessors.|sign=|source=}}

=== Important role of women ===
In God's merciful love, the Spirit draws us together as God's people, and it is as a people that we expand the circle of those living out the joy of the gospel. We are all called to missionary discipleship, ruling out clericalism or the partitioning off of women.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;{{rp|38–39}} Francis does not see women being ordained to the ministerial priesthood, but says: "Our great dignity derives from Baptism. ...When we speak of sacramental power 'we are in the realm of function, not that of dignity or holiness' " (EG 104). And he says:

{{Quote|text=Many women share pastoral responsibilities with priests, helping to guide people, families, and groups and offering new contributions to theological reflection. But we need to create still broader opportunities for a more incisive female presence in the Church ... in the various other settings where important decisions are made. (EG 103-104)|sign=|source=}}

Looking ahead, he said that many women are well prepared to contribute to religious and theological discussions at the highest levels, alongside their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/11/07/pope-francis-appoints-two-laywomen-key-positions-roman-curia|title=Pope Francis appoints two laywomen to key positions in Roman Curia|date=2017-11-07|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more necessary than ever that they do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=9 June 2017 |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/06/09/pope_francis_central_role_of_women_interfaith_dialogue/1317917 |title=Pope Francis: central role of women interfaith dialogue |work=Vatican Radio |access-date=2017-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "because women look at reality with a different, a greater richness".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2015/01/19/vaticaninsider/eng/the-vatican/francis-ill-tell-you-about-a-time-they-tried-to-bribe-me-vivA87qe2wLjtwAAJs5e8I/pagina.html|title=Francis: "I’ll tell you about a time they tried to bribe me"|work=LaStampa.it|access-date=2017-09-29|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Married priests ===
The Church does not require married clergy who are converts to cease their ministry if it considers their ordination valid. And celibacy has never been regarded as a divine law for priests. Francis expressed his openness to consider having some older married men ordained, especially in mission areas where there is an extreme shortage of priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Pope Francis: married men could be ordained to ease priest shortages|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/10/pope-francis-married-men-could-be-ordained-to-ease-priest-shortages|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2017-03-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/10/europe/pope-married-men-priests/index.html|title=Pope may allow married Catholic men as priests|last=Gallagher|first=Delia|website=CNN|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with his idea of [[collegiality]], he chooses to wait for the conferences of bishops to request this in the light of local situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=On Married Priests, Cardinal Kasper Says Pope Wants Proposals from Bishops' Conferences|url=https://onepeterfive.com/married-priests-cardinal-kasper-says-pope-wants-proposals-from-bishops-conferences/ |date=2017-04-06 |work=OnePeterFive|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pastoral sense ==
[[File:Pope Francis Malacanang 19.jpg|thumb|Francis in the Philippines|280px]]
In ''Evangelii gaudium'', Francis quotes a passage from the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' which stands out in his own thinking: “Imputability and responsibility for an action can be diminished or even nullified by ignorance, inadvertence, duress, fear, habit, inordinate attachments, and other psychological or social factors”. He goes on to distinguish between the "evangelical ideal" and the "stages of personal growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-vatican-pope-divorce-communion-20160408-story.html|title=Pope Francis eases the way for divorced Catholics, but reiterates opposition to gay unions|last=Wilkinson|first=Tracy|date=2016-04-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-24|last2=Parvini|first2=Sarah|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2016/04/opinion-usatoday-catholic-church/|title=Catholic Families Need More From Pope Francis - Northwestern Now|website=news.northwestern.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The confessional, he says,

A small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties. (EG 44)|sign=|source=}}

He quotes St. Ambrose: the Communion bread “is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak” (EG 47). Such talk led a few [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]] in the church to speak of an impending schism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-pope-conservatives-2017-story.html|title=Conservative opposition to Pope Francis spurs talk of a schism in the Catholic Church|date=2017-04-17|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis decries self-absorption and failing to find God in every human being (EG 92). He finds this happening with those who observe "certain rules or remain intransigently faithful to a particular Catholic style from the past. A supposed soundness of doctrine or discipline leads instead to a narcissistic and authoritarian elitism" (EG 94).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2015/10/05/pope-francis-offers-good-news-for-narcissists/|title=Pope Francis Offers Good News For Narcissists|date=2015-10-05|work=Aleteia.org – Worldwide Catholic Network Sharing Faith Resources for those seeking Truth – Aleteia.org|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This he decries as

It is what the Lord reprimanded the Pharisees for: "How can you believe, who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?" (Jn 5:44). It is a subtle way of seeking one’s "own interests, not those of Jesus Christ" (Phil 2:21) ... [and] is based on carefully cultivated appearances. (EG 93)|sign=|source=}}

To overcome worldliness it is necessary that "the Church constantly go out from herself, keeping her mission focused on Jesus Christ, and her commitment to the poor” (EG 97), and he adds that "the Church must be a place of mercy freely given, where everyone can feel welcomed, loved, forgiven and encouraged to live the good life of the Gospel." This requires all its members to learn the “art of accompaniment, ... to remove our sandals before the sacred ground of the other (cf. Ex 3:5)", and that the Church itself be constantly evangelized by the Good News (EG 114, 169, 174).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/mercy-is-key-to-the-life-of-faith-pope-francis-says-86096|title=Mercy is key to the life of faith, Pope Francis says|work=Catholic News Agency|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis teaches that we serve the church's heritage best "not by wielding the doctrine of the church as a club" but by meeting the people "'in the streets', listening to their concerns and attending to their wounds", and so knowing "through a pastoral 'connaturality' how the church's doctrine can best be employed to announce God's solidarity with the poor and suffering of this world and the profligate mercy of God.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{rp|138}}

== The Church's liturgy and devotions ==
The editors of ''Go into the Streets!'' write that "Pope Francis inherited a Church which in many ways had moved away from the vision of the Second Vatican Council."&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; John F. Baldovin, S.J., describes Francis' motu proprio ''Magnum Principium'' (3 September 2017) as  &lt;blockquote&gt;certainly a significant change in direction with regard to who has responsibility for liturgical translations. The pope has changed Canon 838 in two important ways. The weight of responsibility now falls much more on the shoulders of the various episcopal conferences. … Those conferences which have been experiencing tension with the Vatican over revised translations, like the French-speaking and German-speaking, now have much more breathing room in deciding what is best for translating liturgical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/09/09/liturgical-expert-explains-pope-francis-change-mass-translation-rules|title=A liturgical expert explains Pope Francis' change to Mass translation rules|date=2017-09-09|work=America Magazine|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This effectively countered the efforts of those who under pope John Paul II had required that "the liturgy conform as closely as possible to the original Latin texts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholiccourier.com/articles/new-missal-will-enrich-worship|title=New missal will enrich worship {{!}} Catholic News &amp; Multimedia {{!}} Diocese of Rochester - Catholic Courier|last=Courier|first=Catholic|website=www.catholiccourier.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his motu proprio Francis said: "the vernacular languages themselves, often only in a progressive manner, would be able to become liturgical languages, standing out in a not dissimilar way to liturgical Latin for their elegance of style and the profundity of their concepts with the aim of nourishing the faith".&lt;ref name="apost letter magnum principium"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2017/09/09/170909a.html|title=Apostolic Letter in the form of Motu Proprio "Magnum Principium" Quibus nonnulla in can. 838 Codicis Iuris Canonici immutantur|website=press.vatican.va|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;This was seen by Jason Horowitz as the end of the “reform of the reform” movement that sought to overturn the principles of liturgical reform proposed by the Second Vatican Council,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/09/world/europe/pope-francis-liturgical-reform.html|title=Pope Francis Shifts Power From Rome With ‘Hugely Important’ Liturgical Reform|last=Horowitz|first=Jason|date=2017-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, as Francis expresses it, “to speak of ‘the reform of the reform’ is an error!”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2016/12/06/pope-francis-there-will-be-no-reform-reform-liturgy|title=Pope Francis: There will be no 'reform of the reform' of the liturgy.|date=2016-12-06|work=America Magazine|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier Francis had written: "We cannot demand that peoples of every continent, in expressing their Christian faith, imitate modes of expression which European nations developed at a particular moment of their history" (EG 118).

Of the Eucharistic celebration he says: “A sacrament is not 'a magical rite' but rather the instrument God has chosen in order to continue to walk beside man as his travelling companion through life”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/events/event.dir.html/content/vaticanevents/en/2013/9/24/papa-francesco-cotidie_20130924_travelling-companion.html|title=A travelling companion (24 September 2013)|website=Vatican.va|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a brief address to liturgists on the anniversary of ''[[Musicam sacram]]'', Francis mentions eight times the importance of the peoples’ active participation in song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2017/march/documents/papa-francesco_20170304_convegno-musica-sacra.html|title=To Participants in the International Conference on Sacred Music |date=4 March 2017 |author=Pope Francis |website=Vatican |access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an address to charismatics he reemphasizes this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/cotidie/2014/documents/papa-francesco-cotidie_20140128_prayer-praise.html|title=The prayer of praise |date=28 January 2014 |author=Pope Francis |website=Vatican |access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that since he had the upper portion of his right lung removed, he is too short of breath to sing the Mass.&lt;ref name="surprises" /&gt;

Francis explains how sacraments are means or instruments, not ends in themselves.&lt;ref name=xyzw&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/homilies/2015/documents/papa-francesco_20150307_omelia-parrocchia-ognissanti.html|title=Pastoral Visit to the Roman Parish of "Ognissanti" |date=7 March 2015 |author=Pope Francis |website=Vatican |access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that true disciples encounter the Lord in the sacraments and receive the power to follow Jesus' teaching. One cannot cover up injustice, dishonesty, and uncharitableness against one's neighbor with prayers and devotions.&lt;ref name=xyzw/&gt; In his encyclical ''Gaudete et Exsultate,'' his emphasis on good works as a means to holiness is such that Alan L. Anderson observes: "I find it curious so little attention is paid in His Holiness’s exhortation to the pivotal role played by the sacraments in attaining holiness. Indeed, to attempt holiness without them would be, well, to flirt with neo-[[Pelagianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2018/04/15/a-curious-absence-in-gaudete-et-exsultate/|title=A Curious Absence in "Gaudete et Exsultate" - The Catholic Thing|date=2018-04-15|work=The Catholic Thing|access-date=2018-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devotional practices ===
Francis remarks how religion has become privatized and purely personal through the secularization of society (EG 64). In this atmosphere a Catholic's devotional life can fall into sentimentality, bringing personal comfort without encounter with others or an evangelizing spirit (EG 78).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/2013/09/25/pope-francis-do-not-attempt-to-privatize-the-church/|title=Pope Francis: Do not attempt to "privatize" the Church – Catholic World Report|website=www.catholicworldreport.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes people who promote such privatized devotion while neglecting the formation of the laity toward the advancement of society (EG 74).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/pope-francis-stresses-formation-of-the-laity-for-their-mission-in-the-world|title=Pope Francis Stresses Formation of the Laity for Their Mission in the World|work=National Catholic Register|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As regards the relationship between private piety and public life, Francis was the first pontiff to suggest automatic excommunication for the [[Mafia]], at an outdoor Mass in [[Calabria]]: "Those who in their life have gone along the evil ways, as in the case of the mafia, they are not with God, they are excommunicated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/21/world/pope-mafia-excommunication/index.html|title=Pope excommunicates Italian Mafia members |work=CNN|first=Delia |last=Gallagher |access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding pilgrimages, Francis says peoples' journeying together to shrines manifests a thirst for God and a working of the Spirit. It enable people to witness to their belief and to feel a part of the Church. Bringing one's children or inviting others is an evangelizing gesture (EG 122-6).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-says-catholic-shrines-are-a-key-place-for-evangelization-23559|title=Pope Francis says Catholic shrines are a key place for evangelization|work=Catholic News Agency|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primacy of charity ==
Francis has said: "The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, ... even the atheists. Everyone! ... We are created children in the likeness of God ... and we all have a duty to do good”.&lt;ref name="culture-of-encounter" /&gt; He points to the Last Judgment scene in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] as proof of how God judges: what we do for the poor, the hungry, the indigent, the outcast, those who suffer and are alone, Jesus regards as done to himself (25:37-40). And he points to the [[Beatitudes]] as showing what gives deep happiness, what Catholics should strive to live up to every day: being poor in spirit and meek and humble of heart, merciful and peacemakers, hungering and thirsting for righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/audiences/2014/documents/papa-francesco_20140806_udienza-generale.html|title=General Audience of 6 August 2014 {{!}} Francis|website=Vatican|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He devotes most of a chapter in ''Gaudete et exsultate'' to explaining these Beatitudes as the way to holiness for everyone (63-94).

=== Capitalism ===
[[File:Pope Francis meets Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|Pope Francis with the [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]]]
Author [[Elisabetta Piqué]], a close friend of Francis, writes: "Francis wants to break down the wall between the [[Global North|North]] and [[Global South|South]] of the world ... (in) the new 'cold war' that he must win over selfishness".&lt;ref name=Pique /&gt; While Christian ethics has always taught that the earth's richness is meant for the common good, Francis has been called a Marxist for his demand for more equality. Francis has "put the poor, the problems of inequality and structural injustice, at the heart of the church's mission, and therefore at the heart of Christian spirituality and living".&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;{{rp|92}} He calls inequality "the root of all social ills" and places on economic and government leaders the responsibility to address its structural causes and to assure all citizens access to education, dignified work, and healthcare. He finds this essential to solving any of the world's problems (EG 202, 205).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/pope-francis-attacks-cult-money|title=Pope Francis attacks 'cult of money' in reform call|last=Davies|first=Lizzy|date=2013-05-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squires, Nick (18 May 2013).

An Italian journalist finds that Francis' comments on capitalism in ''Evangelii gaudium'' "hit the mark", provoking a host of prominent spokespersons for capitalism, and added: "Pope Francis is not afraid to proclaim to the world the limits, obvious to everyone after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial debacle]] (in the United States), of an economic model that, left to itself, is likely to overwhelm the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=

His long-range view is consistent with church tradition and with recent pontiffs &lt;ref name=":k"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/This-Economy-Kills-Francis-Capitalism/dp/0814647251|title=This Economy Kills: Pope Francis on Capitalism and Social Justice|last=Tornielli|first=Andrea|last2=Galeazzi|first2=Giacomo|date=2015-08-17|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=|isbn=9780814647257|location=|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ii}} and with his prioritizing of “time over space”.&lt;ref name=":k" /&gt;{{rp|157}}  “People live poised between each individual moment and the greater, brighter horizon of the utopian future as the final cause which draws us to itself. Here we see a first principle for progress in building a people: time is greater than space” (EG, 222-225).

Francis says that Catholics must say “no to a financial system which rules rather than serves. Behind this attitude lurks a rejection of ethics and a rejection of God” (EG 57). He calls it “increasingly intolerable that financial markets are shaping the destiny of peoples rather than serving their needs, or that the few derive immense wealth from financial speculation while the many are deeply burdened by the consequences”. He adds that speculation in agricultural commodities is “a scandal which seriously compromises access to food on the part of the poorest members of our human family”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2014/june/documents/papa-francesco_20140616_convegno-justpeace.html|title=To participants in the Conference promoted by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace on "Impact Investing for the Poor"|author=Pope Francis|date=16 June 2014|website=Vatican|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis has criticized the [[Trickle-down economics|trickle-down theory]] which claims that economic growth from [[capitalism]] leads to widespread prosperity, as has at times been maintained by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/11/11/can-trump-make-trickle-down-economics-work/93586144/|title=Can Trump make 'trickle-down' economics work?|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He characterized this as never confirmed by the facts and sacralizing the economic system with a "crude and naïve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power" (EG 54). Francis took the occasion of his address to the [[Us congress|US congress]] in 2015 to acknowledge the benefits of capitalism and to clarify that he is not advocating [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxism]].

Clarke]], Anglican Primate of All Ireland, has said that while Francis' "insistence that the poor of the world are Christ's deepest concern" may not be new, his "simplicity of lifestyle ... has undoubtedly conveyed a new impetus and purpose for all Christians"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{rp|122}} "Attention for the poor has become the trademark of Francis's pontificate",&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{rp|3}} the most visible priority of his papacy. He believes that "poverty for us Christians is ... a theological category". His leadership reflects his conviction that "good leadership looks like Jesus in action" and as he says: "Jesus made himself poor to walk along the road with us".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loyolapress.com/products/books/history-or-memoir/pope-francis-why-he-leads-the-way-he-leads|title=Pope Francis - Why He Leads the Way He Leads|last=Lowney|first=Chris|date=|website=www.loyolapress.com|page=69|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For him, the church should be "poor and for the poor" (EG 198), with "creative concern and effective cooperation in helping the poor to live with dignity and reaching out to everyone". Without this all the religious practices and talk of social issues will be just a camouflage (EG 207). He expects some to be offended by his words but would help "those who are in thrall to an individualistic, indifferent, and self-centred mentality, to ... bring dignity to their presence on this earth" (EG 208).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/rush-limbaugh-doesnt-get-pope-francis|title=Rush Limbaugh Doesn't Get Pope Francis {{!}} Catholic Answers|website=www.catholic.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for solidarity with the poor runs through much of ''Evangelii gaudium'', with solidarity mentioned 14 times, indifference 7 times, and widespread selfishness 4 times.

(EG 88-89)|sign=|source=}}He suggests that Jesus can be found in others' faces, voices, and pleas that constantly call us to live in fraternity (EG 91). He calls on lay ministers in the Catholic church to go beyond serving their own communities and show genuine commitment to transform every aspect of life in society with values according to Jesus (EG 94). Only in this way do they respond to the evangelical mandate that God's love potentially holds for them, if they do not refuse help to all those in need (1 Jn 3:17 in EG 187).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.romereports.com/en/2017/10/20/pope-francis-proposes-rethinking-the-market-rules-which-guide-society/|title=Pope Francis proposes rethinking the market rules which guide society|website=www.romereports.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmentalism ==
By issuing ''[[Laudato si']]'' , Francis lifted environmentalism to the high level of teaching of a papal [[encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html |title=Laudato si' |date=24 May 2015 |author=Pope Francis |website=Vatican |access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; even as other Popes wrote encyclicals to argue for the [[Common good#in Catholic social teaching|common good]] in the moral crises of their day.&lt;ref&gt;Leo XIII with [[Rerum novarum]] (social issues) and John XXIII with [[Pacem in terris]] (nuclear war), referenced in paragraph 3 here.&lt;/ref&gt; But as with other issues Francis does not shy away from introducing to the Church a controversial stand, in this case focusing on the human causes of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/us/politics/popes-views-press-gop-on-climate-change.html|title=Pope’s Views on Climate Change Add Pressure to Catholic Candidates|last=Davenport|first=Coral|date=2015-06-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; He addresses Chapter One to all peoples, on our common home, citing "the results of the best scientific research available today" (15). While returning to arguments for this larger audience in chapters three through five, in chapters two and six he addresses largely believers, pointing out that "the Bible has no place for a tyrannical anthropocentrism unconcerned for other creatures" (68).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greanvillepost.com/2015/08/01/a-radical-vatican/|title=A Radical Vatican?|date=2015-08-01|work=The Greanville Post|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks of "the rhythms inscribed in nature"  through sabbatical years and the jubilee year which give rest to the land (71). Among his references are: "The earth is the Lord’s" (Ps 24:1); to God belongs "the earth with all that is within it" (Dt 10:14); humans are to "till and keep the garden of the world" (cf. Gen 2:15).

Francis observes that developed countries exploit the non-renewable resources of poor countries and are lax in assisting them to sustainable development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/laudato-si-call-action-congress|title=Francis' call to action should be heeded by political leaders, writes Senator Sheldon Whitehouse|date=2015-07-07|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though these poor areas are least able to adopt new models that reduce environmental impact (''Laudato si','' 52). This returns to the topic of the ''option for the poor'' (above): Catholics should discern the impact on the poor and on integral human development before launching any project (''Laudato si','' 185). Francis argues for the common destination of the earth's goods, preserving these for the good of all (''Laudato si','' 158). For this Christians must move away from consumerism to a more Christian concept of quality of life, where they can be "grateful for the opportunities which life affords us ... and appreciate the small things" with a certain detachment based on their Christian philosophy of life (''Laudato si','' 222).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2015/06/18/top-ten-takeaways-laudato-si|title=Top Ten Takeaways from 'Laudato Si''|date=2015-06-18|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morality as a vehicle of God's mercy ==
For Francis, "mercy is the greatest of all the virtues" (EG 37) and, according to Cardinal [[Walter Kasper]], "the center of the Gospel, ... the key word of his pontificate, ... (while) Scholastic theology has neglected this topic and turned it into a mere subordinate theme of justice".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|31–32}} In his encyclical on holiness for everyone, ''Gaudete et exsultate'', mercy is the focal theme: "What is Pope Francis’ overall summary of holiness? It’s based on the Beatitudes: 'Seeing and acting with mercy'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2018/04/09/top-five-takeaways-gaudete-et-exsultate|title=Top Five Takeaways from ‘Gaudete et Exsultate’|date=2018-04-09|work=America Magazine|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Francis’s watchword is mercy, but mercy adheres, first, not in alterations of doctrine but in the new way that Catholics are invited to think of doctrine", in pastoral practice in conformity with what "Jesus wants – a Church attentive to the goodness which the Holy Spirit sows in the midst of human weakness".&lt;ref name=yorker&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-morality-of-pope-francis-joy-of-love|title=The New Morality of Pope Francis|date=2016-04-08|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis emphasized this by washing the feet of prisoners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Esteves |first=Junno Arocho |date=13 April 2017 |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2017/pope-washes-feet-of-12-prison-inmates-at-holy-thursday-mass.cfm |title=Pope washes feet of 12 prison inmates at Holy Thursday Mass |work=Catholic News Service |language=en |access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was for some people a shocking gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/03/30/popes-upsets-traditionalists/2037463/|title=Pope's foot-wash a final straw for traditionalists|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis chose for his motto ''miserando atque eligendo,'' literally "by having mercy and by selecting", which refers to Jesus' selection for apostleship [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] the tax collector who was considered unclean by Jewish law. He mentions God's mercy 32 times in ''Evangelii gaudium'' and says: "God never tires of forgiving us; we are the ones who tire of seeking his mercy" (EG 3). Francis declared 2016 a yearlong celebration of God's mercy, and describes mercy as fundamental to the ''pastoral sense'' which he enjoins on all those who would exercise ministry in the Church (see above). He writes that in becoming flesh God's Son "summoned us to the revolution of tenderness” (EG 88), mentioning "tenderness" 11 times in&amp;nbsp;''Evangelii gaudium'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/04/25/pope-francis-urges-revolution-tenderness-new-ted-talk|title=Pope Francis urges a "revolution of tenderness" in new TED Talk|date=2017-04-26|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

He said that “Christian morality is not a form of stoicism, or self-denial, or merely a practical philosophy, or a catalogue of sins and faults. Before all else, the Gospel invites us to respond to the God of love who saves us, to see God in others, and to go forth from ourselves to seek the good of others” (EG 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_bjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=Christian+morality+is+not+a+form+of+stoicism+francis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6hV-R8bB6g&amp;sig=mRB6nF4xWWuQevNueZmQVbL1IBc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjeo-HCitbXAhVk54MKHZ1SDFAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20morality%20is%20not%20a%20form%20of%20stoicism%20francis&amp;f=false|title=The Preaching of Pope Francis: Missionary Discipleship and the Ministry of the Word|last=Heille|first=Gregory|date=2015-02-19|publisher=Liturgical Press|year=|isbn=9780814649275|location=|pages=50|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Saint Thomas Aquinas pointed out that the precepts which Christ and the apostles gave to the people of God “are very few”. Citing Saint Augustine, he noted that the precepts subsequently enjoined by the Church should be insisted upon with moderation "so as not to burden the lives of the faithful" and make our religion a form of servitude, whereas "God’s mercy has willed that we should be free”. (EG 43)&lt;ref name=yorker/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

He warned against "codification of the faith in rules and regulations, as the scribes, the Pharisees, the doctors of the law did in the time of Jesus. To us, everything will be clear and set in order, but the faithful and those in search will still hunger and thirst for God". He went on to describe the Church as a field hospital where people should come to know God's warmth and closeness to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2014/september/documents/papa-francesco_20140919_nuova-evangelizzazione.html|title=To participants in the Meeting sponsored by the Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization |date=19 September 2014 |author=Pope Francis |website=Vatican |access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application to specific issues ===
Regarding gay people, Francis quoted the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|''&lt;u&gt;Catechism&lt;/u&gt;'']], "that they must not be discriminated against, that they must be respected and accompanied pastorally". But he goes further and says:

{{Quote|text=I believe that the church not only should apologize to the person who is gay whom it has offended, but has to apologize to the poor, to exploited women, to children exploited for labor; it has to ask forgiveness for having blessed many weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=27 June 2016 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/26/world/pope-apologize-gays/ |title=Pope says Christians should apologize to gays| first1=Delia |last1=Gallagher |first2=Daniel |last2=Burke |work=CNN |access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While strongly advocating openness to migrants and refugees, Francis acknowledged that the right to migrate must be regulated. Refugees from war or other intolerable situations must be received with greater openness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/full-text-pope-francis-in-flight-presser-from-sweden-66035/|title=Full text: Pope Francis' in-flight presser from Sweden|work=Catholic News Agency|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIs very first trip as Pope was to draw attention to the refugees on the island of [[Lampedusa]], where he criticized the European community's lack of solidarity and globalized indifference. He says the word "solidarity" frightens the developed world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;{{rp|79}}

Speaking of those who cannot satisfy their basic needs for food and health care, Francis calls on all nations to show "a willingness to share everything and to decide to be [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, instead of people who are indifferent to the needs of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=20 June 2013 |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/storico/2013/06/20/pope_to_fao_more_must_been_done_to_end_scandal_of_starvation/en1-703354 |title=Pope to FAO: more must be done to end scandal of starvation |work=Vatican Radio |language=en |access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis acknowledged that he carried his emphasis on mercy too far when he reduced the penalty of a pedophile priest from imprisonment to a lifetime of prayer and being barred from saying Mass or being near children, along with five years of psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/64e1fc2312764a24bf1b2d6ec3bf4caf/pope-quietly-trims-sanctions-sex-abusers-seeking-mercy|title=Pope quietly trims sanctions for sex abusers seeking mercy|work=AP News|access-date=2017-06-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the case: "I was new and I didn't understand these things well, and before two choices I chose the more benevolent one. ...It was the only time I did it, and never again".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-admits-catholic-church-realized-sex-abuse-problem-a-bit-late/|title=Pope Francis admits Catholic Church realized sex abuse problem "a bit late"|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual morality as Good News ===
{{See also| Amoris laetitia}}
Argentinian Archbishop [[Víctor Manuel Fernández|Víctor Fernández]] has explained controversies that have arisen over Francis' words: "The problem is that the fanatics end up converting some principles into a lifelong battle and deliberately discuss only those issues. ... There are other issues that are non-negotiable: love your neighbor, do justice to the oppressed, ... ."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;{{rp|33,34}} The [[Scholasticism|scholastic-philosophical]] approach to morality stemming largely from [[Thomas Aquinas]] was used during the papacy of John Paul II to give attention to the "intrinsic evil" of abortion. But M. Cathleen Kaveny writes, in ''[[America (magazine)|America]]'', that she believes it is incorrect to apply the term to determine the gravity of an evil, nor should intrinsic evils be so narrowly delimited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/673/article/intrinsic-evil-and-political-responsibility|title=Intrinsic Evil and Political Responsibility: Is the concept of intrinsic evil helpful to the Catholic voter?|date=2008-10-27|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/editorial-intrinsically-evil-canard-deception|title=Editorial: 'Intrinsically evil' canard is a deception|date=2012-10-30|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[Massimo Faggioli]] wrote: "The Catholicism of movement 'to the margins' announced by Pope Francis also means trying to take leave of the political culture of neoconservative and neoliberal Catholicism, ... a return to a Catholicism that is in search of 'common ground', such as that of the Cardinal of Chicago [[Joseph Bernardin]]." This is a departure from the neoconservatism among Catholics in the United States that had reigned since the Reagan era, based on an "anti-abortion stance that was isolated from the 'social question' " of market regulation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Pope-Francis-Transition-Massimo-Faggioli/dp/0809148927|title=Pope Francis: Tradition in Transition|last=Faggioli|first=Massimo|date=2015-05-05|publisher=Paulist Press|year=|isbn=9780809148929|edition= Translation|location=New York|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}} At the same time, while Francis may be a "radical reformer", he believes that "the task of the papacy is the preservation of the doctrine handed down by Jesus Christ". This means preserving the church's doctrine, as on abortion and artificial contraception, where he does not respond to specific misinterpretations of his words but uses later opportunities to clarify his orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|385–6}}

Francis has criticized those homilies "which should be [[kerygmatic]] but end up speaking about everything that has a connection with sex, ... whether or not to participate in a demonstration against a draft law in favor of the use of condoms". He adds: "We end up forgetting the treasure of Jesus alive, the treasure of the Holy Spirit present in our hearts, the treasure of a project of Christian life that has many implications that go much further than mere sexual questions".&lt;ref name="surprises"&gt;{{cite web |last=Magister |first=Sandro |url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1350492bdc4.html?eng=y |title=Few Surprises.

{{Quote|text=We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage, and the use of contraceptive methods. ...The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent. The church’s pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently. Proclamation in a missionary style focuses on the essentials, on the necessary things: this is also what fascinates and attracts more, what makes the heart burn, as it did for the disciples at Emmaus. We have to find a new balance; otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards, losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel. The proposal of the Gospel must be more simple, profound, radiant. It is from this proposition that the moral consequences then flow.&lt;ref name="american magazine" /&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In the [[Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Extraordinary General Assembly of Bishops in 2014]], in preparation for the [[Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Synod on the Family]] of 2015, Francis recommended "true spiritual discernment, ... to give answers to the many discouragements that surround and suffocate families". The survey Francis called for before the synod revealed that in Germany "huge percentages of the people (as many as 97% on some questions) had been ignoring the church's teachings in these areas (related to sexuality, remarriage, birth control, ...)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Jesuits-Francis-Changing-Church/dp/1442229012|title=Inside the Jesuits: How Pope Francis Is Changing the Church and the World|last=Kaiser|first=Robert Blair|date=2014-05-23|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=|isbn=9781442229013|location=Lanham u.a.|pages=201|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2015 Synod, the question of [[Eucharist|Communion]] for divorced Catholics living in a civil marriage became heated.

He followed the line of progressives at the synod and suggested that bishops must move church practice closer to the real life situations, and to accompany people in “discernment” and an examination of conscience, "to make room for the consciences of the faithful, who very often respond as best they can to the Gospel amid their limitations, and are capable of carrying out their own discernment in complex situations."&lt;ref&gt;''Amoris laetitia,'' 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that beyond that he left the matter to the local bishops' conferences, in the spirit of collegiality that he had been promoting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/world/europe/rather-than-rules-popes-document-gives-license-to-adapt.html|title=Rather Than Rules, Pope’s Document Gives License to Adapt|last=Yardley|first=Jim|date=2016-04-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, bishops in Germany wrote that “Catholics who have been remarried under civil law after a divorce are invited to go to church, participate in their lives, and mature as living members of the church,” offering "no general rule", not insisting that priests give Communion to divorced people but calling for “differentiated solutions, which are appropriate to the individual case”.

In a book of his own reflections, Francis has written: "Scholars of the law represent the principle opposition to Jesus; they challenge him in the name of doctrine."&lt;ref name=":x"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Name-God-Mercy-Pope-Francis/dp/0399588639|title=The Name of God Is Mercy|last=Francis|first=Pope|date=2016-01-12|publisher=Random House|year=|isbn=9780399588631|edition= Translation |location=New York|pages=91–92|language=English|translator-last=Stransky|translator-first=Oonagh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of losing "the sheep who are already safely inside the pen ...(is) the logic of the scholars of the law. ...

He teaches us what to do, which logic to follow, when faced with people who suffer physically and spiritually."&lt;ref name=":x" /&gt;

=== Liberation theology ===
[[Gustavo Gutierrez]] attended a conference in [[Petrópolis]] in 1964, that is considered to have given birth to [[liberation theology]]. At that conference [[:es:Lucio Gera|Lucio Gera]] spoke on "The Meaning of the Christian Message in the Midst of Poverty and Oppression". Gera had been a teacher of Bergoglio, who as Archbishop of Buenos Aires showed his esteem for Gera by allowing him to be buried in the crypt of the cathedral. Argentinian liberation theology, more so than in other parts of Latin America, focuses on the culture of the people, emphasizing not antagonisms but harmony, peace, and reconciliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

[[Walter Kasper]] points out that in line with the paradigm shift of Vatican II, Pope Francis's method "is not deductive but rather inductive in that it proceeds from the concrete human situation. ... The neighbor is for you the exposition of the concrete will of God".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|35}} This is in accord with the Jesuit practice of "discernment", whereby one begins with the concrete situation, what Vatican II called discerning the "signs of the times" interpreted in the light of the gospel, rather than beginning with church doctrine. This also appears in the method of "see, judge, and act" that is characteristic of liberation theology and is reflected in the report of the [[Latin America]] bishops' conference at [[Aparecida]], where Bergoglio chaired the editorial committee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|11,12}}

The conservative-progressive divide among bishops in Latin America is apparent in the question of how involved the clergy should be in politics.&lt;ref name=Lib&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/11/vatican-new-chapter-liberation-theology-founder-gustavo-gutierrez|title=Catholic church warms to liberation theology as founder heads to Vatican|last=Janeiro|first=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Jonathan Watts in Rio de|date=2015-05-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Óscar Romero]] was appointed bishop in [[San Salvador]] as a conservative, but moved toward the progressive perspective just 17 days after his consecration as bishop, at the assassination of Father [[Rutilio Grande]].

The decline of base communities during the episcopacy of Pope John Paul II has been attributed to his appointment of hundreds of new bishops, some 300 in Brazil alone, "and almost all of those new bishops have been more conservative than their predecessors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/111204/111204m.php|title=Latin America Today: Base communities, once hope of church, now in disarray|last=|first=|date=|website=natcath.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Pope Francis, base communities have been making a comeback,&lt;ref name="LaStampa.it"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2013/12/30/vaticaninsider/basic-ecclesial-communities-make-a-comeback-te8QG64FjkFxjdB11XvPpL/pagina.html|title=Basic Ecclesial Communities make a comeback|work=LaStampa.it|access-date=2018-07-22|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his encouragement and blessing.&lt;ref name="LaStampa.it"/&gt;

'''"There Is Power in a Union"''' is a song written by [[Joe Hill]] in 1913. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (commonly known as the Wobblies) concentrated much of its labor trying to organize [[migrant worker]]s in [[lumber]] and [[construction]] camps. They sometimes had competition for the attention of the workers from religious organizations. The song uses the tune of Lewis E. Jones' 1899 hymn "There Is Power in the Blood (Of the Lamb)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Red Songbook|url=http://www.musicanet.org/robokopp/usa/wouldyou.htm|publisher=Industrial Workers of the World|accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There Is Power in a Union" was first published in the ''[[Little Red Songbook]]'' in 1913.

The song has been recorded several times. [[Billy Bragg]] recorded a song with the title "There Is Power in a Union" on the ''[[Talking with the Taxman About Poetry]]'' album; this has different words&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billybragg.co.uk/music/album.php?albumID=17&amp;songID=40|title=Billy Bragg - Talking With The Taxman About Poetry|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is set to the tune of "[[Battle Cry of Freedom]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bragg|first=Billy|author-link1=Billy Bragg|title=A Lover Sings: Selected Lyrics|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|year=2015|isbn=978-0-571-32861-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics and style==
{{poemquote
|text=Would you have freedom from [[Wage slavery]],
Then join in the grand Industrial band;
Would you from mis'ry and hunger be free,
Then come, do your share, like a man.

(Chorus)
:There is pow'r there is pow'r in a band of workingmen,
:When they stand hand in hand,
:That's a pow'r, that's a pow'r
:That must rule in every land—
:One Industrial Union Grand.

Would you have mansions of gold in the sky,
and live in a shack, way in the back?
Would you have wings up in heaven to fly,
And starve here with rags on your back?

If you've had 'nuff of the "blood of the lamb"
Then join in the grand industrial band;
If, for a change, you would have eggs and ham,
Then come, do your share, like a man.

If you like sluggers to beat off your head,
Then don't organize, all unions despise.
If you want nothing before you are dead,
Shake hands with your boss and look Wise.

Come, all ye workers, from every land,
Come, join in the grand industrial band;
Then we our share of this earth shall demand.
Come on! Do your share, like a man.

==In popular culture==
The [[Billy Bragg]] version of this title is featured in the 2004 film ''[[Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train]]'' in which American Communist organizations march in Time Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416825/soundtrack|title=Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train (2004) - Soundtracks - IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Billy Bragg]] song of this title, but unrelated to Joe Hill's song, is featured in the 2014 film ''[[Pride (2014 film)|Pride]]'' in which London organization [[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]] collects funds to support the striking [[miner]]s of a [[Wales|Welsh]] pit village during the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pride Soundtrack|url=http://soundtrack.pridemovie.co.uk/|publisher=Universal Music Operations Limited|accessdate=17 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008210222/http://soundtrack.pridemovie.co.uk/|archive-date=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, [[Dropkick Murphys]] have used Bragg's song as one of the songs played before they perform.

Punk band [[Street Dogs]] recorded Billy Bragg's version (with altered lyrics) on their album ''[[Fading American Dream]]''.

A western instrumental version of the song can be heard in [[Back_to_the_Future_Part_III|Back to the Future Part III]] when Doc and Marty have their photo taken in front of the clock in 1885. It is an anachronism as the song won't be written before 1913.

'''Thomas Hardy''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OM}} (2 June 1840 – 11 January 1928) was an English novelist and poet. A [[Literary realism|Victorian realist]] in the tradition of [[George Eliot]], he was influenced both in his novels and in his poetry by [[Romanticism]], especially [[William Wordsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Dennis |last=Taylor |title=Hardy and Wordsworth |journal=Victorian Poetry |volume=24 |number=4 |date=Winter 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was highly critical of much in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society, especially on the declining status of rural people in Britain, such as those from his native [[South West England]].

While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898. Initially, therefore, he gained fame as the author of such novels as ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' (1874), ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886), ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), and ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'' (1895). During his lifetime, Hardy's poetry was acclaimed by younger poets (particularly the [[Georgian Poetry|Georgians]]) who viewed him as a mentor. After his death his poems were lauded by [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Philip Larkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Cedric|title=Thomas Hardy: 'Tess of the d'Urbervilles'|date=2007|publisher=Humanities-Ebooks|pages=13, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his novels concern tragic characters struggling against their passions and social circumstances, and they are often set in the semi-fictional region of [[Wessex]]; initially based on the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom, [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Hardy's Wessex]] eventually came to include the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and much of Berkshire, in southwest and south central England. Two of his novels, ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles'' and ''Far from the Madding Crowd'', were listed in the top 50 on the [[BBC]]'s survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml "BBC – The Big Read"]. BBC. April 2003, Retrieved 16 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
=== Early life ===
[[File:2780theHardyTreeOldStPancrasChurchyard.jpg|thumb|"The Hardy Tree" in [[St Pancras Old Church|Old St Pancras]] churchyard, growing between gravestones moved while Hardy was working there]]
Thomas Hardy was born on 2 June 1840 in Higher Bockhampton (then Upper Bockhampton), a hamlet in the parish of [[Stinsford]] to the east of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] in Dorset, England, where his father Thomas (1811–1892) worked as a stonemason and local builder, and married his mother Jemima (née Hand;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/13/thomashardy |title=Thomas Hardy: The Time-Torn Man |work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1813–1904) in Beaminster, towards the end of 1839.&lt;ref name="freebmd.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/|title=FreeBMD Home Page|website=www.freebmd.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jemima was well-read, and she educated Thomas until he went to his first school at Bockhampton at the age of eight. For several years he attended Mr. Last's Academy for Young Gentlemen in Dorchester, where he learned Latin and demonstrated academic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Claire |last=Tomalin |title=Thomas Hardy: the Time-torn Man |publisher=Penguin |year=2007 |pages=30, 36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Hardy's family lacked the means for a university education, his formal education ended at the age of sixteen, when he became apprenticed to James Hicks, a local architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Walsh |first=Lauren |contribution=Introduction |title=The Return of the Native, by Thomas Hardy |place=New York |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |series=Classics |year=2005 |type=print}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy trained as an architect in Dorchester before moving to London in 1862; there he enrolled as a student at [[King's College London]]. He won prizes from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture|Architectural Association]]. He joined [[Arthur Blomfield]]'s practice as assistant architect in April 1862 and worked with Blomfield on All Saints' parish church in [[Windsor, Berkshire]] in 1862–64. A [[reredos]], possibly designed by Hardy, was discovered behind panelling at All Saints' in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flood|first1=Alison|title=Thomas Hardy altarpiece discovered in Windsor church|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/16/thomas-hardy-altarpiece-discovered-in-windsor-church|accessdate=17 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windsorobserver.co.uk/news/14679029.Legendary_author_Thomas_Hardy_s_lost_contribution_to_Windsor_church_uncovered/|title=Legendary author Thomas Hardy's lost contribution to Windsor church uncovered|website=Royal Borough Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1860s, Hardy was in charge of the excavation of part of the graveyard of [[St Pancras Old Church]] prior to its destruction when the [[Midland Railway]] was extended to a new terminus at [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]].&lt;ref name="cornerstone"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burley |first=Peter |year=2012 |title=When steam railroaded history |journal=Cornerstone |volume=33 |issue=1 |page=9 |url= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy never felt at home in London, because he was acutely conscious of class divisions and his social inferiority. During this time he became interested in social reform and the works of [[John Stuart Mill]]. He was also introduced by his Dorset friend [[Horatio Mosley Moule|Horace Moule]] to the works of [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. After five years, concerned about his health, he returned to Dorset, settling in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], and decided to dedicate himself to writing.

In 1885 Thomas and his wife moved into [[Max Gate]], a house designed by Hardy and built by his brother. Although they later became estranged, Emma's subsequent death in 1912 had a traumatic effect on him and after her death, Hardy made a trip to Cornwall to revisit places linked with their courtship; his ''[[Poems 1912–13]]'' reflect upon her death. In 1914, Hardy married his secretary [[Florence Dugdale|Florence Emily Dugdale]], who was 39 years his junior. However, he remained preoccupied with his first wife's death and tried to overcome his remorse by writing poetry. In his later years, he kept a dog named Wessex, who was notoriously ill-tempered. Wessex's grave stone can be found on the Max Gate grounds.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/30/biography.thomashardy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC100304"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/entertainment/days_out/thomas_hardy_stourhead.shtml |title=Wiltshire Days Out – Thomas Hardy at Stourhead |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Hardy had been appointed a Member of the [[Order of Merit]] and was also for the first time nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

Hardy became ill with [[pleurisy]] in December 1927 and died at [[Max Gate]] just after 9&amp;nbsp;pm on 11 January 1928, having dictated his final poem to his wife on his deathbed; the cause of death was cited, on his death certificate, as "cardiac syncope", with "old age" given as a contributory factor. His funeral was on 16 January at [[Westminster Abbey]], and it proved a controversial occasion because Hardy had wished for his body to be interred at Stinsford in the same grave as his first wife, Emma. His family and friends concurred; however, his executor, Sir [[Sydney Carlyle Cockerell]], insisted that he be placed in the abbey's famous [[Poets' Corner]]. A compromise was reached whereby his heart was buried at Stinsford with Emma, and his ashes in Poets' Corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Charles Angell Bradford|Bradford,Charles Angell]] |title=Heart Burial |year=1933 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London |isbn=978-1-162-77181-6 |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy's estate at death was valued at [[Pound sterling|£]]95,418 (£{{inflation|UK|95418|1928}} in 2015 sterling).&lt;ref&gt;From Probate Index for 1928: "Hardy O.

Shortly after Hardy's death, the executors of his estate burnt his letters and notebooks, but twelve notebooks survived, one of them containing notes and extracts of newspaper stories from the 1820s, and research into these has provided insight into how Hardy used them in his works.&lt;ref name="BBC200803"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/homeground/archive/2003/thomas_hardy.shtml |title=Homeground: Dead man talking |date=20 August 2003 |work=BBC Online |accessdate=2006-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831225219/http://www.bbc.co.uk/homeground/archive/2003/thomas_hardy.shtml |archivedate=31 August 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year of his death Mrs Hardy published ''The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1841–1891'', compiled largely from contemporary notes, letters, diaries, and biographical memoranda, as well as from oral information in conversations extending over many years.

Hardy's work was admired by many younger writers, including [[D. H. Lawrence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Study of Thomas Hardy and other essays |origyear=1914 |editor-first=Bruce |editor-last=Steele |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1985 |isbn=0-521-25252-0 |chapter=Literary criticism and metaphysics}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Cowper Powys]], and [[Virginia Woolf]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Novels of Thomas Hardy", ''The Common Reader'', 2nd series.&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography ''[[Goodbye to All That]]'' (1929), [[Robert Graves]] recalls meeting Hardy in Dorset in the early 1920s and how Hardy received him and his new wife warmly, and was encouraging about his work.

Hardy's first novel, ''[[The Poor Man and the Lady]]'', finished by 1867, failed to find a publisher. He then showed it to his mentor and friend, the Victorian poet and novelist, [[George Meredith]], who felt that ''The Poor Man and the Lady'' would be too politically controversial and might damage Hardy's ability to publish in the future. So Hardy followed his advice and he did not try further to publish it. He subsequently destroyed the manuscript, but used some of the ideas in his later work.&lt;ref name="Bullen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B. Bullen|title=Thomas Hardy: The World of his Novels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8aX0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143|date=24 June 2013|publisher=Frances Lincoln|isbn=978-1-78101-122-5|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After he abandoned his first novel, Hardy wrote two new ones that he hoped would have more commercial appeal, ''[[Desperate Remedies]]'' (1871) and ''[[Under the Greenwood Tree]]'' (1872), both of which were published anonymously; it was while working on the latter that he met Emma Gifford, who would become his wife.&lt;ref name="Bullen2013"/&gt; In 1873 ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'', a novel drawing on Hardy's courtship of Emma, was published under his own name. The term "[[cliffhanger]]" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of this story (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left literally hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Hardy2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hardy|title=Delphi Complete Works of Thomas Hardy (Illustrated)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1EbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT570|date=17 November 2013|publisher=Delphi Classics|isbn=978-1-908909-17-6|pages=570–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his next novel ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' (1874), Hardy first introduced the idea of calling the region in the west of England, where his novels are set, [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]]. Wessex had been the name of an early [[Saxon]] kingdom, in approximately the same part of England. ''Far from the Madding Crowd'' was successful enough for Hardy to give up architectural work and pursue a literary career. Over the next twenty-five years Hardy produced ten more novels.

Subsequently, the Hardys moved from London to [[Yeovil]], and then to [[Sturminster Newton]], where he wrote ''[[The Return of the Native]]'' (1878).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/2013/06/curiosities-of-sturminster-newton/|title=Curiosities of Sturminster Newton  -  Dorset Life - The Dorset Magazine|website=www.dorsetlife.co.uk|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy published ''[[Two on a Tower]]'' in 1882, a romance story set in the world of [[astronomy]]. Then in 1885, they moved for the last time, to [[Max Gate]], a house outside Dorchester designed by Hardy and built by his brother. There he wrote ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886), ''[[The Woodlanders]]'' (1887), and ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), the last of which attracted criticism for its sympathetic portrayal of a "fallen woman" and was initially refused publication. Its subtitle, ''A Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented'', was intended to raise the eyebrows of the Victorian middle classes.

''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', published in 1895, met with an even stronger negative response from the Victorian public because of its controversial treatment of sex, religion and marriage. Furthermore, its apparent attack on the institution of marriage caused further strain on Hardy's already difficult marriage because Emma Hardy was concerned that ''Jude the Obscure'' would be read as autobiographical. Some booksellers sold the novel in brown paper bags, and the [[Bishop of Wakefield (diocese)|Bishop of Wakefield]], [[Walsham How]], is reputed to have burnt his copy.&lt;ref name="BBC200803"/&gt; In his postscript of 1912, Hardy humorously referred to this incident as part of the career of the book: "After these [hostile] verdicts from the press its next misfortune was to be burnt by a bishop – probably in his despair at not being able to burn me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Jude the Obscure |last= Hardy |first= Thomas |year= 1998 |publisher=Penguin Classics |isbn= 0-14-043538-7 |page= 466 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=txZevBW0iX0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;#PPA466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Hardy had become a celebrity by the 1900s, but some argue that he gave up writing novels because of the criticism of both ''Tess of the D'Urbervilles'' and ''Jude the Obscure''.&lt;ref name="English Literature 2000"&gt;"Thomas Hardy", ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', 7th edition, vol.2 . New York: W. W. Norton, 2000, p.1916.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Well-Beloved]]'', first serialised in 1892, was published in 1897.

==Literary themes==
Considered a Victorian realist, Hardy examines the social constraints on the lives of those living in [[Victorian England]], and criticises those beliefs, especially those relating to marriage, education and religion, that limited people's lives and caused unhappiness. Such unhappiness, and the suffering it brings, is seen by poet [[Philip Larkin]] as central in Hardy's works:

::"What is the intensely maturing experience of which Hardy's modern man is most sensible?  In my view it is suffering, or sadness, and extended consideration of the centrality of suffering in Hardy's work should be the first duty of the true critic for which the work is still waiting [. . .] Any approach to his work, as to any writer's work, must seek first of all to determine what element is peculiarly his, which imaginative note he strikes most plangently, and to deny that in this case it is the sometimes gentle, sometimes ironic, sometimes bitter but always passive apprehension of suffering is, I think, wrong-headed."&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, Philip 1983, "Wanted: Good Hardy Critic" in ''Required Writing'', London: [[Faber and Faber]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Two on a Tower'', for example, Hardy takes a stand against these rules of society with a story of love that crosses the boundaries of class. The reader is forced to reconsider the conventions set up by society for the relationships between women and men. Nineteenth-century society had conventions, which were enforced. In this novel Swithin St Cleeve's idealism pits him against such contemporary social constraints.

{{quote|In a novel structured around contrasts, the main opposition is between Swithin St Cleeve and Lady Viviette Constantine, who are presented as binary figures in a series of ways: aristocratic and lower class, youthful and mature, single and married, fair and dark, religious and agnostic...she [Lady Viviette Constantine] is also deeply conventional, absurdly wishing to conceal their marriage until Swithin has achieved social status through his scientific work, which gives rise to uncontrolled ironies and tragic-comic misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Harvey, ''Thomas Hardy: The Complete Critical Guide to Thomas Hardy.'' New York: Routledge, 2003, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fate or chance is another important theme. Hardy's characters often encounter crossroads on a journey, a junction that offers alternative physical destinations but which is also symbolic of a point of opportunity and transition, further suggesting that fate is at work. ''Far From the Madding Crowd'' is an example of  a novel in which chance has a major role: "Had Bathsheba not sent the valentine, had Fanny not missed her wedding, for example, the story would have taken an entirely different path."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/twentieth-century-criticism/far-from-madding-crowd-thomas-hardy |title=Far from the Madding Crowd, Thomas Hardy – Introduction (Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism. Ed. Linda Pavlovski. Vol. 153. Gale Group, Inc.,) |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate= 7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Hardy's main characters often seem to be held in fate's overwhelming grip.

==Poetry==
[[File:Thomas Hardy by Walter William Ouless.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Hardy by [[Walter William Ouless]], 1922]]
For online poems, see "Poetry collections" below.

In 1898 Hardy published his first volume of poetry, ''[[Wessex Poems]]'', a collection of poems written over 30 years. While some suggest that Hardy gave up writing novels following the harsh criticism of ''Jude the Obscure'' in 1896, the poet [[C. H. Sisson]] calls this "hypothesis" "superficial and absurd".&lt;ref name="English Literature 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to the Penguin edition of ''Jude the Obscure'' (1978). Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1984, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century Hardy published only poetry.

Thomas Hardy wrote in a great variety of poetic forms including [[lyric poetry|lyrics]], [[ballad]]s, satire, [[dramatic monologue]]s, and dialogue, as well as a three-volume epic closet drama ''[[The Dynasts]]'' (1904–08),&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255167/Thomas-Hardy |title=Thomas Hardy (British writer) – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though in some ways a very traditional poet, because he was influenced by folksong and [[ballad]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Hardy", ''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davies. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p.583.&lt;/ref&gt; he "was never conventional," and "persistently experiment[ed] with different, often invented, stanza forms and metres,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide'', p.583.&lt;/ref&gt; and made use of "rough-hewn rhythms and colloquial diction".&lt;ref name="poets1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/110#sthash.STdc5gsw.dpuf |title=Thomas Hardy &amp;#124; Academy of American Poets |publisher=Poets.org |date=11 January 1928 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy wrote a number of significant war poems that relate to both the [[Boer War]]s and [[World War I]], including "Drummer Hodge", "In Time of 'The Breaking of Nations'", and "[[The Man He Killed]]"; his work had a profound influence on other war poets such as [[Rupert Brooke]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]].&lt;ref name="Axelrod"&gt;{{cite web|last=Axelrod |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/thomas-hardy |title=Thomas Hardy |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |date= |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy in these poems often used the viewpoint of ordinary soldiers and their colloquial speech.&lt;ref name="Axelrod"/&gt; A theme in the ''[[Wessex Poems]]'' is the long shadow that the [[Napoleonic Wars]] cast over the nineteenth century, as seen, for example, in "The Sergeant's Song" and "Leipzig".&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Kearney Maynard, ''Thomas Hardy's Tragic Poetry: The Lyrics and The Dynasts''. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991, pp.8–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Napoleonic War is the subject of ''The Dynasts''.

Some of Hardy's most famous poems are from "Poems of 1912–13", part of ''Satires of Circumstance'' (1914), written following the death of his wife Emma in 1912. They had been estranged for twenty years and these lyric poems express deeply felt "regret and remorse".&lt;ref name="Axelrod"/&gt; Poems like “After a Journey,” “The Voice,” and others from this collection "are by general consent regarded as the peak of his poetic achievement".&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; In a recent biography on Hardy, [[Claire Tomalin]] argues that Hardy became a truly great English poet after the death of his first wife, Emma, beginning with these elegies, which she describes as among "the finest and strangest celebrations of the dead in English poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, Claire. "Thomas Hardy." New York: Penguin, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Hardy (1923 portrait).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A portrait of Thomas Hardy in 1923]]
Many of Hardy's poems deal with themes of disappointment in love and life, and "the perversity of fate", but the best of them present these themes with "a carefully controlled elegiac feeling".&lt;ref&gt;"The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', 7th edition, vol. 2, p.1916.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irony]] is also an important element in a number of Hardy's poems, including "The Man he Killed" and "Are You Digging on My Grave".&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Kearney Maynard, ''Thomas Hardy's Tragic Poetry: The Lyrics and The Dynasts''. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1991, pp8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A few of Hardy's poems, such as "[[The Blinded Bird]]", a melancholy polemic against the sport of {{lang|nl|[[Vinkensport|vinkenzetting]]}}, reflect his firm stance against animal cruelty, exhibited also in his [[Vivisection|antivivisectionist]] views and his membership in The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utjWx0SznGIC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=%22the+blinded+bird%22

A number of notable English composers, including [[Gerald Finzi]],&lt;ref&gt;Song cycle ''[[Earth and Air and Rain]]'' (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geraldfinzi.com/biography/ |title=Biography " Gerald Finzi Official Site |publisher=Geraldfinzi.com |date=27 September 1956 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Britten]],&lt;ref&gt;Song cycle ''[[Winter Words (song cycle)|Winter Words]]'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gustav Holst]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lieder.net/get_settings.html?ComposerId=1237 |title=Gustav Holst (Vocal Texts and Translations for Composer Gustav Holst) |publisher=LiederNet Archive |date= |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; set poems by Hardy to music. Holst also wrote the orchestral tone poem ''[[Egdon Heath (Holst)|Egdon Heath: A Homage to Thomas Hardy]]'' in 1927.

Although his poems were initially not as well received as his novels had been, Hardy is now recognised as one of the greatest twentieth-century poets, and his verse has had a profound influence on later writers, including [[Robert Frost]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Dylan Thomas]], and, most notably [[Philip Larkin]].&lt;ref name="poets1"/&gt; Larkin included twenty-seven poems by Hardy compared with only nine by [[T. S. Eliot]] in his edition of the ''Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse'' in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/110 |title=Poetry.org |publisher=Poets.org |date=11 January 1928 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also fewer poems by [[W. B. Yeats]].&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas Hardy", ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', 7th edition, vol.2, p.1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
[[File:Thomas Hardy aged 70, by William Strang.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas Hardy aged 70, by [[William Strang]]]]
Hardy's family was [[Anglican]], but not especially devout. He was baptised at the age of five weeks and attended church, where his father and uncle contributed to music. However, he did not attend the local [[Church of England]] school, instead being sent to Mr Last's school, three miles away. As a young adult, he befriended [[Henry R. Bastow]] (a [[Plymouth Brethren]] man), who also worked as a pupil architect, and who was preparing for [[adult baptism]] in the [[Baptist Church]]. Hardy flirted with conversion, but decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Tomalin, Thomas Hardy, The Time Torn Man(Penguin, 2007), pp.46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Bastow went to Australia and maintained a long correspondence with Hardy, but eventually Hardy tired of these exchanges and the correspondence ceased. This concluded Hardy's links with the Baptists.

The irony and struggles of life, coupled with his naturally curious mind, led him to question the traditional Christian view of God: 
{{quote|The Christian God&amp;nbsp;– the external personality&amp;nbsp;– has been replaced by the intelligence of the First Cause...the replacement of the old concept of God as all-powerful by a new concept of universal consciousness. The 'tribal god, man-shaped, fiery-faced and tyrannous' is replaced by the 'unconscious will of the Universe' which progressively grows aware of itself and 'ultimately, it is to be hoped, sympathetic'.&lt;ref&gt;Wotton, G. (1985), ''Thomas Hardy: Towards A Materialist Criticism'', Lanham: [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], p.36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars have debated Hardy's religious leanings for years, often unable to reach a consensus. However, Hardy's religious life seems to have mixed [[agnosticism]], [[deism]], and [[spiritism]]. Once, when asked in correspondence by a clergyman, Dr A. B. Grosart, about the question of reconciling the horrors of human and animal life with "the absolute goodness and non-limitation of God",&lt;ref&gt;Florence Emily Hardy, ''The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840–1891'', p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy replied,
{{quote|Mr. Hardy regrets that he is unable to offer any hypothesis which would reconcile the existence of such evils as [[Alexander Grosart|Dr. Grosart]] describes with the idea of omnipotent goodness. Perhaps Dr. Grosart might be helped to a provisional view of the universe by the recently published ''Life of Darwin'' and the works of [[Herbert Spencer]] and other agnostics.&lt;ref name=norton/&gt;}}

Hardy frequently conceived of, and wrote about, supernatural forces, particularly those that control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits.&lt;ref name=norton&gt;Ellman, Richard, &amp; O'Clair, Robert (eds.) 1988. "Thomas Hardy" in ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', Norton, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that had been such a formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels.

Hardy's friends during his apprenticeship to John Hicks included [[Horatio Mosley Moule|Horace Moule]] (one of the eight sons of [[Henry Moule]]), and the poet [[William Barnes]], both ministers of religion. Moule remained a close friend of Hardy's for the rest of his life, and introduced him to new scientific findings that cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wps.ablongman.com/long_kennedy_lfpd_9/0,9130,1489987-,00.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622162641/http://wps.ablongman.com/long_kennedy_lfpd_9/0,9130,1489987-,00.html |date=22 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as those of [[Gideon Mantell]]. Moule gave Hardy a copy of Mantell's book ''The Wonders of Geology'' (1848) in 1858, and Adelene Buckland has suggested that there are "compelling similarities" between the "cliffhanger" section from ''A Pair of Blue Eyes'' and Mantell's geological descriptions. It has also been suggested that the character of Henry Knight in ''A Pair of Blue Eyes'' was based on Horace Moule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/index.php/19/article/viewFile/469/329 |title=Adelene Buckland: ''Thomas Hardy, Provincial Geology and the Material Imagination'' |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Hardy corresponded with and visited [[Charles George Milnes Gaskell|Lady Catherine Milnes Gaskell]] at [[Wenlock Abbey]] and many of Lady Catherine's books are inspired by Hardy, who was very fond of her.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Cynthia, 2015 Wenlock Abbey 1857–1919: A Shropshire Country House and the Milnes Gaskell Family, Ellingham Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''Study of Thomas Hardy'' (1936) indicates the importance of Hardy for him, even though this work is a platform for Lawrence's own developing philosophy rather than a more standard literary study. The influence of Hardy's treatment of character, and Lawrence's own response to the central [[metaphysic]] behind many of Hardy's novels, helped significantly in the development of ''[[The Rainbow]]'' (1915) and ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920).&lt;ref&gt;Terry R. Wright, "Hardy's Heirs: D. H. Lawrence and John Cowper Powys" in ''A Companion to Thomas Hardy''. Chichester, Sussex: John Wiley, 2012.[https://books.google.com/books?id=xLP3sa-bnkoC&amp;pg=PA1925&amp;dq=thomas+hardy+influence+lawrence&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20hardy%20influence%20lawrence&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Wood and Stone'' (1915), the first novel by [[John Cowper Powys]], who was a contemporary of Lawrence, was "Dedicated with devoted admiration to the greatest poet and novelist of our age Thomas Hardy".&lt;ref&gt;Terry R. Wright, "Hardy's Heirs: D. H. Lawrence and John Cowper Powys"&lt;/ref&gt; Powys's later novel ''[[Maiden Castle (novel)|Maiden Castle]]'' (1936) is set in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], Hardy's [[Casterbridge]], and was intended by Powys to be a "rival" to Hardy's ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morine Krissdottir, ''Descents of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys''.

Hardy was clearly the starting point for the character of the novelist Edward Driffield in [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s novel ''[[Cakes and Ale]]'' (1930).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cakes and Ale|work= Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|year= 2015|accessdate= 26 April 2015|url= http://academic.eb.com/EBchecked/topic/88658/Cakes-and-Ale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Hardy's works also feature prominently in the American playwright [[Christopher Durang]]'s ''The Marriage of Bette and Boo'' (1985), in which a graduate thesis analysing ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' is interspersed with analysis of Matt's family's neuroses.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Durang ''The Marriage of Bette and Boo''. New York: Grove Press, 1987.[https://books.google.com/books?id=-z-ns9m7hTIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=The+Marriage+of+Bette+and+Boo+tess+of+the+d%27urbervilles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Djhe9vdZ1x&amp;sig=7kaBl7pP0JobFPCLlaBzglhQLQ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sck8VbSSA9L_ggSMsoGwAw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Marriage%20of%20Bette%20and%20Boo%20tess%20of%20the%20d'urbervilles&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy has been a significant influence on Nigel Blackwell, frontman of the [[post-punk]] British rock band [[Half Man Half Biscuit]], who has often incorporated phrases (some obscure) by or about Hardy, into his song lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the song "Their damnation slumbereth not", which is a quotation from Thomas Hardy's novel ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'',{{cite book|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/etexts/hardy/tess-0012.shtml|last=Hardy|first=Thomas|title=Tess of the d'Urbervilles|at=Chapter 12|year=1891
|accessdate=21 February 2015 }} which is itself an adaptation of the [[Second Epistle of Peter]] at [[s:Bible (King James)/2 Peter#Chapter 2|2:3]]: "Their damnation slumbereth not".

Hardy also produced a number of minor tales; one story, ''The Spectre of the Real'' (1894) was written in collaboration with [[Florence Henniker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thomas Hardy And Florence Henniker: The Writing Of "The Spectre Of The Real|first=Richard |last=Purdy|journal=Colby Library Quarterly, series 1, no.8|date= October 1944|pages=122–6|url=http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cq/vol1/iss8/4/}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional short-story collection, beyond the ones mentioned above, is ''[[A Changed Man and Other Tales]]'' (1913). His works have been collected as the 24-volume Wessex Edition (1912–13) and the 37-volume Mellstock Edition (1919–20). His largely self-written biography appears under his second wife's name in two volumes from 1928 to 1930, as ''The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840–91'' and ''The Later Years of Thomas Hardy, 1892–1928'', now published in a critical one-volume edition as ''The Life and Work of Thomas Hardy'', edited by Michael Millgate (1984).
