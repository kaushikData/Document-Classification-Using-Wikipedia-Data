'''Albert Einstein Archives''' refers to an archive on the [[Givat Ram]] ([[Edmond J. Safra]]) campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in [[Jerusalem]], Israel  housing the personal papers of 20th century physicist [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.huji.ac.il/huji/nobel/einE.htm | title=Prof. Albert Einstein: Nobel Laureate in Physics, 1921 | work=Hobel at HU | publisher=[[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] | location=Israel | accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Albert Einstein's exam of maturity grades - Kunst am Bau.jpg|thumb|Einstein's matriculation grades in 1896]]
In his will, Albert Einstein left the Hebrew University his personal papers and the copyright to them. The Albert Einstein Archives contain some 55,000 items.&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;{{cite news |last=Sela |first=Shimrit |url=http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=1011875&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=2&amp;title='Phone%20company's%20'Einstein'%20ads%20shelved%20due%20to%20Hebrew%20U.%20copyright%20row'&amp;dyn_server=172.20.5.5 |title=Albert Einstein's bequest to the Hebrew University |work=[[Haaretz]] |location=Israel |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 6, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, the University announced that it had digitized the archive and was planning to make it more accessible online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rabinovitch |first=Ari |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/20/us-einstein-archive-idUSBRE82I0WD20120320 |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2012 |title=Einstein the scientist, dreamer, lover: online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Einstein papers to go digital on the Web |work=Space Daily |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Einstein_papers_to_go_digital_on_the_Web_999.html |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University digitises Einstein archives via new website |work=Silicon Republic |last=Doyle |first=Carmel |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/item/26304-university-digitises-albert/ |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive initially released 2,000 documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/19/albert-einstein-archives-theory-of-relativity |title=Albert Einstein's complete archives to be posted online |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK |date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the collection are his personal notes, love letters to various women, including the woman who would become his second wife, [[Elsa Einstein|Elsa]]. Also to be included in the online collection is a letter to the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] newspaper ''[[Falastin (newspaper)|Falastin]]'', proposing a "Secret Council" composed of [[Arab]]s and [[Jew]]s to resolve the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==History==
[[File:GeneralRelativityTheoryManuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|First page from the manuscript explaining the [[theory of general relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]] (1915–16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |title=Albert Einstein: Manuscript in German of "The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity". Originally published in Annalen der Physik (1916). Archival Call No. 120-788 |publisher=[[Archive.org]] |accessdate=3 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104182159/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=January 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Albert Einstein visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1923 for 12 days, giving the first lecture at the [[Mount Scopus]] campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem—two years before the University opened in 1925.&lt;ref name="robinson15"&gt;{{cite book| title=Einstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity | first=Andrew |last=Robinson | author-link=W. Andrew Robinson | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | edition=revised | date=2015 | isbn=978-0-691-16989-7 | page=189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menachem Ussishkin]], the president of the [[Zionist]] Executive, invited Einstein to settle in Jerusalem, but this was the only visit that Einstein actually made to Jerusalem. However, Einstein was a member of the university's first board of governors. In 1925, the original 46-page manuscript of the [[general theory of relativity]] ended up at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.albert-einstein.org/article_manuscript1916.html | title=Relativity – The paper that challenged our notion of time and space | publisher=Albert Einstein Archives | first=Barbara | last=Wolff | accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein did not save all of his written material, but from 1919, as his fame increased, he employed his stepdaughter [[Einstein family|Ilse]] as a secretarial assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.albert-einstein.org/archives2.html | title=The History of the Albert Einstein Archives | publisher=The Albert Einstein Archives at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] | accessdate=2 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Dukas]] (1896–1982) began working for Einstein with increased systematization from April 1928, although not all outgoing correspondence was saved. After the [[Nazi]]s' rise to power in 1933, Einstein's son-in-law [[Einstein family|Rudolf Kayser]], aided by the French Embassy, rescued Einstein's papers in [[Berlin]]. Some of the material at Einstein's summer house in [[Caputh, Brandenburg]] was destroyed to avoid seizure, although most of his works between 1930 and 1932 were saved. That material was transported via Haberlandstrasse where Einstein lived in Berlin, then to [[Paris]], and ended up stored in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], United States until after Einstein's death.

Einstein's 1950 will appointed Helen Dukas and [[Otto Nathan]] as trustees of the estate and stated, "[A]ll literary rights and assets shall be vested in the Hebrew University."&lt;ref name="einstein-website"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.einstein-website.de/z_information/einsteinarchives.html | title=Albert Einstein Archives in Jerusalem | website=Einstein-website.de | location=Germany | accessdate=2 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Einstein's death in 1955, the trustees spent many years organizing Einstein's papers. In the 1960s, Helen Dukas and the physicist  [[Gerald Holton]] of [[Harvard University]] in the USA reorganized the archive, with the aim of publishing the material, in a joint project between the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/ | title=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | accessdate=3 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The material increased from  14,000 documents at the time of Einstein's death in 1955 to around 42,000 documents in 1982.&lt;ref name="einstein-website" /&gt; To aid in this work, Einstein's papers were transferred from his Princeton home to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton University]].

In 1982, the Einstein Estate transferred Einstein's personal papers to the [[Jewish National &amp; University Library]] in Jerusalem. President [[Avraham Harman]] of The Hebrew University and [[Milton Handler]] of the [[American Friends of The Hebrew University]] worked on the transfer of the material to Jerusalem. In subsequent years, additional material was sent from Einstein's Princeton home. The [[Bern Dibner]] Curatorship, which manages the Albert Einstein Archives, was established in 1988 by the [[Dibner Fund]] of [[Connecticut]], USA.
[[File:Declaration of Intention for Albert Einstein, 10-01-1940 (596270 ).jpg|thumb|U.S. Declaration of Intent, Albert Einstein]]
The first curator of the Einstein Archives was Ze'ev Rosenkranz whose term extended from 1989 to 2003. The catalogue was made available online in 2003. Since 2004,  Roni Grosz has been the head of the Archives. The Einstein Archives became part of the Hebrew University's Library Authority in January 2008. In July of that year, the Archives moved to the Levy Building on the Givat Ram campus. Since March 19, 2012, the Archives have digitized and made available increasingly more of Einstein's works online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/database.html | title=Archival Database | publisher=Albert Einstein Archives | accessdate=3 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princeton University Press]] has also been active in this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://press.princeton.edu/einstein/digital/ | title=The Digital Einstein Papers Website – an Overview | publisher=Princeton University Press | accessdate=3 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/12/the-digital-einstein-papers.html | title=New Archive Puts 1000s of Einstein’s Papers Online, Including This Great Letter to Marie Curie | work=Archives, Physics | publisher=[[Open Culture]] | date=8 December 2014 | accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BFI National Archive''' is a department of the [[British Film Institute]], and one of the largest [[film archives]] in the world. It was founded as the '''National Film Library''' in 1935; its first curator was [[Ernest Lindgren]]. In 1955, its name became the '''National Film Archive''', and, in 1992, the '''National Film and Television Archive'''. It was renamed BFI National Archive in 2006.

It collects, preserves, restores, and shares the [[film]]s and television programmes which have helped to shape and record British life and times since the development of cine film in the late 19th century. The majority of the collection is British originated material, but it also features internationally significant holdings from around the world. The Archive also collects films which feature key British actors and the work of British directors.

The collections themselves are accommodated on several sites. The [[Paul Getty|J. Paul Getty, Jr.]] Conservation Centre in [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], named after its benefactor, is the base for much of the restoration work, while approximately 140 million feet of unstable [[nitrate]] film and all the master film collection held on acetate or other media is kept separately at a BFI storage site at [[Gaydon]] in [[Warwickshire]].

==Preservation==
[[File:Berkhamsted, The BFI National Archive Kingshill site - geograph.org.uk - 1413077.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The BFI National Archive Kingshill at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire opened here in 1935. This is the site entrance, several large modern archive buildings lie behind the barn building. The site is officially known as the J Paul Getty Junior Conservation Centre.]]
[[Film preservation]] is an ongoing project among filmmakers, historians, archivists, museums, and [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit organisations]] to rescue deteriorating [[film stock]] and preserve the recorded image. In recent years the Conservation Centre has completed a number of much anticipated restorations of a diverse range of film titles. This has included the [[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection, which consists almost entirely of actuality films commissioned by travelling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century.

Other notable recent restorations include:
*[[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s nine surviving silent feature films
*''[[Underground (1928 film)|Underground]]'' (dir. [[Anthony Asquith]], 1928)
*''[[Shooting Stars (1927 film)|Shooting Stars]]'' (dir. Anthony Asquith, 1927)
*''[[The Epic of Everest]]'' (1924)
*''[[The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands]]'' (1927)

==Collections==
The collection now known as the BFI National Archive was founded as the National Film Library in 1935 by [[Ernest Lindgren]], who was the first curator. The BFI National Archive now comprises over 275,000 titles in total consisting of feature, non-fiction and short films (dating from 1894) and 210,000 television programmes. It is one of the largest and most prestigious film collections in the world. Notable collections include:
*[[Mitchell and Kenyon]] collection
*[[GPO Film Unit]] collection
*[[Central Office of Information|Central Office of Information (COI)]] film collection
*[[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] Out-Takes collection

The archive holds 20,000 silent films including, [[Cecil Hepworth]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1903 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1903), and actively collects artists' moving images. In addition to moving image materials the Special Collections hold the records of filmmakers and institutions. Significant collections include:
*[[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]
*[[David Lean]]
*[[Ken Loach]]
*[[Derek Jarman]]

Films and television programmes are acquired mainly by donation or, in the case of independent television, via funding direct from the TV companies. Emphasis is placed on British productions but whenever possible important and popular movies from overseas are also acquired.

==Content==
{{Primary sources|section about the content of the report|date=September 2015}}
The suggested ecclesiological principles include that the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of the [[Catholic Church]] should be included the theological dialogue.&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n16}} Monks from [[Mount Athos]] monasteries protested against this principle.&lt;ref name="Bremer2014"/&gt;{{rp|page=747}}

The central issue is exclusivity of the doctrine that there is [[no salvation outside the Church]].&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n10}}&lt;ref name="Bremer2014"/&gt;{{rp|page=746}} [[Mission (Christianity)|Missionaries]] converted other Christians "so as 'to bring them back' to one's own Church. In order to legitimize this tendency, a source of [[proselytism]], the Catholic Church developed the theological vision according to which she presented herself as the only one to whom [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] was entrusted. As a reaction, the Orthodox Church, in turn, came to accept the same vision according to which only in her could salvation be found. To assure the salvation of 'the [[separated brethren]]' it even happened that Christians were rebaptized and that certain requirements of the religious freedom of persons and of their act of faith were forgotten."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n10}}
The principle that "the inviolable freedom of persons and their obligation to follow the requirements of their conscience,"&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n15}} is foundational, according to Cassidy, "and justifies both the personal choice to adhere to the Catholic Church or to the Orthodox Church, and offers the possibility of returning to the Catholic Church for those communities which in 1945–49 [[forced conversion|had been forced to convert]] by [[Communist regime]]s to become part of the Orthodox Church," as happened in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] and the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name="Cassidy2007"/&gt;

The report notes that a solution to the problems depends upon "a will to [[pardon]]" and to "overcome reciprocal lack of understanding" with a goal of restoring "the [[East–West Schism|full communion which existed for more than a thousand years]] between our Churches."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n20}} 
While the Catholic Church "no longer aims at proselytizing among the Orthodox."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n22}}
The report acknowledges that historically relations between the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches were "marked by persecutions and sufferings" and that no one should "accuse or disparage the other Church."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n23}}
Churches need to respect all "who suffered, confessed their faith, witnessed their fidelity to the Church, and, in general, towards all Christians, without discrimination, who underwent persecutions."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n33}}
The report suggests that by relinquishing "everything that can foment division, contempt and hatred between the Churches" a resolution to "the extremely complex situation that has been created in [[Eastern Europe]]" can be implemented.&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n21}}
According to the report, both Churches need to "scrupulously respect the religious liberty of the faithful" which "requires that, particularly in situations of conflict, the faithful are able to express their opinion and to decide without pressure from outside if they wish to be in communion either with the Orthodox Church or with the Catholic Church."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n24}}
A "necessary respect for christian freedom" requires the exclusion of "every form of pressure" and a "respect for consciences" should guide pastoral concerns in both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n25}}
Open dialogue is necessary. "If agreement cannot be reached on the local level, the question should be brought to mixed commissions established by higher authorities."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n26}}

Condemning group violence against communities of a sister church lessens [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]], the report paraphrased [[Pope John Paul II]], that violence and pressure needs to "be absolutely avoided in order that freedom of conscience be respected. It is the task of those in charge of communities to assist their faithful to deepen their loyalty towards their own Church and towards its traditions and to teach them to avoid not only violence, be that physical or verbal, but also all that could lead to contempt for other Christians and to a counter-witness, completely ignoring the work of salvation which is reconciliation in Christ."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Paul II |date=1991-05-31 |title=Letter to European bishops on the recent changes in Central and Eastern Europe |website=vatican.va |location= |publisher= |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/letters/1991/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19910531_relationships-catholics-orthodox.html |access-date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910104549/http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/letters/1991/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19910531_relationships-catholics-orthodox.html |archivedate=10 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The report showed how some [[Western culture|Western]] "universal values of freedom of conscience could offend the Orthodox who are less concerned by the rights of the individual than the rights of the community and tradition." For example, the phrase "the right of each person to join the religion of his choice" was removed in the final version of paragraph 27 in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rousselet|first=Kathy|year=2000|title=The challenges of religious pluralism in Post-Soviet Russia|journal=International Journal on Multicultural Societies|volume=2|issue=2|location=Paris|publisher=UNESCO|page=69|issn=1817-4574|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001437/143739M.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119043209/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001437/143739M.pdf|archivedate=2007-01-19|access-date=|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"The use of violence to occupy a place of worship contradicts" faith in sacramental reality and "the evangelical ethos requires that statements or manifestations which are likely to perpetuate a state of conflict and hinder the dialogue be avoided."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n28}}
Clergy "have the duty before God to respect the authority which the Holy Spirit has given to the bishops and priests of the other Church and for that reason to avoid interfering in the spiritual life of the faithful of that Church. When cooperation becomes necessary for the good of the faithful, it is then required that those responsible to an agreement among themselves, establish for this mutual assistance clear principles which are known to all, and act subsequently with frankness, clarity, and with respect for the sacramental discipline of the other Church."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n29}}
New Catholic pastoral projects, "which imply the creation of new structures in regions which traditionally form part of the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church," should not be established without consulting the Orthodox bishops in the same geographical area to avoid the risk of rivalry and conflict.&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n29}}
Instead of intervention by civil authorities, dialogue about "the complexity of present realities and local circumstances" between Churches or local communities should be used to resolve problems such as "the possession or return of ecclesiastical property."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n31}}

Avoiding "the use of history in a polemical manner {{interp|...}} will lead to an awareness that faults leading to separation belong to both sides, leaving deep wounds on each side." Clergy should be educated about "the [[apostolic succession]] of the other Church and the authenticity of its sacramental life" as should "a correct and comprehensive knowledge of history aiming at a [[historiography]] of the two Churches which is in agreement and even may be common."&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n30}}
Providing "objective news to the mass-media especially to the religious press in order to avoid tendentious and misleading information" should be a common task to [[evangelize]] a secularized world.&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n32}}

"By excluding {{interp|...}} all proselytism and all desire for expansion by Catholics at the expense of the Orthodox Church, the commission hopes that it has overcome the obstacles which impelled certain autocephalous Churches to suspend their participation in the theological dialogue and that the Orthodox Church will" continue the theological work of the commission.&lt;ref name="Balamand1993"/&gt;{{rp|at=n35}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1494">'''Buggins' turn''' or '''Buggins's turn''' is appointment to a position by [[job rotation|rotation]] or [[seniority]] rather than by [[meritocracy|merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=54 |title=A Natural History of the Common Law |author=Stroud Francis Charles Milsom |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2003 |isbn=9780231129947 |chapter=Management, Custom, and Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice in the British [[Royal Navy]] was a concern of the reforming [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] (1841 –1920) who wrote, "Going by seniority saves so much trouble.

'''Carey v Hastie [1968] NZLR 276''' is a case cited regarding [[illegal contract]]s.&lt;ref name="Gerbic &amp; Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Commercial Law |edition=5th |last1=Gerbic |first1=Philippa |last2=Lawrence |first2=Martin |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71714-9|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hastie hired Carey to do some building alterations at his Wellesley Street business premises, and was later invoiced ₤274 for the work.

However, local council bylaws required that a building permit be first issued by the council before building commenced, although for small jobs, the council practice was to allow the building permit to be issued after building had started.

At the start of the contract, the owner was required to obtain the necessary building permits, but as the owner was causing delays to the build over approval of the final plans, in an effort to speed up the build, the builder agreed to take responsibility to get the permits.  

Carey subsequently completed the alterations, but for unknown reasons, he did not get the necessary building permits for the work, although the council had approved the building plan, and the work being inspected by a council building inspector.

Not satisfied with receiving illegal unpermitted alterations, Carey paid ₤139 of the account, and refused to pay the balance, claim the contract was illegal and not legally enforceable.

The builder subsequently sued successfully in the District Court for the balance of ₤135, but was reversed on appeal in the High Court.

And the matter made its way through the courts despite the claim's ridiculously low amount, until it finally reached the Court of Appeal.

==Held==
The court held that by not getting the necessary building consent, breached the council bylaws, making the contract illegal by performance.

'''Footnote:''' This case pre dates the [[Illegal Contracts Act 1970]]

{{Osteopathic Medicine}}
In the United States, physicians may hold either the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree (MD) or the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree (DO).&lt;ref name="osteopathic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-dos/what-is-a-do/Pages/default.aspx |title=What is a DO? |publisher=American Osteopathic Association |accessdate=20 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; MD and DO physicians complete similar residency programs in hospitals, can be licensed in all 50 states, and have rights and responsibilities common to physicians.

Historically, MDs and DOs significantly differed in their approach to medical treatment. [[Allopathic medicine]], practiced by MDs, was primarily based on scientific practices.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In contrast, osteopathic medicine was founded in the mid-nineteenth century on the premise of healing the body through osteopathic musculoskeletal manipulation. MD and DO schools can also be distinguished by a relative lack of scientific and clinical research at DO schools.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2094616|title=Research in the Osteopathic Medical Profession: Roadmap to Recovery|first1=Brian C.|last1=Clark|first2=Jack|last2=Blazyk|date=1 August 2014|publisher=|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|volume=114|issue=8|pages=608–614|accessdate=16 April 2018|via=jaoa.org|doi=10.7556/jaoa.2014.124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coursework at MD and DO schools is similar, with the most notable exception being that DO students are taught [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis L. Kasper, Eugene Braunwald, Anthony S. Fauci, Stephen L. Hauser, Dan L. Longo, J. Larry Jameson, and Kurt J. Isselbacher, Eds|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.|chapter=10: Complementary and Alternative Medicine|page=63|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0071748896|edition=18th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
While allopathic [[medicine]] has followed the development of society, osteopathic medicine is a more recent development. The first MD school in the United States opened in 1807 in [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 1845, the [[American Medical Association]] was formed, and standards were put into place, with a three-year program including lectures, dissection, and hospital experience. In 1892, [[frontier]] physician [[Andrew Taylor Still]] founded the American School of Osteopathy in [[Kirksville, MO]] as a protest against the present medical system. A. T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Still AT.[https://archive.org/stream/philosophymechan00stiliala/philosophymechan00stiliala_djvu.txt ''The Philosophy and Mechanical Principles of Osteopathy.''] Kansas City, Mo: Hudson-Kimberly Pub Co; 1902:9–20,185,210,270. Version 2.0. Inter Linea Web site. Accessed January 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1900s, DOs fought to gain practice rights and government recognition. The first state to pass such regulations allowing DOs medical practice rights was California in 1901, the last was [[Nebraska]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gevitz|first=Norman|title=''The DO's: osteopathic medicine in America|year=2004|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=0-8018-7833-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up through the 1960s, osteopathic medicine was labeled a cult by the [[American Medical Association]], and collaboration by physicians with osteopathic practitioners was considered to be unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?aid=1120786239|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|first=Josephine P.|last=Briggs|editor-first1=Dennis|editor-last1=Kasper|editor-first2=Anthony|editor-last2=Fauci|editor-first3=Stephen|editor-last3=Hauser|editor-first4=Dan|editor-last4=Longo|editor-first5=J. Larry|editor-last5=Jameson|editor-first6=Joseph|editor-last6=Loscalzo|date=16 April 2018|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|accessdate=16 April 2018|via=Access Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]]'s current definition of a physician is "an individual who has received a 'Doctor of Medicine' or a 'Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine' degree or an equivalent degree following successful completion of a prescribed course of study from a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H-405.969 Definition of a Physician|url=https://www.ama-assn.org/ssl3/ecomm/PolicyFinderForm.pl?site=www.ama-assn.org&amp;uri=/resources/html/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-405.969.HTM|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=27 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 editorial about mitigating the impending shortage of physicians in the United States, Jordan Cohen, MD, then-president of the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After more than a century of often bitterly contentious relationships between the osteopathic and allopathic medical professions, we now find ourselves living at a time when osteopathic and allopathic graduates are both sought after by many of the same residency programs; are in most instances both licensed by the same licensing boards; are both privileged by many of the same hospitals; and are found in appreciable numbers on the faculties of each other's medical schools.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Jordan|title=Following in Flexner's Footsteps|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/MemberCenter/Premeds/edRx/Footsteps2.aspx|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, MDs and DOs are fully licensed medical doctors and have full medical practice rights throughout the United States. An MD is accepted worldwide, while the DO degree is accepted in 44 countries abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Difference Between U.S.-Trained Osteopathic Physicians and Osteopaths Trained Abroad|url=http://www.aacom.org/become-a-doctor/about-om/US-vs-abroad|website=www.aacom.org|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, less than 10% of US physicians have a DO degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Physicians with a U.S. Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) by Specialty, 2015|url=https://www.aamc.org/data/workforce/reports/458502/1-6-chart.html|website=www.aamc.org|publisher=American Association of Medical Colleges|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] (DO) is different than an [[osteopath]]: a DO is a physician, while an osteopath is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~nss/nav/pages/advice/DOGuide.pdf|title=A Brief Guide to Osteopathic Medicine|last=Wu, Siu|first=|date=April 2012|website=|publisher=AACOM|access-date=June 5, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501201041/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nss/nav/pages/advice/DOGuide.pdf|archivedate=May 1, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Medical training===
Of the 860,917 physicians actively practicing in the United States in 2015, 67.1% hold an MD degree granted in the U.S., 24.3% are international medical graduates, and 7.6% hold a DO degree.&lt;ref name=aamcpsd /&gt; The percentage of physicians that hold a DO degree varies by specialty, with the greatest representation in [[Family Medicine]]/General Practice (16.5% of [[general practitioner]]s), [[Physiatry|Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation]] (13.8%), and [[Emergency Medicine]] (11.2%).&lt;ref name=aamcpsd /&gt;

As of 2015, 9.0% of residents and fellows in medical training programs accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] (ACGME), which accredits all MD residency programs, hold a DO degree.&lt;ref name=aamcpsd /&gt; 65.1% of the 19,302 DO graduates enrolled in post-doctoral training are in ACGME-accredited programs, with the remainder in AOA programs.&lt;ref name=ompr&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Osteopathic Medical Profession Report|url=http://osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/aoa-annual-statistics/Documents/2016-OMP-report.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020, the ACGME will take over the accreditation of all residency programs in the United States for both MDs and DOs.

===Trends===
There are significantly more MDs than DOs, though the number of DOs is increasing, due to the relative ease of obtaining admission to a DO school relative to an MD school, and a number of new DO schools opening at a rate faster than MD schools, and an increase in applicants for medical schools as a whole.&lt;ref name=aamcpsd&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Physician Specialty Data Book|url=https://www.aamc.org/data/workforce/reports/457712/2016-specialty-databook.html|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation given|date=August 2018}} A 2012 survey of students applying to both U.S. MD and DO schools found that 9% of applicants were admitted only to an MD school, 46% were admitted only to a DO school, 26% were admitted to both, and 19% were not admitted to any medical schools.&lt;ref name=2012_Applicants_to_MD&amp;DO&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Applicants to U.S. and Offshore Medical Schools|url=http://www.aacom.org/data/applicantsmatriculants/Documents/2012%20Applicants%20to%20U%20S%20%20and%20Offshore%20Medical%20Schools.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|accessdate=2 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2018}} Geographic location was the top reason given by both DO and MD students for choosing the school in which they enrolled.&lt;ref name=2012_Applicants_to_MD&amp;DO /&gt;
Of first-year medical students matriculating in 2016, 25.9% (7,369 students) entered DO medical programs and 74.1% (21,030 students) entered MD programs.&lt;ref name="aamcenroll"&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of the 2016 Medical School Enrollment Survey|url=https://members.aamc.org/iweb/upload/Results%20of%20the%202016%20Medical%20School%20Enrollment%20Survey.pdf|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges|accessdate=24 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of American Medical Colleges projects that from 2016 to 2021, first-year DO student enrollment will increase by 19.4% versus a 5.7% increase in MD students.&lt;ref name="aamcenroll" /&gt; Between 1980 and 2005, the annual number of new MDs remained stable at around 16,000. During the same period, the number of new DOs increased by more than 200% (from about 1,150 to about 2,800).&lt;ref name="per capita"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salsberg E |author2=Grover A |title=Physician workforce shortages: implications and issues for academic health centers and policymakers |journal=Acad Med |volume=81 |issue=9 |pages=782–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16936479 |doi=10.1097/00001888-200609000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of new MDs per 100,000 people fell from 7.5 to 5.6, while the number of new DOs per 100,000 rose from 0.4 to 0.8.&lt;ref name="per capita"/&gt;

===Geographic distribution===
The geographic distribution of MD and DO physicians is not uniform. As of 2012, the states with the greatest ratio of active physicians holding a DO degree versus active physicians holding an MD degree were [[Oklahoma]] (20.7% of physicians), [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], [[Maine]], and [[West Virginia]]. During that same year, the states with the greatest ratio of active physicians holding an MD degree versus a DO degree were [[Louisiana]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], and [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=State2012&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 State Physician Workforce Data Book|url=https://members.aamc.org/eweb/upload/State%20Physician%20Workforce%20Data%20Book%202013%20(PDF).pdf|page=19|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states with the greatest ''per capita number'' of DO physicians are Maine, Michigan, [[Pennsylvania]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Iowa]]. The states with the greatest ''per capita number'' of MD physicians are Washington, D.C., Massachusetts, Maryland, [[New York (state)|New York]], and Connecticut.&lt;ref name=State2012 /&gt; Doctors holding a DO degree are more likely to practice in rural areas. 

The sex and racial distribution of DOs and MDs are similar.&lt;ref name=Peters1999&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peters AS, Clark-Chiarelli N, Block SD |title=Comparison of Osteopathic and Allopathic Medical Schools' Support for Primary Care |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=14 |issue=12 |pages=730–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10632817 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1497.1999.03179.x |pmc=1496864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and scholarly work ==
In comparison to allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine has been criticized for the relative lack of research and lesser emphasis on scientific inquiry at D.O. schools in comparison with M.D. schools.&lt;ref name="pmid11329813"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gevitz N | title = Researched and demonstrated: inquiry and infrastructure at osteopathic institutions | journal = The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–179 | date = Mar 2001 | pmid = 11329813 | url = http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11329813  | format = Free full text }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelso A, Townsend A. The status and future of osteopathic research. In: Northup G, ed. Osteopathic Research: Growth and Development. Chicago, Ill: American Osteopathic Association; 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Licciardone, John C., Osteopathic research: elephants, enigmas, and evidence"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Licciardone JC | title = Osteopathic research: elephants, enigmas, and evidence | journal = Osteopathic Medicine and Primary Care | volume = 1 | pages = 7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17371583 | pmc = 1808471 | doi = 10.1186/1750-4732-1-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Journal of the American Osteopathic Association]], the "inability to institutionalize research, particularly clinical research, at osteopathic institutions has, over the years, weakened the acculturation, socialization, and distinctive beliefs and practices of osteopathic students and graduates."&lt;ref name="pmid11329813"/&gt;

Allopathic medical schools have applied for and received 800 times more funding for scientific and clinical research from the [[National Institutes of Health]] than osteopathic schools have. Osteopathic schools ranked last out of 17 types of educational institutions, including veterinary medicine, optometry, social work, and dentistry.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2014, the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association stated that research from osteopathic schools amounted to "fewer than 15 publications per year per school, and more than a quarter of these publications had never been cited. Clearly, scholarly contributions from osteopathic medical schools are unacceptably low in both quantity and quality."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Cultural differences==

===Patient interactions===

Several studies have investigated whether there is a difference in the approach to patients by MDs and DOs. A study of patient visits to general and [[family medicine]] physicians in the U.S., including 277 million visits to MDs and 65 million visits to DOs, found that there was no significant difference between DOs and MDs with regard to time spent with patients and preventive medicine services.&lt;ref name=Licciardone&gt;{{cite journal |author=Licciardone JC |title=A comparison of patient visits to osteopathic and allopathic general and family medicine physicians: results from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2003–2004 |journal=Osteopath Med Prim Care |volume=1 |page=2 |year=2007 |pmid=17371578 |pmc=1805772 |doi=10.1186/1750-4732-1-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study of approximately 341 million healthcare visits founds that there was no difference on the rate that doctors provided to patients diet or nutrition counseling, weight reduction counseling, exercise counseling, tobacco use or exposure counseling, and mental health or stress reduction counseling.&lt;ref name=Licciardone/&gt; Some authors{{who|date=November 2017}} describe subjective distinctions in patient interactions, but Avery Hurt writes, "In actual practice, the variations between the two types of physicians are often so slight as to be unnoticeable to patients, and a day in the life of each can appear indistinguishable. But the differences are there, subtle but deep."&lt;ref name=Hurt&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside osteopathic medicine's parallel world |author=Hurt, Avery |date=Feb 2007 |journal=The New Physician |publisher=American Medical Student Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-characterization and identification===
A study conducted during 1993-94 found significant differences in the attitudes of DOs and MDs.  The study found that 40.1% of MD students and physicians described themselves as "socioemotionally" oriented over "technoscientific" orientation. 63.8% of their DO counterparts self-identified as socioemotional.&lt;ref name=Peters1999 /&gt;

One study of DOs attempted to investigate their perceptions of differences in philosophy and practice between themselves and their MD counterparts.  88% of the respondents had a [[self-identification]] as osteopathic medical physicians, while less than half felt their patients identified them as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson SM, Kurtz ME |title=Perceptions of philosophic and practice differences between US osteopathic physicians and their allopathic counterparts |journal=Soc Sci Med |volume=55 |issue=12 |pages=2141–8 |date=December 2002|pmid=12409127 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953601003574 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00357-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the training of DOs and MDs becomes less distinct, some have expressed concern that the unique characteristics of osteopathic medicine will be lost.&lt;ref name=Zeigler/&gt; Others welcome the rapprochement and already consider modern medicine to be the type of medicine practiced by both "MD and DO type doctors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neurosurgical.com/neurgosurgery_glossary/a.htm |title=Medical/Neurosurgical Glossary |website=Northern California Neurosurgery Medical Group |accessdate=27 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One persistent difference is the respective acceptance of the terms "allopathic" and "osteopathic." DO medical schools and organizations all include the word ''osteopathic'' in their names, and such groups actively promote an "osteopathic approach" to medicine. While "osteopathy" was a term used by its founder [[Andrew Taylor Still|AT Still]] in the 19th century to describe his new philosophy of medicine, "[[allopathic medicine]]" was originally a derogatory term coined by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] to contrast the conventional medicine of his day with his alternative system of [[homeopathic medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Berkenwald A|title=In the Name of Medicine|journal=Ann Intern Med|date=1 February 1998|volume=128|issue=3|pages=246–250|url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?volume=128&amp;issue=3&amp;page=246#r7-23|accessdate=27 Sep 2015|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-128-3-199802010-00023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America|author=Whorton JC|year=2004|isbn=0-19-517162-4|pages = 18, 52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RU0DndWVSPoC&amp;pg=PA18|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term "allopathic physician" is used infrequently, usually in discussions relating to comparisons with osteopathic medicine or alternative medicine. Some authors argue that the terms "osteopathic" and "allopathic" should be dropped altogether, since their original meanings bear little relevance to the current practice of modern medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gundling K|title=When Did I Become an "Allopath"?|journal=Arch Intern Med|date=9 November 1998|volume=158|issue=20|pages=2185–2186|doi= 10.1001/archinte.158.20.2185|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=210204|accessdate=27 Sep 2015|pmid=9818797}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahf.org/articles/a-b/allopathy.html |title=Misuse of the Term "Allopathy" |author=Jarvis WT |access-date=27 Sep 2015 |publisher=National Council Against Health Fraud |date=1 Dec 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical education and training==

===Medical schools===
The [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME) accredits the 144 U.S. medical schools that award the MD degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aamc.org/about/membership/378788/medicalschools.html |title=Medical Schools |publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges |accessdate=27 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcme.org/directory.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131114000754/http://www.lcme.org/directory.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 November 2013 |title=Medical School Directory |publisher=Liaison Committee on Medical Education |accessdate=27 Sep 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[American Osteopathic Association|American Osteopathic Association (AOA)]]'s [[Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation]] (COCA) accredits the 34 osteopathic medical schools that award the DO degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/affiliates/Pages/osteopathic-medical-schools.aspx |title=Osteopathic Medical Schools |publisher=American Osteopathic Association |accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osteopathic schools tend to be affiliated with smaller universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sciencebiz/2010/10/27/osteopaths-versus-doctors/#204d2a9d1033|title=Osteopathic Physicians Versus Doctors|first=Steven|last=Salzberg|date=|website=forbes.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michigan State University]], [[Rowan University]], and [[Nova Southeastern University]] offer both MD and DO accredited programs.&lt;ref name="tcomMD"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hedger|first=Brian|title=Texas university explores offering an MD degree in addition to its DO program|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2009/04/27/prsc0427.htm|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=American Medical News|date=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences|Kansas City University]] proposed starting a dual MD/DO program in addition to the existing DO program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fired medical school president had been pushing big changes|url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/joplin_metro/x546223676/Fired-medical-school-president-had-been-pushing-big-changes|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=Joplin Metro|date=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of North Texas Health Science Center|University of North Texas]] explored the possibility of starting an MD program that would be offered alongside the DO program.&lt;ref name=tcomMD /&gt; Both proposals were met with controversy. Proponents argued that adding an MD program would lead to the creation of more local residency programs and improve the university’s ability to acquire research funding and state funding, while opponents wanted to protect the discipline of osteopathy.

61% of graduating seniors at osteopathic medical schools evaluated that over half of their required in-hospital training was delivered by MD physicians.&lt;ref name=aacomgrad&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aacom.org/docs/default-source/data-and-trends/2014-15-GSSSR.pdf|title=AACOM 2014-15 Academic Year Survey of Graduating Seniors Summary|last=|first=|date=2015|website=AACOM|publisher=|access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, osteopathic medical schools have more modest research programs compared to MD schools, and fewer DO schools are part of universities that own a hospital.&lt;ref name=SeparateEduPathway&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chen C|author2=Mullan F|title=The separate osteopathic medical education pathway: uniquely addressing national needs.

====Osteopathic manipulative medicine====
Many authors note the most obvious difference between the curricula of DO and MD schools is [[Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine|osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM)]], a form of hands-on care used to diagnose, treat and prevent illness or injury and is taught only at DO schools. As of 2006, the average osteopathic medical student spent almost 8 weeks on clerkships for OMM during their third and fourth years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krueger PM|author2=Dane P |author3=Slocum P |author4= Kimmelman M |title=Osteopathic clinical training in three universities|journal=Acad Med|date=June 2009|volume=84|issue=6|pages=712–7|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181a409b1|pmid=19474543}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute of Health]]'s [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] states that overall, studies have shown that spinal manipulation can provide mild-to-moderate relief from low-back pain and appears to be as effective as conventional medical treatments.&lt;ref name=nccih&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/pain/spinemanipulation.htm |title=Spinal Manipulation for Low-Back Pain &amp;#124; NCCIH |publisher=National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health |date=26 Jan 2015 |accessdate=27 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 guidelines, the [[American College of Physicians]] and the [[American Pain Society]] include spinal manipulation as one of several treatment options for practitioners to consider using when pain does not improve with self-care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chou R|author2=Qaseem A |author3=Snow V |author4=Casey D |author5=Cross T |author6=Shekelle P |author7=Owens DK |title=Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain: A Joint Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society|journal=Ann Intern Med|date=2 October 2007|volume=147|issue=7|pages=478–491|pmid=17909209|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-7-200710020-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chou|first=R|author2=Huffman, LH|title=Nonpharmacologic therapies for acute and chronic low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society/American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline.|journal=Ann Intern Med|date=2 October 2007|volume=147|issue=7|pages=492–504|pmid=17909210|url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?volume=147&amp;issue=7&amp;page=492|accessdate=24 August 2012|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-7-200710020-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinal manipulation is generally a safe treatment for low-back pain. Serious complications are very rare.&lt;ref name=nccih /&gt; A 2001 survey of DOs found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) on less than 5% of their patients. The survey was the latest indication that DOs have become more like MD physicians in all respects: fewer perform OMT, more prescribe drugs, and many perform surgery as a first option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson SM, Kurtz ME |title=Diminished use of osteopathic manipulative treatment and its impact on the uniqueness of the osteopathic profession |journal=Acad Med |volume=76 |issue=8 |pages=821–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11500286 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1040-2446&amp;volume=76&amp;issue=8&amp;spage=821 |doi=10.1097/00001888-200108000-00016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area which has been implicated, but not been formally studied regarding the decline in OMT usage among DOs in practice, is the role of reimbursement changes.&lt;ref name=snider2009&gt;{{cite journal|author=Snider KT |author2=Jorgensen DJ |title=Billing and coding for osteopathic manipulative treatment |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |date=Aug 2009 |volume=109 |issue=8 |pages=409–13 |pmid=19706830 |url=http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the last several years could a DO charge for both an office visit (Evaluation &amp; Management services) and use a procedure (CPT) code when performing OMT; previously, it was bundled.&lt;ref name=snider2009 /&gt;

====Student aptitude indicators====
There is a statistical difference in average [[Grade point average|GPA]] and [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] scores of those who matriculate at DO schools versus those who matriculate at MD schools. In 2016, the average MCAT and GPA for students entering U.S.-based MD programs were 508.7 and 3.70,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table A-16: MCAT Scores and GPAs for Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools, 2016-2017|url=https://www.aamc.org/download/321494/data/factstablea16.pdf|publisher=American Association of Medical Colleges|accessdate=24 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, and 502.2 and 3.54 for DO matriculants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 AACOMAS Profile: Applicant and Matriculant Report|url=http://www.aacom.org/docs/default-source/data-and-trends/2016-aacomas-applicant-amp-matriculant-profile-summary-report.pdf?sfvrsn=10|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|accessdate=24 Aug 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DO medical schools are more likely to accept non-traditional students, who are older, coming to medicine as a second career, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical College Information Book|url=http://www.aacom.org/docs/default-source/cib/2016_cib.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|page=19|year=2016|accessdate=27 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Madison Park |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/13/mid.life.doctors/index.html?hpt=hp_t2/ |title=Never too late to be a doctor |publisher=CNN News |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MD students take [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE)'s series of three licensing exams during and after medical school.  

DO students are required to take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination ([[COMLEX-USA]]) that is administered by the [[National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners]] (NBOME). This exam is a prerequisite for DO-associated residency programs, which are available in almost every specialty of medicine and surgery. DO medical students may also choose to sit for the [[USMLE]] if they wish to take an MD residency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmle.org/bulletin/eligibility/ |title=Eligibility for the USMLE Examinations |publisher=United States Medical Licensing Examination |accessdate=27 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 48% take USMLE Step 1.&lt;ref name=aacomgrad /&gt; However, if they have taken COMLEX, it may or may not be needed, depending on the individual institution’s program requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sarko J |author2=Svoren E |author3=Katz E |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00632.x/full |title=COMLEX-1 and USMLE-1 are not interchangeable examinations |journal=Acad Emerg Med |pmid=20070273 |doi=10.1111/j.1553-2712.2009.00632.x |date=Feb 2010 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=218–20 |accessdate=27 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chick DA |author2=Friedman HP |author3=Young VB |author4=Solomon D |title=Relationship between COMLEX and USMLE scores among osteopathic medical students who take both examinations|journal=Teach Learn Med|date=Jan 2010|volume=22|issue=1|pages=3–7|pmid=20391276|doi=10.1080/10401330903445422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbome.org/directors-faq.asp |title=Information for Program Directors |publisher=National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners |accessdate=27 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residency===
Currently, the ACGME accredits all MD residency programs, while the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA) accredits all DO [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] programs. DO students may choose to apply to ACGME-accredited residency programs through the [[National Resident Matching Program]] (NRMP) rather than completing a DO residency. As of 2014, 54% of DOs in post-doctoral training are enrolled in an ACGME-accredited residency program and 46% are enrolled in an AOA-accredited residency program.&lt;ref name=ompr /&gt;

Since 1985, a single residency training program can be dual-accredited by both the ACGME and the AOA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hayes OW |title=Dual approval of a residency program: ten years' experience and implications for postdoctoral training |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |volume=98 |issue=11 |pages=647–52 |date=November 1998|pmid=9846049}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The number of dually accredited programs increased from 11% of all AOA approved residencies in 2006 to 14% in 2008, and then to 22% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burkhart|first=DN|author2=Lischka, TA|title=Dual and parallel postdoctoral training programs: implications for the osteopathic medical profession.|journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc|date=April 2011|volume=111|issue=4|pages=247–56|pmid=21562295}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the AOA adopted a provision making it possible for a DO resident in any MD program to apply for osteopathic approval of their training.&lt;ref name=res42&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bulger JB |url=http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093263 |title=Approval of ACGME Training as an AOA-approved internship: history and review of current data |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |pmid=17242416 |date=Dec 2006 |volume=106 |issue=12 |pages=708–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of dual-accreditation is controversial. Opponents claim that by merging DO students into the "MD world," the unique quality of osteopathic philosophy will be lost.&lt;ref name=Zeigler&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zeigler, Jennifer |title=Osteopathic residencies struggle to keep up with the growing number of DO grads |journal=The New Physician |date=April 2004 |volume=53 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters claim the programs are popular because of the higher prestige and higher resident reimbursement salaries associated with MD programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Terry RR |title=Dually accredited family practice residencies: wave of the future |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |volume=103 |issue=8 |pages=367–70 |date=August 2003|pmid=12956249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 5 years starting in July 2015, the AOA, AACOM, and the ACGME will create a single, unified accreditation system for graduate medical education programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Single GME Accreditation System|url=https://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/tabid/445/GraduateMedicalEducation/SingleAccreditationSystemforAOA-ApprovedPrograms.aspx|publisher=Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="singlegme"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Single GME Accreditation System|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/single-gme-accreditation-system/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will ensure that all physicians trained in the U.S. will have the same graduate medical education accreditation, and as of June 30, 2020, the AOA will cease its accreditation functions.&lt;ref name="singlegme" /&gt;

There are notable differences in the specialty choices of DOs and MDs. 60% of DOs work in primary care specialties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medicalschoolhq.net/md-vs-do-what-are-the-differences-and-similarities/#2|title=MD vs DO - What are the Differences (and similarities)?|author=|date=3 March 2012|website=medicalschoolhq.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 35% of MDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/health-cents/Does-osteopathic-medicine-have-a-future.html|title=Does osteopathic medicine have a future? - Philly|author=|date=|website=philly.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing medical education===
{{main|Continuing medical education}}
To maintain a professional license to practice medicine, U.S. physicians are required to complete ongoing additional training, known as [[continuing medical education]] (CME).  CME requirements differ from state to state and between the American Osteopathic Medical Association (DO) and the American Medical Association (MD) governing bodies.

== Professional opportunities ==

An MD is accepted worldwide, while the DO degree is accepted in 44 countries abroad. Accredited DO and MD medical schools are both included in the World Health Organization’s [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Directory of Medical Schools|url=http://avicenna.ku.dk/database/medicine|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDs and DOs are both accepted by international medical organizations such as [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work in the Field: FAQ|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/work-us/work-field/faq|publisher=Doctors Without Borders|accessdate=2 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corpus Catholicorum''' ('''Corp. Cath., CCath., CC''') is a collection of sixteenth century writings by the leading proponents and defenders of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against the teachings of the [[Protestant reformers]].

The full title of the series is: ''Corpus Catholicorum: Werke katholischer Schriftsteller im Zeitalter der Glaubensspaltung'' i.e. ''Body of Catholic [writings]: Works of Catholic authors in the Time of the Splitting of the Faith.''

The series, intended as a counterpart to the [[Corpus Reformatorum]], was conceived by Professor Joseph Greving  (1868–1919) of the [[University of Bonn]] in 1915, and was announced that same year in the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070817191347/http://egora.uni-muenster.de/fb2/thrv/aktuelles.shtml Theologische Revue]'' as a "Plan für ein Corpus Catholicorum" or "Plan for a Corpus Catholicorum" &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGFAAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Plan%20for%20a%20Corpus%20Catholicorum%22&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA332#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Plan%20for%20a%20Corpus%20Catholicorum%22&amp;f=false  The Fortnightly review], ed., Arthur Preuss, St. Louis, Missouri, Volume XXVI, No. 21, November 1, 1919, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crnogorska Enciklopedija''' ({{lang-en|Montenegrin Encyclopedia}}; formerly ''Montenegrowiki'') was an [[internet encyclopedia project]] written in [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], which existed from 2006 to 2008. It was started by the [[IT Association of Montenegro]] in 2006 as an experimental project, with the goal of providing a base for a future Montenegrin [[Wikipedia]]. As of late 2008, it is nonfunctional. It used the [[MediaWiki]] software, running at version 1.6.8, and did not carry advertising.

By 9 January 2008, Crnogorska Enciklopedija had just over 1,000 articles. Like Wikipedia, the articles were released under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]. Its authors and webmasters were Darko Bulatović ("User:WikiSysop") and Damir Mustafić ("User:OutLook"). According to Bulatović, in an interview for the Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Vijesti]]'', the project was a victim of wiki-hacking, having been attacked by users from Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Nova šansa za Montenegrowiki|publisher = [[Vijesti]]|date = 2008-01-09|accessdate = 2008-01-09|url = http://www.vijesti.cg.yu/vijesti_old/naslovna.php?akcija=vijest&amp;id=258117}}{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/inicijativa-wikipediju-facebook-crnogorskom-jeziku-clanak-3680 |title=Inicijativa za Wikipediju i Facebook na crnogorskom jeziku |last=Damira Kalač |first= |date=2011-01-25 |work=Vijesti.me |language=Montenegrin |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2008, the project is closed.

'''Cú Chulainn''', also spelled '''Cú Chulaind''' or '''Cúchulainn''' ({{IPA-ga|kuːˈxʊlˠɪnʲ||Cuchulainn-audio.ogg}}; [[Irish language|Irish]] for "[[Culann]]'s Hound") and sometimes known in English as '''Cuhullin''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|h|ʊ|l|ᵻ|n}},&lt;ref&gt;Best known from the folk tale "Oona and Cuhullin" and [[Robert Dwyer Joyce]]'s ''Blanid''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Irish mythology|Irish mythological]] hero who appears in the stories of the [[Ulster Cycle]], as well as in [[Scottish folklore|Scottish]] and [[Isle of Man|Manx]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How the Manx Cat Lost Its Tail and Other Manx Folk Stories |last=Cowley Young |first=Blanche |date=1959 |publisher=McKay |location=New York |isbn= |pages=17–18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzPaAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to be an [[incarnation]] of the god [[Lugh]], who is also his father.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Alan (2011).

Born '''Sétanta''', he gained his better-known name as a child, after killing Culann's fierce guard-dog in self-defence and offered to take its place until a replacement could be reared. At the age of seventeen he defended [[Ulster]] single-handedly against the armies of queen [[Medb]] of [[Connacht]] in the famous ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' ("Cattle Raid of [[Cooley peninsula|Cooley]]"). It was prophesied that his great deeds would give him everlasting fame, but his life would be a short one. He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy, or ''ríastrad''&lt;ref&gt;Literally "the act of contorting, a distortion" (''[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]]'', Compact Edition, [[Royal Irish Academy]], Dublin, 1990, p. 507)&lt;/ref&gt; (translated by [[Thomas Kinsella]] as "warp spasm"&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kinsella]] (trans.), The Táin, Oxford University Press, 1969, {{ISBN|0-19-281090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ciaran Carson|Ciarán Carson]] as "torque"),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ciaran Carson]] (trans.), ''The Táin: A New Translation of the Táin Bó Cúailnge'', Penguin, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in which he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer [[Láeg]] and drawn by his horses, [[Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend]]. In more modern times, Cú Chulainn is often referred to as the "Hound of Ulster".&lt;ref name="Ulster"&gt;Hull, E. ''Cuchulain the Hound of Ulster'' (London, Harrap, 1913). Sutcliff, R., ''The Hound of Ulster'' (London, Red Fox, 1992). "The Hound of Ulster", [http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/myths_legends/northern_ireland/ni_7/ BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cú Chulainn shows striking similarities to the legendary [[Persian Empire|Persian]] hero [[Rostam]], as well as to the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Lay of Hildebrand]] and the labours of the Greek epic hero [[Heracles]], suggesting a common [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Legends==
===Birth===
{{Main article|Compert Con Culainn}}

There are a number of versions of the story of Cú Chulainn's [[miraculous birth]]. In the earliest version of ''Compert C(h)on Culainn'' ("The Conception of Cú Chulainn"), his mother [[Deichtine]] is the daughter and charioteer of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], king of Ulster, and accompanies him as he and the nobles of Ulster hunt a flock of magical birds. As snow begins to fall, Ulstermen seek shelter in a nearby house. As the host's wife goes into labour, Deichtine assists in the birth of a baby boy, while a [[mare]] gives birth to twin [[colt (horse)|colts]]. The next morning, the Ulstermen find themselves at the ''Brug na Bóinde'' (the Neolithic mound at [[Newgrange]])—the house and its occupants have disappeared, but the child and the colts remain. Deichtine takes the boy home and begins raising him as her own, but the boy falls ill and dies. The god [[Lugh|Lug]] appears to her and tells her he was their host that night, and that he has put his child in her womb, who is to be called Sétanta. Her pregnancy turns into a scandal as she is betrothed to [[Sualtam]] mac Róich, and the Ulstermen suspect Conchobar of being the father, so she aborts the child and goes to her husband's bed "virgin-whole". She then conceives a son whom she names Sétanta.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.G. van Hamel]] (ed.), ''Compert Con Culainn and Other Stories'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1978, pp. 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later and better-known version of ''Compert Con Culainn'', Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from [[Emain Macha]], the Ulster capital. As in the previous version, the Ulstermen go hunting a flock of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, a member of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Peete Cross &amp; Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt &amp; Company, 1936 (reprinted by Barnes &amp; Noble, 1996), pp. 134–136&lt;/ref&gt;

The nobles of Ulster argue over which of them is to be his foster-father, until the wise Morann decides he should be fostered by several of them: Conchobar himself; [[Sencha mac Ailella]], who will teach him judgement and eloquent speech; the wealthy [[Blaí Briugu]], who will protect and provide for him; the noble warrior [[Fergus mac Róich]], who will care for him and teach him to protect the weak; the poet [[Amergin mac Eccit|Amergin]], who will educate him, and his wife [[Findchóem]], who will nurse him. He is brought up in the house of Amergin and Findchóem on [[Muirthemne]] Plain in modern [[County Louth]] (at the time part of Ulster), alongside their son [[Conall Cernach]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kinsella]] (trans.), ''The Táin'', Oxford University Press, 1969, {{ISBN|0-19-281090-1}}, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The County Louth town of [[Dundalk]] has the motto ''Mé do rug Cú Chulainn cróga''{{spaces|2}}&lt;small&gt;([[Irish language|Irish]])&lt;/small&gt; "I gave birth to brave Cú Chulainn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dkit.ie/international-office/international-students/about-ireland/dundalk|title=Dundalk|date=20 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
The stories of Cú Chulainn's childhood are told in a flashback sequence in ''Táin Bó Cúailnge''. As a small child, living in his parents' house on Muirthemne Plain, he begs to be allowed to join the boy-troop at Emain Macha. However, he sets off on his own, and when he arrives at Emain he runs onto the playing field without first asking for the boys' protection, being unaware of the custom. The boys take this as a challenge and attack him, but he has a ''ríastrad'' and beats them single-handed. Conchobar puts a stop to the fight and clears up the misunderstanding, but no sooner has Sétanta put himself under the boys' protection than he chases after them, demanding they put themselves under his protection.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella 1969, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cudesiresarms.jpg|thumb|upright|"Cuchulain Desires Arms of the King", illustration by [[Stephen Reid (artist)|Stephen Reid]] in Eleanor Hull's ''The Boys' Cuchulain'', 1904]]

[[Culann]] the [[Smith (metalwork)|smith]] invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before going, Conchobar goes to the playing field to watch the boys play [[hurling]]. He is so impressed by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. Sétanta has a game to finish, but promises to follow the king later. But Conchobar forgets, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to protect his house. When Sétanta arrives, the enormous hound attacks him, but he kills it in self-defence, in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, and in another by driving a [[sliotar]] (hurling ball) down its throat with his [[hurley (stick)|hurley]]. Culann is devastated by the loss of his hound, so Sétanta promises he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old enough to do the job, he himself will guard Culann's house. The [[druid]] [[Cathbad]] announces that his name henceforth will be ''Cú Chulainn''—"Culann's Hound".&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella 1969, pp. 82–84; [[Cecile O'Rahilly]] (ed. &amp; trans.), ''Táin Bó Cúalnge from the Book of Leinster'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1967, pp. 159–163&lt;/ref&gt;

One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad teaching his pupils. One asks him what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar and asks for arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, in response to a similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of [[Nechtan Scéne]], who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife [[Mugain]] leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. They put him in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella 1969, pp. 84–92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emer and Cú Chulainn's training===
{{Main article|Tochmarc Emire}}

In Cú Chulainn's youth he is so beautiful the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will have none but [[Emer]], daughter of [[Forgall Monach]]. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. He suggests that Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman [[Scáthach]] in the land of Alba ([[Scotland]]), hoping the ordeal will be too much for him and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence ''[[Dunscaith Castle|Dún Scáith]]'' (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of [[Skye]].&lt;ref&gt;"Scáthach." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 03 Jun. 2014. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/526802/Scathach&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitley Stokes, ‘The Training of Cúchulainn’, Revue Celtique, 29 (1908), 109–52;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Henry, Celtica, 21 (1990), 191–207.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of [[Munster]], but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.

Scáthach teaches Cú Chulainn all the arts of war, including the use of the [[Gáe Bulg]], a terrible barbed spear, thrown with the foot, that has to be cut out of its victim. His fellow trainees include [[Ferdiad]], who becomes Cú Chulainn's best friend and foster-brother as well as possible lover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cassell's Encyclopedia of Queer Myth, Symbol and Spirit|last= Conner |first= Randy P. |year=1998 |publisher=Cassell |location=UK |isbn=0304704237 |page=116 "Cú Chulainn and er diadh"}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time there, Scáthach faces a battle against [[Aífe]], her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Scáthach, knowing Aífe's prowess, fears for Cú Chulainn's life and gives him a powerful [[sleeping potion]] to keep him from the battle. However, because of Cú Chulainn's great strength, it only puts him to sleep for an hour, and he soon joins the fray. He fights Aífe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but Cú Chulainn distracts her by calling out that Aífe's horses and chariot, the things she values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword at her throat, he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Scáthach, and bear him a son.

Leaving Aífe pregnant, Cú Chulainn returns from Scotland fully trained, but Forgall still refuses to let him marry Emer. Cú Chulainn storms Forgall's fortress, killing twenty-four of Forgall's men, abducts Emer and steals Forgall's treasure. Forgall himself falls from the ramparts to his death. Conchobar has the "[[Droit du seigneur|right of the first night]]" over all marriages of his subjects. He is afraid of Cú Chulainn's reaction if he exercises it in this case, but is equally afraid of losing his authority if he does not. Cathbad suggests a solution: Conchobar sleeps with Emer on the night of the wedding, but Cathbad sleeps between them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kuno Meyer]] (ed. &amp; trans.), "The oldest version of ''Tochmarc Emire''", ''[[Revue Celtique]]'' 11, 1890, pp. 433–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cú Chulainn kills his son===
Eight years later, [[Connla]], Cú Chulainn's son by Aífe, comes to Ireland in search of his father, but Cú Chulainn takes him as an intruder and kills him when he refuses to identify himself. Connla's last words to his father as he dies are that they would have "carried the flag of Ulster to the gates of Rome and beyond", leaving Cú Chulainn grief-stricken.&lt;ref&gt;Kuno Meyer (ed. &amp; trans.), "The death of Connla", ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]'' 1, 1904, pp. 113–121&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Cú Chulainn and Connla shows a striking similarity to the legend of [[Persia]]n hero [[Rostam]] who also kills his son [[Sohrab]]. Rostam and Cú Chulainn share several other characteristics, including killing a ferocious beast at a very young age, their near invincibility in battle, and the manner of their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Connell Monette, ''The Medieval Hero: Christian and Muslim Traditions''. (Saarsbruck: 2008), pp. 91–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar myth is found in the [[Hildebrandslied]], in which Hildebrand kills his son, Hadubrand.

===Lugaid and Derbforgaill===
During his time abroad, Cú Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the [[Fomorians]]. She falls in love with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him in the form of a pair of swans. Cú Chulainn, not realising who she is, shoots her down with his sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his [[fosterage|foster-son]] [[Lugaid Riab nDerg]]. Lugaid goes on to become [[High King of Ireland]], but the ''[[Lia Fáil]]'' (stone of destiny), fails to cry out when he stands on it, so Cú Chulainn splits it in two with his sword.&lt;ref&gt;''Lebor Gabála Érenn'' [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/lebor4.html#55 §57]&lt;/ref&gt; When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual desirability and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house the women are inside, killing 150 of them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Marstrander]] (ed. &amp; trans.), "The Deaths of Lugaid and Derbforgaill", ''Ériu'' 5, 1911, pp. 201–218&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cattle Raid of Cooley===
{{Main article|Táin Bó Cúailnge}}
At the age of seventeen, Cú Chulainn single-handedly defends Ulster from the army of [[Connacht]] in the ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]''. [[Medb]], queen of Connacht, has mounted the invasion to steal the stud bull [[Donn Cúailnge]], Cú Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman when he should have been watching the border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labour pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop [[Medb]]'s army from advancing further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.

Before one combat a beautiful young woman comes to him, claiming to be the daughter of a king, and offers him her love, but he refuses her. The woman reveals herself as the [[Morrígan]], and in revenge for this slight, she attacks him in various animal forms while he is engaged in combat against Lóch mac Mofemis. As an eel, she trips him in the ford, but he breaks her ribs. As a wolf, she stampedes cattle across the ford, but he blinds her eye with a sling-stone. Finally, she appears as a heifer at the head of the stampede, but he breaks her leg with another sling stone. After Cú Chulainn finally defeats Lóch, the Morrígan appears to him as an old woman milking a cow, with the same injuries he had given her in her animal forms. She gives him three drinks of milk, and with each drink he blesses her, healing her wounds.

After one particularly arduous combat, Cú Chulainn lies severely wounded but is visited by Lug, who tells him he is his father and heals his wounds. When Cú Chulainn wakes up and sees that the boy-troop of Emain Macha have attacked the Connacht army and been slaughtered, he has his most spectacular ''ríastrad'' yet:

{{bquote|The first warp-spasm seized Cúchulainn, and made him into a monstrous thing, hideous and shapeless, unheard of. His shanks and his joints, every knuckle and angle and organ from head to foot, shook like a tree in the flood or a reed in the stream. His body made a furious twist inside his skin, so that his feet and shins switched to the rear and his heels and calves switched to the front... On his head the temple-sinews stretched to the nape of his neck, each mighty, immense, measureless knob as big as the head of a month-old child... he sucked one eye so deep into his head that a wild crane couldn't probe it onto his cheek out of the depths of his skull; the other eye fell out along his cheek. His mouth weirdly distorted: his cheek peeled back from his jaws until the gullet appeared, his lungs and his liver flapped in his mouth and throat, his lower jaw struck the upper a lion-killing blow, and fiery flakes large as a ram's fleece reached his mouth from his throat... The hair of his head twisted like the tangle of a red thornbush stuck in a gap; if a royal apple tree with all its kingly fruit were shaken above him, scarce an apple would reach the ground but each would be spiked on a bristle of his hair as it stood up on his scalp with rage.|[[Thomas Kinsella]] (translator)|The Táin, Oxford University Press, 1969, pp. 150–153}}

He attacks the army and kills hundreds, building walls of corpses.

When his foster-father Fergus mac Róich, now in exile in Medb's court, is sent to face him Cú Chulainn agrees to yield, so long as Fergus agrees to return the favour the next time they meet. Finally, he fights a gruelling three-day duel with his best friend and foster-brother, [[Ferdiad]], at a ford that was named ''Áth Fhir Diadh'' ([[Ardee]], [[County Louth]]) after him.

The Ulstermen eventually rouse, one by one at first, and finally ''en masse''. The final battle begins. Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps his side of the bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as [[Athlone]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella 1969, pp. 52–253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecile O'Rahilly (ed. &amp; trans.), ''Táin Bó Cúalnge from the Book of Leinster'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecile O'Rahilly (ed. &amp; trans.), ''Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension 1'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bricriu's Feast===
{{Main article|Fled Bricrenn}}

The troublemaker [[Bricriu]] once incites three heroes, Cú Chulainn, [[Conall Cernach]] and [[Lóegaire Búadach]], to compete for the [[champion's portion]] at his feast. In every test that is set Cú Chulainn comes out on top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire will accept the result. [[Cú Roí]] mac Dáire of Munster settles it by visiting each in the guise of a hideous churl and challenging them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Conall and Lóegaire both behead Cú Roí, who picks up his head and leaves, but when the time comes for him to return they flee. Only Cú Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to Cú Roí's axe; Cú Roí spares him and he is declared champion.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Gantz (trans.), ''Early Irish Myths &amp; Sagas'', Penguin, 1981, pp. 219–255&lt;/ref&gt; This beheading challenge appears in later literature, most notably in the [[Middle English]] poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. Other examples include the 13th century [[French language|French]] ''[[Caradoc|Life of Caradoc]]'' and the English romances ''The Turke and [[Gawain|Gowin]]'', and ''[[Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle]]''.

===The Death of Cú Roí===
Cú Roí, again in disguise, joins the Ulstermen on a raid on [[Inis Fer Falga]] (probably the [[Isle of Man]]), in return for his choice of the spoils. They steal treasure, and abduct [[Blathnát]], daughter of the island's king, who loves Cú Chulainn. But when Cú Roí is asked to choose his share, he chooses Blathnát. Cú Chulainn tries to stop him taking her, but Cú Roí cuts his hair and drives him into the ground up to his armpits before escaping, taking Blathnát with him. Like other heroes such as the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Samson]], [[Duryodhana]] in the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] [[Llew Llaw Gyffes]], Cú Roí can only be killed in certain contrived circumstances, which vary in different versions of the story. Blathnat discovers how to kill him and betrays him to Cú Chulainn, who does the deed. However, Ferchertne, Cú Roí's poet, enraged at the betrayal of his lord, grabs Blathnát and leaps off a cliff, killing her and himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. I. Best]] (ed. &amp; trans.), "The Tragic Death of Cúrói mac Dári", ''Ériu'' 2, 1905, pp. 18–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emer's only jealousy===
{{Main article|Serglige Con Culainn}}

Cú Chulainn has many lovers, but Emer's only jealousy comes when he falls in love with [[Fand]], wife of [[Manannán mac Lir]]. Manannán has left her and she has been attacked by three [[Fomorians]] who want to control the [[Irish Sea]]. Cú Chulainn agrees to help defend her as long as she marries him. She agrees reluctantly, but they fall in love when they meet. Manannán knows their relationship is doomed because Cú Chulainn is mortal and Fand is a fairy; Cú Chulainn's presence would destroy the fairies. Emer, meanwhile, tries to kill her rival, but when she sees the strength of Fand's love for Cú Chulainn she decides to give him up to her. Fand, touched by Emer's magnanimity, decides to return to her own husband. Manannan shakes his cloak between Cú Chulainn and Fand, ensuring the two will never meet again, and Cú Chulainn and Emer drink a potion to wipe the whole affair from their memories.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Leahy (trans.), ''Historic Romances of Ireland'' Vol. 1, 1905, pp. 51–85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cú Chulainn's death===
[[File:Cuchulainn's death, illustration by Stephen Reid 1904.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"Cuchulain's death", illustration by [[Stephen Reid (artist)|Stephen Reid]] in Eleanor Hull's ''The Boys' Cuchulain'', 1904]]
(Irish: ''Aided Con Culainn'', also known as ''Brislech Mór Maige Muirthemne''). Medb conspires with [[Lugaid mac Con Roí|Lugaid]], son of Cú Roí, [[Erc mac Cairpri|Erc]], son of [[Cairbre Nia Fer]], and the sons of others Cú Chulainn had killed, to draw him out to his death. His fate is sealed by his breaking of the ''[[geis|geasa]]'' (taboos) upon him. Cú Chulainn's ''geasa'' included a ban against eating dog meat, but in early Ireland there was a powerful general taboo against refusing hospitality, so when an old crone offers him a meal of dog meat, he has no choice but to break his ''geis''. In this way he is spiritually weakened for the fight ahead of him.
Lugaid has three magical spears made, and it is prophesied that a king will fall by each of them. With the first he kills Cú Chulainn's charioteer [[Láeg]], king of chariot drivers. With the second he kills Cú Chulainn's horse, [[Liath Macha]], king of horses. With the third he hits Cú Chulainn, mortally wounding him. Cú Chulainn ties himself to a standing stone to die on his feet, facing his enemies. This stone is traditionally identified as [[Clochafarmore]], located near [[Dundalk]].&lt;ref name="mackillop"&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his ferocity even when so near death, it is only when a [[raven]] lands on his shoulder that his enemies believe he is dead. Lugaid approaches and cuts off his head, but as he does so the "hero-light" burns around Cú Chulainn and his sword falls from his hand and cuts Lugaid's hand off. The light disappears only after his right hand, his sword arm, is cut from his body.

[[Conall Cernach]] had sworn that if Cú Chulainn died before him he would avenge him before sunset, and when he hears Cú Chulainn is dead he pursues Lugaid. As Lugaid has lost a hand, Conall fights him with one hand tucked into his belt, but he only beats him after his horse takes a bite out of Lugaid's side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]], where Erc's sister [[Achall]] dies of grief for her brother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]] (ed. trans.), "Cuchulainn's death, abridged from the Book of Leinster", ''Revue Celtique'' 3, 1877, pp. 175–185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearance===
Cú Chulainn's appearance is occasionally remarked on in the texts. He is usually described as small, youthful and beardless. He is often described as dark: in ''The Wooing of Emer'' and ''[[Fled Bricrenn|Bricriu's Feast]]'' he is "a dark, sad man, comeliest of the men of Erin",&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Slover 1936, p. 156, 265&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Mesca Ulad|The Intoxication of the Ulstermen]]'' he is a "little, black-browed man",&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Slover 1936, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''The Phantom Chariot of Cú Chulainn'' "[h]is hair was thick and black, and smooth as though a cow had licked it... in his head his eyes gleamed swift and grey";&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Slover 1936, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; yet the prophetess [[Fedelm]] in the ''Táin Bó Cúailnge'' describes him as blond.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella 1969, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The most elaborate description of his appearance comes later in the ''Táin'':

{{bquote|And certainly the youth Cúchulainn mac Sualdaim was handsome as he came to show his form to the armies. You would think he had three distinct heads of hair—brown at the base, blood-red in the middle, and a crown of golden yellow. This hair was settled strikingly into three coils on the cleft at the back of his head. Each long loose-flowing strand hung down in shining splendour over his shoulders, deep-gold and beautiful and fine as a thread of gold. A hundred neat red-gold curls shone darkly on his neck, and his head was covered with a hundred crimson threads matted with gems. He had four dimples in each cheek—yellow, green, crimson and blue—and seven bright pupils, eye-jewels, in each kingly eye. Each foot had seven toes and each hand seven fingers, the nails with the grip of a hawk's claw or a gryphon's clench.|Thomas Kinsella (translator)|''The Táin'', Oxford University Press, 1969, pp. 156–158}}

==Later stories==
===Siabur-Charpat Con Culaind===
The ''Siabur-Charpat Con Culaind'' (or "Demonic Chariot of Cu Chulaind") tells the story of when [[Saint Patrick]] was trying to convert King [[Lóegaire mac Néill|Lóegaire]] to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="siabur1"&gt;{{citation| editor-first = J. |editor-last = O'Beirne Crowe | title  =Siabur-Charpat Con Culaind. From "Lebor na h-Uidre" (Fol. 37, et seqq.), a Manuscript of the Royal Irish Academy | journal = Journal of the Royal Historical and Archaeological Association of Ireland |series = 4th series 4 |volume = 1 | number =2 | year = 1871 | pages = 371–448 | jstor = 25506590 | url  = https://archive.org/stream/journalroyalhis04irelgoog#page/n410  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title  =Síaburcharpat Conculaind| url  =https://celt.ucc.ie/published/G301008/index.html | work = Corpus of Electronic Texts (CELT) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tale St. Patrick visited King Loegaire, attempting to convert him to the Christian faith. The king agreed but on a condition - that the saint call up Cu Chulainn from the dead, bringing him to the king's presence. St. Patrick agreed, and then the hero appeared, complete with chariot, and his two horse ''Liath Macha'' and ''Dub-Sainglend'', together with his charioteer ''Loeg''. The saint asks if the king is convinced - he replies that the appearance was so short he was not yet sure. The saint responds that God is so powerful that the king would see the hero again.&lt;ref name="siabur1"/&gt;

The ghostly hero returns, and this time salutes and addresses the saint, he then turns to the king, confirms it is Cu Chulainn he sees and not some demon, and implores him to believe in the saint and his god. A dialogue between king and ghostly hero takes place, in which the old hero recounts his life, including a poetic telling of his heroic deeds, ending with a request to Patrick to allow him too into heaven - the king is convinced. At the end of this the saint declares that Cu Chulainn is welcome in heaven.&lt;ref name="siabur1"/&gt;

The date of the tale is not certain.

===A Legend of Knockmany===
Cú Chulainn was later reimagined as an evil giant at odds with [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (or Finn McCool).&lt;ref name="huck1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Charlotte Huck's children's literature |last=Kiefer |first=Barbara Zulandt |author2=Hepler, Susan Ingrid |author3=Hickman, Janet |author4= Huck, Charlotte S. |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw–Hill |location= |isbn= |page=294 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfxJAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unrecorded before the 19th century, the earliest known version was "A Legend of Knockmany" in the 1845  ''Tales and Sketches .. of the Irish Peasantry'' by [[William Carleton]].&lt;ref name="carleton1"&gt;{{citation| chapterurl = https://archive.org/stream/talesandsketche02carlgoog#page/n123 | chapter = A Legend of Knockmany | pages = 97-112 |  title =  Tales and sketches, illustrating the character, usages, traditions, sports and pastimes of the Irish peasantry | first = William | last = Carleton | edition =  | year = 1845 | url = https://archive.org/details/talesandsketche02carlgoog |  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="killop1"&gt;{{citation| title = Myths and Legends of the Celts| first = James | last = MacKillop | authorlink = James MacKillop (author) |pages = 231-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Variants were published in [[Patrick Kennedy (folklorist)|Patrick Kennedy]]'s ''Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts'' (1866), and republished and brought to a larger audience by [[W.B. Yeats]] in ''Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry'' (1888), followed by numerous adaptions and variant, many uncredited.&lt;ref name="killop1"/&gt; The work was included in later collections of 'folk tales' by other editors such as [[Joseph Jacobs]] in his ''Celtic Fairy Tales'' (1891).

In this tale, Cú Chullain's power was contained in his middle finger. Wishing to defeat Finn, he came to Finn's house, but Finn disguised himself as a baby while his wife Oona baked cakes, some with griddle irons inside, some without. When Cú Chulainn could not bite through his cake (which had an iron in it) but the baby could (Finn's cake had no iron), in amazement Cú Chulainn felt to see how sharp the baby's teeth were, allowing Finn to bite his middle finger off and deprive Cú Chulainn of both his strength and size.&lt;ref name="huck1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carleton1"/&gt;

===Literature===
[[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] retold many of the legends of Cú Chulainn in her 1902 book ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'', which paraphrased the originals but also romanticized some of the tales and omitted most of the more violent content. This first translation was very popular, supported by the [[Celtic Revival]] movement. It featured an introduction by her friend [[William Butler Yeats]], who wrote several pieces based on the legend, including the plays ''On Baile's Strand'' (1904), ''The Green Helmet'' (1910), ''[[At the Hawk's Well]]'' (1917), ''The Only Jealousy of Emer'' (1919) and ''The Death of Cuchulain'' (1939), and a poem, ''Cuchulain's Fight with the Sea'' (1892).&lt;ref name="mackillop" /&gt;

'''''Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam''''' is a 1987 American [[documentary film]] inspired by the anthology of the same title, directed by [[Bill Couturié]] in 1987. Using real letters written by American soldiers (which can be read in the book along with many more) and archive footage, the film creates a highly personal experience of the [[Vietnam War]]. The film won the Special Jury Prize: Documentary at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1988. It was also screened out of competition at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/333/year/1988.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam |accessdate=2009-07-31 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003084515/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/333/year/1988.html |archivedate=2012-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] commented, "There have been many great movies about Vietnam. This is the one that completes the story."

The '''domain aftermarket''' is the [[secondary market]] for [[Internet]] [[domain name]]s in which a party interested in acquiring a domain that is already registered bids or negotiates a price to effect the transfer of registration from the registered holder of that domain name.

The professional pursuit of [[domain name speculation|speculation in the domain aftermarket]] is known as [[domaining]]. The domain aftermarket has grown substantially, as an increasing number of generic domains names that promise 'marketing appeal' and 'desirability' are registered by domain warehouses, or resellers.

The domain aftermarket is facilitated by auction houses which provide communication methods for buyers and sellers to interact, often anonymously, to negotiate and close a transaction. They often provide additional services, such as financial escrow services and [[domain parking]].

==History==
The collection was started by [[botanist]] [[William Russell Dudley]] (1849−1911), the head of the Stanford Botany Department from 1892 to 1911.&lt;ref name=MAB&gt;Makers of American Botany, [[Harry Baker Humphrey]], Ronald Press Company, Library of Congress Card Number 61-18435&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70–1}}

In the early 1960s, Stanford Provost [[Frederick E. Terman]] made a decision to terminate support for the Division of Systematic Biology.&lt;ref name=SH/&gt;

The collection was eventually transferred (by long-term loan), along with Stanford's Natural History Museum fish collections, to the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=SH/&gt; In 1976, the Dudley Herbarium had 850,000-specimens, which were merged with the 600,000 specimens of the California Academy Herbarium, on completion of what was at the time a state-of-the-art facility to house the collections and staff, funded mostly by a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name=SH/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1474">An elaborate '''Earth-Maker Story of Creation''' is a [[mythology|myth]] that comes from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s of [[California]], also called the "[[Creation myth|Story of Creation]]." This myth describes Earth-maker creating day and night, land, water, and all living things. Men and women were created out of soft clay into which Earth-Maker "breathed life".He also created the seas with his tears. The creation begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''“In the beginning there was no land, no light, only darkness and the vast waters of Outer Ocean where Earth-Maker and Great-Grandfather were afloat in their canoe... Earth-Maker took soft clay and formed the figure of a man and of a woman, then many men and women, which he dried in the sun and into which he breathed life: they were the First People."'' (Kroeber 1968:62).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The entire narrative is printed in the book ''Almost Ancestors: The First Californians'' by [[Theodora Kroeber]] and Robert F. Heizer. The (hardback edition) of the book does not identify the ethnic group who believed in this myth, or an exact narrator.

'''Elaine Svenonius''' is an American [[librarian]] and [[library scholar]], known for her research on [[bibliographic control]], particularly [[cataloging]], [[classification]], and [[Index (publishing)|indexing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elaine Svenonius|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/authors/elaine-svenonius|publisher=The MIT Press|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is best known for bringing a philosophical [[knowledge organization]] approach to cataloging theory.

Svenonius received an MA in [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1957, an MA in [[Library Science]] in 1965 from the [[University of Chicago]], and a [[PhD]] in Library Science in 1971, as well from the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=ccq /&gt;

In ''The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization'', Svenonius attempts to "synthesize the literature of
information organization in a language and at a level of generality to make it understandable to persons outside the field of library and information science" and to "synthesize subject and descriptive cataloging within a common conceptual framework." &lt;ref name=ccq&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myall|first=Carolynne|author2=McGarry, Dorothy |title=An Interview with Elaine Svenonius|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|volume=29|issue=4|pages=5–17|doi=10.1300/J104v29n04_02}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is frequently assigned to [[Master of Library and Information Science]] students, among whom it is nicknamed "the red devil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272799.Intellectual_Foundation_of_Information_Organization|work=Goodreads|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emanuel Tov''' ({{lang-he|עמנואל טוב}}; born September 15, 1941, Amsterdam, Netherlands) is [[emeritus Professor]] in the Department of [[Bible]] at the [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]].

==Biography==
Emanuel Tov was born in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]] during the German occupation (1941). When he was one year old his parents entrusted him to the care of a [[Christian]] family. His parents perished in the [[Holocaust]], and following the war he grew up with his uncle and aunt as one of their children. He studied at a “gymnasium”, where he learned classical and modern European languages, and at the same time learned [[Hebrew]] at [[Talmud Torah]]. From age 14, he was active in the [[Zionism|Zionistic]] youth movement “Ichud Habonim” and served as one of its leaders. At age 18, the movement sent him to [[Israel]] for training as a leader and in 1960 he became the general secretary of that movement in the Netherlands. In 1961, he immigrated to Israel. He studied at the Hebrew University ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] Bible; [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] Bible and [[Greek literature]]), while serving also as an assistant in the Bible Dept. and at the Hebrew University Bible Project. In 1967-1969, he continued his studies at the Dept. for [[Near Eastern]] Studies and Languages at Harvard University. His dissertation, written under the guidance of Professors [[Shemaryahu Talmon]] of the Hebrew University and [[Frank Moore Cross]] of [[Harvard University]], was submitted to the Hebrew University in 1973 as “The [[Septuagint]] Translation of [[Jeremiah]] and [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]].” Upon his return to Israel, he served as an “assistant” at the [[University of Haifa]] and at the Hebrew University.

In 1986, he was appointed Professor at the Hebrew University and in 1990 he became the J. L. Magnes Professor of Bible Studies. Served as visiting Professor at the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]], [[Doshisha University|Doshisha]] (Kyoto), Macquarie and [[University of Sydney|Sydney]] (Australia), [[Stellenbosch University|Stellenbosch]] (South Africa), [[Vrije Universiteit]] (Amsterdam), [[University of Pennsylvania]] (Philadelphia), the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] (Rome), and Halle (Germany).

==Research==

===Septuagint===

Emanuel Tov's studies on the Septuagint focused first on inner-translational developments and gradually moved to the importance of this translation for the study of the Bible: the early revisions of the Septuagint, translation technique, the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Greek translation, the value of the Septuagint for the textual study of the Hebrew Bible, the importance of certain Septuagint books for the exegesis of the Hebrew books and the understanding of their literary development, the place of the Hebrew source of the Septuagint in the development of the text of the Bible.
&lt;ref&gt;See items 3*, 7a*, 65, 181, 207 in [http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~tov Tov's bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728184807/http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~tov/ |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tov's initial publications on the Septuagint deal with that translation's early revisions that were intended to approximate the Greek text to the Hebrew text current in Israel from the 1st century BCE until the 2nd century CE. For that research, he established sound principles by determining the criteria for defining and characterizing the revisions. His preoccupation with matters of translation technique and the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint was influenced by his practical work in the HUBP (Hebrew University Bible Project). In that research, he combined the field work in that project with the formulation of abstract rules for the evaluation of details in the Septuagint, constantly cross-fertilizing both areas. These rules were formulated in his theoretical book on the Septuagint that grew out of his courses at the Hebrew University, each year on a different Bible book
&lt;ref&gt;The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (Third Edition, Completely Revised and Enlarged; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2015). 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the focus of Tov's interest moved to the importance of the Septuagint for biblical scholarship, both for textual and literary criticism. In several books, the Septuagint reflects a Hebrew basis that needs to be taken into consideration in the exegesis of those books beyond small details, both when, according to Tov, the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint preceded the Masoretic Text (Joshua, 1 Samuel 16–18, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.) and when it serves as an exegetical layer reacting to the forerunner of the Masoretic Text (1 Kings, Esther, and Daniel). According to Tov, in all these books the exegete of the Hebrew books must take the Greek translation into consideration. A precondition for this procedure is that the analysis of the translation technique as described in the previous paragraph will have established that the Septuagint is a good source for analyzing the text that lay in front of him. From among all the early witnesses of the biblical text, the best ones for analyzing the stages of its literary development are the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, a few Qumran texts and the Samaritan Pentateuch. Tov believes that the analysis of early witnesses such as the Septuagint enriches our exegesis and helps us in understanding the last stages of the development of the biblical literature in specific books.

===Development of the Bible text===

Emanuel Tov does not describe the development of the biblical text based on abstract theories, but tries to take the evidence of the ancient manuscripts and versions as his point of departure. It is clear that in antiquity many versions of the Bible were circulating, as is evident from the textual plurality at Qumran. All the manuscripts differed from one another, but within that plurality one may recognize some groups (families). Tov  qualified this plurality by providing  the internal statistics of the different types of the Qumran scrolls. He also described the socio-religious background of some groups of the Judean Desert scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;See items 171 and 178 in Tov's bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important link in this argumentation is the group of the so-called 4QReworked Pentateuch texts.  Ten years after Tov published this group of  documents
,&lt;ref&gt;Together with S. A. White: “4QReworked Pentateuchb–e and 4QTemple?“ in H. Attridge et al., in consultation with J. VanderKam, Qumran Cave 4.VIII, Parabiblical Texts, Part 1 (DJD XIII; Oxford:  
Clarendon, 1994) 187–351, 459–63 and plates XIII–XXXXVI&lt;/ref&gt;  he realized that these texts do not reflect a single non-biblical rewritten Pentateuch composition, but  a cluster of biblical texts that included many exegetical elements. These texts reflect a link in the series of developing biblical texts. 
&lt;ref&gt;See items 206a and 216 in Tovs bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tov's studies on the Septuagint and 4QReworked Pentateuch led him to new thoughts regarding the development of the last stages of the biblical books and the original text of these books. In his view, the early stages of the biblical books such as reflected in the Septuagint of 1 Samuel, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, show that the formulations of these books developed stage by stage. This reconstructed development makes it difficult to posit an original text of the biblical books. In Tov's view, there was not one original text, but a series of “original texts.” This view developed after the appearance of the second edition of his  Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible (2001) and was emphasized more in
the third edition (2012).
&lt;ref&gt;See “The Many Forms of Scripture: Reflections in Light of the LXX and 4QReworked Pentateuch,” in From Qumran to Aleppo: A Discussion with Emanuel Tov about the Textual History of Jewish Scriptures in Honor of his 65th Birthday (ed. A. Lange et al.; FRLANT 230; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2009) 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The development of the text of the Torah===
In studies primarily carried out in the 2010s, Tov focused on the
special textual status of the Torah.
&lt;ref&gt;See items 210, 224,
244, 260, 261, 264, 283, 290 in the bibliography in the website&lt;/ref&gt;
In his view, the textual development of the Torah differed from that
of all other Scripture books, probably because of its popularity.
The Masoretic Text reflects the presumed original text better than
all other preserved texts, all of which reflect more secondary
elements than MT, especially the one-time joined tradition of the
Samaritan Pentateuch and the LXX. Further, the number of the 
non-Masoretic textual branches in the Torah is much larger than in
all other Scripture books.

===Dead Sea Scrolls and the Qumran scribes===

Emanuel Tov dealt with various aspects of the Qumran scrolls, but his most central publications pertain to the Qumran scribes. In 2004, he published a detailed monograph on the scribal practices reflected in the Qumran scrolls,   suggesting that the information about these scribal practices allows us to obtain a better understanding of the Qumran scrolls. 
&lt;ref&gt;Scribal Practices and Approaches Reflected in the Texts Found in the Judean Desert (STDJ 54; Leiden/Boston: E. J. Brill, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;
This monograph describes the technical aspects of all the Judean Desert texts, such as the measurements of the columns and sheets, the beginnings and ends of scrolls, systems of correcting mistakes, orthography systems, and a classification of the scrolls according to these parameters.

An important part of this description is Tov's theory on the Qumran scribes. Since 1986, Tov has suggested the division of the Qumran scrolls into two groups distinguished by external features. Group 1 is written in a special spelling (forms like ki’), specials linguistic forms (like malkehemah, me’odah), and special scribal habits (writing the divine name in the old Hebrew script, erasing elements with lines and writing cancellation dots above and below words and letters, writing dots in the margins guiding the drawing of the lines, etc.). The great majority of the Qumran sectarian scrolls belong to this group; hence Tov's suggestion that these scrolls were written by sectarian scribes, possibly at Qumran. These scribes copied biblical as well as extra-biblical scrolls, altogether one-third of the Qumran scrolls, while the other scrolls (group 2) were brought to Qumran from outside, from one or more localities.
&lt;ref&gt;For the latest formulation of this view, see item 13 in list 4 below, "Books Authored" (Scribal Practices)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer-assisted research of the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls===

Emanuel Tov believes that the examination of the Bible and Dead Sea Scrolls needs to be aided by computer-assisted research and that therefore databases and computer programs need to be developed. He supervised the electronic encoding of the Leningrad Codex in the 1980s.
&lt;ref&gt;This encoding was published among others in: JPS Hebrew–English Tanakh: The Traditional Hebrew Text and the New JPS Translation (2d. ed.; Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, he also embarked upon a research project together with Prof. Robert A. Kraft of the University of Pennsylvania (CATSS = Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint Studies). That project, based in Philadelphia and Jerusalem, created a comparative database of all the words in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint. It was published as a module within the Accordance program (subsequently also within Bible Works and Logos). With the aid of that program, which allows for advanced searches and statistical research, several such investigations have been carried out by Tov and others.
&lt;ref&gt;
For a listing, see Tov's website under bibliography, CATSS
&lt;/ref&gt;
Another database edited by Tov contains all the texts and images of the para-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls, in the original languages and in translation, with morphological analysis and search programs.  All these programs serve the international community.

'''FringePedia''' is a [[wiki]]-powered online [[encyclopedia]] of information regarding the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''. Launched on July 23, 2008 by Dennis Acevedo,&lt;ref name="fringepediaabout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fringepedia.net/wiki/FringePedia_-_The_FRINGE_wiki:About|title=FringePedia:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=FringePedia|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140623232342/http://fringepedia.net/wiki/Fringepedia:About|archive-date=23 June 2014|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2011-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the site uses [[MediaWiki]] software to maintain a user-created database of information. It is the largest, fan-generated, online encyclopedia for ''Fringe'', and is intended to be the most comprehensive source data about the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/08/fringepedia/ |title=Fringe Gets Its Own ‘Pedia,’ New Promo Posters |date=5 February 2009|last=Scott Lewinski|first=John|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is not affiliated with Warner Bros. Entertainment, Bad Robot Productions, FB2 Films Inc., DC Comics/Wildstorm, or any other persons or organizations responsible for the production, promotion or distribution of ''Fringe''.&lt;ref name=fringepediaabout/&gt;

==History==
Designed by Dennis Acevedo, the website was launched on 23 July 2008, one day after ''Fringe'' was originally screened at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]. Acevedo created the site to allow fans to "organize, read, better understand and better enjoy the extensive amount of information" presented during the popular science-fiction saga.

==Impact==
Five months after its launch, Andrew Hanson from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' recommended FringePedia as a "pool of collective knowledge" that's "fun for everyone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/12/fringe-web-surf.html |title='FRINGE': Web-surfing for 'Fringe'-fanatics |date=2008-12-10|last=Hanson|first=Andrew|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, ''Into the Looking Glass: Exploring the Worlds of Fringe'' author Sarah Clarke Stuart referred to FringePedia as the "main" wiki site for fans, explaining that the site is "reliable in its archiving of episodes and episode transcripts." However, Clarke Stuart did criticize FringePedia for not keeping its homepage announcements up-to-date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDj4aMpiT8YC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=friday+death+slot&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kb8uT830Nann0QH738DqCg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Into the Looking Glass: Exploring the Worlds of Fringe |last=Clarke Stuart |first=Sarah |publisher=ECW Press |year=2011 |isbn=1-77041-051-1 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics''''', commonly referred to as the '''Blue Bible''' or '''Goodman &amp; Gilman''', is a [[textbook]] of [[pharmacology]] originally authored by [[Louis S. Goodman]] and [[Alfred Gilman, Sr.|Alfred Gilman]]. First published in 1941, the book is in its twelfth edition (as of 2011), and has the reputation of being the "bible of pharmacology". The readership of this book include physicians of all therapeutic and surgical specialties, clinical pharmacologists, clinical research professionals and pharmacists.

While teaching jointly in the [[Yale School of Medicine]]'s Department of Pharmacology, Goodman and Gilman began developing a course textbook that emphasized relationships between [[pharmacodynamics]] and [[pharmacotherapy]], introduced recent pharmacological advances like [[sulfa drugs]], and discussed the history of drug development.&lt;ref name="Ritchie"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ritchie |first=Murdoch |authorlink=J.

Although rapid pharmacological innovations were made in the years immediately following—including the introduction of [[chemotherapy]], [[steroids]], [[antibiotics]], and [[antihistamines]]—a second edition could not be completed until 1955 because of the authors' service in World War II.&lt;ref name="Altman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritchie" /&gt; Thereafter, the text was revised every five years in collaboration with a large number of specialist coauthors.&lt;ref name="Ritchie" /&gt; 

Gilman and Goodman remained the book's lead editors for the first five editions; Gilman remained an editor through the sixth edition, and Goodman through the seventh, which was published shortly after Gilman's death in 1984. [[Alfred Goodman Gilman]], the son of Alfred Gilman and winner of the 1994 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology]], joined as senior editor for the book's sixth, seventh, and eighth editions, and a contributing editor to the ninth and tenth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.1996.03540120077042| title = Goodman and Gilman's the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics| journal = JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association| volume = 276| issue = 12| pages = 999| year = 1996| last1 = Hastings | first1 = R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2989">'''Graphic training aids''' ('''GTAs''') are publications that assist during the conduct of training and the process of learning.

Current Training Aids come in different forms, including [[physical model|model]]s, displays, [[presentation slide|slide]]s, [[book]]s, [[picture]]s and media presentations.

During [[World War II]], Graphic Training Aids were in high demand. Large quantities of young men were recruited which demanded a higher rate of training. A large replica of an [[M1 Garand]] rifle would be presented in front of a class. During his presentation, the trainer would use it as a reference.{{fact|date=June 2010}} Printed media was also used in the form of [[exploded view drawing]]s, which depicted various parts of rifles.

A curious form of a Graphic Training Aid was used during the [[Vietnam War]], in the form of a [[comic book]]. The Graphic Training Aid, called M16A1 Operation and Preventive Maintenance, explained the proper maintenance of an [[M16 rifle]] and was highly effective since it was targeted at the young [[infantry]] men and illustrated by the popular comic book artist, [[Will Eisner]]. 

United States Army Graphic Training Aids, Field Manuals and other training media are produced by organizations such as the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC), the [[Army Training Support Center]] (ATSC), G3 and the Training Aids Service Center (TASC).

Other forms of Graphic Training Aids exist as well. The vast majority of Training Aids exist for non-military training such as safety training and work training. Such guides are produced by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].

The (c. 230) '''''Guangya''''' ({{zh|c=廣雅/广雅|p='''Guǎngyǎ'''|w='''Kuang Ya'''}}; "Expanded ''[Er]ya''") was an early 3rd-century CE [[Chinese dictionary]], edited by [[Zhang Yi (Cao Wei)|Zhang Yi]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. It was later called the '''''Boya''''' (博雅; ''Bóyǎ''; ''Po-ya''; "Broadened [Er]ya") owing to [[naming taboo]] on Yang Guang (楊廣), which was the birth name of [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]. 

Zhang Yi wrote the ''Guangya'' as a supplement to the centuries older ''[[Erya]]'' dictionary. He used the same 19 chapter divisions into lexical categories, and numerous ''Guangya'' entries are abstract words under the first three chapters ''Shigu'' (釋詁 "Explaining Old Words"), ''Shiyan'' (釋言 "Explaining Words"), and ''Shixun'' (釋訓 "Explaining Instructions"). Based upon entries in the ''Guangya'' biological chapters, [[Joseph Needham]] et al. (1986: 192) say most are original and different, showing little overlap with ''Erya'' entries, so that Zhang Yi almost doubled the 334 plants and trees in the classic dictionary.

The [[Qing Dynasty]] philologist [[Wang Niansun]] spent a decade studying this dictionary, and his ''Guangya shuzheng'' (廣雅疏證 "''Guangya'' Annotations and Proofs") is still considered the authoritative edition, in which he demonstrated the important philological principle of "looking for the ancient meaning by considering the ancient sound ... not constrained by the structure of the character" (就古音以求古義......不限形體). His preface notes the ''Guangya'' has 2343 entries and a total of 18,150 characters (the received text has 17,326), including corrections and emendations, which is about 5000 more than the received ''Erya''. The linguist Zhou Fagao edited an index (1977) to the ''Guangya''.

The '''''Historical Dictionary of American Slang''''', often abbreviated '''''HDAS''''', is a [[dictionary]] of American [[slang]].  The first two volumes, ''Volume 1, A – G'' (1994), and ''Volume 2, H – O'' (1997), were published by [[Random House]], and the work then was known as the '''''Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang''''', sometimes abbreviated as '''''RHHDAS'''''.  Both volumes used the same ISBN, {{ISBN|0-394-54427-7}}; the paperback editions are {{ISBN|978-0-394-54427-4}} for Volume 1 and {{ISBN|978-0-679-43464-1}} for Volume 2.

When Random House discontinued publication, [[Oxford University Press]] announced in 2003 that it would publish the two remaining volumes, ''Volume 3, P – S [Part 1]'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-517418-2}}, and ''Volume 4, S [Part 2] – Z''. &lt;ref name="oup"&gt;{{cite web| title=Historical Dictionary of American Slang: Project History|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oup.com/us/collections/slang/history/?view=usa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017212817/http://www.oup.com/us/collections/slang/history/?view=usa|archive-date=2012-10-17|access-date=2016-05-17|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2018, however, those volumes have not yet been published.

Each entry includes representative quotations, including the earliest quotation using the word.  HDAS is edited by Jonathan E. Lighter of the [[University of Tennessee]].  It is sometimes compared to ''[[Green's Dictionary of Slang]]'', which takes a generally similar approach but is not focused specifically on American slang.

The ''HDAS'' is not to be confused with the ''DAS'', the ''Dictionary of American Slang'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Dictionary_of_American_slang.html?id=P6MYAAAAIAAJ |title=Dictionary of American slang - Harold Wentworth, Stuart Berg Flexner - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/dictionary/d4ction.html |title=Dictionaries and Works Cited: Dictionary of Newfoundland English |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Humboldt Forum''' is a large-scale museum project in [[Berlin]], Germany, which will have its seat in the reconstructed [[Berlin Palace]], located on the [[Museum Island]].&lt;ref name=guardian2015-04-10&gt;{{Cite web|title = Appointment of Neil MacGregor as head of Humboldt Forum silences critics|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/appointment-of-neil-macgregor-as-head-of-humboldt-forum-silences-critics|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Ben|last = Knight|first2 = Mark|last2 = Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber, which was also located in the Berlin Palace and which was established in the mid 16th century. The Humboldt Forum will incorporate two of the art chamber's successor institutions, the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] and the [[Museum of Asian Art]] (originally the Indian Department of the former). The project, named after the brothers [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alexander]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], aims to be a world centre for culture.&lt;ref name=guardian2015-04-10/&gt; The Humboldt Forum has been described as the "German equivalent" of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/17/neil-macgregor-britain-germany-humboldt-forum-berlin&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil MacGregor]], formerly the Director of the British Museum, was appointed as the founding Director of the Humboldt Forum in 2015.&lt;ref name=guardian2015-04-10/&gt;

==History==
The Humboldt Forum will incorporate two existing museums, the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] and the [[Museum of Asian Art]]. Both have their roots in the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber. The Ancient Prussian Art Chamber was originally established by [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg]] in the mid 16th century, but was nearly destroyed during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648). The art chamber was rebuilt as a magnificent collection by [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], and was moved to the newly extended [[Berlin Palace]] by [[Frederick I of Prussia]] in the early 18th century. The Ethnological Museum opened in 1886 as a successor of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber; the Museum of Asian Art originated as the Indian Department of the Ethnological Museum in 1904. [[Wilhelm von Bode]], the Director-General of the Royal Museums in Berlin, established the Museum of East Asian Art as a separate collection in 1906. In 2006 the Museum of Indian Art and the Museum of East Asian Art were merged to form the Museum of Asian Art. From 2019 the Ethnological Museum and the Museum of Asian Art will both be part of the Humboldt Forum in the Berlin Palace.

On completion in 2019 the City Palace will house the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] and the [[Museum of Asian Art]], as well as two restaurants, a theater, a movie theater and an auditorium. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Berlin Palace Rebuilding Begins 63 Years After Explosion|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-12/berlin-palace-rebuilding-begins-63-years-after-explosion|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Catherine|last = Hickley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is led by a three-member management committee, chaired by founding director [[Neil MacGregor]] and also including the co-directors, archaeologist [[Hermann Parzinger]] and art historian [[Horst Bredekamp]]. The [[Foundation for the Humboldt Forum in the Berlin Palace]] has been set up to create the museum.

Neil MacGregor has proposed to make the museum admission-free, based on the model of the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/berlin-s-ambitious-humboldt-forum-to-explore-world-nature-and-cultures-/ Neil MacGregor unveils plans for Berlin’s ambitious Humboldt Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Much like the British Museum and its controversial holding of the [[Parthenon Marbles]] and other artefacts,
the Humboldt Foundation has been criticised in connection with [[looting]] and [[cultural appropriation]].&lt;ref name="websi"&gt;http://www.no-humboldt21.de/resolution/english/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nolan Ryan in Atlanta close-up.jpg|thumb|Nolan Ryan, the all-time leader in batters walked]]
A [[base on balls]] (BB), also known as a walk, occurs in [[baseball]] when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls ''[[strike zone|balls]]'', and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called [[Out (baseball)|out]].  The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball's Official Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/definition_terms_2.jsp|title=Official Rules|author=|date=|website=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further detail is given in 6.08(a).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp|title=Official Rules|author=|date=|website=Major League Baseball}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, however, considered a faux pas for a [[professional baseball|professional]] player to actually walk to first base; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play.

This is a list of top 100 [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]]s who have allowed the most walks of all time. Nolan Ryan holds the record for walking the most batters in a career with 2,795. Ryan is the only pitcher in [[MLB]] history to walk more than 2,000 batters.

'''''Menckeniana: A Schimpflexikon''''' is a collection of articles and quotations denouncing [[H. L. Mencken]], collected and arranged by Mencken himself, with the assistance of Sara Haardt, his bride-to-be.

The word “schimpflexikon” is from the [[German language]], which Mencken spoke fluently; it means, roughly, a dictionary of vituperation.  

''Menckeniana: A Schimpflexikon'' was printed in a very small quantity by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 1928. A second edition was printed by Octagon Books in 1977.

'''Publishers Note'''
&lt;br /&gt;
"''This collection is not exhaustive, but an effort has been made to keep it representative.
''The original materials would fill many volumes: they include hundreds of savage articles''
''and newspaper editorials, and a number of whole pamphlets. During the single year 1926''
''more than 500 separate editorials upon the sayings and doings of Mr. Mencken were printed''
''in the United States, and at least four-fifths of them were unfavorable. Himself given''
''to somewhat ludicrous utterance, he has probably been denounced more vigorously and at greater length than any other American of his time, not even excepting Henry Ford, Robert''
''M. LaFollette, Clarence Darrow, and Sacco and Vanzetti. Here there is room only to offer
''some salient specimens of this anti-Mencken invective—mainly single sentences or phrases, torn from their incandescent context. Some were chosen for their wit—for there are palpable hits among them!—, some for their blistering ferocity, and some for their charming idiocy.''
''The rest of the material awaits the literary resurrection men of another and perhaps''
''less indignant day.''''''"

'''Chapters'''
&lt;br /&gt;
Zoölogical - Genealogical - Pathological - Freudian Diagnoses - Penalogical - As a Critic - As an Artist - As an Evangelist - As an American - As an Intellectual - As a Journalist - As a Truth-Seeker - As an Editor - As a Statesmen - As a Voluptuary - As a Scoundrel - Kosher or Terefah? - Ex-Cathedra - Counter-Offensive - Winces of the Galled - The Voice of the Motherland - Miscellaneous Elegancies - Verdicts in Brief

'''''Minister of Police v Ewels''''', is an important case in both the [[South African law of delict]] and, to a lesser extent, [[South African criminal law]]. It expresses a general rule: An omission is to be regarded as unlawful conduct when the circumstances of the case are of such a nature not only that the omission incites moral indignation, but also that the legal convictions of the community demand that it be regarded as unlawful and that the damage suffered be made good by the person who neglected to perform a positive act. In order to make a determination as to whether or not there is unlawfulness, therefore, the question is not whether there was the usual "negligence" of the ''bonus paterfamilias''; the question is whether, regard being had to all the facts, there was a duty in law to act reasonably.  
#Saflii Court case [http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/1975/2.html]

''In casu'', a citizen was assaulted in a police station by an off-duty officer in the presence of other officers. It was held by the court, on the facts of this case, that a policeman on duty, if he witnesses an assault, has a duty to come to the assistance of the person being assaulted. The failure of the police to do so made the Minister of Police liable for damages.

'''The National Party''' ({{lang-tr|Ulusal Parti}}) is a [[Turkish nationalism|nationalist]] party in [[Turkey]]. The party was founded by [[Gökçe Fırat Çulhaoğlu]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulusalparti.net/yazilar/genelbaskan.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This party's main idols are [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], [[Doğan Avcıoğlu]] and [[Mirsaid Sultan-Galiev]]. Unlike other socialist parties in Turkey, they often criticise [[Marxism]] for being [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentrist]]. They describe [[Kemalism]] as [[socialism]] with Turkish characteristics. They also idolize socialist, [[Third-Worldism|third worldist]] and [[Left-wing nationalism|left-wing nationalist]] leaders like [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[Patrice Lumumba]].

This party supports Turkish nationalism against [[imperialism]] and [[separatism]], socialism against [[capitalism]], and [[secularism]] against [[fundamentalism]].

Despite this party mainly supports [[Civic nationalism|civic]] and [[Cultural nationalism|cultural]] kind of nationalism, they also have [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] tendencies. They support an aggressive [[Foreign relations of Turkey|foreign policy]] against [[Armenia]] and [[Greece]]. They are against any alliance with [[NATO]], the [[European Union]], [[China]] or [[Russia]]. They are in favour of a Turkic union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulusalparti.org.tr/yazilar/soylesi4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

They are often accused of being [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]] and [[Racism|racist]] in [[Turkey–PKK conflict|Kurdish issue]], because of mottos like ''there is not a Kurdish problem but a Kurdish invasion'', ''I trade with Turks, therefore my money doesn't flow to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]'', ''save your cities from invasion'' (of Kurds), etc. However Gökçe Fırat claims, [[Kurds|Kurdish ethnicity]] and [[Kurdish language|language]] are artificial, which were created by imperialist powers, especially [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] and [[British Empire]]. He's also said, ''for us, in Turkey there is only and one nation and it's Turkish nation. We don't recognise any other ethnic and national identities. That's why we don't discriminate anyone, we see every citizen as Turks''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulusalparti.org.tr/yazilar/soylesi3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The party publishes [[Turkish Left|Türksolu]] and İleri.

'''Numbeo''' is a [[crowd-sourced]] global database of reported [[consumer price index|consumer prices]], perceived [[crime rate]]s, quality of [[health care]], among other statistics.

== Description ==
Numbeo is a collaborative online database which enables users to share and compare information about the cost of living between countries and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ICAEW|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/human-resources/cost-of-living-comparisons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Numbeo website is operated by Numbeo doo, company registered in [[Serbia]]. The founder of Numbeo is an ex-[[Google]] software engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Numbeo|url=http://www.numbeo.com/common/about.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Numbeo was founded in April 2009 by Mladen Adamovic. Originally it was a website for crowd-sourced price comparison, but later in 2011 it started to collect data about crime, pollution, health care, and traffic.

== Popularity ==
Numbeo was mentioned or used as a source in hundreds of major newspapers around the world, including ''[[Forbes]]'', ''[[Business Insider]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[BBC]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[China Daily]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Numbeo in the news|url=http://www.numbeo.com/common/in_the_news.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbeo claims to be the biggest website of its kind with more than 1.3 million data collected as of August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Numbeo number of data|url=http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]'s ranking in August 2014, Numbeo.com was among the top 10,000 websites (ranked by traffic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexa|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/numbeo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Columnist Alistair Walsh suggested in an article written for the website Property Observer, that Numbeo's information is based on what people say and should be taken with grain of salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PropertyObserver|url=http://www.propertyobserver.com.au/international/harare-has-poor-healthcare-and-political-violence-but-property-is-relatively-inexpensive/2012082956292}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no third party check or audit on the accuracy of data. Comparison against other international city data sources suggests Numbeo is often very inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=229 Low Cost Cities Around the World: Data Sources|url=https://raywoodcockslatest.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/123-low-cost-cities/#Oxpat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Jenyns Book.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Thomas Jenyns' Book, an English ordinary of arms compiled in c.1398. This page shows a sequence of coats of arms featuring [[Lion (heraldry)|lions rampant]]. British Library, Add. MS 40851.]]
An '''ordinary of arms''' (or simply an '''ordinary''') is a [[Roll of arms|roll]] or register of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical [[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinaries]] and [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]]s) grouped together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Julian |last1=Franklyn |first2=John |last2=Tanner |title=An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Heraldry |place=Oxford |publisher=Pergamon |year=1970 |page=246 |ISBN=0080132979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Friar |title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry |place=Sherborne |publisher=Alphabooks |year=1987 |page=260 |ISBN=0906670446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of an ordinary is to facilitate the identification of the bearer of a coat of arms from visual evidence alone. 

Ordinaries may take a form which is either graphic (consisting of a series of painted or drawn images of shields) or written (consisting of [[blazon]]s – verbal descriptions – of the coats). Most [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] manuscript ordinaries were graphic, whereas all the principal modern published ordinaries have been written. A knowledge of the technicalities of blazon is essential for the student hoping to make best use of a written ordinary.

By extension, ordinaries may also be compiled of other elements of heraldic display, such as [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]s, [[supporter]]s or [[Heraldic badge|badge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock and Robinson 1988, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ordinaries of arms have been compiled since the 14th century, the actual term seems to have come into use only in the 18th century. The earliest clear attestation is found in [[Joseph Edmondson|Edmondson]]'s ''Complete Body of Heraldry'' of 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|ordinary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and early modern ordinaries==
[[File:Jenyn's Ordinary circa 1360.png|thumb|right|Extract from William Jenyn's Ordinary of c.1360, showing two pages of arms featuring [[Roundel (heraldry)|roundels]] and [[Annulet (heraldry)|annulets]]]]
The ordinary appears to have been an English development of the 14th century. No medieval ordinaries are known from continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1950, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval English ordinaries include "[[Robert Cooke (officer of arms)|Cooke]]'s Ordinary", compiled in c.1340 (644 coats),&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1950, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox06"&gt;Fox 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; "Cotgrave's Ordinary", also of c.1340 but in blazon (556 coats),&lt;ref name="Fox06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1950, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and the larger "Thomas Jenyns' Book", compiled in c.1398 (1,595 coats).&lt;ref name="Fox06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1950, pp. 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt; These three are all related, and perhaps derive from a lost progenitor. An independent work is "William Jenyns' Ordinary", compiled in c.1360 (1,612 coats).&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1950, pp. 69–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 16th century, [[Thomas Wriothesley]], [[Garter King of Arms]], planned a comprehensive painted roll and ordinary of all English arms: this was not completed, but parts of the ordinary survive in what is now known as "[[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Prince Arthur]]'s Book" of c.1520.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1957, pp. 258–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell and Steer 1988, pp. 387–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock and Robinson 1988, colour plate 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century, [[Robert Glover (officer of arms)|Robert Glover]], [[Somerset Herald]], drew on a wide range of medieval sources to compile "Glover's Ordinary", the fullest and most authoritative ordinary to date. This was assembled in its first form in 1584, and contained some 15,000 coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb |id=10833 |title=Glover, Robert (1543/4–1588) |first=Nigel |last=Ramsay |origyear=2004 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 17th century, [[Augustine Vincent]], [[Rouge Croix Pursuivant]] and later [[Windsor Herald]], compiled "Vincent's Ordinary", also of about 15,000 shields, drawn in trick.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell and Steer 1988, pp. 409–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of Glover's Ordinary, much augmented, were published in [[Joseph Edmondson]]'s ''Complete Body of Heraldry'' (1780) and in [[William Berry (genealogist)|William Berry]]'s ''Encyclopedia Heraldica'' (1828). Cotgrave's Ordinary was published in 1829, edited by Sir [[Nicholas Harris Nicolas|Harris Nicolas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=A Roll of Arms compiled in the reign of King Edward III, and apparently between the years 1337–1350 |title=Rolls of Arms of the Reigns of Henry III and Edward III |editor-first=Sir Harris |editor-last=Nicolas |editor-link=Nicholas Harris Nicolas |publisher=William Pickering |place=London |year=1829 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Rolls_of_arms_of_the_reigns_of_Henry_iii.html?id=B2gFAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern ordinaries==
===Papworth===
[[File:Papworth Ordinary 3.jpg|thumb|right|Extract from Papworth's ''Ordinary'' (1874)]]
The principal modern ordinary of British and Irish heraldry, still not entirely superseded, is "Papworth's ''Ordinary''" (1874), or in full ''An Alphabetical Dictionary of Coats of Arms belonging to Families in Great Britain and Ireland, forming an extensive Ordinary of British Armorials upon an entirely new plan'', compiled by [[John Woody Papworth]]. Papworth began work in 1847, making extensive use of [[Bernard Burke|Burke]]'s ''General Armory'' (first published 1842; third edition with supplement 1847), copying its entries – which were arranged alphabetically by surname – onto slips of paper and rearranging them.&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1942, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He published a prospectus in 1857, and began to issue his work in [[Serial (literature)|instalment]]s shortly afterwards: nine parts had appeared by 1863, and fourteen by the time of his early death (apparently hastened by his insistent commitment to work on the project) in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1942, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; By this point the work had proceeded as far as page 696: the remaining 429 pages were edited and brought to completion from Papworth's materials by Alfred William Morant (1828–1881). The ''Ordinary'', containing about 50,000 entries, was published as a complete volume in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1942, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It rapidly established itself as a standard work of reference, and was reprinted in 1961, 1977 and 1985.

The great strength of Papworth's ''Ordinary'' was the rigorousness of its system of classification by blazon, which (with minor modifications) has remained the basis for all ordinaries published since: there was only one possible place for any particular coat of arms to be entered within it.&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1942, pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For further details, see {{cite book |first=T. |last=Woodcock |authorlink=Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms) |chapter=Structure of the Ordinary |editor1-first=T. |editor1-last=Woodcock |editor1-link=Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms) |editor2-first=Sarah |editor2-last=Flower |title=Dictionary of British Arms: Medieval Ordinary |volume=4 |place=London |publisher=Society of Antiquaries |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-85431-297-9 |pages=ix–xv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its weakness was its dependence for its contents on Burke's ''General Armory'' and other [[secondary source]]s, which meant that it inherited many of their errors and omissions. One of the oddities of the book (and therefore of some of its successors), which resulted in part from Papworth's decision to classify animal [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] of all kinds under the primary heading "Beast", and birds of all kinds under "Bird", is that the alphabetical distribution of entries is highly unbalanced: the headings A–F account for roughly 80% of the whole, a point on which the editor had to reassure subscribers while the work was still in progress.&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1942, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dictionary of British Arms''===
In 1926 [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt Col]] George Babington Croft Lyons left a substantial bequest to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] to prepare a revised and improved edition of Papworth. [[Anthony Wagner]] became co-general editor in 1940 and sole general editor in 1944, remaining in that position until 1995. A number of volunteers were recruited (some of them, during the [[World War II|war years]], working in inactive periods of [[Fire lookout|firewatching]] duties) to assemble material on [[index card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sir Anthony |last=Wagner |authorlink=Anthony Wagner |chapter=Hugh Stanford London (1884–1959) |editor-first=Hugh Stanford |editor-last=London |title=The Life of William Bruges, the first Garter King of Arms |series=[[Harleian Society]] |publisher=Harleian Society |place=London |year=1970 |volume=111–12 |pages=xiv–xv }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the task was a large one and progress slow, in part because of Wagner's insistence on high scholarly standards and use of [[primary source]]s, and in part because of over-ambitious plans to include in the final work a series of essays on medieval armorial families. It was eventually decided to limit the project to England, to the medieval period (pre-1530), and to publish a simple ordinary, including a name-index but without the additional essays. With the aid of computer technology, the first volume of what was now entitled the ''Dictionary of British Arms'' appeared in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D.H.B. |last=Chesshyre |authorlink=Hubert Chesshyre |chapter=History of the Project |editor1-first=D.H.B. |editor1-last=Chesshyre |editor1-link=Hubert Chesshyre |editor2-first=Thomas |editor2-last=Woodcock |editor2-link=Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms) |title=Dictionary of British Arms: Medieval Ordinary |volume=1 |place=London |publisher=Society of Antiquaries |year=1992 |isbn=0854312587 |pages=viii–xiv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 2 was published in 1996, volume 3 in 2009, and volume 4 (the final volume) in 2014.

===Scotland===
{{main|Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland}}
''An Ordinary of Arms'' for [[Scotland]], edited by Sir [[James Balfour Paul]], [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], was published in 1893, with a second updated edition appearing in 1903: this includes all arms recorded in the [[Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland]] from its inception in 1672 down to the end of 1901 (5,532 entries, with a name index).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sir James Balfour |last=Paul |authorlink=James Balfour Paul |title=An Ordinary of Arms contained in the Public Register of all Arms and Bearings in Scotland |edition=2nd |place=Edinburgh |publisher=William Green &amp; Sons |year=1903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second volume, covering arms entered in the Register from 1902 to 1973 (a further 6,040 entries), was published in 1977: this was edited by David Reid of Robertland, [[Carrick Pursuivant]], and Vivien Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Reid |editor2-first=Vivien |editor2-last=Wilson |title=An Ordinary of Arms contained in the Public Register of all Arms and Bearings in Scotland, 1902–1973 |volume=2 |place=Edinburgh |publisher=H.M.S.O. |year=1977 |isbn=0-9505299-0-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''An Ordinary of Scottish Arms from Original pre-1672 Manuscripts'', edited by Eilean Malden, John Malden (sometime [[Unicorn Pursuivant]]) and William G. Scott, was published in 2016. This contains both an armory (arranged alphabetically by surname) and an ordinary of some 25,000 coats of arms, drawing on the evidence of medieval rolls of arms and other pre-1672 manuscript sources, but excluding that of [[Seal (emblem)|seals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Eilean |editor1-last=Malden |editor2-first=John |editor2-last=Malden |editor3-first=William G. |editor3-last=Scott |title=An Ordinary of Scottish Arms from Original pre-1672 Manuscripts |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Heraldry Society of Scotland |year=2016 |isbn=9780952525899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
"An Ordinary of Welsh Arms", covering [[Wales|Welsh]] arms, crests, badges and supporters down to c.1630 (about 2,800 entries and a name index) forms the greater part of volume 3 of ''The Development of Welsh Heraldry'' by [[Michael Siddons|Michael Powell Siddons]], published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael Powell |last=Siddons |authorlink=Michael Siddons |title=The Development of Welsh Heraldry |publisher=National Library of Wales |place=Aberystwyth |volume=3 |year=1993 |isbn=090715851X |pages=1–170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A supplementary ordinary down to c.1700 (a further 1,200 entries) is included in volume 4, published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael Powell |last=Siddons |authorlink=Michael Siddons |title=The Development of Welsh Heraldry |publisher=National Library of Wales |place=Aberystwyth |volume=4 |year=2006 |isbn=1862250448 |pages=267–358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suffolk===
''A Dictionary of [[Suffolk]] Arms'' edited by Joan Corder (an ordinary of arms, containing about 6,700 entries and a name-index) was published by the [[Suffolk Records Society]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Joan |editor-last=Corder |title=A Dictionary of Suffolk Arms |series=Suffolk Records Society |volume=7 |publisher=Suffolk Records Society |place=Ipswich |year=1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A companion volume by the same editor, ''A Dictionary of Suffolk Crests'' (containing some 25,000 entries for [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], arranged in "ordinary" form, together with a name-index), was published by the same society in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Joan |editor-last=Corder |title=A Dictionary of Suffolk Crests: heraldic crests of Suffolk families |series=Suffolk Records Society |volume=40 |publisher=Suffolk Records Society |place=Woodbridge |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Garter's Ordinaries"===
An important modern unpublished ordinary is the collection known as "Garter's Ordinaries", now held at the [[College of Arms]]. This was originally compiled by and under the direction of Sir [[Albert Woods]], [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King of Arms]], between 1842 and his death in 1904, and was then donated to the College by his grandson, [[Gerald Wollaston|Gerald Woods Wollaston]]. At that time it comprised two series, one of five and the other of six volumes, plus indexes. Subsequent Garters have added to the series and kept the ordinary up to date by including within it new [[Grant of arms|grants of arms]]. The ordinary remains in use by the members of the College, both for identifying old coats of arms, and for ensuring that new grants are sufficiently differenced from existing coats.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner 1952, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sample library''' is a collection of digital [[sound recordings]], known as [[Sampling (music)|samples]], for use by  composers, arrangers, performers, and producers of [[music]]. The sound files are loaded into a [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]—either hardware or software-based—which is then used to create music. Sample libraries appear in a variety of forms:

* As a tempo-based [[Phrase (music)|musical phrase]] that can be [[Loop (music)|looped]] (repeated in tempo with the arrangement), or edited in a [[cut and paste]] collage fashion.
* Collections of note-by-note recordings of [[musical instrument]]s for playback on a digital sampler, known as '''multi-samples'''. This method of sample playback is to construct a playable instrument, or emulation of another instrument, from a sampler or computer.
* One-shot hits or stabs of non-tempo-based audio, particularly for [[sound effect]]s.

The term sample library, when used in a commercial context, implies a collections of samples that have been produced and licensed for the purpose of being used as samples. Such a library, sometimes called a '''sample pack''', can be distributed either physically (on CD or DVD) or over the internet. Some sampling websites, such as [[The Freesound Project]], utilize user-generated sample libraries.

Individual '''sample packs''' can often be found in online libraries or website directories that host the files (free or paid) for download. It is important to know if the samples being utilized are [[royalty-free]] or having certain usage restrictions (such as not being allowed in commercial content) when downloading these files. Usually this is stated in the usage rights of the pack or under the Terms of Service on the website they were downloaded from.

==Tretyakov Gallery==
In 1851, Tretyakov and his brother [[Pavel Tretyakov]] acquired a property on the right bank of the [[Moskva River]] to use as offices, also using the building to house their art collection, which became known as the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].&lt;ref name="open"/&gt; Sergei's collection was smaller than his brother's, but also very valuable. The first work to be added to his collection was [[Alexey Bogolyubov]]'s ''Ipatievsky Monastery near Kostroma''.&lt;ref name="10facts"/&gt; He later began collecting primarily works from Western European artists, especially French romantics and realists.&lt;ref name="10facts"/&gt;

On Sergei's death in 1892, both brothers' collections were donated to the Moscow city administrators.&lt;ref name="donation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Donation of the Tretyakov Gallery to Moscow City 1892-1898|url=http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/museum/history/gallery/1892_1898/|website=Tretyakov Gallery|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="open"/&gt; The brothers' combined collections consisted of 1,287 paintings, 518 drawings and 9 sculptures by Russian artists, along with 75 paintings and eight drawings by European artists, mainly French and German masters of the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="donation"/&gt; The value of the donated collections was estimated at 1,429,000 roubles.&lt;ref name="donation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="open"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Meyer|editor1-first=Andrea|editor2-last=Savoy|editor2-first=Benedicte|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums|date=1 January 2014|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=154|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Sergei+Mikhailovich+Tretyakov+gallery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnudrwx-PRAhWHaxQKHSmOBBIQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sergei%20Mikhailovich%20Tretyakov%20gallery&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city converted the brothers' private showroom into a gallery accessible to the public,&lt;ref name="open"/&gt; free of charge.&lt;ref name="10facts"/&gt; The official opening of the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov, as it was then named, took place on 15 August 1893, with over 700 visitors on the first day.&lt;ref name="10facts"/&gt;

The '''''Synecdemus''''' or '''''Synekdemos''''' ({{lang-el|Συνέκδημος}}) is a geographic text, attributed to [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]], which contains a table of administrative divisions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and lists of their cities. The work is dated to the reign of [[Justinian]] but prior to 535, as it divides the 912 listed cities in the Empire among 64 [[Eparchy|Eparchies]]. The ''Synecdemus'', along with the work of [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] were the principal sources of [[Constantine VII]]'s work on the Themes (''De Thematibus''). 

The ''Synecdemus'' was published in various editions beginning in 1735, notably by [[Gustav Parthey]] (''Hieroclis Synecdemus''; Berlin, 1866) and slightly later in a corrected text by A. Burckhardt in the [[Teubner]] series.&lt;ref name="(Grammarian.)East)1893"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hierocles (Grammarian.)|author2=Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (Emperor of the East)|first3=August |last3=Burckhardt|title=Hieroclis Synecdemus: accedunt fragmenta apud Constantinum Porphyrogennetum servata et nomina urbium mutata|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=HIITK93F54wC}}|year=1893|publisher=in aedibus B.G.

'''''The Oxford Companion to Wine''''' ('''''OCW''''') is a book in the [[Book series|series]] of [[Oxford Companions]] published by [[Oxford University Press]]. The book provides an alphabetically arranged reference to [[wine]], compiled and edited by [[Jancis Robinson]], with contributions by several wine writers including [[Hugh Johnson (wine)|Hugh Johnson]], [[Michael Broadbent]], and [[James Halliday (wine)|James Halliday]],&lt;ref name=wd-jan&gt;{{cite web|last= Kissack |first= Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title= Wine Books: Jancis Robinson |url= http://www.thewinedoctor.com/otherresources/robinson.shtml |accessdate= 2013-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and experts such as [[viticulture|viticulturist]] [[Richard Smart (viticulturalist)|Richard Smart]] and [[oenology|oenologist]] [[Pascal Ribéreau-Gayon]].&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

The contract for the first edition was signed in 1988, and after five years of writing it was published in 1994.&lt;ref name="Gremolata interview"&gt;Jolley, Malcolm, gremolata.com [http://gremolata.com/jancis.htm Jancis Robinson Interview], accessed on April 4, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026013648/http://gremolata.com/jancis.htm |date=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition was published in 1999 and the third in 2006. The fourth edition, published in 2015, contains nearly 4,000 entries (300 of them completely new) over about 850 pages with contributions from 187 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Entries for individuals are limited by the strict criteria of "a long track record" and "global significance"; hence French worldwide consulting oenologist [[Michel Rolland]] and even Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] have entries, while California oenologist [[Helen Turley]] is omitted.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; Also, there is no entry for Jancis Robinson herself.

[[Eric Asimov]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' has noted that with the wine world's increasing rate of evolution, "this encyclopedic work keeps pace with new information on issues like climate change, biodynamic viticulture and globalization, and emerging wine regions like Canada and eastern Europe".&lt;ref name=NYT-eaocw/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3353">'''''The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire''''' is a [[book]] about the small [[nation]]s of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Soviet Union]], and the Russia and some other [[post-Soviet states]] of today.  It was published in [[Estonian (language)|Estonian]] in 1991 and in English in 2001.

The foreword of the book explains the book's approach by saying, "the authors of the present book, who come from a country (Estonia) which has shared the fate of nations in the Russian and Soviet empires, endeavour to publicize the plight of the small nations whose very existence is threatened as a result of recent history."

==Described peoples==
The authors' intention for the book was to include the peoples according to the following criteria:

* are not yet extinct,
* whose main area of settlement is on ex-Soviet territory,
* whose numbers are below 30,000,

[[Image:Variety Unit, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Variety Unit&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Variety Unit''' is an exhibit building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]].

==History==
Variety Unit is the only structure at Shelburne Museum that is original to the site. Built in 1835, the building was originally known as the Weed House, but was renamed Variety Unit to reflect the wide range of [[decorative arts]] exhibited there.

==Architecture==
The original brick structure, with its front-gable orientation and fully articulated pediment, reflects the style of [[Greek Revival architecture]] popular in the mid-19th century. However, the complex rambling interior composed of a series of one and two-room additions, constructed over time as the occupants required more space, embodies the [[New England]] tradition of "continuous architecture."

==Variety Unit collections==

===Glass===
Shelburne Museum's glass collection numbers nearly two thousand pieces dating from 1750 to 1900 and includes free-blown flasks, window glass, and mold-blown bottles and flasks; pattern glass plates, serving dishes and decorative piecesl colorful canes, rolling pins, marbles, "witch balls" and other whimseys; and miniature glass doll dishes. The Garrison collection of American pattern glass goblets includes eleven hundred patterns. In addition the collection includes a wide range of patent medicine and apothecary bottles.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. ''Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections''. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceramics===
The finest ceramics in the Museum's collection include over 200 pieces of 19th-century English [[mochaware]], several of which are recent acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=4&lt;/ref&gt; While the strength of the Shelburne Museum's collection is in utilitarian and fine tablewares, the figural ceramics are also of interest. Staffordshire animal figures, whimsical [[toby jug]]s, and a magnificent pair of Chelsea swans can also be seen in the Variety Unit.

===Dolls and Dollhouses===
Shelburne Museum's European and American dolls include [[bisque doll|bisque]], [[papier-mâché]], [[Parian Ware|Parian]], china, [[wax]], wood and cloth pieces, most of them made between 1760 and 1930. About 400 dolls are on exhibition in Variety Unit in galleries re-designed in 2004 with new lighting and exhibition labels.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"&gt;http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=11&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibited with the dolls are 19th and 20th-century dollhouses; they include an [[English Gothic Revival]] house and the idiosyncratic ''Ramshackle Inn'', a rambling American house with an artist's studio in the attic.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"/&gt;

Many American dolls of the 18th and 19th centuries were made at home of readily available materials, including wood, rags, clay, dried apples, corn husks, bottles and clay pipes. Until World War I, the majority of dolls sold in America were imported from England, France, and Germany. Joel Ellis of [[Springfield, Vermont]] made some of the first commercial American dolls with wooden bodies, patented jointed limbs, and pewter hands and feet. Izannah Walker of [[Rhode Island]] made cloth dolls with hand-painted faces and hair. Examples by both Ellis and Walker can be seen in the Variety Unit.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Not all dolls were playthings. In the late 19th century French dollmakers such as Bru, Jumeau, and Steiner, and German dollmakers such as Kestner and Simon &amp; Halbig – all represented in Shelburne Museum's collection – created elegant bisque-head dolls with large wide glass eyes, thick eyebrows, long lashes, [[cupid's bow]] lips, beautifully coiffed real hair and elaborate dresses of silk and other fine fabrics.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Souvenir and keepsake dolls were popular products in many areas frequented by tourists. Dolls created entirely of different sizes and shapes of shells, for example, come from a number of French and English resort towns; a number of these fragile dolls may be seen in the Hat and Fragrance. English peddler dolls, which depict street vendors and their diverse wares, and American Indian dolls, complete with bead-decorated costumes are also represented in Shelburne's vast collection.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

===Pewter===
Shelburne Museum's [[pewter]] collection offers an overview of French, German, Dutch, English, and American styles. [[Settler]]s brought pieces of pewter with them from abroad and many American merchants sold foreign pewter in their shops. It cost less than other metals, and in Europe its styles frequently copied popular silver designs. American artisans often relied on imported English and German pewter for stylistic inspiration. In fact, long after pewter had fallen out of fashion in Europe it was still being widely produced in America.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

===Scrimshaw===
The American [[whaling]] industry dominated the world market in the nineteenth century. It peaked in 1850 when seven hundred American ships with over twenty thousand men sailed from the South Pacific to the Arctic in search of whales. Voyages could last up to five years because ships only returned when their holds were filled with barrels of whale oil. To pass the time, some sailors used the leftover whalebone to make homecoming gifts for their friends and loved ones.  With saws and files they would first shape the whalebone. Then with needles or knives they would sketch designs into the surface. When the design was complete the sailors would ink them with [[lampblack]] or squid ink.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

While the best-known form of [[scrimshaw]] is the whale tooth decorated with engraved scenes, scrimshanders also fashioned shipboard tools, kitchen implements, domestic and needlework tools, and fashion accessories from whalebone and ivory. Tortoise shell, seashells, animal horn, pewter, silver, and exotic tropical woods gathered during the whaling journeys sometimes provided decorative accents.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Shelburne Museum's scrimshaw collection offers a broad range of forms. A variety of teeth are decorated with whaling scenes, portraits, and patriotic motifs.  A "Susan's tooth," one of a handful engraved in the 1830s by Frederick Myrick aboard the ship Susan, is among the earliest documented scrimshaw in existence.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Pieces intended as gifts to wives and sweethearts included corset busks (inserted in a slit at the front of a woman's corset to firm the bodice), small picks (used to pierce holes in cloth or as hair decorations), pie crimpers, knitting needles, a butter print, a sewing box, and a yarn-winding [[Swift (textiles)|swift]].&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

===Automata===
[[Automata]] are large (sometimes three feet tall), often comical wind-up toys with accompanying music that were displayed in parlors, especially in France, in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum exhibits about 30 automata, including several particularly fine pieces by [[Gustave Vichy]] of Paris, France. The collection includes a drunken chef, a magician, a monkey drummer, a magician, an opium smoker, a woman at her toilette, and a clown walking on his hands.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"/&gt;

===Woodenware and food molds===
North America's abundant forests supplied the raw materials that settlers used to create buildings and objects that ranged from baskets, barrels, and bowls, to carriages and boats.

Household utensils, known as [[Treen (wooden)|treen]], comprised some of the most basic and common wooden objects. One of the most popular materials used to create treen were burls, which are dense, hard growths that form on tree trunks. The semi-circular burls typically required little shaping to form bowls and in addition to their strength, they often possessed highly patterned and attractive grains. Craftsmen would scoop out the interior of a burl by hand or, in later years with a lathe, to create a hollowed bowl.

During the 19th century [[food mold]]s became popular as a vehicle for both identification and decoration. Confectioners would use intricately carved wooden molds to form and decorate pastries and marzipan candies while bakers would pour their cake batters into carved molds such as the Museum's George Washington cake mold made by John Conger, a renowned New York carver. Dairy farmers would likewise use ornamental, circular stamps to mark their butter with their brand.

===Other===
The Variety Unit is also home to the glass canes, globlets, [[toby jug]]s, and [[trivet]]s.

Reynolds, a paralegal, appealed a contempt ruling after she refused to submit an unpublished document for [[Discovery (law)|discovery]].  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] upheld the contempt order.  The Court reasoned that a person who had gathered information for private use without the intent to gather the information as part of an investigation for a publication was not entitled to a reporter's privilege.

The {{nihongo||和漢三才図会|'''Wakan Sansai Zue'''|lit. "Illustrated Sino-Japanese Encyclopedia"}} is an illustrated [[Japan]]ese ''[[leishu]]'' encyclopedia published in 1712 in the [[Edo period]]. It consists of 105 volumes in 81 books. Its compiler was [[Terashima]] or [[Terajima Ryōan|Terajima]] ({{Nihongo|Terajima Ryōan|寺島良安|}}), a doctor from [[Osaka]]. It describes and illustrates various activities of daily life, such as [[carpentry]] and [[fishing]], as well as [[plants]] and [[animals]], and [[constellations]]. As seen from the title of the book ([[Wa (Japan)|和 (wa)]], which means Japan and ([[Han Dynasty|漢 (kan)]], which means China), Terajima's idea was based on a [[Chinese encyclopedia]], specifically the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] work ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'' ("Pictorial..." or "Illustrated Compendium of the Three Powers") by [[Wang Qi]] (1607), known in Japan as the {{nihongo|''Sansai Zue''|三才図会|}}. Reproductions of the ''Wakan Sansai Zue'' are still in print in Japan.

'''William Dwight Whitney''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|t|n|i}}; February 9, 1827 – June 7, 1894) was an American [[linguistics|linguist]], [[philologist]], and [[lexicographer]] known for his work on [[Sanskrit]] grammar and [[Vedas|Vedic]] philology as well as his influential view of language as a social institution. He was the first president of the [[American Philological Association]] and editor-in-chief of ''[[Century Dictionary|The Century Dictionary]]''.

==Life==
William Dwight Whitney was born in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] on February 9, 1827. His father was Josiah Dwight Whitney (1786–1869) of the [[New England Dwight family]]. His mother was Sarah Williston (1800–1833).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

He entered [[Williams College]] at fifteen, graduating in 1845. He continued studying and worked at a bank in [[Northampton]] for several years, then assisted his older brother [[Josiah Whitney]] on a geological survey of the [[Lake Superior]] region in 1849. On this expedition, he began the study of Sanskrit in his leisure hours. Around this time Whitney was living at Yale University in Connecticut. In 1850 he then left the United States to study philology, and especially Sanskrit, in Germany. There, he spent his winters at Berlin studying under [[Franz Bopp]] and [[Albrecht Weber]], and his summers were devoted to research under [[Rudolph von Roth]] at Tübingen. It was during his time in Germany that Whitney began a major life project, 'preparation of an edition and translation of the Atharva-veda'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Margaret|title=50 Key Thinkers on Language and Linguistics|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-415-37303-6|pages=119–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He gained wide reputation for his scholarship in the field. In 1853, Yale University offered Whitney a position as 'Professor of Sanskrit' ‒ a position made just for him and the first of its kind in the United States. (It was not until 1861, however, that he received his doctoral degree from the University of Breslau.) He also taught modern languages at the [[Sheffield Scientific School]], and served as secretary to the ''[[American Oriental Society]]'' from 1857 until he became its president in 1884.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On August 28, 1856 he married Elizabeth Wooster Baldwin. She was the daughter of [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]], US Senator and Governor of the State of [[Connecticut]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
They had six children:{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Career==
Whitney revised definitions for the 1864 edition of Webster's [[Webster's Dictionary|''American Dictionary'']], and in 1869 became a founder and first [[List of Presidents of the American Philological Association|president]] of the ''[[American Philological Association]]''. He wrote metrical translations of the ''[[Vedas]]'', and numerous papers on the Vedas and linguistics, many of which were collected in the ''Oriental and Linguistic Studies'' series (1872–74).  He wrote several books on [[language]], and grammar textbooks of [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and Sanskrit.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

His ''Sanskrit Grammar'' (1879) is notable in part for the criticism it contains of the [[Ashtadhyayi]], the Sanskrit grammar attributed to [[Pāṇini|Panini]]. Whitney describes the Ashtadhyayi as "containing the facts of the language cast into the highly artful and difficult form of about four thousand algebraic-like rules (in the statement and arrangement of which brevity alone is had in view at the cost of distinctness and unambiguousness)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitney|first=William|title=[[s:Sanskrit Grammar|Sanskrit Grammar: Including Both the Classical Language, and the Older Dialects, of Veda and Brahmana]]|date=1889|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' in the chapter on the 'Immutability and Mutability of the Sign', [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] credits Whitney with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the [[sign (linguistics)|linguistic signs]].

The linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] (Jakobson 1965, 23-4) remarks that Whitney exerted a deep influence on European linguistic thought by promoting the thesis of language as a social institution. In his fundamental books of the 1860s and 70's, language was defined as a system of arbitrary and conventional signs. This doctrine was borrowed and expanded by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], and it entered into the posthumous edition of his 'Course', adjusted by his disciples C. Bally and [[Albert Sechehaye]] (1916). The teacher declares: "On the essential  point  it  seems to  us that  the American linguist  is right: language is a convention, and the nature of the sign that is agreed upon remains indifferent." Jakobson writes, Arbitrariness is posited as the first of two basic principles for defining the nature of the verbal sign: "The bond uniting the signifier with the signified is arbitrary." The commentary points out that no one has controverted this principle "but it is often easier to discover a truth than to assign to it the appropriate place." &lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, R. (1965) 'Quest for the Essence of Language', Diogenes, 13(21): pp. 21-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he suffered from a heart ailment in his later years, he was editor-in-chief of the first edition of the respected ''[[Century Dictionary]]'', which appeared from 1889 to 1891.

[[File:Xinhua zidian.jpg|thumb|right|2004 10th edition of ''Xinhua zidian'']]
The '''''Xinhua Zidian''''' ({{Zh|s=新华字典|t=新華字典|p=Xīnhuá Zìdiǎn|l=New Chinese Dictionary}}), or '''''Xinhua Dictionary''''', is a [[Chinese language]] dictionary published by the [[Commercial Press]].  It is the best-selling [[Chinese dictionary]] and the world's most popular [[reference work]] (Xinhua 2004). In 2016, [[Guinness World Records]] officially confirmed that the dictionary, published by The Commercial Press, is the “Most popular dictionary” and the “Best-selling book (regularly updated)”. It is considered a symbol of Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/press-release/2016/4/gwr%20announces%20xinhua%20dictionary|title=GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS ANNOUNCES XINHUA DICTIONARY AS THE "MOST POPULAR DICTIONARY" AND THE "BEST-SELLING BOOK (REGULARLY UPDATED)"|website=Guinness World Records |accessdate=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This pocket-sized dictionary of [[Chinese characters]] uses [[simplified Chinese characters]] and [[pinyin]] romanization. The most recent ''Xinhua Zidian'' edition (the 11th) contains 3,300 [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and includes over 13,000 [[logograms]], including [[traditional Chinese characters]] and [[variant Chinese character]]s. [[Bopomofo]] is used as a supplement alongside Pinyin. ''Xinhua Zidian'' is divided into 189 "[[Radical (Chinese characters)|radicals]]" or "section headers" (DeFrancis 1984:291).

Besides their popular concise version ''Xinhua Zidian'', Commercial Press also publishes a large-print edition and a ''Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation'' (Yao 2000, reviewed by Clark 2001). In addition, the Shanxi Education Press publishes a pinyin-edition ''Xinhua Zidian'' with both characters and orthographically precise transcriptions (Yi et al. 1999).

==History==
Under the aegis of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], the People's Education Press published the original ''Xinhua Zidian'' in 1953. The linguist and lexicographer Wei Jiangong (魏建功, 1901–1980) was chief editor. In 1957, Commercial Press published the ''Xinhua Zidian'' (1st edition), which was alphabetically [[collated]] in pinyin order. They have subsequently revised this dictionary ten times, with over 200 printing runs, and it is a longtime [[bestseller]] among students in China. In early 2004, the total number of published copies exceeded 400 million.

When [[San Marino]], a tiny country surrounded by Italy, was building a relationship with China in the 1970s, the Sammarinese gave a three-volume encyclopedia they had published, as a present to Chinese officials. However, due to the chaos caused by the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the area of publishing, China only could give a copy of the little ''Xinhua Zidian'' in return, which really embarrassed the Chinese government. As a result, the Chinese government decided to publish a series of new dictionaries in 1975, including [[Hanyu Da Cidian]] and some Chinese-foreign languages dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sjuc9U3IQ_WRi8z3jkikrg 编纂《汉语大词典》的那些日子、那些人].&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictionary was strongly affected by the political environment under [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]. In its 1971 edition, the dictionary contained 46 Quotations of Chairman Mao, and slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2011-10/14/content_13898400.htm|title =Better read than Red|website=China Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile app==
The Commercial Press presented its official app on [[App Store (iOS)|Apple Store]] in June 2017. It supports identifying [[Chinese characters|hànzì]] characters by handwriting, voice, or camera. It also provides a pronunciation of the characters read by [[Li Ruiying]], the former news presenter of ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1706144 新华字典官方App今日上线，新闻联播原播音员李瑞英配音]. 澎湃新闻.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
The use of the term ''Xinhua Zidian'' has been disputed in China since the publishing of the dictionary is no longer arranged by the government. The Commercial Press insisted that the name is a specific term while other publishing houses believed that it is a generic term, as many of them published their own Chinese dictionary under the name.
In 2016, The Commercial Press (Beijing) filed a lawsuit at Beijing intellectual property court, claiming [[Sinolingua|Sinolingua Co., Ltd.]] had violated The Commercial Press's trademark for Xinhua Zidian by publishing ''Xinhua Zidian'' without permission from The Commercial Press, even though the trademark name was not registered. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpubg.com/news/2016/1102/31413.shtml|title="新华字典"不能随意被"傍名"|date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original case started when 3.2 million copies of student edition of Xinhua Zidian (学生新华字典)  published by a company in [[Hubei]] were recalled for poor quality. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/newmedia/2013-07/26/c_125069540.htm|title="傍名"出版伤了谁|date=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1229">The '''Yellow Pages Association''', known in the industry as the '''YPA''', is the regulating body of the [[United States]]' [[yellow pages]] industry.

Founded in 1975 as the National Yellow Pages Service Association (NYPSA), the Yellow Pages Association (YPA) is the largest trade organization of a print and digital media industry valued at more than $31 billion worldwide. Association members include Yellow Pages publishers, who produce products that account for almost 90 percent of the Yellow Pages revenue generated in the U.S. and Canada. Members also include the industry's international, national and local sales forces, certified marketing representatives (CMRs) and associate members, a group of industry stakeholders that include Yellow Pages advertisers, vendors and suppliers. The association has members in 29 countries.

The European counterpart to the YPA is the European Association of Directory and Database Publishers ([[EADP]]).

Recently YPA has changed the name into Local Search Association.
