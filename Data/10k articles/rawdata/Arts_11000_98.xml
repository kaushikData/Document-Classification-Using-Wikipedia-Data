'''Amy Kravitz''' is an independent filmmaker and teacher specializing in [[Abstract film|abstract animation]]. She is currently a Professor in the Film Department at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].

== Work ==
As a young girl, Amy Kravitz began making and teaching animation in [[Yvonne Andersen]]'s famed [[Yellow Ball Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.12/articles/jacksonandersen1.12.html Yvonne Andersen: Profile of a Pioneer]. Jackson, Wendy, Animation World Magazine 1.12, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Amy went on to obtain a B.A. in Social Anthropology from [[Harvard University]], and received an MFA in Experimental Animation from the [[California Institute of the Arts]]. During her studies at CalArts, she was mentored under [http://www.skydavid.com Sky David] and [[Jules Engel]]. She taught Animation at Harvard and the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts]], Boston, before becoming a professor in the Film Department of the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] where she has taught Experimental Animation since the 1980s, and from time-to-time has served as the department chair.

Her film work includes ''River Lethe'' (1985), ''The Trap'' (1988), and ''Roost'' (1999). She states that her approach to filmmaking is "direct and visceral."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risd.edu/Film-Animation-Video/Amy_Kravitz/ Amy Kravitz Faculty Biography] at RISD Faculty Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Her films have been screened worldwide and have received numerous prizes and awards.

Amy's out-of-the-ordinary work as a teacher has been highly praised by her students and others in her field. Her long classes involve week-to-week problems and questions that students explore as a means to reveal and understand their perception of the world, instead of merely imparting a collection of animation techniques. Her students develop highly personalized relationships to the medium that bring out their own individual talents and points of view. Many of Kravitz's students have gone on to successful careers in [[traditional animation]], [[computer animation]], and [[interactive art]].

'''Annie Fargé''' (15 April 1934 – 4 March 2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purepeople.com/article/polnareff-en-pleurs-annie-fargue-est-morte-retour-sur-son-riche-parcours_a75341/1]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[French people|French]] [[actress]] named "most promising new star in a [[situation comedy]]" in 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,871774,00.html The New Shows - Printout - TIME]&lt;/ref&gt; when she played the title role in [[CBS]]'s ''[[Angel (1960 TV series)|Angel]]''. Especially in Europe, she was often credited as "Annie Fargue".

==Early life==
Born in Belgium as '''Henriette Goldfarb''', she escaped the country with her family before the [[Nazi]] occupation. She wanted to become an actress; her mother opposed the idea, but relented when Fargé was accepted at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire National]].

==Career==
Fargé traveled to New York and later married dancer Dirk Sanders. The couple had a daughter, Leslie (Mrs. Tabuteau, French TV Producer), born shortly before ''Angel'' began filming in April 1960. Broadway producer [[Joshua Logan]] is said to have discovered Fargé and had her take English lessons. At the time of casting for the television series, Fargé was an [[understudy]] in the Broadway production of ''[[The World of Suzie Wong]]''. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

She was signed for the ''Angel'' role by producer [[Jess Oppenheimer]] on the basis of CBS executive Robert Lewine's recommendation. Oppenheimer did not elect to do a screen test.&lt;ref name=Lost&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCjT3AvbN5QC&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Lost Laughs of '50s and '60s Television: Thirty Sitcoms That Faded Off Screen|editor-last=Tucker|editor-first=David C.|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|pages=210|isbn=0-7864-4466-5|accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Angel'' pilot did not impress the network, but when Lewine screened it for sponsors [[S. C. Johnson and Son|S. C. Johnson]] and [[General Foods]], both sponsors were sufficiently impressed to tell the network executive to put the show on the air or they would cancel their sponsorship of all CBS programs. Fargé played Angelique "Angel" Smith, the scatterbrained French wife of American architect John Smith, played by [[Marshall Thompson]]. [[Doris Singleton]] was her sympathetic neighbor Susie, and [[Don Keefer]] was Susie's husband George. The show was filmed at [[Desilu Studios]].  The series ran for thirty-three episodes. After ''Angel'' folded due to low ratings, Fargé appeared as a guest star in a few other series, including ''[[The Rifleman]]'' and ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]''.

Her last television appearance was in a 1964 episode of ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', "The Case of the Betrayed Bride," as she played the role of defendant Marie Claudet.&lt;ref name=IMDb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/celebrity.aspx?tvobjectid=209207&amp;more=uccelebcredits TV Guide.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fargé divorced her husband and returned to France in the mid-1960s. Upon her return to France, Fargé became a theatrical producer (''Hair'', ''Godspell'', ''Oh! Calcutta!'', ''Jesus Christ Superstar'') and was associate producer for the 1981 [[John Huston]] film ''[[Escape to Victory]]''. She later became the manager of French singer [[Michel Polnareff]].

==Death==
Fargé died of cancer in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], aged 76, on 4 March 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7418">'''Anxiety of Influence''' is a type of [[literary criticism]] established by [[Harold Bloom]] in 1973, in his book, ''[[The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry]]''. It refers to the psychological struggle of aspiring authors to overcome the anxiety posed by the influence of their literary antecedents.

== Theory ==

The theory of anxiety of influence is a theory applied principally to early nineteenth century romantic poetry. Its author, Harold Bloom, maintains that the theory has general applicability to the study of literary tradition, ranging from Homer and the Bible to [[Thomas Pynchon]] and [[Anne Carson]] in the 20th and 21st century. It is based primarily on Bloom's belief that there is no such thing as an original poem, that every new composition is simply a misreading or misinterpretation of an earlier poem and that influence is unavoidable and inescapable; all writers inevitably, to some degree, adopt, manipulate or alter and assimilate certain aspects of the content or subject matter, literary style or form from their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{harvnb|Abrams &amp; Harpham|2009|pp=155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate his point, Bloom quotes Oscar Wilde, noting that:

"Influence is simply transference of personality, a mode of giving away what is most precious to one's self, and its exercise produces a sense, and, it may be, a reality of loss. Every disciple takes away something from his master."&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to universally-held beliefs that the literary influence of precursors can provide a purely benevolent, inspirational platform for young, aspiring writers; Bloom deems that this influence provides entirely the opposite effect.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom}}{{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that it proves detrimental; that this influence instills in young writers a type of unease, apprehension or anxiety as they psychologically struggle against past literary forebears to create something definitive and original and achieve literary recognition and success. Bloom equates this struggle to the Freudian family drama; particularly to the Oedipal complex and relationship of son to father, where the emerging writer is cast as the 'son' in a battle against the 'father'; a literary precursor.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; Bloom claims that this forces poets or authors into a type of 'creative misprision'; where they must distort the works of their literary masters in an attempt to create something revolutionary and innovative.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; The authors who triumph over this struggle are deemed 'strong', with some even receiving acclaim to the extent where the contemporary has the potential to transcend time, with some literary predecessors being read in terms of their contemporary successor. In contrast, writers who cannot prevail over this anxiety of influence are deemed 'weak', with their works regarded as markedly derivative and reminiscent of the works of earlier literary masters. Some great poets in which Bloom draws upon, who have overcome this anxiety of influence include Wordsworth, Shelley and Wallace Stevens.

== Effects on literature ==
In order to determine the effects of this theory on literature, Bloom has established the six "revisionary ratios", which are occasionally based on the model of Freud's defense mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-8"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ratios show the developmental stages of anxiety of influence in relation to the ways a poet or author misreads and deforms the work of a literary precursor in the composition of a literary text.&lt;ref name="Geddes"&gt;{{harvnb|Geddes|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Clinamen'' – Bloom defines this as "poetic misreading or misprision proper".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author makes a swerve away from a precursor, alluding to the proposition that the original work was only precise and accurate up until a particular end; at which point, the successive author makes the corrective motion.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;  
* ''Tessera'' – Bloom defines this as "completion and antithesis".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author elaborates upon a precursor's work, maintaining the precursor's terms and ideas but constituting them in another sense, with the implication that the predecessor failed to take the argument far enough in the first instance&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Kenosis'' – Bloom defines this as a "breaking device similar to the defence mechanisms our psyches employ against repetition compulsions".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt; The author seeks a state of discontinuity, in the act of isolating themself from the influence of the precursor&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-14" /&gt;
* ''Daemonization'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement towards a personalised Counter-Sublime, in reaction to the precursor's Sublime".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author manipulates an apparent power of a precursor that they believe is superior to the precursor in an effort to dismiss the originality of the predecessor's work and perpetuate the greatness of their own.&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Askesis'' – Bloom defines this as a "movement of self-purgation which intends the attainment of a state of solitude".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997" /&gt; In this process, the author diminishes both his own and his precursor's achievements, purging themself of all remnants of influence, with a rationale for independent, individual success and achievement.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;
* ''Apophrades'' – Bloom defines this as the "return of the dead".&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; The author is encumbered by his previous state of solitude and holds his work open for inspection with that of his predecessors&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt; Geddes 1999). Instead of proving detrimental to the author, this instead has the effect of the successor overpowering the predecessor, with the predecessor's work being read in terms of the successor's work.&lt;ref name="Geddes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloom1997-15" /&gt;

In marketing, '''art infusion''' is the general influence of [[work of art|artwork]]s on perceptions and evaluations of products with which the artworks are associated.

The term was first introduced in an article in the [[Journal of Marketing Research]] in 2008. [[Henrik Hagtvedt]] and Vanessa Patrick, the two researchers who authored the article, demonstrated a favorable influence of artworks on consumer evaluations of non-art products that were associated with the artworks via, for instance, advertising or [[product design]]. The authors suggested that the creation and appreciation of art has evolved through the millennia of [[Prehistory|human prehistory]], and that the universal human impulse to apply skill and creative effort to express oneself artistically is also reflected in the recognition of the objects thus created as belonging to a special category. This special category has several characteristics, including non-utility. This does not imply that artworks cannot have utility, but that creativity and skill are central to the creation and appreciation of the artwork, irrespective of any other functions, or lack thereof, that the artwork may serve. This non-utilitarian quest for excellence, when associated with other objects, leads to more favorable evaluations of those objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">The '''Australian Singing Competition''' (ASC) evolved from the [[Marianne Mathy]] Scholarship, established in 1982 through a bequest made in the will of Marianne Mathy-Frisdane, a [[coloratura soprano]] [[opera]] singer and distinguished teacher of opera and classical singing.

The ASC rules and repertoire requirements are designed for young opera and classical singers, under 26 years of age. The competition is now recognised as one of the longest-running events of its kind, offering a range of scholarships, prizes, career and network opportunities, which also make the competition one of the richest in terms of financial and career opportunities available to recipients. Since 1982 the premier award of the competition has been the Marianne Mathy Scholarship, known by its participants and within its industry as "The Mathy".

The since 1998 the finals concert of the competition has taken place in various capital cities around Australia, featuring many prominent conductors and some of Australia's leading orchestras.

The competition has had the patronage of several Governor-Generals of Australia, most recently The Honourable [[Quentin Bryce|Quentin Bryce AC]] (2010–2014). In 2014 the ASC formally welcomed [[Haruhisa Handa]] as patron of the re-named IFAC Handa Australian Singing Competition in recognition of his ongoing sponsorship and support, both personally and as chairman of the International Foundation for Arts and Culture (IFAC). 

The winner of the [[Opera Awards (Australia)]] is acknowledged and invited to perform as a guest artist at the finals concert of the IFAC Handa Australian Singing Competition.

The '''Azadi Tower''' ({{lang-fa|برج آزادی}}, {{transl|fa|''Borj-e Āzādi''}}; "Freedom Tower"), formerly known as the '''Shahyad Tower''' ({{lang|fa|برج شهیاد}}, {{transl|fa|''Borj-e Ŝahyād''}}; "[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s Memorial Tower"), is a monument located at [[Azadi Square]], in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. It is one of the landmarks of Tehran, marking the west entrance to the city, and is part of the Azadi Cultural Complex, which also includes a museum underground.

The tower is about {{convert|45|m|ft}} tall and is completely clad in cut marble.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/nphotos/slideshow/photo//090615/481/383faf99533649c7bc4b9f2a555f322d/#photoViewer=/090615/481/383faf99533649c7bc4b9f2a555f322d|title=Yahoo News - Latest News &amp;amp; Headlines|publisher=news.yahoo.com|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hureau, Jean. Iran Today, 2nd. Ed, editions j.a.&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of Iran, to mark the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire|2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran]].

After winning a competition, architect [[Hossein Amanat]] was tasked to design the tower, his client being the Council of Celebrations. His ideas were based upon classical and post-classical Iranian architecture,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2009/07/090718_mg_azadi_sq_tehran.shtml|title=BBC فارسی - ايران - 'برج آزادی پس از۲۰ سال شسته می شود'|website=BBC Persian|accessdate=1 September 2015|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; popular influences on art in the 1960s following the [[White Revolution]]. Iran's increasing wealth sparked modernisation programmes and sent the art industry into a renaissance-like period.

==History==
===Name===
The first name associated with this monument was ''Darvāze-ye Kuroš'' ("the Gate of Cyrus"), and at the time of the Centenary Celebrations, [[Asadollah Alam]], who chaired the Council of Celebrations, referred to the monument as ''Darvāze-ye Šāhanšāhi'' ("the Imperial Gate").

The monument's official name was decided before the announcement of the competition for the monument's design in September 1966. Bahram Farahvashi, a scholar and professor of ancient Iranian languages who worked with the Council of Celebrations, came up with the officially designated name of the structure, ''Šahyād Āryāmehr''.&lt;ref name="Khashayar"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://summit.sfu.ca/item/15619| title = A Monument of Destiny: Envisioning A Nation’s Past, Present, and Future Through Shahyad/Azadi| last = Khashayar| first = Hemmati,| date = 2015-08-20| website = summit.sfu.ca| access-date = 2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in 1971 in commemoration of the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire|2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran]], this "gateway into Tehran" was named the ''Šahyād'' ("King's Memorial") in honor of [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], but was renamed ''Āzādi'' ("Freedom") following the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Revolution]].

===Construction===
[[File:Shahyad Tower Plans.jpg|left|thumb|Plans of the Azadi Tower.]]
During the 1960s, Iran became a [[OPEC|major oil-exporting country]], and using the newly-found wealth, the shah launched programs to modernize and industrialize the country. This followed a cultural growth that architect [[Hossein Amanat]] describes as "a mini renaissance".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riazati|first1=Rozita|title=The man behind Iran's most famous tower|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35295083|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 February 2017|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Amanat won a competition to design the building.

Due to governmental concerns, he was required to sign underneath contracts with "on condition of the approval of the Council of Celebrations", which would serve as the client. Amanat planned to contract the British company of [[Arup Group|Arup]] to assist in the structural design of the tower, as he was impressed by their contributions towards the design and construction of the [[Sydney Opera House]]. He initially faced opposition from the head of the council, as well as several conservative and nationalistic Iranian engineers, as he was turning to a foreign engineer for assistance. Despite that, the shah supported Amanat, sending a letter to the council which would leave the decision to the architect. [[Shahbanu]] [[Farah Pahlavi]] was also supportive of Amanat's decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hossein Amanat with Benjamin Tiven|url=http://www.bidoun.org/magazine/28-interviews/hossein-amanat-with-benjamin-tiven/|publisher=Bidoun|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amanat told the [[BBC World News]] in an interview that "overall, the building starts from the base and moves up towards the sky." He states that he was inspired to design the tower in this way because he felt that Iran "should be moving towards a higher level." According to him, the main [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] is a [[Sasanian architecture|Sassanian]] arch representing the classical era, while the broken arch above it is a popular medieval form of arch representing the [[History of Iran#Medieval Iran|post-classical]] era. The "network of [[Rib vault|ribs]]", which connects the arches together, would represent the connection between classical and post-classical Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Amanat|first=Hossein|subjectlink=Hossein Amanat|title=The Freedom Tower in the name Ayush patel Tehran|work=Witness|publisher=BBC World Service|date=January 14, 2016|interviewer=Rozita Riazati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built with white [[marble]] from [[Isfahan Province|Isfahan]], the monument includes 8,000 blocks of stone. The stones were all located and supplied by Ghanbar Rahimi, who was well known for his extensive knowledge of quarries, often known as the ''Soltān-e Sang-e Irān'' ("Iran's Sultan of Stone"). Computers were used to "define its complex woven surfaces," which, at the time, was a new technological technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMANAT ARCHITECT - SHAHYAD MONUMENT|url=http://www.amanatarchitect.com/shahyad/index.php?lang=english|website=www.amanatarchitect.com|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main contractor for the construction of the tower was the MAP Company, supervised by Ghaffar Davarpanah Varnosfaderani, a renowned Iranian stonemason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grigor|first1=Talinn|title=Of Metamorphosis Meaning on Iranian Terms|journal=Third Text|date=2003|volume=17|issue=3|pages=207–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was mainly funded by a group of five hundred Iranian industrialists. According to a report by the [[MEED]], the construction costed about six million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=MEED|journal=Middle East Economic Digest|date=29 October 1971|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 1971, the inauguration of the tower took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran Travel Photos. Tourism pictures from Iran - CountryReports|url=http://www.countryreports.org/travel/Iran/pictures.htm#!shahyad-tower-tehran|website=www.countryreports.org|accessdate=20 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until January 14, 1972 that the tower was open to the public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The iconic [[Martyrs' Memorial, Algiers|Martyrs' Memorial]] in [[Algiers]], which was built in 1982, shows a strong influence by this monument.

==Museum==
The Azadi Museum is located on the basement floor. Inside the floor, there are black austere walls and proportions, and a concrete mesh forms the ceiling. Heavy doors open onto a crypt with subdued lighting issuing from showcases, each containing an object. The museum houses a number of gold and enamel pieces, painted pottery, marble and paintings. Approximately fifty pieces have been selected, each representing a particular period in Iran's history.

Among the earliest items on display were square [[flagstone]]s, gold sheeting, and [[terracotta]] tablets from [[Susa]] covered with cuneiform characters. Before the 1979 Revolution, the main display was occupied by a copy of the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], the original being kept at the [[British Museum]]. A translation of the cylinder's [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform inscription]] is inscribed in golden letters on the wall of one of the galleries leading to the museum's audio-visual department. A similar plaque facing the cylinder listed the Twelve Points of the [[White Revolution]]. Next, to the Cyrus Cylinder, there was a gold plaque commemorating the original presentation of the museum to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi by the Mayor of Tehran. Potteries, ceramics, varnished [[porcelain]]s (such as a seventh-century blue and gold dish from [[Gorgan]]), an illuminated [[Quran]], and miniatures highlighted milestones in the country's history up to the 19th century, which were represented by two painted panels from Empress and the structure was to represent [[Farah Pahlavi]] as in is stated in some ancient texts.

==Events==
===Audiovisual theatre (1971)===
The original show, devised in 1971, was replaced in 1975 by a new one which invited visitors to discover Iran's geographic and natural diversity along with its fundamental historical elements. It exhibited a number of national achievements, technical undertakings, calligraphed poems, and miniature paintings. The project, devised by a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] company, required 12,000 metres of film, 20,000 color slides, 20 movie projectors, and 120 slide projectors. The audiovisual programmes were directed by professor Jaroslav Frič (1928–2000). Five computers operated the entire system.&lt;ref name="Khashayar"/&gt;

===''Gate of Words'' light show (2015)===
German artist Philipp Geist organized a projection mapping installation named ''Gate of Words'' at the Azadi Tower, on the occasion of the [[German Unity Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]]: ''[https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/gallery/2015/oct/07/german-artist-tehran-freedom-arch-pictures German artist lights up Tehran's freedom arch – in pictures]''. 7 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was held from October 3 to 5, 2015.

In this project, the artist visualized the topics of freedom, peace, space and time in a poetical manner. Geist developed a light installation made of colored words and concepts in different languages, and abstract painterly compositions of images. The glowing words were in English, German and Persian, moving in sync with live music on the walls of the tower.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Geist was invited by the German Embassy to propose such a project at the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the German Reunification.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berlin Biennale''' (full name: Berlin Biennale für zeitgenössische Kunst, Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art) is a [[contemporary art]] exhibition, which has been held at various locations in [[Berlin]], Germany, every two to three years since 1998. The curator or curators choose the artists who will participate. After the event became established, annual themes were introduced. The Biennale is now underwritten by the German government through the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (Federal Culture Foundation), and is the second most important contemporary arts event in the country, after [[documenta]].&lt;ref name=Mauer&gt;Karin Schmidl, [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/biennale-kunst-in-der-friedrichstrasse-mauerfall-in-kreuzberg,10809148,16329348.html "Biennale-Kunst in der Friedrichstraße: Mauerfall in Kreuzberg"], ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'', 9 June 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kito Nedo, [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/kultur/bundeskulturstiftung-wer-sucht--bleibt-in-bewegung,10809150,16443528.html "Bundeskulturstiftung: Wer sucht, bleibt in Bewegung"], ''Berliner Zeitung'', 22 June 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin Biennale was co-founded on 26 March 1996 by [[Klaus Biesenbach]] and a group of collectors as well as patrons of art.

==Chronology==

===1st Berlin Biennale===
The first exhibition ran from 30 September to 30 December 1998 and was curated by [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]] and [[Nancy Spector]]. It took place in the [[Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art]] in [[Mitte|Berlin-Mitte]], at the [[Akademie der Künste]] in [[Pariser Platz]] and at the postal centre in [[Oranienburger Straße]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130825114332/http://www.berlinbiennale.de/blog/en/1st-6th-biennale/1st-berlin-biennale The 1st Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art], Berlin Biennale.

During the opening week, the [[Thailand|Thai]] artist [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]] catered a banquet for 1,000 guests in the post office gymnasium, and a three-night combination symposium and festival, ''Congress 3000'', took place in the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|House of World Cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstaspekte.de/index.php?action=termin&amp;tid=24139 1.

The Second Berlin Biennale ran from 20 April to 20 June 2001 and included works by approximately 50 artists (deliberately fewer than at the first&lt;ref name=BerlinerZeitung5/&gt;) from more than 30 countries, several of them very young. It was curated by [[Saskia Bos]], who adopted the theme of "connectedness, contribution and commitment" and sought to reject commercially oriented art while fostering engagement with the public in order to "exhibit a utopian sociability in art".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Monk, "2nd Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art", ''Parachute'', 1 October 2001 ([http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-30203328.html Online] at Highbeam, subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; Works were again exhibited at the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art and the postal centre in Oranienburger Straße as well as under the elevated [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] at Jannowitzbrücke and the Allianz Building, known as the [[Treptowers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130220102525/http://www.berlinbiennale.de/blog/1-6-biennale/2-biennale 2.

===3rd Berlin Biennale===
The Third Berlin Biennale took place from 14 February to 18 April 2004 and was directed by [[Ute Meta Bauer]], who chose five themes, or "hubs," titled Migration, Urban Conditions, Sonic Landscapes, Modes and Scenes, and Other Cinema, in order to focus on artistic conversation and on the specific circumstances of post-[[Cold War]] Berlin. The Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art was again used as a site; additional sites included the [[Martin Gropius Bau]] and, for the exhibition of 35 cinematic works, the cinema Kino Arsenal at [[Potsdamer Platz]]. There were several collaborations with various Berlin cultural institutions, a partnership with the Friends of the [[Deutsche Kinemathek]], and a weekly special radio broadcast, reboot.fm. The event ended with a three-day multi-media ''Performance Jam'' on the final weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130220102537/http://www.berlinbiennale.de/blog/1-6-biennale/3-biennale 3.

===4th Berlin Biennale===
The Fourth Berlin Biennale ran from 25 March to 5 June 2006, curated by [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Massimiliano Gioni]], and [[Ali Subotnick]], known collectively as the [[Wrong Gallery]] after a project they did in New York. Titled ''Von Mäusen und Menschen'' (Of Mice and Men) and conceived of as an extended narrative or life cycle, the Fourth Berlin Biennale featured works by [[Mircea Cantor]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Ján Mančuška]], and [[Thomas Schütte]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Hanno Rauterberg, [http://www.zeit.de/2006/14/Biennale/komplettansicht "In der Matschpfütze des Seins.

===6th Berlin Biennale===
The Sixth Berlin Biennale ran from 11 June to 8 August 2010 and was headed by [[Kathrin Rhomberg]]. It was preceded by Project Artists Beyond, sponsored by the [[European Commission]], which sought to showcase the process of artistic creation through exhibits in public places. This began in January and involved seven artists in [[Amsterdam]], [[Istanbul]], [[Pristina]], Copenhagen, [[Vienna]], and Paris in addition to Berlin. The title of this Biennale was ''was draußen wartet'' (what is waiting out there) and the guiding question was "Glauben Sie an die Wirklichkeit?" (Do you believe in reality?). More than 40 artists were featured. Rhomberg chose sites in parts of the city inhabited by large numbers of migrants and invited the New York art critic [[Michael Fried]] to mount an exhibition on the drawings of the 19th-century artist [[Adolph Menzel]] in association with the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|Museum of Prints and Drawings]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Münter, [http://www.de-cn.net/mag/bku/de6029924.htm 6.

The 9th Berlin Biennale stirred some controversy among critics and audiences. James Farago, of ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote a scathing review, describing the art event as “an ultra-slick, ultra-sarcastic biennial, replete with ads, avatars, custom security guard uniforms, a manic social media presence disposed to hashtags like #BiennaleGlam, and a woman lip syncing to Trap Queen.” 

Other critics lauded the Biennale; in the September 2016 Issue of Artforum, British artist [[Hannah Black]] wrote that “…They [DIS] have been greeted, just like the modernist avant-gardes were in their time, with accusations of bad politics and even worse taste. Perhaps these critics haven’t noticed: The world is a ruin, but we go on living in it…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Black|first1=Hannah|title=the 9th Berlin Biennale|url=https://www.artforum.com/inprint/issue=201607&amp;id=63010|publisher=Artforum|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Piero Bisello concluded that “Regardless of what we thought Berlin Biennale 2016 would be, we can now claim it is for us a milestone in art history, whether by that history we mean the last centuries, the last years, the last days, the last hours, the last fashion seasons.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bisello|first1=Piero|title=Berlin Biennale 2016: last goodbye to the prematurely dead post-internet label|url=https://www.conceptualfinearts.com/cfa/2016/06/07/berlin-biennale-2016-last-goodbye-to-the-prematurely-dead-post-internet-label/|publisher=Conceptual Fine Arts|date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tess Edmonson wrote For ''Art Agenda'' that “As a whole, the biennial articulates the sense that disengaging from networks of capital and power is neither effective nor interesting nor possible, instead performing its own complicity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edmonson|first1=Tess|title='The Present in Drag,' 9th Berlin Biennale|url=http://www.art-agenda.com/reviews/%E2%80%9Cthe-present-in-drag%E2%80%9D-9th-berlin-biennale/|publisher=Art Agenda|date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later art historian [[:de:Susanne von Falkenhausen|Susanne von Falkenhausen]] commented on the controversial nature of the 9th Biennale: "Finding myself confronted with such a unified front of fantasies, rhetorics, pretensions and desires for authenticity in 2017, I confess that I revised my reaction to DIS’s 2016 Berlin Biennale 9, ‘The Present in Drag’. That exhibition rigorously, to the point of cynicism, followed the web 2.0 world of digital prosumer reality and the moral ambiguity of its promises and aesthetics. In my view, it catered to a young, white, middle-class audience, but now it strikes me as more realistic than what we are seeing today: an outsourcing to the (post-)colonial other of the political, guilt, spiritual desire and collectivity that plague the Western-Northern self."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=von Falkenhausen|first1=Susanne|title=Get Real|url=https://frieze.com/article/get-real-0|publisher=FRIEZE|date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 10th Berlin Biennale ===
The 10th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art will take place from 9 June to 9 September 2018, and is curated by Gabi Ngcobo and her team of Nomaduma Rosa Masilela, Serubiri Moses, Thiago de Paula Souza and Yvette Mutumba. Titled ''We don’t need another hero'', the 10th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art is a conversation with artists and contributors who think and act beyond art as they confront the incessant anxieties perpetuated by a willful disregard for complex subjectivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://berlinbiennale.de/about|title=About|website=berlinbiennale.de|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bongy Westphall Universe''' is a fictional universe of 44 related films released by [[Full Moon Entertainment]]. Series creator [[Charles Band]] took inspiration from team up comics he read as a child.&lt;ref name=yell&gt;{{cite web|title=Band, Charles Band: Our Exclusive Interview Explores His Fears and Future with Full Moon|url=http://www.yellmagazine.com/charles-band-interview/25686/2/|publisher=Yell!|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe is named after the [[Tommy Westphall Universe]] and also the film [[Evil Bong]] which presents the largest crossover in the fictional universe. The named was coined by film podcast [[Double Feature (podcast)|Double Feature]] during their "Killapalooza" episode highlighting the [[Puppet Master (series)|Puppet Master]] franchise.&lt;ref name="DF#1"&gt;{{cite podcast|title=Killapalooza 24: Puppet Master|publisher=Double Feature|url=https://doublefeature.fm/2014/killapalooza-24-puppet-master|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Crossovers ==

=== Evil Bong ===

Evil Bong represents the largest overall crossover in the Bongy Westphall universe. Ooga Booga ([[Blood Dolls]]), Ivan Burroughs ([[Decadent Evil]]), [[Gingerdead Man]], Jack Attack ([[Demonic Toys]]), and Jack Deth ([[Trancers]]) are all featured.

=== Decadent Evil ===

Footage from [[Subspecies (film series)|Vampire Journals]] is used at the beginning of the movie which ties the [[Subspecies (film series)|Subspecies]] series to the Bongy Westphall Universe.

=== Dollman vs. Demonic Toys ===

Jack Attack's appearance in Evil Bong brings Demonic Toys into the Bongy Westphall Universe. The Dollman crossover also incorporates [[Bad Channels]] due to a small Dollman cameo.

=== Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys ===

By crossing over with Demonic Toys, all ten other [[Puppet Master (film series)|Puppet Master films]] are entered into the Bongy Westphall Universe although Puppet Master never crosses over directly with Evil Bong.

=== miscellaneous ===

[[Zombies Vs. Strippers]] (2012): The character Hambo (played by [[Chance A. Rearden]]) later appears in Ooga Booga and several Gingerdead Man films.

[[Crash and Burn (1990 film)|Crash and Burn]] (1990): The character Quinn (played by [[Bill Moseley]]) later appears in Evil Bong (2006).

'''''Dives and Pauper''''' is a 15th-century commentary on the [[Ten Commandments]] in dialogue form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0025-8385| volume = 76| issue = 1| pages = 164–165| last = Connolly| first = Margaret| title = Dives and Pauper, Vol II| journal = Medium Aevum| accessdate = 2017-05-27| date = 2007| url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=27055032&amp;site=ehost-live}}{{subscription|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Middle English]], it was most likely authored by a [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] friar. It is structured as a dialogue between a wealthy [[layman]] (Dives) and a spiritual poor man with many similarities to a [[friar]] (Pauper). The work is an example of orthodox [[Catholic]] theology, but it engages many questions relevant to [[Lollardy|Wycliffism]], an English movement condemned as heretical by church authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Dives and Pauper | encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. | date = 2017 | access-date = July 31, 2018 | url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781118396957.wbemlb181 | doi = 10.1002/9781118396957 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like [[John Wycliffe]]'s ''De mandatis divinis'', ''Dives and Pauper'' discusses the Commandments in the context of Church law, as well as the "laws of civil society".&lt;ref name=Barnum&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press for the Early English Text Society| isbn = 978-0-19-722326-0| last = Barnum| first = Priscilla Heath| title = Dives and pauper: (no. 323 in series). Introduction, explanatory notes and glossary| date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patricia Barnum describes it as a discussion about justice in the context of the "seemingly double standard" of the [[Old Testament]] concept of law (''[[ius]]'') and the [[New Testament]] charity ([[Charity (virtue)|''caritas'']]).&lt;ref name=Barnum/&gt; The question posed is whether God's laws may be harmonized with man's laws. ''Dives and Pauper'' starts the inquiry with the question of what the [[Christian scriptures]] teach about wealth (''temporalia'').&lt;ref name=Barnum/&gt;

'''''Djibi, the Kitten''''' ({{lang-de|Djibi das Kätzchen}}) is the last novel of [[Felix Salten]], published originally in 1945 and translated into English in 1946. Similarly as in other Salten's late books, the [[protagonist]] is an animal, this time a young female [[cat]] called Djibi.

In ''[[Renni the Rescuer]]'', the main animal character had been a loyal servant to humans, but Djibi is an independent cat who chooses for herself where to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=Beverley Driver |date=2010 |title=Felix Salten: Man of Many Faces |location=Riverside (Ca.) |publisher=Ariadne Press |page=303 |isbn=978-1-57241-169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel begins dramatically with a drowning attempt which the young kitten survives. A boy rescues her from the river and takes to his home where a dog adopts her and feeds along with other puppies. But when the boy rebuffs the cat, she leaves the farm immediately and, for a while, lives in the forest and kills [[pheasant]]s. After being wounded by a gamekeeper, she decides to take shelter with humans again, and a kind teacher, Salten's alter ego, adopts her. After that, Djibi lives with the teacher and his wife, but her strong hunting instinct finally leads Djibi to her demise.

The main theme of the book are the reciprocal interactions between men and animals, especially cats and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ehness | first=Jürgen | title=Felix Saltens erzählerisches Werk: Beschreibung und Deutung | location=Frankfurt am Main | publisher=Peter Lang | date=2002 | isbn=3-631-38178-6 | pages=258–259 | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in Salten's earlier animal novels, for instance ''[[Bambi's Children]]'', there isn't much [[anthropomorphism]] in ''Djibi'' — there is only one short dialogue between Djibi and a [[marten]].&lt;ref&gt;''Djibi, the Kitten'' (1946), pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The human characters, in contrast to the animals in the book, mostly have no personal names, but are referred to as “the teacher,” “the farmer,” etc.

The first English translation of ''Djibi'' by Raya Levin appeared in the United Kingdom in 1946, illustrated by [[Walter Linsenmaier]] as the original Swiss edition, but there is also an anonymous American translation, '''''Jibby the Cat''''', illustrated by Fritz Kredel, which was published in 1948 by [[Julian Messner]] in [[New York City]]. This edition differs greatly from Salten's original text. Not only has it a happy ending — Djibi's death is left out — but it also has a happy opening added to it: the novel begins with five pages depicting Djibi's (or Jibby's) sweet life before the attempt on her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Salten, Felix | title=Jibby the Cat | publisher=Julian Messner, Inc. | location=New York | year=1948 | pages=1–6 | others=Illustrated by Fritz Kredel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel has been largely rewritten, and new incidents have been added to the story. For instance, in the Swiss and the British edition, the boy takes the kitten from the river directly to his home, but in the American edition, he first takes it to the teacher (or “schoolmaster Victor” in this edition). The Americal edition also adds chapter numbers and chapter titles to the book,&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/993362737/04 Contents] at Deutsche Nationalbibliothek.&lt;/ref&gt; and most human characters have personal names.

For example, the episode where Djibi decides to leave the farm is very different in the two English-language editions. The British edition follows very closely Salten's original German-language text,&lt;ref&gt;''Djibi das Kätzchen'' (1945), pp. 14–15. ([http://www.mlang.name/felix/djibi-auszug.jpg Extract on-line.])&lt;/ref&gt; but the American edition has it rewritten:

The boy ran howling out of the stable. But because he was hungry, he ran into the kitchen.&lt;br&gt;
 There a decisive scene took place between him and Djibi.&lt;br&gt;
 Djibi meant no harm when she hastened to meet him and tried to jump on his shoulder as usual.&lt;br&gt;
 But the boy pushed her back: “Leave me alone!”&lt;br&gt;
 Djibi made a second attempt at re-establishing their long-standing intimacy. At the first sign of her intention, however, the boy cried:&lt;br&gt;
 “Leave me alone, you damned beast!” At the same time he slapped the cat's head with impatient indignation.&lt;br&gt;
 A slap? Djibi never accepted a slap without retaliation, never!&lt;br&gt;
 As quick as lightning, her sharp claws dug into the boy's hand, from which a few drops of blood began to trickle. He staggered back in pain, while the cat, spitting, sat up on her hind legs and raised her paws in readiness for both defence and attack.&lt;br&gt;
 The boy did not remember that he had pulled Djibi out of the water and saved her poor little life; he did not remember how often she had amused and delighted him. At the moment she appeared to him as a wild, excited enemy, and he was her exasperated, badly scratched opponent.&lt;br&gt;
 It never occurred to him that he was responsible for this sudden transformation. Embittered, he reached out for the cat, to throw her against the wall, to punish her. To show her who was master.&lt;br&gt;
 But Djibi admitted no punishment. The very notion of it, so well known to dogs, was completely alien to her.&lt;br&gt;
 She submitted to neither ill-treatment nor to punishment. Nothing of the kind!&lt;br&gt;
 She had suffered gross unfairness, never gave a thought to the past, or to her once beloved friend. She had finished with him for ever.&lt;br&gt;
 In the face of his angry attitude, she ran stealthily past him, and jumped out of the window before he had realised it.&lt;br&gt;
 Into freedom!&lt;ref&gt;''Djibi, the Kitten'' (1946), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
| style="font-size: 90%;" | 
Peter's face went suddenly white, and he turned and ran through the barn to the hayloft. His throat burned, and he held his fists clenched at his sides and his body rigid.&lt;br&gt;
 Jibby appeared at the top of the steps just as the boy threw himself down in the hay and began to cry. She ran up to her playmate, prepared as usual to settle in his lap and lay her head under his chin. Peter gave her a push, which Jibby mistook for part of a new game. She scratched his knees and sprang to her proud perch on his shoulder. But Peter, busy with his first grown-up sorrow, knocked her off with a brusk swipe that sent her sprawling.&lt;br&gt;
 “Go away, Jibby!” he said, putting his head down on his arms again. But the kitten gave a blow for a blow. Lightning fast her paw raked across the boy's hand, making the blood come. Peter sat up and stared at her, nursing his hand. Jibby did not retreat. She sat spitting at him, paws raised for defense or attack.&lt;br&gt;
 Peter forgot that he had fished her out of the cold river. He forgot Jibby was his hard-earned pet. For a moment she was a wildly excited enemy and he her wounded antagonist.&lt;br&gt;
 The kitten, still spitting, began to back away. She had seen Peter's face change. He was big and strong, and he looked as if he meant to punish her. Jibby, however, was not one to take punishment. The notion was foreign to her kind. She had seen the dogs cower and whimper under Mrs. Julius' light discipline, but Jibby was not a dog. If she could not win by scratching and spitting, she could run.&lt;br&gt;
 Peter caught up with her at the trapdoor. He lifted her roughly by the scruff of the neck and dropped her all the way to the barn floor below. Jibby landed on the planks with a thud and a cry of pain. Then she slowly rose to her feet, arching her back and half turning toward the haymow. Then she relaxed: her babyhood was over. Without a backward look toward her one-time friend and benefactor, she sailed in a graceful curve through the open barn door and took to the open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Salten, Felix | title=Jibby the Cat | publisher=Julian Messner, Inc. | location=New York | year=1948 | pages=38–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dual narrative''' is a form of [[narrative]] that tells a story in two different perspectives, usually two different people. '''Dual narrative''' is also an effective technique that can be used to tell the story of people (or one person) at two different points in time ([[Postcards from No Man's Land]], [[Great Expectations]]).
It is used to show parallels or emphasise differences in the lifestyles or points-of-view of different places or time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haertsch|first=Gretchen|title=The Dual Narrative- Does it Work?|url=http://birthofanovel.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/the-dual-narrative-does-it-work/|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Margaret Farrelly''' is a Sydney-based author, architecture critic, essayist, columnist and speaker who was born in [[New Zealand]] but later became an Australian citizen. She has contributed to
current debates about [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], design, [[public art]], architecture, [[urban areas|urban]] environments, society and politics, including criticism of the treatment of [[Julian Assange]].&lt;ref name="Farrelly SMH bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/by/elizabeth-farrelly | title=Elizabeth Farrelly | accessdate=11 January 2011 | work=Newspaper contributor biography | publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the case of Assange, truth is actively and repeatedly punished". {{cite news|last=Farrelly|first=Elizabeth|title=Truth of Assange is stranger than fiction|date=12 April 2012|url=http://www.nationaltimes.com.au/opinion/politics/truth-of-assange-is-stranger-than-fiction-20120411-1ws4o.html|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=The National Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Assange had not been charged with any crime." {{cite news|last=Farrelly|first=Elizabeth|title=Ambassador's rage doesn't dispel facts|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/ambassadors-rage-doesnt-dispel-facts-20121128-2ae99.html||date=29 November 2012|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Farrelly was born in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand and trained as an architect in [[Auckland]]. She left New Zealand in 1983 for London, moved to Sydney in October 1988 and became an Australian citizen in 1991. She holds a PhD in architecture from the [[University of Sydney]].

==Teaching==
Farrelly has taught at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she is Associate Professor (Practice) in the UNSW Graduate School of Urbanism; the [[University of Technology, Sydney]], where she was Adjunct Associate Professor of Architecture; the [[University of Auckland]]; the [[Royal College of Art]], London; the [[University of Lincoln|Humberside Polytechnic]] and the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]], London. Farrelly has set writing for Wikipedia as a task for post-graduate students, and has commented that its demand for every input to be traceable and published, enables "genuine crowd-sourcing of scholarship" and is both "a revelation and a revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-wikipedia-at-15-is-a-beautiful-exercise-in-scholarly-excellence-20151209-glj79f.html|title = Don't fall for Wiki-denial: there's nothing wrong with using Wikipedia|last = Farrelly|first = Elizabeth|date = 9 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 10 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Farrelly practised as an architect in London until 1988, working at Pollard Thomas and Edwards Architects, London; at JASMaD Architects, [[Auckland]]; and Warren and Mahoney, [[Christchurch]]. She was the inaugural chair of the [[Australia Award for Urban Design]], an award "established to recognise recent urban design projects of high quality in Australia and to encourage cities, towns and emerging settlements of all sizes to strive similarly for improvement".&lt;ref name="Australia Award for Urban Design"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.planning.org.au/whatson/australia-award-for-urban-design | title=Australia Award for Urban Design | accessdate=11 January 2011 | author=Planning Institute Australia | work=website | publisher=Planning Institute Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as a juror for design awards such as Parramatta Design Excellence Awards and the [[Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal|Royal Australian Institute of Architects Awards]].

==Public service==
Elizabeth Farrelly served as an independent Councillor of the [[City of Sydney]] from 1991 to 1995.

She writes a weekly column and regular essays for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', one of which, on "the destructive myth of professionalism", was among the editor's best comment pieces of 2015.&lt;ref name=Professionalism&gt;{{cite news|last = Editor|title=15 of our best comment pieces of 2015|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/15-of-our-best-comment-pieces-of-2015-20151229-glw7dm.html|accessdate=25 January 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Careervlife&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farrelly|first1=Elizabeth|title=You don't have a career.

[[File:Francesco Casanova Battaglia di cavalleria.jpg|thumb|300px|''Cavalry Battle'', currently in the [[Louvre]]]]
'''Francesco Giuseppe Casanova''' (1 June 1727, London – 8 July 1803, near [[Mödling]]) was an Italian painter who specialised in battle scenes. His older brother was [[Giacomo Casanova]], the famous adventurer, and his younger brother was [[Giovanni Battista Casanova|Giovanni Casanova]]; also a well-known painter.

== Biography ==
[[File:Paysans surpris par un orage.jpg|thumb|275px|left|''The Storm'', one of four "disaster paintings"]]
He was born in London, where his parents, [[Zanetta Farussi]], an actress, and [[Gaetano Casanova]], an actor and dancer, had a theatrical engagement.&lt;ref name="W"&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Casanova,_Francis_(DNB00) "Francis Casanova"] by Lionel Henry Cust, from the ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900'', Volume 09 @ Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rumoured that his father was actually the Prince of Wales (who shortly after became King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]); whether for scurrilous motives or publicity is unclear.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} They returned to Venice when he was still young and, after his father's death in 1733, he and his siblings were placed in the care of the [[Grimani family]].&lt;ref name="W" /&gt;

His career began in the workshops of [[Giovanni Antonio Guardi]],&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-giuseppe-casanova_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/ Brief biography] from the Enciclopedia Italiana @ [[Treccani]].&lt;/ref&gt; a very unpleasant time for him, according to the memoirs of his brother Giacomo. Later, he moved to the studios of [[Antonio Joli]], who was a set designer for the theatres owned by the Grimanis. This was also, apparently, unsatisfactory and he took up studies with the battle painter, [[Francesco Simonini]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; In 1751, upon his brother Giovanni's advice, he went to Paris and became an apprentice of [[Charles Parrocel]].&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; The following year, after Parrocel's death, he went to Dresden and spent a year studying the battle paintings at the "Gallery of the Electors of Saxony". In 1758, he returned to Paris and set himself up as a free-lance artist.

Success did not come immediately, and his first exhibition was a failure. In 1761, he became a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] member of the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] and was promoted to full member in 1763.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; As a result of favourable criticism from [[Denis Diderot]], he began to receive commissions from the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=Diderot,+Oeuvres+compl%C3%A8tes.J.+Ass%C3%A9zat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MR5tTrs8KC&amp;sig=K-hIlRxaem9g659UAp0FYaQkrSc&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=Ae1uS_jYK5_kmgO5l7jUBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Diderot on Francesco Casanova, ''Salon'' 1761, in Diderot, ''Beaux-Arts, Essais sur la peinture'', Garnier frères 1879 pp. 149–150] @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot would later express negative opinions about Casanova's work, but his reputation was already made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219Beaux-Arts,%20Essais%20sur%20la%20peinture,%20par%20J.%20Ass%E9zat,%20I,%20Paris,%20Garnier%20fr%E8res%201879%20pp.%20149-150&amp;dq=Diderot,+Salon+1763+J.+Ass%E9zat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MR5tTru9IC&amp;sig=LNRWKC9GrZ1u5VhFMb7O3Rv3d8s&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=PvVuS9rdEdOrsAb46MiABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Diderot on Francesco Casanova, ''Salon'' 1763 in Diderot, ''Beaux-Arts, Essais sur la peinture'', Garnier frères 1879 p. 219] @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; His fame soon spread eastward and he received commissions from [[Catherine the Great]] for the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], beginning in 1768. Two years later, he produced his four famous "disaster paintings", which were purchased by [[Jean-Benjamin de la Borde]] on behalf of King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. In 1771, he exhibited two large canvases depicting scenes from the [[Thirty Years' War]] (The [[Battle of Freiburg]] and the [[Battle of Lens]]) and once again won Diderot's approval.

===Personal life===
[[File:Casanova Cattle on pasture.jpg|thumb|300px|''Cattle on pasture'', [[Łazienki Palace|Palace on the Water]] in [[Warsaw]].]]
In 1762, he had married Jeanne-Marie Jolivet (1734–1773) a ballerina with the theatre of the [[Comédie-Italienne]] who was known as "Mademoiselle d'Alancour". Her professional connections also supplied him with many clients. In 1775, two years after her death, he married the recently widowed Jeanne Cathérine Delachaux (1748–1818). The marriage turned out to be a disaster, so he abandoned her in 1783,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histoireeurope.fr/RechercheLocution.php?Locutions=Jeanne+Catherine+Delachaux Jeanne Delachaux] @ Histoire de l'Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; aided and abetted by Giacomo. He took refuge in Vienna, under the protection of Prince [[Charles-Joseph, 7th Prince of Ligne|Charles Joseph de Ligne]], who introduced him to [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Chancellor Kaunitz]]. It appears that Francesco was almost as extroverted and entertaining as his brother Giacomo, so he quickly became popular at the Viennese Court.

In addition to his paintings, he produced designs for [[tapestries]] and upholstery which proved very lucrative. From 1770 to 1787, the [[Beauvais tapestry|Royal Beauvais Manufactory]] used more than seventy of his patterns.

Despite his success and his many aristocratic clients, he squandered his money, was perpetually in debt, and died in poverty at his home near Mödling. The year is generally given as 1803, although some sources have 1805 or 1807.

'''Gladvertising''' (n) is [[outdoor advertising]] that uses cameras and [[facial recognition software]] to read a consumer's [[mood (psychology)|mood]], then pushes products relevant to the target [[emotional state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Keats, Jonathan|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/06/st_jw_gladvertising/|title=Jargon Watch|work=Wired Magazine|date=July 2011|page= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[emotion recognition]] software to tailor outdoor adverts to consumers' mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jazarah.net/the-real-minority-report-gladvertising-kick-starts-revolution-in-outdoor-advertising/|title=The real Minority Report: "Gladvertising" kick starts revolution in outdoor advertising|work=jazarah.net|date=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms was coined in a July 2011 report by the Centre of Future Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.3mgtg.com/PDF/3MGTG_Up_Front_and_Personal_Report.pdf | title=Up Front and Personal Digital Out-Of-Home Communications | publisher=Centre of Future Studies | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409070651/http://www.3mgtg.com/PDF/3MGTG_Up_Front_and_Personal_Report.pdf | archivedate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.futurestudies.co.uk/home.htm|title=Futurist Think Tank &amp; Strategic Futures Consultants: The centre for future studies|publisher=futurestudies.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that advertisements like the ones in the film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' may be well on the way, and indeed, that some already exist. Their report – commissioned by 3MGTG, which specialises in digital advertising – foresees the first step to be advertisements that adapt to our moods.

The technology has been dubbed 'Gladverts' by the report's authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://technologyinf.com/electronics/minority-report-like-adverts/|title=Minority Report-like adverts|work=www.technologyinf.com|date=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">A '''harpsichordist''' is a person who plays the [[harpsichord]].

Many [[baroque music|baroque]] composers played the harpsichord, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[François Couperin]] and [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]. At this time, it was common for such musicians also to play the [[pipe organ|organ]], and all [[keyboard instrument]]s, and to direct orchestral music while playing [[Figured bass|continuo]] on the instrument.

Modern harpsichord playing can be roughly divided into three eras, beginning with the career of the influential reviver of the instrument, [[Wanda Landowska]]. At this stage of the 'harpsichord revival', players generally used harpsichords of a heavy, piano-influenced type made by makers such as [[Ignaz Pleyel|Pleyel]]; the revival of the instrument also led some composers to write specifically for the instrument, often on the request of Landowska. An influential later group of English players using post-Pleyel instruments by Thomas Goff and the [[Robert Goble|Goble]] family included [[George Malcolm (musician)|George Malcolm]] and [[Thurston Dart]]. Beginning in the 1920s, [[Gavin Williamson (harpsichordist)|Gavin Williamson]] and [[Philip Manuel]] also helped popularize the harpsichord through concert tours, and were, in fact, the world's only full-time harpsichord duo, known as Manuel and Williamson, performing throughout North American and Europe. They had studied for many years with Wanda Landowska both in France and in New York. In the 1930s Manual and Williamson made the first recordings of the Bach multiple keyboard concerti with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and the duo also gave the American premiere performance of Bach's Concerto in C major for two harpsichords. In addition, they gave American premieres of many works of Couperin and Rameau, among other composers. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-04-25/news/8904070185_1_harpsichords-music-mr-williamson|title=Gavin Williamson: Helped save harpsichord|publisher=Chicago Trubune|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of harpsichordists were pioneers of modern performance on instruments built according to the [[Authentic performance|authentic practices]] of the earlier period, following the research of such scholar-builders as [[Frank Hubbard]] and [[William Dowd]]. This generation of performers included such players as [[Isolde Ahlgrimm|Isohlde Ahlgrimm]],  [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]], [[Igor Kipnis]], and [[Gustav Leonhardt]]. More recently, many outstanding harpsichordists have appeared, such as [[Scott Ross (harpsichordist)|Scott Ross]], [[Trevor Pinnock]], [[Kenneth Gilbert]], [[Christopher Hogwood]], [[Jos van Immerseel]], [[Ton Koopman]], [[Gary Cooper (musician)|Gary Cooper]] and [[David Schrader]], with many of them also directing a [[baroque orchestra]] from the instrument.

'''''Horton and the Kwuggerbug and More Lost Stories''''' is an anthology of children's stories written and illustrated by [[Dr. Seuss]], published posthumously by [[Random House]] in 2014.

==Background==
The four stories in this book were originally published as installments of a monthly column that Dr. Seuss wrote for ''[[Redbook]]'' during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Migaki|first1=Lauren|title=Horton Meets A... Who?|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/09/08/345880696/horton-meets-a-who-introducing-the-kwuggerbug-from-seuss-lost-stories|accessdate=12 March 2015|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Seuss died in 1991, but the stories were later rediscovered by Seuss scholar Charles D. Cohen.&lt;ref name=WT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taube|first1=Michael|title=BOOK REVIEW: ‘Horton and the Kwuggerbug and More Lost Stories’|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/6/book-review-the-lost-and-found-dr-seuss/?page=all|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plots==
The four stories included in the book are as follows:
*"Horton and the Kwuggerbug": A Kwuggerbug lands on [[Horton the Elephant]]'s trunk and asks him to take him to his beezlenut tree, which Horton agrees to since when they get there the bug promises Horton will get half the nuts. The journey to the beezlenut tree is quite hazardous, and Horton goes through all the hardships including swimming across a large crocodile infested river and climbing a large and rocky mountain, with the Kwuggerbug taking advantage of Horton's good nature. In the end, the Kwuggerbug tries to double-cross Horton, but a well-timed sneeze makes things more even.
*"Marco Comes Late": Marco from ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]'' explains to his teacher why he was late for school. His explanation involves a bird who landed on his books and laid an egg there, and various animals who argue over whether he should protect the egg or get to school on time. In the end, the teacher sees through the tall tale for the morsel of truth.
*"How Officer Pat Saved the Whole Town": Officer Pat sees a gnat about to disturb a cat and realizes this could be the start of a string of disasters that could obliterate the town. He intervenes and the town is saved.
*"The Hoobub and the Grinch": A very short story in which a [[Grinch]] convinces a Hoobub that a piece of green string is better than the sun.

==Reception==
Michael Taube of ''[[The Washington Times]]'' was enthusiastic about the book, writing, "If you loved Dr. Seuss as a child (and as an adult), these little-known stories will bring back many fond memories."&lt;ref name=WT/&gt; The reviewer for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' was more critical, stating, "By no means gems, these archives suggest how Geisel tinkered with characters, developed his signature [[tetrameter]], and commented on ethical issues, circa 1950."&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite news|title=Horton and the Kwuggerbug: And More Lost Stories|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-38298-4|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese art''' covers a wide range of art styles and media, including [[Jōmon Pottery|ancient pottery]], [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]], [[Ink wash painting|ink painting]] and [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on silk and paper, ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], ceramics, [[origami]], and more recently [[manga]]—modern Japanese [[cartoon]]ing and comics—along with a myriad of other types. It has a long history, ranging from the beginnings of human habitation in Japan, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present.

Japan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with [[Buddhism]]. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the [[Ōnin War]] (1467–1477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.

[[Painting]] is the preferred artistic expression in Japan, practiced by amateurs and professionals alike. Until modern times, the Japanese wrote with a [[Ink brush|brush]] rather than a [[pen]], and their familiarity with brush techniques has made them particularly sensitive to the values and [[aesthetics]] of painting. With the rise of popular culture in the [[Edo period]], a style of woodblock prints became a major form and its techniques were fine tuned to produce colorful prints.  The Japanese, in this period, found [[sculpture]] a much less sympathetic medium for artistic expression; most Japanese sculpture is associated with [[religion]], and the medium's use declined with the lessening importance of traditional Buddhism.

[[Japanese pottery|Japanese ceramics]] are among the finest in the world and include the earliest known artifacts of their culture. In [[Japanese architecture|architecture]], Japanese preferences for natural materials and an interaction of interior and exterior space are clearly expressed.

== History of Japanese art ==

=== Jōmon art ===
The first settlers of Japan, the [[Jōmon]] people (c. 11000&amp;nbsp;– c. 300 BC), named for the [[rope|cord]] markings that decorated the surfaces of their clay vessels, were nomadic hunter-gatherers who later practiced organized farming and built cities with populations of hundreds if not thousands. They built simple houses of wood and thatch set into shallow earthen pits to provide warmth from the soil. They crafted [[Jōmon pottery|lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels]], clay figurines called ''[[dogū]]'', and crystal jewels.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Yayoi art===
The next wave of immigrants was the [[Yayoi]] people, named for the district in [[Tokyo]] where remnants of their settlements first were found. These people, arriving in Japan about 350 BC, brought their knowledge of wetland rice cultivation, the manufacture of copper weapons and bronze bells (''[[dōtaku]]''), and wheel-thrown, kiln-fired [[ceramics]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Kofun art===

The third stage in Japanese prehistory, the [[Kofun]] period (c. 250&amp;nbsp;– 552 AD), represents a modification of [[Yayoi]] culture, attributable either to internal development or external force. The period is named for the large number of ''kofun'' [[Tumulus|megalithic tombs]] created during this period. In this period, diverse groups of people formed political alliances and coalesced into a nation. Typical artifacts are bronze mirrors, symbols of political alliances, and clay sculptures called ''[[haniwa]]'' which were erected outside tombs.

===Asuka and Nara art===

[[File:Dragon head Pitcher former Horyuji.JPG|thumb|150px|A dragon-head pitcher with [[Pegasus]] pattern incised, [[Gilding|gilded]] bronze　with silver, Asuka period, 7th century, former [[Horyu-ji]] Temple treasures, [[Tokyo National Museum]]]]

During the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s, so named because the seat of Japanese government was located in the Asuka Valley from 552 to 710 and in the city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] until 784, the first significant influx of continental Asian culture took place in Japan.

The transmission of Buddhism provided the initial impetus for contacts between China, Korea and Japan. The Japanese recognized the facets of [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] that could profitably be incorporated into their own: a system for converting ideas and sounds into writing; [[historiography]]; complex theories of government, such as an effective [[bureaucracy]]; and, most important for the arts, new technologies, new building techniques, more advanced methods of casting in [[bronze]], and new techniques and media for painting.

Throughout the 7th and 8th centuries, however, the major focus in contacts between Japan and the Asian continent was the development of Buddhism. Not all scholars agree on the significant dates and the appropriate names to apply to various time periods between 552, the official date of the introduction of Buddhism into Japan, and 784, when the Japanese capital was transferred from Nara. The most common designations are the Suiko period, 552–645; the [[Hakuhō period]], 645–710, and the Tenpyō period, 710–784.

""It should also be pointed out that there was considerable influence from Koguryo on the southern kingdoms of Paekche and Silla even though Paekche also received direct influence from south China, as was mentioned above." "I have argued that various groups, including official envoys, monks and students, as well as Korean settlers, were responsible for bringing Korean icons to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the [[Kōryū-ji]] [[Maitreya|Miroku]] Bosatsu and the [[Chūgū-ji]] [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] statues.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;

They illustrate the terminal point of the [[Silk Road transmission of art]] during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese [[Fūjin]] Wind God,&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins.&amp;nbsp;... One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p. 21)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Niō]] guardians,&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of [[Vajrapani]] should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules.&amp;nbsp;... The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardina Deities (Niō)." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; and the near-[[classical antiquity|Classical]] floral patterns in temple decorations.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Buddhist structures still extant in Japan, and the oldest wooden buildings in the [[Far East]] are found at the [[Hōryū-ji]] to the southwest of Nara. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]], it consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or ''Kondō'' (Golden Hall), and ''Gojū-no-tō'' (Five-story [[Pagoda]]), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. The ''Kondō'', in the style of [[Buddhism in China|Chinese worship]] halls, is a two-story structure of post-and-beam construction, capped by an ''[[irimoya]]'', or hipped-gabled roof of ceramic tiles.

Inside the ''Kondō'', on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period. The central image is a Shaka Trinity (623), the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] flanked by two [[bodhisattva]]s, sculpture cast in bronze by the sculptor [[Tori Busshi]] (flourished early 7th century) in homage to the recently deceased Prince Shōtoku. At the four corners of the platform are the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Guardian Kings of the Four Directions]], carved in wood around 650. Also housed at [[Hōryū-ji]] is the [[Tamamushi]] Shrine, a wooden replica of a ''Kondō'', which is set on a high wooden base that is decorated with figural paintings executed in a medium of mineral pigments mixed with lacquer.

Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2-m (53-ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or ''Daibutsuden'', is a [[Rushana]] Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the [[Edo period]].

Clustered around the Daibutsuden on a gently sloping hillside are a number of secondary halls: the ''[[Hokke-dō]]'' (Lotus Sutra Hall), with its principal image, the [[Fukukenjaku Kannon|Fukukenjaku]] [[Kannon]] (不空羂索観音立像, the most popular bodhisattva), crafted of dry lacquer (cloth dipped in lacquer and shaped over a wooden armature); the ''[[Kaidanin]]'' (戒壇院, Ordination Hall) with its magnificent clay statues of the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Four Guardian Kings]]; and the storehouse, called the ''[[Shōsōin]]''. This last structure is of great importance as an art-historical cache, because in it are stored the utensils that were used in the temple's dedication ceremony in 752, the eye-opening ritual for the Rushana image, as well as government documents and many secular objects owned by the Imperial family.

'''Choukin''' (or '''chōkin'''), the art of metal [[engraving]] or sculpting, is thought to have started in the Nara period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choukin (彫金)|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/c/choukin.htm|website=[[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System|JAANUS]]|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frédéric|first1=Louis|last2=Roth|first2=Käthe|title=Japan Encyclopedia|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=120|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heian art===
[[File:Kongokai.jpg|thumb|170px|Taizokai Mandala]]
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|170px|Taizokai Mandala, [[Tō-ji]] owning]]
In 794 the capital of Japan was officially transferred to Heian-kyō (present-day [[Kyoto]]), where it remained until 1868. The term ''[[Heian period]]'' refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at the end of the [[Genpei War]]. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara era]], the pivotal date being 894, the year [[Imperial Japanese embassies to China|imperial embassies to China]] were officially discontinued.

'''Early Heian art:''' In reaction to the growing wealth and power of organized [[Buddhism]] in Nara, the priest [[Kūkai]] (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) journeyed to China to study [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]], a form of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, which he introduced into Japan in 806. At the core of Shingon worship are [[mandala]]s, diagrams of the spiritual universe, which then began to influence temple design. Japanese Buddhist architecture also adopted the [[stupa]], originally an [[Indian architecture|Indian architectural form]], in its Chinese-style pagoda.

The temples erected for this new sect were built in the mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary.

The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the [[Murō-ji]] (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara. The wooden image (also early 9th century) of [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni]], the "historic" Buddha, enshrined in a secondary building at the [[Murō-ji]], is typical of the early Heian sculpture, with its ponderous body, covered by thick drapery folds carved in the ''[[honpa-shiki]]'' (rolling-wave) style, and its austere, withdrawn facial expression.

'''Fujiwara art:''' In the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara period]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]], which offered easy salvation through belief in [[Amitabha|Amida]] (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the [[Fujiwara family]], then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as [[Sesshō and Kampaku|regents]] for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. So secure and beautiful was their world that they could not conceive of Paradise as being much different. They created a new form of Buddha hall, the Amida hall, which blends the secular with the religious, and houses one or more Buddha images within a structure resembling the mansions of the nobility.

[[File:Byodo-in Uji01pbs2640.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Byōdō-in]] Phoenix Hall, [[Uji, Kyoto]]]]
The ''Hō-ō-dō'' (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by [[Jōchō]], who used a new canon of proportions and a new technique (''[[yosegi]]''), in which multiple pieces of wood are carved out like shells and joined from the inside. Applied to the walls of the hall are small relief carvings of celestials, the host believed to have accompanied Amida when he descended from the Western Paradise to gather the souls of believers at the moment of death and transport them in lotus blossoms to Paradise. ''[[Raigō]]'' paintings on the wooden doors of the Hō-ō-dō, depicting the Descent of the Amida Buddha, are an early example of [[Yamato-e]], Japanese-style painting, and contain representations of the scenery around Kyoto.

[[File:Genji emaki YADORIGI 2.JPG|thumb|260px|"YADORI GI" of [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]]]]
'''E-maki''': In the last century of the Heian period, the horizontal, illustrated narrative handscroll, known as ''[[emaki|e-maki]]'' (絵巻, lit. "picture scroll"), came to the fore. Dating from about 1130, the ''[[Genji Monogatari Emaki]]'', a famous illustrated ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' represents the earliest surviving yamato-e handscroll, and one of the high points of Japanese painting. Written about the year 1000 by [[Murasaki Shikibu]], a lady-in-waiting to the Empress [[Akiko (Empress)|Akiko]], the novel deals with the life and loves of Genji and the world of the Heian court after his death. The 12th-century artists of the ''e-maki'' version devised a system of pictorial conventions that convey visually the emotional content of each scene. In the second half of the century, a different, livelier style of continuous narrative illustration became popular. The ''[[Ban Dainagon Ekotoba]]'' (late 12th century), a scroll that deals with an intrigue at court, emphasizes figures in active motion depicted in rapidly executed brush strokes and thin but vibrant colors.

''E-maki'' also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the ''[[otoko-e]]'' ("men's pictures") and ''[[onna-e]]'' ("women's pictures") styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of the genders. But perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. ''Onna-e'', epitomized by the Tale of Genji handscroll, typically deals with court life, particularly the court ladies, and with romantic themes. ''Otoko-e'' often recorded historical events, particularly battles. The [[Siege of Sanjō Palace|Siege of the Sanjō Palace]] (1160), depicted in the "Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace" section of the [[Heiji Monogatari]] handscroll is a famous example of this style.

===Kamakura art===

[[File:Saidaiji Monastery Gilt Bronze Reliquary (478).jpg|thumb|170px|Gilt bronze reliquary in openwork (kondō sukashibari sharitō)]]

In 1180 a war broke out between the two most powerful warrior clans, the [[Taira]] and the [[Minamoto]]; five years later the Minamoto emerged victorious and established a de facto seat of government at the seaside village of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], where it remained until 1333. With the shift of power from the nobility to the warrior class, the arts had to satisfy a new audience: men devoted to the skills of warfare, priests committed to making Buddhism available to illiterate commoners, and conservatives, the nobility and some members of the priesthood who regretted the declining power of the court. Thus, realism, a popularizing trend, and a classical revival characterize the art of the [[Kamakura period]]. In the Kamakura period, [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] remained the centres of artistic production and high culture.

[[File:Muchaku (detail, 2).jpg|thumb|left|210px|Detail of [[Muchaku]] at [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] by [[Unkei]]]]
'''Sculpture:''' The [[Kei school]] of sculptors, particularly [[Unkei]], created a new, more realistic style of sculpture. The two [[Niō]] guardian images (1203) in the Great South Gate of the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara illustrate Unkei's dynamic supra-realistic style. The images, about 8 m (about 26&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, were carved of multiple blocks in a period of about three months, a feat indicative of a developed studio system of artisans working under the direction of a master sculptor. Unkei's polychromed wood sculptures (1208, [[Kōfuku-ji]], Nara) of two Indian sages, [[Muchaku]] and [[Seshin]], the legendary founders of the [[Dharma character school|Hossō sect]], are among the most accomplished realistic works of the period; as rendered by Unkei, they are remarkably individualized and believable images. One of the most famous works of this period is an [[Amitabha]] Triad (completed in 1195), in [[Jōdo-ji (Ono)|Jōdo-ji in Ono]], created by [[Kaikei]], Unkei's successor.

'''Calligraphy and painting:''' The ''[[Kegon Engi Emaki]]'', the illustrated history of the founding of the [[Kegon]] sect, is an excellent example of the popularizing trend in Kamakura painting. The Kegon sect, one of the most important in the Nara period, fell on hard times during the ascendancy of the [[Pure Land]] sects. After the Genpei War (1180–1185), Priest [[Myōe]] of [[Kōzan-ji]] sought to revive the sect and also to provide a refuge for women widowed by the war. The wives of samurai had been discouraged from learning more than a [[syllabary]] system for transcribing sounds and ideas (see [[kana]]), and most were incapable of reading texts that employed Chinese ideographs ([[kanji]]).

Thus, the ''[[Kegon Engi Emaki]]'' combines passages of text, written with a maximum of easily readable syllables, and illustrations that have the dialogue between characters written next to the speakers, a technique comparable to contemporary comic strips. The plot of the ''e-maki'', the lives of the two Korean priests who founded the Kegon sect, is swiftly paced and filled with fantastic feats such as a journey to the palace of the Ocean King, and a poignant mom story.{{clarify|date=April 2016}}

A work in a more conservative vein is the illustrated version of [[The Murasaki Shikibu Diary|Murasaki Shikibu's diary]]. ''E-maki'' versions of her novel continued to be produced, but the nobility, attuned to the new interest in realism yet nostalgic for past days of wealth and power, revived and illustrated the diary in order to recapture the splendor of the author's times. One of the most beautiful passages illustrates the episode in which Murasaki Shikibu is playfully held prisoner in her room by two young courtiers, while, just outside, moonlight gleams on the mossy banks of a rivulet in the imperial garden.

=== Muromachi art ===
{{Main|Higashiyama period}}

During the [[Muromachi period]] (1338–1573), also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The [[Ashikaga clan]] took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the [[Muromachi district]] of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. [[Zen]] Buddhism, the [[Ch'an]] sect　traditionally thought to have been founded in China in the 6th century, was introduced for a second time into Japan and took root.

[[File:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Karesansui of [[Ryōan-ji]], Kyoto]]

'''Painting:''' Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of Yamato-e yielded to the [[Sumi-e|monochromes]] of painting in the Chinese manner, where paintings generally only have black and white or different tones of a single color.

Typical of early Muromachi painting is the depiction by the priest-painter [[Kao (painter)|Kao]] (active early 15th century) of the legendary monk [[Kensu]] (Hsien-tzu in Chinese) at the moment he achieved enlightenment. This type of painting was executed with quick brush strokes and a minimum of detail. ''Catching a Catfish with a Gourd'' (early 15th century, [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto), by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]] (active c. 1400), marks a turning point in Muromachi painting. Executed originally for a low-standing screen, it has been remounted as a hanging scroll with inscriptions by contemporary figures above, one of which refers to the painting as being in the "new style". In the foreground a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background mountains appear to be far in the distance. It is generally assumed that the "new style" of the painting, executed about 1413, refers to a more Chinese sense of deep space within the picture plane.

The foremost artists of the Muromachi period are the priest-painters [[Tenshō Shūbun|Shūbun]] and [[Sesshū Tōyō|Sesshū]]. Shūbun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]], created in the painting ''Reading in a Bamboo Grove'' (1446) a realistic landscape with deep recession into space. Sesshū, unlike most artists of the period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. ''Landscape of the Four Seasons'' (''Sansui Chokan''; c. 1486) is one of Sesshu's most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.

=== Azuchi-Momoyama art ===

[[File:Kano Eitoku - Cypress Trees.jpg|thumb|350px|''[[Cypress Trees]] Byōbu'', folding screen by [[Kanō Eitoku]], 1590]]

In the [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1573–1603), a succession of military leaders, such as [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], attempted to bring peace and political stability to Japan after an era of almost 100 years of warfare. Oda, a minor chieftain, acquired power sufficient to take [[de facto]] control of the government in 1568 and, five years later, to oust the last Ashikaga shogun. Hideyoshi took command after Oda's death, but his plans to establish hereditary rule were foiled by Ieyasu, who established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1603.

'''Painting:''' The most important school of painting in the Momoyama period was that of the [[Kanō school]], and the greatest innovation of the period was the formula, developed by [[Kanō Eitoku]], for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. The decoration of the main room facing the garden of the [[Jukō-in]], a subtemple of [[Daitoku-ji]] (a Zen temple in Kyoto), is perhaps the best extant example of Eitoku's work. A massive ''[[ume]]'' tree and twin pines are depicted on pairs of sliding screens in diagonally opposite corners, their trunks repeating the verticals of the corner posts and their branches extending to left and right, unifying the adjoining panels. Eitoku's screen, ''Chinese Lions'', also in Kyoto, reveals the bold, brightly colored style of painting preferred by the samurai.

[[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], a contemporary of Eitoku, developed a somewhat different and more decorative style for large-scale screen paintings. In his ''[[Maple Screen]]'' (楓図), now in the temple of [[Chishaku-in]] ([[:ja:智積院]]), Kyoto, he placed the trunk of the tree in the center and extended the limbs nearly to the edge of the composition, creating a flatter, less architectonic work than Eitoku, but a visually gorgeous painting. His sixfold screen, ''[[Pine Wood]]'' (松林図), is a masterly rendering in [[sumi-e|monochrome ink]] of a grove of trees enveloped in mist.

===Art of the Edo period===

[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|210x210px|The print ''[[Red Fuji]]'' from [[Hokusai]]'s series ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]

The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] gained undisputed control of the government in 1603 with a commitment to bring peace and economic and political stability to the country; in large measure it was successful. The shogunate survived until 1867, when it was forced to capitulate because of its failure to deal with pressure from Western nations to open the country to foreign trade. One of the dominant themes in the Edo period was the repressive policies of the shogunate and the attempts of artists to escape these strictures. The foremost of these was the closing of the country to foreigners and the accoutrements of their cultures, and the imposition of strict codes of behavior affecting every aspect of life, the clothes one wore, the person one married, and the activities one could or should not pursue.

In the early years of the [[Edo period]], however, the full impact of Tokugawa policies had not yet been felt, and some of Japan's finest expressions in architecture and painting were produced: Katsura Palace in Kyoto and the paintings of [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]], pioneer of the [[Rinpa school]].

'''Architecture:''' [[Katsura Detached Palace]], built in imitation of [[The Tale of Genji|Genji]]'s palace, contains a cluster of shoin buildings that combine elements of classic Japanese architecture with innovative restatements. The whole complex is surrounded by a beautiful garden with paths for walking.
Many of powerful ''daimyōs'' (feudal lords) built a [[Japanese garden|Circuit style Japanese garden]] in the territory country, and competed for the beauty.

'''Painting:''' Sōtatsu evolved a superb decorative style by re-creating themes from classical literature, using brilliantly colored figures and motifs from the natural world set against gold-leaf backgrounds. One of his finest works is the pair of screens ''The Waves at Matsushima'' in the [[Freer Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. A century later, Kōrin reworked Sōtatsu's style and created visually gorgeous works uniquely his own. Perhaps his finest are the screen paintings of ''[[Red and White Plum Blossoms]]''.

'''Sculpture''' The Buddhist monk [[Enkū]] carved 120,000 Buddhist images in a rough, individual style.

'''Ukiyo-e and Bunjinga:''' The school of art best known in the West is that of the [[ukiyo-e]] paintings and [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] of the demimonde, the world of the [[kabuki]] theater and the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]]. Ukiyo-e prints began to be produced in the late 17th century; in 1765 [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]] produced the first [[Nishiki-e|polychrome print]]. Print designers of the next generation, including [[Torii Kiyonaga]] and [[Utamaro]], created elegant and sometimes insightful depictions of courtesans.

In the 19th century the dominant figures were [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]], the latter a creator of romantic and somewhat sentimental landscape prints. The odd angles and shapes through which Hiroshige often viewed landscape, and the work of Kiyonaga and Utamaro, with its emphasis on flat planes and strong linear outlines, had a profound impact on such Western artists as [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].  Via artworks held in Western museums, these same printmakers would later exert a powerful influence on the imagery and aesthetic approaches used by early [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[Richard Aldington]] and [[H.D.]]&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

A school of painting contemporary with ukiyo-e was [[Nanga (Japanese painting)|Nanga]], or Bunjinga, a style based on paintings executed by Chinese scholar-painters. Just as ukiyo-e artists chose to depict figures from life outside the strictures of the Tokugawa shogunate, Bunjin artists turned to Chinese culture. The exemplars of this style are [[Ike no Taiga]], [[Yosa Buson]], [[Tanomura Chikuden]], and [[Yamamoto Baiitsu]] ([[:ja:山本梅逸]]).

'''Ceramics'''
{{main|Japanese pottery and porcelain|Japanese export porcelain}}
Traditional, mostly [[stoneware]], styles continued in many parts of Japan, but Japanese ceramics were transformed around the start of the Edo period, by a large influx of Korean potters, captured or persuaded to emigrate in the course of the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s]].  Many of these were settled on the southern island of [[Kyushu]], and they brought with them experience of versions of the Chinese-style chambered [[Dragon kiln|climbing kiln]], called ''[[noborigama]]'' in Japan, which allowed high temperatures with more precise control.  By around 1620 they had discovered deposits of [[kaolinite]], and started to make porcelain for the first time in Japan.  The early wares (called "Early Imari") were relatively small and imitated the Chinese [[underglaze]] [[blue and white porcelain]], which Japan had been importing for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Impey, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

The porcelain industry greatly expanded in the late 1650s, as the collapse of the Chinese industry from civil war led to very large orders from the Chinese traders and the [[Dutch East India Company]], by then the traders only permitted to do business in Japan. The first great period of [[Japanese export porcelain]] lasted until about the 1740s, and the great bulk of Japanese porcelain was made for export, mostly to Europe, but also the Islamic world to the west and south of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Impey, 71-74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art of the Prewar period===

When [[Emperor of Japan]] regained ruling power in 1868, Japan was once again invaded by new and alien forms of culture. During the [[Empire of Japan|Prewar period]], The introduction of Western cultural values led to a dichotomy in Japanese art, as well as in nearly every other aspect of culture, between traditional values and attempts to duplicate and assimilate a variety of clashing new ideas. This split remained evident in the late 20th century, although much synthesis had by then already occurred, and created an international cultural atmosphere and stimulated contemporary Japanese arts toward ever more innovative forms.

[[File:Summer Airing by Kawamura Kiyoo (Tokyo National Museum).jpg|thumb|210x210px|''Summer Airing'', by [[Kawamura Kiyoo]], [[Tokyo National Museum]], Japan]]

By the early 20th century, European art forms were well introduced and their marriage produced notable buildings like the [[Tokyo Station|Tokyo Train Station]] and the [[National Diet Building]] that still exist today.

A lot of artistic new [[Japanese gardens]] were built with ''[[Ogawa Jihei VII|Jihei Ogawa]]''.

''[[Manga]]'' cartoons flourished the Meiji period, influenced greatly by English and French [[editorial cartoon|political cartoons]]. However, some art popular in the Meiji era, such as [[jōge-e]] (reversible images), is no longer popular in modern Japan.

'''Architecture:''' [[Tokyo Station]], a building of [[Giyōfū architecture]], full of [[brick]]s and pseudo-European style. This style of building was built in urban areas.

'''Painting''': The first response of the Japanese to Western art forms was open-hearted acceptance, and in 1876 the [[Technological Art School]] was opened, employing Italian instructors to teach Western methods. The second response was a pendulum swing in the opposite direction spearheaded by [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and the American [[Ernest Fenollosa]], who encouraged Japanese artists to retain traditional themes and techniques while creating works more in keeping with contemporary taste.  This was a strategy that eventually served to extend the influence of Japanese art as far as Calcutta, London, and Boston in the years leading up to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/asia-and-modernism Video of a Lecture discussing the importance of Okakura and Japanese Art to Global Modernism], ''[[School of Advanced Study]]'', July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these two poles of artistic theory—derived from Europe and from East Asia respectively—developed ''[[yōga]]'' ("Western-style painting") and [[Nihonga]] ("Japanese painting"), categories that have maintained currency.

===Art of the Postwar period===
After the [[surrender of Japan|end of World War II]] in 1945, many artists began working art forms derived from the international scene, moving away from local artistic developments into the mainstream of world art. But traditional Japanese conceptions endured, particularly in the use of modular space in architecture, certain spacing intervals in music and dance, a propensity for certain color combinations and characteristic literary forms.

Art from 1603 to 1945 (Edo period and Prewar period) were supported by merchants. Counter to Edo period and Prewar period, art of [[Postwar Japan|Postwar period]] was changed to the art which is supported by people as consumers. The wide variety of art forms available to the Japanese reflect the vigorous state of the arts, widely supported by the Japanese people and promoted by the government. In the 1950s and 1960s, Japan's artistic [[avant garde]] include the internationally influential [[Gutai group]], which originated or anticipated various postwar genres such as [[performance art]], [[installation art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[wearable art]]. In photography, [[Kansuke Yamamoto (artist)|Kansuke Yamamoto]] was prominent.

American art and architecture greatly influenced Japan.  Though fear of earthquakes severely restricted the building of a skyscraper, technological advances let Japanese build larger and higher buildings with more artistic outlooks.

As Japan has always made little distinction between 'fine art' and 'decorative art', as the West has done since the Renaissance, it is important to note Japan's significant and unique contributions to the fields of art in entertainment, commercial uses, and graphic design. Cartoons imported from America led to [[anime]] that at first were derived exclusively from manga stories.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Today, anime abounds, and many artists and studios have risen to great fame as artists; [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and the artists and animators of [[Studio Ghibli]] are generally regarded to be among the best the anime world has to offer. Japan also flourishes in the fields of [[graphic design]], commercial art (e.g. billboards, magazine advertisements), and in [[video game]] graphics and concept art.

====Contemporary art in Japan====
Japanese modern art takes as many forms and expresses as many different ideas as modern art in general, worldwide. It ranges from advertisements, anime, video games, and architecture as already mentioned, to sculpture, painting, and drawing in all their myriad forms.

Many artists do continue to paint in the traditional manner, with black ink and color on paper or silk. Some of these depict traditional subject matter in the traditional styles, while others explore new and different motifs and styles, while using the traditional media. Still others eschew native media and styles, embracing Western oil paints or any number of other forms.

In sculpture, the same holds true; some artists stick to the traditional modes, some doing it with a modern flair, and some choose Western or brand new modes, styles, and media. [[Yo Akiyama]] is just one of many modern Japanese sculptors. He works primarily in clay pottery and ceramics, creating works that are very simple and straightforward, looking like they were created out of the earth itself. Another sculptor, using iron and other modern materials, built a large modern art sculpture in the [[Israel]]i port city of [[Haifa]], called ''Hanabi'' (Fireworks). [[Nahoko Kojima]] is a contemporary Kirie artist who has pioneered the technique of Paper Cut Sculpture which hangs in 3d.

[[Takashi Murakami]] is arguably one of the most well-known Japanese modern artists in the Western world. Murakami and the other artists in his studio create pieces in a style, inspired by anime, which he has dubbed "[[superflat]]". His pieces take a multitude of forms, from painting to sculpture, some truly massive in size. But most if not all show very clearly this anime influence, utilizing bright colors and simplified details.

==Performing arts==

A remarkable number of the traditional forms of Japanese music, dance, and theater have survived in the contemporary world, enjoying some popularity through reidentification with Japanese cultural values. Traditional music and dance, which trace their origins to ancient religious use—[[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]], [[Shinto|Shintō]], and [[folk dance|folk]]—have been preserved in the dramatic performances of [[Noh]], [[Kabuki]], and [[bunraku]] theater. Ancient court music and dance forms deriving from continental sources were preserved through Imperial household musicians and temple and shrine troupes. Some of the oldest musical instruments in the world have been in continuous use in Japan from the [[Jōmon period]], as shown by finds of stone and clay [[flute]]s and [[zither]]s having between two and four strings, to which [[Yayoi period]] metal [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[gong]]s were added to create early musical ensembles. By the early historical period (6th to 7th centuries), there were a variety of large and small [[drum]]s, gongs, [[Tubular bell|chimes]], flutes, and stringed instruments, such as the imported mandolin-like [[biwa]] and the flat six-stringed zither, which evolved into the thirteen-stringed [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]]. These instruments formed the orchestras for the 7th-century continentally derived ceremonial court music ([[gagaku]]), which, together with the accompanying [[bugaku]] (a type of court dance), are the most ancient of such forms still performed at the Imperial court, ancient temples, and shrines. [[Buddhism]] introduced the rhythmic chants, still used, that underpin [[Shigin]], and that were joined with native ideas to underlay the development of vocal music, such as in [[Noh]].

==Aesthetic concepts==
[[File:Bodhidarma.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Calligraphy of [[Bodhidharma]], "Zen points directly to the human heart, see into your nature and become Buddha", [[Hakuin Ekaku]], 17th century]]
{{Main|Japanese aesthetics}}

Japanese art is characterized by unique polarities. In the ceramics of the prehistoric periods, for example, exuberance was followed by disciplined and refined artistry. Another instance is provided by two 16th-century structures that are poles apart: the [[Katsura Detached Palace]] is an exercise in simplicity, with an emphasis on natural materials, rough and untrimmed, and an affinity for beauty achieved by accident; [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]] [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū]] is a rigidly symmetrical structure replete with brightly colored relief carvings covering every visible surface. Japanese art, valued not only for its simplicity but also for its colorful exuberance, has considerably influenced 19th-century Western painting and [[Architectural history#Modern architecture and beyond|20th-century Western architecture]].

Japan's aesthetic conceptions, deriving from diverse cultural traditions, have been formative in the production of unique art forms. Over the centuries, a wide range of artistic motifs developed and were refined, becoming imbued with symbolic significance. Like a [[pearl]], they acquired many layers of meaning and a high luster. Japanese aesthetics provide a key to understanding artistic works perceivably different from those coming from Western traditions.

Within the East Asian artistic tradition, [[China]] has been the acknowledged teacher and Japan the devoted student. Nevertheless, several Japanese arts developed their own style, which can be differentiated from various Chinese arts. The monumental, symmetrically balanced, rational approach of Chinese art forms became miniaturized, irregular, and subtly suggestive in Japanese hands. Miniature [[Japanese rock garden|rock gardens]], diminutive plants (''[[bonsai]]''), and ''[[ikebana]]'' (flower arrangements), in which the selected few represented a garden, were the favorite pursuits of refined aristocrats for a millennium, and they have remained a part of contemporary cultural life.

The diagonal, reflecting a natural flow, rather than the fixed triangle, became the favored structural device, whether in painting, architectural or garden design, dance steps, or musical notations. Odd numbers replace even numbers in the regularity of a Chinese master pattern, and a pull to one side allows a motif to turn the corner of a three-dimensional object, thus giving continuity and motion that is lacking in a static frontal design. Japanese painters used the devices of the cutoff, close-up, and fade-out by the 12th century in ''[[yamato-e]]'', or Japanese-style, scroll painting, perhaps one reason why modern filmmaking has been such a natural and successful art form in Japan. Suggestion is used rather than direct statement; oblique poetic hints and allusive and inconclusive melodies and thoughts have proved frustrating to the Westerner trying to penetrate the meanings of literature, music, painting, and even everyday language.

The Japanese began defining such aesthetic ideas in a number of evocative phrases by at least the 10th or 11th century. The courtly refinements of the aristocratic Heian period evolved into the elegant simplicity seen as the essence of good taste in the understated art that is called ''[[shibui]]''. Two terms originating from [[Zen]] Buddhist meditative practices describe degrees of tranquility: one, the repose found in humble melancholy (''[[wabi-sabi|wabi]]''), the other, the serenity accompanying the enjoyment of subdued beauty (''[[wabi-sabi|sabi]]''). Zen thought also contributed a penchant for combining the unexpected or startling, used to jolt one's consciousness toward the goal of enlightenment. In art, this approach was expressed in combinations of such unlikely materials as lead inlaid in lacquer and in clashing poetic imagery. Unexpectedly humorous and sometimes grotesque images and motifs also stem from the Zen ''[[kōan]]'' (conundrum). Although the arts have been mainly secular since the [[Edo period]], traditional aesthetics and training methods, stemming generally from religious sources, continue to underlie artistic productions.

==Artists==
{{Japanese art history}}
{{Culture of Japan}}
Traditionally, the artist was a vehicle for expression and was personally reticent, in keeping with the role of an artisan or entertainer of low social status. The [[shodo|calligrapher]], a member of the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] literati class, or [[samurai]] class in Japan, had a higher status, while artists of great genius were often recognized in the [[Kamakura period]] by receiving a name from a feudal lord and thus rising socially. The performing arts, however, were generally held in less esteem, and the purported immorality of actresses of the early [[Kabuki]] theater caused the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] government to bar women from the stage; female roles in Kabuki and Noh thereafter were played by men.

After World War II, artists typically gathered in arts associations, some of which were long-established professional societies while others reflected the latest arts movement. The [[Japan Artists League]], for example, was responsible for the largest number of major exhibitions, including the prestigious annual Nitten ([[Japan Art Exhibition]]). The [[P.E.N. Club]] of Japan (P.E.N. stands for prose, essay, and narrative), a branch of an international writers' organization, was the largest of some thirty major authors' associations. Actors, dancers, musicians, and other performing artists boasted their own societies, including the [[Kabuki Society]], organized in 1987 to maintain this art's traditional high standards, which were thought to be endangered by modern innovation. By the 1980s, however, avant-garde painters and sculptors had eschewed all groups and were "unattached" artists.

===Art schools===
There are a number of specialized universities for the arts in Japan, led by the national universities. The most important is the [[Tokyo Arts University]], one of the most difficult of all national universities to enter. Another seminal center is [[Tama Art University]], which produced many of Japan's late 20th-century innovative young artists. Traditional training in the arts, derived from Chinese traditional methods, remains; experts teach from their homes or head schools working within a master-pupil relationship. A pupil does not experiment with a personal style until achieving the highest level of training, or graduating from an arts school, or becoming head of a school. Many young artists have criticized this system as stifling creativity and individuality. A new generation of the [[avant-garde]] has broken with this tradition, often receiving its training in the West. In the traditional arts, however, the master-pupil system preserves the secrets and skills of the past. Some master-pupil lineages can be traced to the Kamakura period, from which they continue to use a great master's style or theme. Japanese artists consider technical virtuosity as the ''[[sine qua non]]'' of their professions, a fact recognized by the rest of the world as one of the hallmarks of Japanese art.

The national government has actively supported the arts through the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]], set up in 1968 as a special body of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education]]. The agency's budget for FY 1989 rose to ￥37.8 billion after five years of budget cuts, but still represented much less than 1 percent of the general budget. The agency's Cultural Affairs Division disseminated information about the arts within Japan and internationally, and the [[Cultural Properties Protection Division]] (文化財保護部, now 文化財部) protected the nation's cultural heritage. The Cultural Affairs Division is concerned with such areas as art and culture promotion, arts copyrights, and improvements in the [[Japanese language|national language]]. It also supports both national and local arts and cultural festivals, and it funds traveling cultural events in music, theater, dance, art exhibitions, and filmmaking. Special prizes are offered to encourage young artists and established practitioners, and some grants are given each year to enable them to train abroad. The agency funds national museums of modern art in Kyoto and Tokyo and [[The National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo, which exhibit both Japanese and international shows. The agency also supports the [[Japan Art Academy]], which honors eminent persons of arts and letters, appointing them to membership and offering ￥3.5 million in prize money. Awards are made in the presence of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], who personally bestows the highest accolade, the [[Order of Culture]].
Tokyo University of the Arts also taking active roles on several art events in previous years. Their other campuses are also involving varied courses.

===Private sponsorship and foundations===
Arts patronage and promotion by the government are broadened to include a new cooperative effort with corporate Japan to provide funding beyond the tight budget of the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Many other public and private institutions participate, especially in the burgeoning field of awarding arts prizes. A growing number of large corporations join major newspapers in sponsoring exhibitions and performances and in giving yearly prizes. The most important of the many literary awards given are the venerable [[Naoki Prize]] and the [[Akutagawa Prize]], the latter being the equivalent of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in the United States.

In 1989 an effort to promote cross-cultural exchange led to the establishment of a Japanese "[[Nobel Prize]]" for the arts, the [[Premium Imperiale]], by the [[Japan Art Association]]. This prize of US$100,000 was funded largely by the mass media conglomerate [[Fujisankei Communications Group]] and was awarded on a worldwide selection basis.

A number of foundations promoting the arts arose in the 1980s, including the [[Cultural Properties Foundation]] set up to preserve historic sites overseas, especially along the [[Silk Road]] in [[Inner Asia]] and at [[Dunhuang]] in [[China]]. Another international arrangement was made in 1988 with the United States [[Smithsonian Institution]] for cooperative exchange of high-technology studies of Asian artifacts. The government plays a major role by funding the [[Japan Foundation]], which provides both institutional and individual grants, effects scholarly exchanges, awards annual prizes, supported publications and exhibitions, and sends traditional Japanese arts groups to perform abroad. The Arts Festival held for two months each fall for all the performing arts is sponsored by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Major cities also provides substantial support for the arts; a growing number of cities in the 1980s had built large centers for the performing arts and, stimulated by government funding, were offering prizes such as the [[Lafcadio Hearn Prize]] initiated by the city of [[Matsue]]. A number of new municipal museums were also providing about one-third more facilities in the 1980s than were previously available. In the late 1980s, [[Tokyo]] added more than twenty new cultural halls, notably, the large [[Bunkamura]] built by [[Tokyu Group]] and the reconstruction of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Globe Theatre]]. All these efforts reflect a rising popular enthusiasm for the arts. Japanese art buyers swept the Western art markets in the late 1980s, paying record highs for [[Impressionism|impressionist]] paintings and US$51.7 million alone for one [[blue period]] [[Picasso]].

'''''Jumanji''''' is a 1981 [[fantasy]] [[children's literature|children's]] [[picture book]], written and illustrated by the American author [[Chris Van Allsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill C.|title=Chris Van Allsburg|year=2005|publisher=ABDO Pub. Co.|location=Edina, Minn. |isbn=978-1-59197-721-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-VG3qYxbCvcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=jumanji+allsburg#v=onepage&amp;q=jumanji&amp;f=false|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made into a [[Jumanji|1995 film of the same name]]. Both the book and the film are about a magical board game that implements real animals and other jungle elements as the game is played; thus the dangers which the players have to overcome in the game also appear in real life. ''Jumanji'' star [[Robin Williams]] said "jumanji" is a [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word meaning "many effects",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flashes: Name of the Game|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299864,00.html|accessdate=November 18, 2011|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 8, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did Van Allsburg.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 2011, Williams recorded an audiobook for its 30th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fictiondb.com/author/chris-van-allsburg~jumanji-30th-anniversary-edition~433680~b.htm|title=Jumanji 30th Anniversary Edition|website=FictionDB|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fritz, a bull terrier in all of [[Chris Van Allsburg]]'s books, appears as a toy dog on wheels in the third illustration.

==Storyline==
While their parents are out for the evening, Judy and Peter Shepherd, after playing with some toys, become bored and decide to go to the park. There they find a jungle adventure game called ''Jumanji''. Taking the game home, they find a warning message; "Do not begin unless you intend to finish". Ignoring the warning, they start to play.

The pair soon discovers that any dangers encountered in the game spring to life somewhere in the house. For example, when Peter rolls on a lion, a real lion appears, which Judy and Peter trap in their mother's bedroom. Continuing on, Judy rolls on a stampede, Peter rolls on a monsoon, and Judy rolls on an explorer—each appears in real life to wreak havoc in the house. Still they continue to play, hoping that by finishing the game everything will go back to normal. The game finally ends when Judy rolls a volcano and yells "Jumanji!".

In an instant everything is back to normal and the siblings quickly return to the park and abandon the game before their parents return. The story ends when Judy and Peter look outside and see their neighbors, Danny and Walter, excitedly returning from the park with ''Jumanji'' in their hands with the knowledge that their mother claims the brothers never bother to finish the games they play nor read the instructions.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Jumanji]]'', a 1995 film based on the story. Unlike the short story, the film has adult characters that did not appear in the original short story like Alan Parrish ([[Robin Williams]]), Sarah Whittle ([[Bonnie Hunt]]), Officer Carl Bentley ([[David Alan Grier]]), Aunt Nora ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]) and a big-game hunter named Van Pelt ([[Jonathan Hyde]] who also portrayed Alan's father, Sam Parrish). Not only is Alan Parrish the main protagonist instead of Judy ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) and Peter ([[Bradley Pierce]]), but a background story is added, in which the game trapped Alan in the jungle many years earlier while he and Sarah were playing back in 1969. Danny and Walter Budwing from the end of the original book do not appear in the film. Also in the film, Judy and Peter are orphaned after their parents died in a car accident in Canada and their aunt is now their legal guardian. Other changes are that the animals wreak havoc all over town, Peter transforming into a monkey while trying to cheat and Alan ultimately winning the game instead of Judy with everything including time restored back to the way it was before. The drumbeats in the game are also heard far away, which never happened in the book.
* [[Jumanji (TV series)|''Jumanji'' (TV series)]], an animated TV series roughly based on the book and the film, which ran from 1996 to 1999. Unlike the book and film, the game transports Judy and Peter in the jungle after taking turns and reading a clue instead of releasing all of the jungle elements and there are other villains besides Van Pelt. Also, Peter transforms into various animals while trying to cheat in a few episodes and Alan Parrish from the film remains trapped in the game until the final episode and Danny and Walter from the end of the original book are absent.
* ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]'' came out in 2017 and stars [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Jack Black]], [[Kevin Hart]] and [[Karen Gillan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/08/20/the-rock-says-new-jumanji-is-not-a-reboot/|title=The Rock Says New Jumanji Is Not A Reboot|author=Matthew Mueller |publisher=Comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not a strict sequel, it uses many of the same premises as the 1995 film.

==Sequel==
''[[Zathura]]'' (published in 2002) is a sequel to ''Jumanji'' also written by Van Allsburg. In ''Zathura'', Danny and Walter Budwing from the end of the ''Jumanji'' story, find a science fiction board game that similarly causes the effects of the game to come to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zbaracki |first=Matthew D. |title=Best Books for Boys: A Resource for Educators |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=mVThAAAAMAAJ |publisher=[[Libraries Unlimited]] |year=2008 |page=56 |isbn=9781591585992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been [[Zathura: A Space Adventure|adapted to film]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kümmerling-Meibauer |first=Bettina |title=The Routledge Companion to Picturebooks |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=jtNBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT690 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=December 6, 2017 |pages=526 |isbn=9781317526599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tompkins |first=Gail E. |title=Literacy for the 21st Century: Teaching Reading and Writing in Grades 4 Through 8 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=qARKAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Pearson/Merrill/Prentice Hall |year=2003 |page=263 |isbn=9780130986542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Leypoldt |first=E. |title=The Publishers Weekly |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=2xDDLHfovXAC |volume=54 |issue=44-51 |year=2004 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Owen |first=Lynette |title=Selling Rights |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=8oDZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA318 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=October 17, 2014 |page=318 |isbn=9781317611813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limerick School of Art and Design''' or '''LSAD''' is an [[art college]] in [[Limerick]] city in Ireland. The school is one of the five constituent schools of [[Limerick Institute of Technology]] and operates on two of LIT's campuses in Limerick city, located on Clare Street and George's Quay; both are about 2&amp;nbsp;km from the main LIT campus at Moylish Park. Since 2012, the school also offers degree programmes at the Clonmel campus of LIT. The School can trace its origins back to 1852 and has had a number of guises and locations before consolidating into its current format and campuses in the 1980s and 1990s. LSAD offers courses at Level 8 (Honours Degree) and Level 9 (Master's Degree) across a range of art and design disciplines.

==History==

On 3 July 1852, a public notice appeared in the [[Limerick Leader|Limerick Chronicle]] announcing the opening of the School of Ornamental Art at the Leamy Institute on Hartstonge Street. The school offered instruction to the general public in drawing and modelling. The first prospectus stated the school's objective of "providing instruction in all those branches of art which are applicable to manufactures and decoration".&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Chronicle'', 3 July 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; The school opened on 2 November 1852 with 28 male and seven female pupils.

Although the school thrived in its first year, changes in government departments led to a withdrawal of funding and the school was forced to close in January 1855. Following public pressure, the school reopened in December 1855 under the auspices of the [[Limerick Athenaeum]], a centre of learning that would be open to all, irrespective of class, creed or cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Chronicle'', 3 December 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; This had opened in February 1855 at No. 2 Upper Cecil Street. The school continued to operate successfully over the coming decades. The trustees of the Athenaeum handed the building over to the Corporation in 1896 in order to administer the property for the advancement of technical education in Limerick. However, by the turn of the century, the building was no longer large enough to cater for the range of courses offered by the Limerick Technical Instruction Committee, and the school began to move sections to new premises, mainly on George's Street (now [[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Chronicle'', 5 May 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

The departments were eventually rehoused on one site with the opening of the Municipal Technical Institute on O' Connell Avenue in December 1911. This building has since been known in Limerick as the 'Red Tech'. The work of the Institute was taking place against the background of intense political change in Ireland and was forced to close from 1919 to 1923. Troops of the Warwickshire Regiment occupied the Institute during the [[Irish War of Independence]] in 1921 and considerable damage was caused to the building and its contents. Limerick MTI eventually re-opened in October 1923 and such was the impact of the closure that it was effectively a new start-up.&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Chronicle'', 22 September 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vocational Education Committee was established in July 1930 and took over the running of the MTI, with its main focus on providing full-time education to students between the ages of fourteen and sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;Limerick Chronicle, 25 March 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; This continued in much the same format until 1967, when the Limerick VEC was suspended for three years over irregularities in appointing staff.&lt;ref&gt;From Small Beginnings - The Story of the Limerick School of Art and Design, 1852-2002, J.J. Hogan, Limerick Institute of Technology, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Art had relocated to the former County Infirmary and Nurses' Home in Mulgrave Street in 1962, now Limerick College of Further Education.

Limerick missed out on a new technical college in 1966 with the establishment of the Regional Technical Colleges, as the Department of Education decided to establish a National Institute for Higher Education instead (later to become the [[University of Limerick]]). The reconvened Limerick City VEC planned to build Limerick Technical College and acquired land at Moylish Park to do this. The college was opened in 1975 and has since developed into the main campus of Limerick Institute of Technology.

The School of Art continued to grow at its Mulgrave Street location and by the mid 1970s the lack of space was becoming a serious issue. 1980 saw the school finally taking shape as what is now the Limerick School of Art and Design under the reconstituted LTC, which had become the College of Art, Commerce and Technology (CoACT), and this coincided with a move to a VEC property on George’s Quay, formerly St. Anne’s Vocational School, which had been opened in 1939 but vacated in 1978. However, the move to George’s Quay proved to be a short-term solution as the school quickly outgrew this site also. CoACT rented rooms in Bruce House on Rutland Street and in the Granary on Michael Street to accommodate the extra courses and students but this quickly got out of control with the school renting a further five properties during this period.

When CoACT finally achieved RTC status in 1992, work began on finding a suitable location for the school. The Good Shepherd Convent on Clare Street was purchased from the [[Good Shepherd Sisters]] in October 1994 and some emergency refurbishment allowed occupancy as early as January 1995. Further refurbishment and development work took place and its final stage was completed in September 2008.

==Clare Street Campus==
[[File:LSAD Clare Street Campus 1.jpg|thumb|right|New build alongside 19th century convent]]
Clare Street originally backed onto the walls of the Irishtown and derives its name from [[John Fitzgibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|John Fitzgibbon]], the 1st Earl of Clare who was [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] from 1789 to 1802. James O'Sullivan, a tobacco merchant, constructed the street on swampy land known as ''Múin na Muice'', the moor or common of the pigs, and dedicated it to Fitzgibbon.&lt;ref name=Spellissey&gt;Spellissy, S., ''The History of Limerick City'', 1998, pp.100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clare Street Campus is located on the site of an old [[Joseph Lancaster|Lancastrian School]], developed by [[Joseph Lancaster]] for the education of the poor in the early 19th century. Lancaster was a Quaker, born in London in 1788, who had devoted himself to the education of the poor. His system was to employ the more advanced boys as monitors, or assistant teachers, to enable a few masters to teach a large number of boys. Spelling and reading were taught from charts hung on the walls, thereby dispensing with the need for books for the poor and slates were used to write on, to save paper. His first school was founded in London in 1801 and his school in Limerick was probably founded around 1806. The entrance to the school was on Old Clare Street and this street became known locally as ''The Long Can'', after the Lancastrian School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,4007,en.pdf Ahern, Richard, ''The History Of The Christian Brothers In Limerick - Part I'', p.13.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendance figures dropped at the school and it gradually fell into disrepair. In November 1821, [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|The Christian Brothers]] purchased the school for £200. In 1858, they let part of the garden to Madame De Beligond, superioress of the Good Shepherd Convent at an annual rent of £10. When the Christian Brothers left the building in 1888, they sold it to the nuns for £200.&lt;ref&gt;Spellissy, S. &amp; O' Brien, J., ''Limerick - The Rich Land'', 1989, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; They established a girls' reformatory on the site of the old Thomond Brewery, adjacent to the convent, which was one of three breweries still in operation in Limerick city in the 1870s. It was sold to the nuns in 1879 and demolished to construct the reformatory to house young women who had become pregnant out of wedlock. They also established a [[Magdalene laundry]] on another adjacent site which had been a public execution ground in the 16th and 17th centuries, known as the Farrancroghy execution site.&lt;ref name=Spellissey/&gt; They continued to operate the reformatory and the laundry at the site until it was sold to the Regional Technical College in 1994.

Major refurbishment and construction works have been carried out at the site, in two phases. The first saw the refurbishment of much of the main building and chapel in the late 1990s. The second phase was completed in August 2008 and consisted of construction of additional space, further refurbishment and considerable ground works, including a new entrance onto Clare Street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="376618">'''Fairy tales''' are stories that range from those originating in folklore to more modern stories defined as literary fairy tales. Despite subtle differences in the categorizing of [[fairy tale]]s, [[folklore]], [[fable]]s, [[Mythology|myths]], and [[legend]]s, a modern definition of the fairy tale, as provided by Jens Tismar's monologue in German, is a story that differs "from an oral folk tale", written by "a single identifiable author", which can be characterised as "simple and anonymous", and exists in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to [[Oral tradition|folktale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, xv&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Manuela von Meinhardis, whose mother had died when she was young and father serves in the military, is enrolled at an all-girls boarding school headed by the traditional and iron-fisted Fräulein von Nordeck zur Nidden. Manuela is immediately exposed to the strictness of the school when receiving her uniform and having many of her possessions taken from her. While the other girls at the school receive Manuela with open arms, she still feels very out of place, until she meets Fräulein von Bernburg, a teacher at the school. After witnessing Fräulein von Bernburg's compassion for the other girls, Manuela develops a passionate love for her teacher. The first spark of love begins with a goodnight kiss. While the teacher normally gives all the girls a goodnight kiss on the forehead, Manuela receives one on the lips.

There is a meeting asking the teachers in the school and the headmistress. Fräulein von Bernburg advocates using compassion and love when dealing with the students, but is met with disagreement from the headmistress and the other teachers.

During class, the girls are reciting from an assigned reading. The girls who are called upon all know their recitations, except Manuela. After class, Fräulein von Bernburg calls for Manuela to meet her in her room. Manuela expects to be punished for not knowing the assigned material, but Fräulein von Bernburg comments on the state of the clothes the girl came to the school with, noting that there were many holes in them. Fräulein von Bernburg then gives one of her own petticoats to Manuela, at which she begins to weep. After much crying, Manuela confesses her love for Fräulein von Bernburg, and the teacher states that she loves Manuela but that she cannot give her special treatment because the other girls will be jealous.

The girls gather around Ilsa von Westhagen, another student, as she reads aloud a letter to her parents complaining about the conditions at the school. She has a worker at the school smuggle the letter out.

The girls are preparing to put on a play, ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'', by [[Friedrich Schiller]], for the birthday of the headmistress. Manuela plays Don Carlos, the lead male role. Ilsa is to play another major role in the play, but is barred from performing after her letter to her parents denouncing the school is returned because of a wrong address. Ilsa packs up to leave the school, but Fräulein von Bernburg convinces her to stay. The girls put on the play for the headmistress and her guests;  it is a great success, with a standout performance by Manuela.

After the play, the girls all meet for dinner and are served punch with alcohol in it by the kitchen workers. After much dancing and singing, the girls ask Manuela about her relationship with Fräulein von Bernburg. Without knowing that the headmistress's assistant is in the room, Manuela tells them of the petticoat that Fräulein von Bernburg gave her. Then, she declares that she is not afraid of anything or anyone—yelling it drunkenly in the direction of the headmistress, who has now entered the room.

After passing out, Manuela is brought to a room, where no-one is allowed to see her. She is scolded by the headmistress. The headmistress is then informed that the princess is on her way to the school to speak to her. The students and teachers all line up for the arrival of the princess. After observing all the students, she asks to see Manuela. The princess tells Manuela that she knew Manuela's mother and respected her. The princess says that Manuela looks a little pale and asks whether she is sick, at which the headmistress rushes her away and denies any paleness.

After the meeting with the princess, the headmistress scolds Fräulein von Bernburg for being too close and compassionate with her students. She also tells her that she is never to speak to Manuela again. When Fräulein von Bernburg leaves the headmistress's office, Manuela is waiting for her. Fräulein von Bernburg tells Manuela to meet her in her room. In her room, Fräulein von Bernburg tells Manuela that while she cares for her, she is to never speak to her again. Manuela responds by saying that she will die. Fräulein von Bernburg tells her not to say such things and sends her away. As Manuela leaves the room, the headmistress arrives to scold Fräulein von Bernburg for speaking to Manuela and says that she can no longer be a teacher at the school. Fräulein von Bernburg says that she could not continue there anyway, for she needs to stand for justice.

At this point, the girls are all looking for Manuela and cannot find her. Manuela has climbed up the main staircase and is ready to jump. Manuela is saved by the other students. The headmistress and Fräulein von Bernburg walk out of Fräulein von Bernburg's room to discover a commotion and are then told that Manuela tried to jump and kill herself. The movie ends with all the girls watching the headmistress as she walks down the stairwell and down the hall in silence.

==Production==
Winsloe's stage play had previously appeared under the title ''{{Lang|de|Ritter Nérestan}}'' (''Knight Nérestan'') in Leipzig with [[Hertha Thiele]] and Claire Harden in the lead roles. After Leipzig the play was produced on the stage in Berlin as ''{{Lang|de|Gestern und heute}}''&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Johann: ''Grenze und Halt: Der Einzelne im "Haus der Regeln". Zur deutschsprachigen Internatsliteratur.'' Heidelberg: Universitätsverlag, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; with a different cast and a more prominent lesbian theme, which was again toned down somewhat for the film.

Having mostly played the same roles on stage, the cast was able to produce the film at speed and on a low budget of [[Reichsmark|RM]]55,000. It was largely shot at the [[Potsdam]] military orphanage, now a teacher training college for women. Carl Froelich's studio in Berlin-[[Tempelhof]] was also used. The film's original working title was ''{{Lang|de|Gestern und heute}}'' (''Yesterday and Today'') but this was thought too insipid and changed to increase the chances of box-office success. Although sound had only been used for two years in cinema, it was used artfully.

The film was groundbreaking in having an all-female cast; in its sympathetic portrayal of lesbian "pedagogical eros" (see [[Gustav Wyneken]]) and [[homoeroticism]], revolving around the passionate love of a fourteen-year-old (Manuela) for her teacher (von Bernburg); and in its co-operative and profit-sharing financial arrangements (although these failed).

During an interview about the film decades later, Thiele said
&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole of ''{{Lang|de|Mädchen in Uniform}}'' was set in the [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Empress Augusta]] boarding school, where [[Christa Winsloe|Winsloe]] was educated. Actually there really was a Manuela, who remained lame all of her life after she threw herself down the stairs. She came to the premiere of the film. I saw her from a distance, and at the time Winsloe told me, "The experience is one which I had to write from my heart." Winsloe was a lesbian.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thiele also said, "However, I really don't want to make a great deal of [...] or account for a film about lesbianism here. That's far from my mind, because the whole thing of course is also a revolt against the cruel [[Prussia]]n education system."

After many screen tests, Winsloe had insisted that her friend Thiele play the lead role. Director Sagan would have preferred [[Gina Falckenberg]] who had done the role on stage in Berlin, but along with having played Manuela in Leipzig, Thiele had already played a young lesbian in [[Ferdinand Bruckner]]'s stage play ''{{Lang|de|Die Kreatur}}'' (''The Creature'') and although twenty-three years old when filming began, she was considered to be more capable of portraying a fourteen-year-old.

==Reaction==
The film had some impact in the Berlin lesbian clubs, but was largely eclipsed by the ongoing cult success of ''[[The Blue Angel|Der blaue Engel]]'' (1930). The film did however generate large amounts of fan mail to the stars from all over Germany and was considered a success throughout much of Europe. The goodnight kiss Thiele received from Wieck was especially popular: one distributor even asked for more footage of other kisses like it to splice into prints of the film.

From its premiere at the Capitol cinema in Berlin until 1934 the film is said to have grossed some RM6,000,000. Despite the collective nature of the filming for which cast and crew received only a quarter of the normal wage, none saw a share of the 6,000,000 marks and Thiele later hinted that the profits had been mostly retained by the producers.

The film was distributed outside Germany and was a huge success in Romania. During a 1980 interview Thiele said the school play scene caused a "longstockings and kissing" cult when the film was first shown there. It was also distributed in Japan, the United States (where it was first banned, then released in a heavily cut version), England and France.

''{{Lang|de|Mädchen in Uniform}}'' won the audience referendum for Best Technical Perfection at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1932 and received the Japanese Kinema Junpo Award for Best Foreign Language Film (Tokyo, 1934).

Later, an alternate ending which subtly pandered to pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] ideals enabled continued screening in German cinemas, but eventually even this version of the film was banned as 'decadent' by the Nazi regime, which reportedly attempted to burn all of the existing prints, but by then several had been dispersed around the world. Sagan and many others associated with the film fled Germany soon after the banning. Many of the cast and crew were [[Jew]]ish, and those who could not escape from Germany died in the camps. "You were only first aware that they were Jewish when fascism was there and you lost your friends," said Thiele, who left Germany in 1937. Assistant director Walter Supper killed himself when it became clear his Jewish wife would be arrested.

Despite its later banning, ''{{Lang|de|Mädchen in Uniform}}'' was followed by several German films about intimate relationships among women, such as ''{{Lang|de|Acht Mädels im Boot}}'' (''[[Eight Girls in a Boat (1932 film)|Eight Girls in a Boat]]'', 1932) and ''[[Anna and Elizabeth]]'' (1933), which also starred Wieck and Thiele but was banned by the Nazis soon after its opening night, along with ''[[Ich für dich, du für mich]]'' (''Me for You, You for Me'', 1934).

The film is said to have inspired the 1949 novel ''Olivia'' by [[Dorothy Bussy]], which treats very similar themes, and which was made into a French film ''[[Olivia (film)|Olivia]]'' (1951) directed by [[Jacqueline Audry]]. Also in 1951, a Mexican adaptation ''[[Girls in Uniform (1951 film)|Girls in Uniform]]'' was made. There was a German [[Mädchen in Uniform (1958 film)|remake in 1958]], directed by [[Géza von Radványi]] and starring [[Lilli Palmer]], [[Romy Schneider]], and [[Therese Giehse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0051964|Mädchen in Uniform|(1958)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and surviving version==
The film was almost banned in the US, but [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] spoke highly of the film, resulting in the film getting a limited release in the US in 1932-33. Prints of the film survived the war, but it was heavily [[censorship|censored]] until the 1970s, and it was not shown again in Germany until 1977 when it was screened on television there.

In 1978, [[Janus Films]] and [[Arthur Krim]] arranged for a limited re-release in the US in 35mm, including a screening at the [[Roxie Cinema]] in [[San Francisco]]. Also in 1978, the film was released in its surviving form by Janus Films on [[VHS]] with English subtitles.

Versions were later released in the US (1994) and the UK (2000) by the [[British Film Institute]]. Even this version is probably missing some brief scenes. For a full understanding of what may have been censored, a viewing of the film might be followed with a reading of the 1933 novel by Christa Winsloe ''{{Lang|de|Das Mädchen Manuela}}''/''The Child Manuela'' (Virago Press, 1994).

==Quotation from the film==
*"What you call sin, I call the great spirit of love, which takes a thousand forms." (Spoken in reference to the boycott.)

==In popular culture==
* In Anthony Powell's novel ''[[The Acceptance World]]'' (1955), the narrator, Nick Jenkins, is re-united with his first major love, Jean Templer, after Jean and her sister-in-law, Mona, have returned to the Ritz (London) on New Year's Eve 1931, following a screening of the film. Jean is accompanied by her brother Peter. Nick (who has seen the film) is mildly mocked by his old schoolfriend Peter (who has not), for saying that the film is not primarily about lesbians.
* In the film ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' (1990), this is one of the films shown in the small art-house theater frequented by the main characters.
*The film ''[[Loving Annabelle]]'' (2006) was reportedly inspired by ''Mädchen in Uniform''.
*The album ''Mädchen in Uniform'' (2009) by the German band [[Nachtmahr]].

'''''Noite na Taverna''''' (in {{lang-en|A Night in the Tavern}}) is a [[short story]] collection written by [[Brazil]]ian [[Ultra-Romanticism|Ultra-Romantic]] author [[Álvares de Azevedo]] under the pen name '''Job Stern'''. It was published posthumously, in [[1855 in literature|1855]]; three years after Azevedo's death. The book is structured as a frame story containing five tales (as well as a prologue and an epilogue, thus totaling seven chapters) told by a group of five men sheltering in a [[tavern]]. It is one of the most popular and influential works of [[Gothic fiction]] in Brazilian literature.

It is said that the book was largely inspired by [[Spain|Spanish]] author [[José Cadalso]]'s 1790 work ''Noches lúgubres''.

==Plot==

===Chapter 1: "Uma Noite do Século"===
The first chapter of the book, "Uma Noite do Século" ("A Night of the Century"), introduces its setting – a tavern in an undisclosed location filled with prostitutes, drunkards and libertines. At a nearby table, influenced by the alcohol, a group of five friends – Solfieri, Bertram, Gennaro, Claudius Hermann and Johann – decide to share with each other certain events of their lives. The five tales have, in common, aspects such as unsuccessful love stories, [[cannibalism]], [[murder]]s, [[sexual violence]], [[Alcoholism|heavy drinking]], among others.

===Chapter 2: "Solfieri"===
When in [[Rome]], on a rainy night, Solfieri sees a shadow crying over a window. He realizes it is a beautiful woman. She leaves the house and Solfieri decides to follow her, and they ultimately arrive at a nearby cemetery. There, the woman cries, kneeling before a headstone, as Solfieri falls asleep watching her from afar.

One year later, Solfieri, wandering the streets of Rome after taking part in an [[orgy]], ends into a church inadvertently. He sees a coffin and, after listening to breathing noises inside, opens it, and sees the cemetery lady he met the year before inside it. After realizing that she is still alive (but in a [[catalepsy|catalepsic]] state), he carries her through the city. Arriving at his home, the woman dies two days later, of a very high fever. Solfieri buries her under the floorboards of his bedroom and pays a sculptor for a statuette built in the woman's likeness.

===Chapter 3: "Bertram"===
Bertram tells the story of his ill-fated love for a [[Spain|Spanish]] woman from [[Cádiz]], named Angela. Amidst their romance, Bertram's sick father, living in [[Denmark]], calls for him. He goes, returning two years later; however, during the time he was away, Angela marries another man, having a son with him. Despite this, Bertram tries to maintain his affair with her, but Angela's husband finds out everything. Before her husband kills her, she kills him and her child, and flees with Bertram.

One day, without further explanations, she leaves him. Bertram sinks into despair as he tries to forget Angela; subdued by woe, he faints in the middle of a street and is run over by a chariot. The passengers of the chariot, an old man and his 18-year-old daughter, help him and take him to their mansion so he can recover. Bertram gets in love with the lady and they flee together, but he ultimately gets bored with her and sells the lady to a pirate in a card game. Later, he would learn that the girl poisoned the pirate and threw herself in the sea.

Having moved to [[Italy]], Bertram decides to kill himself there, but when he is about to do it, he is saved by a sailor whom he kills unintentionally. Bertram spends some time in the sailor's ship (a [[corvette]]), where he gets in love with the [[Captain (naval)|captain]]'s wife, being requited.

In the midst of this affair, the ship is attacked by pirates and sinks, but not without making the other one sink too. The captain, his wife, Bertram and two other unnamed sailors are able to save themselves in a [[raft]]. Some time later, with no water or food, the two unnamed sailors being washed out by the sea, the three lot in order to discover who will be killed and serve as food for the others. The chosen one is the captain, but he does not accept his fate and fights for his life. He loses the fight however, and Bertram and the woman are obligated to eat him because of the lack of food, maintaining themselves for two days.

Arriving at a beach, both already weakened by hunger, the woman asks Bertram for a last moment of love before her death. Afraid of dying, Bertram strangles her and lives at the beach in complete solitude until he is found by a British [[brig]] that rescues him.

===Chapter 4: "Gennaro"===
The painter Gennaro reminisces of when he was the young apprentice of the famous Godofredo Walsh. Walsh had a young, beautiful wife named Nauza (whom Gennaro loved) and a young, beautiful daughter named Laura (who loved Gennaro). One day, Laura gets pregnant of Gennaro, but when she proposes marriage to him, he declines. Displeased, she gradually sinks into [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and dies, taking the baby with her.

The old painter, not knowing anything, visits his daughter's bedroom every night and, because of this, Gennaro starts sleeping with his wife. However, the painter is able to make Gennaro confess everything in a certain night. Days later, Godofredo takes Gennaro to a cliff and tries to kill him; however, he survives the fall and decides to return to Godofredo's house – initially planning to apologize, but later he changes his mind and decides to take his revenge on the painter and murder him. However, when he arrives at the painter's house, he finds both Nauza and Godofredo dead.

===Chapter 5: "Claudius Hermann"===
Claudius Hermann, an assiduous [[gambling|gambler]], spots the beautiful Duchess Eleonora at a [[horse racing|horse race]] and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets her once more in a [[theatre]] later on, and during an entire week he [[stalking|stalks]] her.

In a certain night, he [[bribery|bribes]] one of the duchess' lackeys for permission to enter her house for an hour, and also obtains a copy of her bedroom's keys. He puts [[sedative]] in the duchess' wine and has sex with her, returning for many nights.

One day, however, her husband, [[Duke]] Maffio, inadvertently drinks some of the sedative as well. Desperate and afraid of being caught, Claudius plans to kill him, but changes his mind and kidnaps Eleonora instead while she is still sleeping. Arriving in an [[inn]], she wakes up, and Claudius tells her everything, forcing her to stay with him. Optionless, she accepts.

Some days later, Claudius has to leave in order to take care of some affairs; when he returns home, he finds the duchess and her husband dead.

===Chapter 6: "Johann"===
Johann's story begins in a different tavern, located in [[Paris]]. He was playing a game of [[Carom billiards|carambole]] with a blond-haired man named Arthur. Johann was losing the game, while Arthur only needed to score one point to win. When it is Johann's turn to play, Arthur bumps into the table (accidentally or not), detouring Johann's ball, thus making him lose the game. Infuriated, he defies Arthur to a duel, which he accepts. They stop at a [[hotel]] to get the guns, and the blond man writes two letters. They head to a deserted and dark street. In there, they choose their guns – but only one is loaded.

They shoot. It is revealed that Johann's gun was the loaded one, and Arthur, before supposedly dying, hands Johann the letters he wrote. The first letter is addressed to Arthur's mother, and the other one is addressed to his girlfriend; he also hands Johann her address and an engagement ring. Pretending to be Arthur, Johann then decides to steal his girlfriend.

In the morning after they sleep together, Johann is attacked by a mysterious man. After a short struggle, he kills the man. However, after a close inspection, he discovers that the man he killed was his own brother, and Arthur's girlfriend was his sister.

===Chapter 7: "Último Beijo de Amor"===
In the last chapter, "Último Beijo de Amor" ("Last Love Kiss"), the orgy ends; everyone is sleeping. A mysterious hooded figure walks into the tavern and kills Johann, and then heads toward a man named Arnold.

The figure is revealed to be Giorgia, Johann's sister, and Arnold is actually Arthur (who was saved by a passerby after the duel) under a false name. Giorgia reveals to Arthur that she wanted to get her revenge on Johann, and having done so, the honor Johann stole from her when they slept together is finally restored.

After exchanging some love words with Arthur, both decide to commit suicide.

==Adaptations==

'''Olga Isabella Nethersole''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Royal Red Cross|RRC]] (18 January 1867&lt;ref&gt;Year of birth approximated as 1867 based on death registry at Findmypast.co.uk&lt;br&gt;Name: NETHERSOLE, Olga I.&lt;br&gt;Registration District: Poole&lt;br&gt;County: Dorset&lt;br&gt;Year of Registration: 1951&lt;br&gt;Quarter of Registration: Jan-Feb-Mar&lt;br&gt;Age at death: 84&lt;br&gt;Volume No: 6A/Page No:752&lt;/ref&gt; – 9 January 1951) was an [[England|English]] [[actress]], [[theatre producer]], and wartime nurse and health educator.

==Career==
Olga Isabella Nethersole was born in [[London]], of [[Spain|Spanish]] descent on her mother's side. Her father was Henry Nethersole, a [[solicitor]]. She made her stage début at [[Theatre Royal, Brighton]] in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=NETHERSOLE, Olga|journal=Who's Who|year=1907|volume=59|page=1293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888, Nethersole began playing important parts in London, at first under [[Rutland Barrington]] and [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]] at the [[Garrick Theatre]].

[[Image:Olganethersole1.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the [[Clyde Fitch]] play, ''[[Sapho (play)|Sapho]]'' ]]

Nethersole toured Australia and the United States playing leading parts in modern plays, notably [[Clyde Fitch]]'s ''[[Sapho (play)|Sapho]]'', where she and her male costar [[Hamilton Revelle]] were arrested for "violating public decency" for which she was later acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/1900/peopleevents/pande30.html|title=The Sapho Affair|accessdate=2011-03-19|quote=During one performance, Olga Nethersole was placed under arrest for "violating public decency."

In 1904, Nethersole portrayed the lead role in ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray|La seconde madame Tanqueray]]'' at the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Le Ménestrel Review 1904&lt;/ref&gt; Then she was at the [[Théâtre de la Ville|Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt]] in ''[[Heimat (play)|Magda]]'', ''Sapho'', ''[[Adrienne Lecouvreur (play)|Adrienne Lecouvreur]]'', and an adaptation of a French play by [[Eugène Scribe]] and [[Ernest Legouvé]], ''Camille'', an adaptation of a French play ''[[La Dame aux Camélias]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Annales du théatre et de la musique de 1907 (p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Spanish Gipsy'', an adaptation of the French play ''Carmen de Mérimée'' in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;L'Aurore du 12 of june 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Every summer, Nethersole spent a week at the house of playwright [[Edmond Rostand]] in Cambo les Bains. In 1907, she performed Rostand’s play ''La Samaritaine'' an English version of it to play it in London.&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper l'Aurore, 12 June 1907&lt;/ref&gt; In a conference at the [[Théâtre de l'Athénée]] on 17 November 1908, Robert Eude said that Olga Nethersole invented the soul kiss (an especially long kiss, of which actress [[Maude Adams]] was the recordwoman).&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper Comoedia, 18 November 1908 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Nethersole inspired the character of "Miss Nethersoll", an American dancer, in the French novel ''La Danseuse nue et la Dame a la licorne'' by Rachel Gaston-Charles (1908).&lt;ref&gt;''Review Le Mercure de France'', 16 September 1908 p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and later years===
During [[World War I]], Nethersole served as a nurse in London and later established the [[People's League of Health]], for which she received the [[Royal Red Cross]] (RRC) in 1920.&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt; She combined her theatre work with health work for the rest of her life. She was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1936.

The Yoruba believe the power of Osanyin is vested in a wrought iron staff, called an '''Osanyin staff''', that is placed on altars to this [[Orisha]].

The staff is composed of a circle of small birds and a shaft in the middle that elevates a large bird above smaller ones. [[Babatunde Lawal]] suggests that the reason for this division could be to suggest the relaying of metaphysical powers from the celestial to the terrestrial realm. Lawal evokes the Yoruba reference to Osanyin as "The one who sees everything, like [[Olodumare]]," allowing him a vantage point from which he can protect all of humanity below.&lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=Embodying the sacred in Yoruba art : featuring the Bernard and Patricia Wagner Collection|year=2007|publisher=High Museum of Art|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=1932543201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birds, emissaries of [[Ogun]], refer to the herbalist's understanding of and power over these malevolent people. There are typically sixteen birds, invoking the most sacred number of divination, surrounding and confronting the central bird, which represents the smallpox god.

'''Pearl Connor-Mogotsi''', ''née'' Nunez (13 May 1924 – 11 February 2005), was a [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]]-born theatrical and literary agent, actress and cultural activist, who was a pioneering campaigner for the recognition and promotion of African Caribbean arts.&lt;ref name=Bourne&gt;[[Stephen Bourne (writer)|Stephen Bourne]], [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/pearl-connor-mogotsi-483304.html "Pearl Connor-Mogotsi - Trailblazer for African Caribbean arts in the UK" (obituary)], ''The Independent'', 14 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, in the 1950s, she was the first agent to represent black and other minority ethnic actors, writers and film-makers, and during the 1960s was instrumental in setting up one of Britain's first black theatre companies, the Negro Theatre Workshop.&lt;ref name=Bourne /&gt; In the words of [[John La Rose]], who delivered a eulogy at her funeral on 26 February 2005: "Pearl Connor-Mogotsi was pivotal in the effort to remake the landscape for innovation and for the inclusion of African, Caribbean and Asian artists in shaping a new vision of consciousness for art and society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.tt/columnist/2007-10-04-000000/%E2%80%98last-lap%E2%80%99-london Quoted in Leela Ramdeen, "‘Last lap’ in London", ''Guardian'' (Trinidad and Tobago)], October 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LaRose&gt;John La Rose, [http://www.onepaper.com/caribiadigest/?v=d&amp;i=&amp;s=Commentary:Your+Word&amp;p=1105685639 "Eulogy for Pearl Connor-Mogotsi"], ''Caribia Digest'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years in Trinidad==
Pearl Cynthia Nunez, the ninth of her parents' 12 children, was born in [[Diego Martin]], [[Trinidad]], to Albert Antonio Nunez and Georgina Agnes Fitt, and had a convent school education in [[Port of Spain]]. Describing her background, in an interview with [[Yvonne Brewster]], she said: "I came from a family of educated [[mixed-race]] people in Trinidad, and we were readily exposed to music and the arts in general and the folklore....And our education was of course in the same pattern as most of the colonials. It was a British education and an English education, so we were doing [[Shakespeare]] and all that kind of thing and all the modern poets and [[Dickens]]. We were quite familiar in our secondary school education with those writers, so we had an idea what drama was, but it was the folk theatre that imbued me with the interest I had in the theatre."&lt;ref&gt;Rodreguez King-Dorset, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NiGhBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=%22pearl+connor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DXdWVaOQ6m&amp;sig=xJOwX9V1Yp-g9HiBbf7I9PVfBU0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir96KP8efLAhXDbhQKHXYWBoMQ6AEIgAEwFQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pearl%20connor%22&amp;f=false "Pearl Connor-Mogotsi, née Nunez—Agent"], in ''Black British Theatre Pioneers: Yvonne Brewster and the First Generation of Actors, Playwrights and Other Practitioners'', McFarland, 2014, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first experience of performance was at the [[Little Carib Theatre]], founded by [[Beryl McBurnie]], who became her greatest influence.&lt;ref name=Bourne /&gt;

==Life in London==
In 1948 Pearl met and subsequently married in England the Trinidadian folk-singer and actor [[Edric Connor]] (1913–68), with whom she eventually had two children: Peter and [[Geraldine Connor|Geraldine]]. She had gone to the UK to study law at [[King's College London|King’s College, London University]], but she deferred her studies to manage her husband's career.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;[http://historicalgeographies.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/biography-pearl-connor-mogotsi.html "Biography - Pearl Connor-Mogotsi"]. Extract from ''Caribbean Britain: The Cultural and Biographical Directory'' by Marjorie H. Morgan, Historical Geographies.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1956 she and her husband began an agency for black artists, The Edric Connor Agency, which in the 1970s would be renamed the Afro-Asian-Caribbean Agency,&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt; representing people from the Caribbean, Malaysia, India and Africa across all art forms.&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;Seb Whyte, [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/499408/ "Connor-Mogotsi, Pearl (1924-2005), Actor", BFI Screen Online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Cochrane, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fMtOarGzdxkC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;dq=%22pearl+connor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8-onAUHgRZ&amp;sig=iyUcq4biXhnkTGuSefbDGRACfpE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir96KP8efLAhXDbhQKHXYWBoMQ6AEIgwEwFg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pearl%20connor%22&amp;f=false ''Twentieth-Century British Theatre: Industry, Art and Empire''], Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many actors, dancers, musicians and writers represented by the agency in the 20 years of its existence are [[Carmen Munroe]], [[Ram John Holder]], [[Corinne Skinner]], [[Lloyd Reckord]], [[Patti Boulaye]], [[Nina Baden-Semper]], [[Yemi Ajibade]], [[Allister Bain]], [[George Harris (actor)|George Harris]], [[Johnny Sekka]], [[Osibisa]], [[Joan Armatrading]], and [[Earl Lovelace]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=CBbiog&gt;Pearl Connor-Mogotsi biographical note, p. 17, in Roxy Harris and Sarah White (eds), ''Changing Britannia – Life Experience With Britain'', [[New Beacon Books]]/George Padmore Institute, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The agency was also involved in the co-production of several films, most notably ''Carnival Fantastique'' (1959) and the cricket series ''West Indies vs England'' (1963), and in addition distributed other landmark films such as ''[[Pressure (1975 film)|Pressure]]'' (London, 1975), ''[[Bim]]'' (Trinidad, 1974), ''[[Smile Orange (film)|Smile Orange]]'' (Jamaica, 1976), ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' (Jamaica, 1972) and ''King Carnival'' (Trinidad).&lt;ref name=CBbiog /&gt;

Connor-Mogotsi herself trained at the [[Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama]] and was a broadcaster for the [[BBC World Service|BBC General Overseas Service]], working for their Caribbean Service and in radio plays on the Corporation's domestic networks, including ''The Barren One'' (1958); ''My People and Your People'' (1959), a "West Indian ballad opera" broadcast on the [[BBC Home Service]];&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bourne [https://books.google.com/books?id=YYaryaqLfd4C&amp;pg=PA117 ''Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television''], London: Continuum, 2001, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Carew]]'s The ''Riverman'' (1968). She occasionally acted on the stage - as in [[Barry Reckord]]'s ''You in Your Small Corner'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]] in 1960 - and in television or film roles, including a cameo in [[Lindsay Anderson]]'s ''[[O Lucky Man!]]'' (1973).&lt;ref name=Bourne /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bac332441 "Pearl Connor | Filmography"], BFI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural activism==
In 1971, three years after Edric Connor's death, she married Joe Mogotsi, leader of the [[South Africa]]n singing group [[The Manhattan Brothers]], and together they organized tours throughout the world for black South African artists.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2VnLeHIVID8C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=pearl+connor-mogotsi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YNm1H1N_ZY&amp;sig=Pbm1C8Y-2fmbq9d6arZFD7i_87o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gST0Udn3IsHmOoKrgNAM&amp;ved=0CIwBEOgBMBA#v=onepage&amp;q=pearl%20connor-mogotsi&amp;f=false ''Black in the British Frame''] (2001), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; They also co-authored the book ''Mantindane - "He Who Survives": My Life With The Manhattan Brothers'' (2002).&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[[Margaret Busby]], [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries "Pearl Connor-Mogotsi" (obituary)], ''The Guardian'', 2 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LaRose /&gt;

In 1972 she was awarded Trinidad and Tobago's [[Hummingbird Medal|Hummingbird Silver Medal]] for "outstanding services to the immigrant community in the United Kingdom".&lt;ref name=Bourne /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Research/SubjectGuide/NationalAwards/NationalAwardsRecipients/NationalAwardsRecipients19691979/tabid/418/Default.aspx?PageContentID=879 National Awards Recipients 1969 - 1979, NALIS.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 she was an interviewee in the two-part [[BBC television]] documentary ''Black and White In Colour'', directed by [[Isaac Julien]], which examined the contribution of black and Asian people to British television history from the birth of television in 1936 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/439149/ "Black and White in Colour (1992)"], BFI ScreenOnline.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6402688/ "Pearl Connor"] at IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Connor opened the 12th [[International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books]] in London.&lt;ref name=Bourne /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah White, Roxy Harris &amp; Sharmilla Beezmohun (eds), "Pearl Connor-Mogotsi", ''A Meeting of the Continents: The International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books – Revisited'', London: New Beacon Books/George Padmore Institute, 2005, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perfection''' is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. 

The [[terminology|term]] is used to designate a range of diverse, if often kindred, [[concept]]s. These have historically been addressed in a number of discrete [[academic discipline|discipline]]s, notably [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[ontology]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''O doskonałości'' (On Perfection), 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Term and concept==
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Aristotle]].]]
The form of the word long fluctuated in various languages. The [[English language]] had the alternates, "perfection" and the [[Bible|Biblical]] "perfectness."&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection: the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "perfection" derives from the [[Latin]] "''[[w:la:perfectio|perfectio]]''", and "perfect" — from "''[[w:la:perfectus|perfectus]]''". These expressions in turn come from "''[[w:la:perficio|perficio]]''" — "to finish", "to bring to an end." "''Perfectio''(n)" thus literally means "a finishing", and "perfect''(us)''" — "finished", much as in [[grammar|grammatical]] parlance ("[[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]").&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5 /&gt;

Many modern languages have adopted their terms for the concept of "perfection" from the Latin: the [[French language|French]] "''[[w:fr:parfait|parfait]]''" and "''perfection''"; the [[Italian language|Italian]] "''[[w:it:perfetto|perfetto]]''" and "''[[w:it:perfezione|perfezione]]''"; the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] "''[[w:es:perfecto|perfecto]]''" and "''[[w:es:perfección|perfección]]''"; the [[English language|English]] "perfect" and "perfection"; the [[Russian language|Russian]] "''[[w:ru:совершенный|совершенный]]''" (sovyershenniy) and "''совершенcтво''" (sovyershenstvo); the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] "''savršen''" and "''savršenstvo''"; the [[Czech language|Czech]] "''dokonalost''"; the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] "''dokonaly''" and "''dokonalost''"; the [[Polish language|Polish]] "''doskonały''" and "''doskonałość''."&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p5 /&gt;

The genealogy of the concept of "perfection" reaches back beyond Latin, to [[Greek language|Greek]]. The Greek equivalent of the Latin "''perfectus''" was "''teleos''." The latter Greek expression generally had concrete referents, such as a perfect physician or flutist, a perfect comedy or a perfect social system. Hence the Greek "''teleiotes''" was not yet so fraught with abstract and superlative associations as would be the Latin "''perfectio''" or the modern "perfection." To avoid the latter associations, the Greek term has generally been translated as "[[wikt:complete|complete]]ness" rather than "perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest definition of "perfection", fairly precise and distinguishing the shades of the concept, goes back to [[Aristotle]]. In Book ''Delta'' of the ''Metaphysics'', he distinguishes three meanings of the term, or rather three shades of one meaning, but in any case three different concepts. That is perfect:
:1. which is complete — which contains all the requisite parts;
:2. which is so good that nothing of the kind could be better;
:3. which has attained its purpose.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p7&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these concepts is fairly well subsumed within the second. Between those two and the third, however, there arises a duality in concept. This duality was expressed by [[Thomas Aquinas]], in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', when he distinguished a twofold perfection: when a thing is perfect in itself — as he put it, in its ''substance''; and when it perfectly serves its ''purpose''.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz1979p7 /&gt;

The variants on the concept of perfection would have been quite of a piece for two thousand years, had they not been confused with other, kindred concepts. The chief of these was the concept of that which is the best:  in Latin, "''excellentia''" ("excellence"). In [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], "''excellentia''" and "''perfectio''" made a pair; thus, for example, dignitaries were called "''perfectissime''", just as they are now called "excellency."  Nevertheless, these two expression of high regard differ fundamentally: "''excellentia''" is a distinction among many, and implies comparison; while "''perfectio''" involves no comparison, and if something is deemed perfect, then it is deemed so in itself, without comparison to other things.  [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who thought much about perfection and held the world to be the [[Optimism#Philosophy|best of possible worlds]], did not claim that it was perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection:  the Term and the Concept," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VI, no. 4 (autumn 1979), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paradoxes==
[[File:6655 - Roma - Ettore Ferrari, Giulio Cesare Vanini (1889) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 6-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Lucilio Vanini|Vanini]]]]
The parallel existence of two concepts of perfection, one strict ("perfection," as such) and the other loose ("excellence"), has given rise, perhaps since [[ancient history|antiquity]] but certainly since the [[Renaissance]], to a singular [[paradox]]: that the greatest perfection is imperfection. This was formulated by [[Lucilio Vanini]] (1585–1619), who had a precursor in the 16th-century writer [[Joseph Juste Scaliger]], and they in turn referred to the ancient philosopher [[Empedocles]]. Their argument, as given by the first two, was that if the world were perfect, it could not improve and so would lack "true perfection," which depends on progress. To [[Aristotle]], "perfect" meant "complete" ("nothing to add or subtract"). To Empedocles, according to Vanini, perfection depends on incompleteness ("''perfectio propter imperfectionem''"), since the latter possesses a potential for development and for complementing with new characteristics ("''perfectio complementii''"). This view relates to the [[baroque]] [[esthetic]] of Vanini and [[Marin Mersenne]]:  the perfection of an art work consists in its forcing the recipient to be active—to complement the art work by an effort of mind and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Paradoxes of Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 1 (winter 1980), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paradox]] of perfection—that imperfection is perfect—applies not only to human affairs, but to [[technology]].  Thus, irregularity in [[semiconductor]] [[crystal]]s (an imperfection, in the form of [[contaminant]]s) is requisite for the production of semiconductors. The solution to the apparent paradox lies in a distinction between two concepts of "perfection": that of regularity, and that of [[utility]]. Imperfection is perfect in technology, in the sense that irregularity is useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Paradoxes of Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 1 (winter 1980), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect numbers==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Perfect number]] --&gt;
[[Perfect number]]s have been distinguished ever since the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called them "''teleioi''." There was, however, no consensus among the Greeks as to which numbers were "perfect" or why. A view that was shared by [[Plato]] held that 10 was a perfect number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection in the Sciences.  I. Perfect Numbers," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mathematics|Mathematicians]], including the mathematician-philosopher [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], proposed as a perfect number, the number 6.&lt;ref name="TatarkiewiczSp1980p137"/&gt;

The number 10 was thought perfect because there are 10 fingers to the two hands. The number 6 was believed perfect for being divisible in a special way:  a sixth part of that number constitutes unity; a third is two; a half — three; two-thirds ({{lang-el|dimoiron}}) is four; five-sixths (''pentamoiron'') is five; six is the perfect whole.  The ancients also considered 6 a perfect number because the human foot constituted one-sixth the height of a man, hence the number 6 determined the height of the human body.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

[[File:EuclidStatueOxford.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Euclid]]]]
Thus both numbers, 6 and 10, were credited with perfection, both on purely mathematical grounds and on grounds of their relevance in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt; Belief in the "perfection" of certain numbers survived [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], but this quality came to be ascribed to other numbers as well. The perfection of the number 3 actually became [[proverb]]ial: "''omne trinum perfectum''" ({{lang-la|all threes are perfect}}).  Another number, 7, found a devotee in the 6th-century [[Pope]] [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great), who favored it on grounds similar to those of the Greek mathematicians who had seen 6 as a perfect number, and in addition for some reason he associated the number 7 with the concept of "[[eternity]]."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]], however, championed the perfection of 6: [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Alcuin]] wrote that [[God]] had created the world in 6 days because that was the perfect number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

The Greek mathematicians had regarded as perfect that number which equals the [[summation|sum]] of its [[divisor]]s that are smaller than itself. Such a number is neither 3 nor 7 nor 10, but 6, for 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

But there are more numbers that show this property, such as 28, which = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. It became customary to call such numbers "perfect." [[Euclid]] gave a formula for (even) "perfect" numbers:
:N&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; (2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)
where ''p'' and 2&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 are [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p137 /&gt;

[[Euclid]] had listed the first four perfect numbers: 6; 28; 496; and 8128. A manuscript of 1456 gave the fifth perfect number: 33,550,336. Gradually mathematicians found further perfect numbers (which are very rare). In 1652 the [[Poland|Polish]] [[polymath]] [[Jan Brożek]] noted that there was no perfect number between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Perfection in the Sciences.  I. Perfect Numbers," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite over 2,000 years of study, it still is not known whether there exist infinitely many perfect numbers; or whether there are any odd ones.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

Today the term "perfect number" is merely historic in nature, used for the sake of tradition. These peculiar numbers had received the name on account of their analogy to the construction of man, who was held to be [[nature]]'s most perfect creation, and above all on account of their own peculiar regularity. Thus, they had been so named on the same grounds as perfect objects in nature, and perfectly proportioned edifices and statues created by man; the numbers had come to be called "perfect" in order to emphasize their special regularity.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The [[Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]]s had named these numbers "perfect" in the same sense in which [[philosopher]]s and [[artist]]s used the word. Jamblich (''In Nicomachi arithmeticam'', Leipzig, 1894) states that the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] had called the number 6 "marriage," "health," and "beauty," on account of the [[harmony]] and accord of that number.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The perfect numbers early on came to be treated as the measure of other numbers: those in which the sum of the divisors is greater than the number itself, as in 12, have — since as early as [[Theon of Smyrna]], ca. 130 A.D. — been called "redundant" ({{lang-la|redundantio}}), "more than perfect" (''plus quam perfecti''), or "[[abundant number]]s", and those the sum of whose divisors is smaller, as in 8, have been called "[[deficient number]]s" (''deficientes'').&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

Currently 47 perfect numbers have been identified.

==Physics and chemistry==
[[File:Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Robert Boyle|Boyle]]]]
A variety of [[physics|physical]] and [[chemistry|chemical]] [[concept]]s include, in their names, the word "perfect."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p138 /&gt;

The physicist designates as a ''[[rigid body|perfectly rigid]]'' body, one that "is not deformed by forces applied to it."  He uses the concept in the full awareness that this is a fictitious body, that no such body exists in [[nature]]. The concept is an ''[[thought experiment|ideal]] [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]''.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Perfection in the Sciences.  II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[plasticity (physics)|perfectly plastic]]'' body is one that is deformed infinitely at a constant load corresponding to the body's limit of plasticity: this is a physical ''[[Physical model|model]]'', not a body observed in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[black body|perfectly black]]'' body would be one that absorbed completely, radiation falling upon it — that is, a body with a coefficient of absorption equal to unity.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A [[crystal]] is perfect when its physically equivalent walls are equally developed; it has a perfect [[structure]] when it answers the requirements of spatial [[symmetry]] and is free of structural defects, dislocation, lacunae and other flaws.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[perfect fluid]]'' is one that is incompressible and non-viscous — this, again, is an [[ideal fluid]] that does not exist in nature.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

A ''[[perfect gas]]'' is one whose molecules do not interact with each other and which have no volume of their own.  Such a gas is ''fictitious'', just as are perfectly solid, perfectly rigid, perfectly plastic and perfectly black bodies. They are termed "perfect" in the ''strict'' (non-metaphorical) sense of the word. These are all concepts that are necessary in physics, insofar as they are limiting, ideal, fictitious — insofar as they set the extreme which nature may at the most approach.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

In a ''looser'' sense, real things are called "perfect" if they approximate perfection more or less closely, though they be not, strictly speaking, perfect.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

The relation of these ''perfect'' bodies to ''real'' bodies may be illustrated by the relation of a perfect gas to a real one. The equation of state of a perfect gas is a first approximation to a quantum equation of state that results from statistical physics. Thus, the equation of state of a real gas within classical limits assumes the form of the equation of  state of a perfect gas. That is, the equation of state of a perfect gas describes an ideal gas (comprising points, that is, dimensionless molecules that do not act upon one another).&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

The [[ideal gas law|perfect gas equation]] arose from the work of [[Robert Boyle]], [[Edme Mariotte]] and [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], who, in studying the properties of [[real gas]]es, found [[formula]]s applicable not to these but to an ideal, [[perfect gas]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSp1980p139 /&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Plato]]]]
The ''[[ethics|ethical]]'' question of perfection concerns not whether man ''is'' perfect, but whether he ''should'' be. And if he ''should'' be, then how is this to be attained?&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] seldom actually used the term, "perfection"; but the concept of "[[Good and evil|good]]", central to his philosophy, was tantamount to "perfection." He believed that approximation to the idea of perfection makes people perfect.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

Soon after, the [[Stoics]] introduced the concept of perfection into ethics expressly, describing it as [[harmony]] — with [[nature]], [[reason]], man himself. They held that such harmony—such perfection—was attainable for anyone.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

Plato and the Stoics had made perfection a [[philosophy|philosophical]] watchword. Soon it would be transformed, in [[Christianity]], into a [[religion|religious]] one.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p117 /&gt;

The Christian doctrine of perfection is in the [[Gospels]] as well as elsewhere in the [[Bible]]. [[The Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48 enjoins: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." &lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), pp. 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christian writings, especially [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s, are replete with calls to perfection. Many of these are collected in a discourse by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], ''De perfectione iustitiae hominis''. They begin already with the [[Old Testament]]: "Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God." (''[[Deuteronomy]]'' 18:13.)  Elsewhere synonyms for "perfection" are "undefiled", "without rebuke", "without blemish", "blameless", "holy", "righteous", "unblamable", "unreprovable."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p118&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]]]
Augustine explains that not only that man is properly termed perfect and without blemish who is already perfect, but also he who ''strives'' unreservedly after perfection. This is a broader concept, of ''approximate'' perfection, resembling that used in the [[exact sciences]]. The first ancient and Christian perfection was not very remote from modern ''self-perfection''. [[St. Ambrose]] in fact wrote about ''degrees'' of perfection ("''gradus piae perfectionis''").&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p118 /&gt;

Along with the idea of perfection, [[Holy Scripture]] conveyed doubt as to whether perfection was ''attainable'' for man. According to [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] 1:8, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." Similarly Jesus said in Matthew 19:17: "And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God..."; while Jesus does not deny that he himself is good, he does call into question the idea that anyone but God can even be good, let alone perfect. And [[St. Jerome]] wrote:  "''Perfectio vera in coelestibus''" — true perfection is to be found only in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 5th century CE, two distinct views on perfection had arisen within the Church: that it was attainable by man on earth by his own powers; and, that it may come to pass only by special [[divine grace]]. The first view, which was championed by [[Pelagius]], was condemned in 417 CE; the second view, which was championed by St. Augustine, prevailed at the very beginning of the 5th century and became authoritative.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the Church did not condemn the writings of the [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Areopagite]], purportedly the first [[bishop]] of [[Athens]], voicing a ''natural'' possibility for man to rise to perfection, to the contemplation of God. And so, for centuries, two views contended within the Church.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

Even as, for the ancient philosophers, the essence of perfection had been [[harmony]], so for the [[Gospel]] and the Christian theologians it was [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], or love. [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] wrote (''[[Epistle to the Colossians]]'', 3:14): "And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

[[St. Gregory]] wrote that perfection will be realized only after the fulfillment of history — only "then will the world be beautiful and perfect." Still, everyone should make his own approach to perfection — to [[Sacred|holiness]].  Discourses in moral theology and [[asceticism]] were generous with advice on how this was to be done.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p119 /&gt;

The [[medieval]] concept of perfection and self-perfection, especially in its mature form, can be natural for modern man. As formulated by [[Peter Lombard]], this concept implies that perfection is a result of ''[[Personal development|development]]''. And as described by [[Giles of Rome]], perfection has not only personal sources ("''personalia''") but ''social'' ones ("''secundum statum''"). Since the individual is formed within a [[society]], the second perfection subsumes the first, in accordance with the "order of the universe" ("''ordo universi''"). The social perfection is ''binding'' on man, whereas personal perfection is only ''becoming'' to him.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p120&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Theses on perfection persist within the Church to the present day. The first condition for perfection is the desire of it. Also necessary is [[Divine grace|grace]] — but God gives grace to those who desire perfection and strive for it.  Another condition for perfection is constancy of striving and effort. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] says: "He who stops, regresses." And effort is necessary in things not only great but also in the smallest; the [[Gospel]] according to [[St. Luke]] says: "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:  and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much." An aid in approaching perfection is an awareness of [[God]]'s perfection and of one's own imperfection.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p120/&gt;

[[File:John Calvin Titian B.jpg|thumb|100px|[[John Calvin|Calvin]]]]
The 14th century saw, with the [[Scotism|Scotists]], a shift in interest from [[moral]] to [[ontology|ontological]] perfection; the 15th century, particularly during the [[Italian Renaissance]], a shift to [[art]]istic perfection.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the 16th century saw [[John Calvin]]'s complete conditioning of man's perfection on the [[divine grace|grace of God]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

The second half of the 16th century brought the [[Counter-reformation]], the [[Council of Trent]], and a return of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] concept; and also, heroic attempts to attain perfection through [[contemplation]] and [[mortification of the flesh|mortification]]. This was the age of [[Ignatius Loyola]] and the founding of the [[Jesuit Order]]; of [[Teresa of Ávila|St. Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–82) and [[St. John of the Cross]] (1542–91), and the 1593 founding of the [[Discalced Carmelites|Barefoot Carmelites]]. This was the culminating point in the history of the [[Christianity|Christian]] idea of perfection; at the same time, it was the terminal point as there soon began attempts at reforming the idea.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121/&gt;

The first half of the 17th century saw attempts at a Catholic reform of the idea of perfection. This was the time of [[Cornelis Jansen]] (1585–1638) and of [[Jansenism]] — of a growing belief in [[predestination]] and in the impossibility of perfection without [[Divine grace|grace]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

With the second half of the 17th century came a further development in the doctrine of [[predestination]] — the doctrine of "[[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]]." Perfection could be reached through a passive awaiting of grace rather than by an active striving. This theory, formulated in [[Spain]] by [[Miguel de Molinos]] (ca. 1628 - 1697), spread in [[France]], where it was espoused by [[Madame Guyon]] (1648–1717) and for a time attracted [[François Fénelon]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p121 /&gt;

The 18th century brought a sea change to the idea of moral perfection. Faith in it remained, but it changed character from [[religion|religious]] to [[secular]]. This secular, 18th-century perfection was a fundamental article of faith for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Its central tenet was that ''[[nature]] was perfect''; and perfect, too, was the man who lived in harmony with nature's law.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primitive man was held to be the most perfect, for he was closest to nature. Perfection lay behind present-day man rather than before him, for [[civilization]] distanced man from perfection instead of bringing him closer to it.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

A second interpretation, however, took the contrary view: [[civilization]] perfected man by bringing him closer to [[reason]], and thereby to [[nature]]; for reason would direct life with due consideration for the [[natural law|laws of nature]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

The former, retrospective view of perfection had antecedents in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]: [[Hesiod]] and [[Ovid]] had described a "[[golden age]]" that had existed at the beginning of time, and which had been succeeded by silver, copper and Iron Ages, each inferior to the previous. The renewal of this view now, after two millennia, was stimulated by European contact with the "primitive" peoples of the [[Americas]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was but one of many who wrote in a similar vein.&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

These two mid-18th-century schools of thought — one seeing perfection in [[nature]] and in the past, and the other in [[civilization]] and in the future — represented a reaction not against the idea of perfection, but against its [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] interpretation: as, earlier, the measure of perfection had been the idea of [[God]], so now it was the idea of [[nature]] or of [[civilization]]. It was the latter idea that ultimately gained the upper hand and passed into the 19th century as the legacy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122/&gt;

The idea of perfection as transcendental, fell away; only worldly perfection counted. The idea that perfection was a matter of grace, also fell by the wayside; man himself must strive for it, and if a single man could not accomplish it, then perhaps mankind could. As [[God]] had been the measure of perfection during the [[Middle Ages]], so now man was: the measure had become smaller, more accessible. To the thinking of the 19th century, such worldly, human perfection might ultimately be attainable by everyone. And if not perfection, then ''improvement''.  This would be the great concept of the [[modern age]].&lt;ref name=TatarkiewiczSu1980p122 /&gt;

At the very midpoint of the 18th century, there occurred an exceptional momentary retreat from the idea of perfection.  It was in the [[France|French]] ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The entry, "Perfection" (vol. XII, 1765), discussed only technical perfection, in the sense of the matching of human products to the tasks set for them; no mention was made of [[ontology|ontological]], [[morality|moral]] or [[esthetics|esthetic]] perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, the 18th century saw great declarations championing the future perfection of man, as in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Idee zu einer allgemeinem Geschichte'' (1784) and [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]]'s ''Ideen'' (1784/91).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

Perfection was expected to come about by a variety of means. Partly it would be by way of ''natural'' development and progress (the view espoused by [[David Hume]]) but more so by way of ''[[education]]'' (precursors of this view included [[John Locke]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], and the leaders of the [[Polish Enlightenment]]) and by way of overt ''state'' action ([[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], later [[Jeremy Bentham]]); reliance was placed in [[cooperation]] among people ([[Charles Fourier]], 1808), later in [[eugenics]] ([[Francis Galton]], 1869). While the foundations of the faith in the future perfectibility of man changed, the faith itself persisted. It linked the people of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with the [[idealism|idealists]] and [[romanticism|romantics]] — with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], the [[Polish messianism|Polish Messianists]] — as well as with the 19th-century [[Positivism|Positivists]] and [[evolutionism|evolutionists]]; [[Herbert Spencer]] penned a great new declaration championing the future perfection of man.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

The idea of human perfectibility had, however, become more comprehensive. Man would attain greater perfection, in the sense that he would live more rationally, healthily, happily, comfortably. But there was no adequate term for this new conception, as the term "perfection" had a moral coloring, while the new goal was more intellectual, physical and social.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

In 1852, [[John Henry Newman]], the future [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], wrote that it would be well if the [[English language]], like the [[Greek language|Greek]], had a term to express [[intellect]]ual perfection, analogously to the term "[[health]]", which addresses man's physical state, and to "[[virtue]]", which speaks to his moral nature. During the 19th century, the [[Germany|Germans]] would come to call perfection, thus construed, "culture" (''Kultur''), and the [[France|French]] would call it "civilization" (''civilisation'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 123"/&gt;

One of the elements of perfection, in its new construction, is ''[[health]]'', understood by the [[World Health Organization]] as "a state of complete physical and mental well-being."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Moral Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 3 (summer 1980), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the burgeoning achievements of contemporary [[biology]] have not dislodged the age-old interest in moral perfection — with the important distinction, that the goal now is not so much perfection as ''improvement''. A classic early-19th century exponent of this view was [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"/&gt;

In the 20th and 21st centuries, the advances of [[science]] and [[technology]] appear to have been paralleled to some extent by increasingly pluralistic attitudes. The [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]] [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886–1980) has written: "To demand of someone that he strive after perfection seems equally inappropriate as to blame him for not striving after it." Such striving, he adds, "is often egocentric and yields poorer moral and social results than an outward-directed behavior based not on self-perfection but on good will and kindliness toward others."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 124"/&gt;

==Aesthetics==
The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] viewed perfection as a requisite for [[beauty]] and high [[art]]. The [[Pythagoreans]] held that perfection was to be found in the right [[Body proportions|proportions]] and in a [[harmony|harmonious]] arrangement of parts. The idea that beauty and art were characterized by perfection, was subsequently embraced by [[Plato]], who believed that art ought to be "apt, suitable, without deviations" — in short, "perfect".&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewiczn p. 145"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a conviction that perfection was a single quality, the Pythagoreans, Plato and their adherents held that beauty also was a single quality; hence, for every kind of art, there was but one perfect and proper [[Substantial form|form]]. [[Plutarch]] stated (''De Musica'') that, during the early Greek age, musical [[harmony|harmonies]] that were recognized as perfect were ''legally binding'' at public performances.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewiczn p. 145" /&gt;

Similarly, in [[temple]] [[architecture]] from the 5th century BCE, there were established [[classical order|orders]].  There were established [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s for [[Doric order|Doric]] temples, and for [[Ionia|Ionic]] temples. Likewise in [[sculpture]], for centuries, it was a matter of dogma that certain proportions of the human body were perfect and obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a prevalent belief that certain [[shape]]s and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]] were in themselves perfect. Plato felt that the perfect proportion was the [[ratio]] of the [[Edge (geometry)|side]] to the [[diagonal]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]]. His authority was so great that architects and other artists continued using this proportion, even when ignorant of its source, as late as the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Another early idea — one that was to be espoused by many illustrious writers and artists of various periods — found perfection in the [[circle]] and the [[sphere]]. [[Aristotle]] wrote in the ''Physica'' that the circle was "the perfect, first, most beautiful form." [[Cicero]] wrote in ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (On the Nature of the Gods): "Two [[shape|forms]] are the most distinctive:  of [[solid]]s, the [[sphere]]... and of [[plane figure]]s, the [[circle]]...  There is nothing more [[symmetry|commensurate]] than these forms."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

In a commentary to Aristotle's ''De coelo et mundo'' (''[[On the Heavens|On the Heavens and Earth]]''), the [[medieval]] [[Poles|Pole]], [[Jan of Słupcza]], wrote: "The most perfect body ought to have the most perfect form, and such [a body] is [[heaven]], while the most perfect form is the round form, for nothing can be added to it." In the famous illustrated ''Les très riches heures du duc de Berry'', [[paradise]] is depicted as contained within an ideal [[sphere]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] [[architect]] [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) stated: "the round form is the most perfect of all."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 146"/&gt;

The most excellent of 16th-century architects, [[Andrea Palladio]], held that "the most perfect and most excellent" form was "the round form, since of all forms it is the simplest, the most uniform, the strongest, the most capacious" and "is the most suitable for rendering the unity, infinity, uniformity and righteousness of God." This was the same thought as in Jan of Słupcza and in Serlio, and it was one of uncommon durability.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]] — [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[High Medieval|Gothic]] alike — had been quite taken with the idea of perfection. But a true explosion of the imperative for perfection came with the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

Renaissance aesthetics placed less emphasis than had [[classicism|classical]] aesthetics on the unity of things perfect. [[Baldassare Castiglione]], in his ''[[Il Cortegiano|Courtier]]'', wrote, of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Giorgione]], that "each of them is unlike the others, but each is the most perfect [''perfectissimus''] in his style." &lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

[[File:Daniele Barbaro by Titian.jpg|thumb|[[Daniele Barbaro|Barbaro]]]]
The great [[architect]] and [[polymath]] [[Leone Battista Alberti]] wrote (''De architectura'') that "the art of building... in [[Italy]] [had] achieved perfect maturity", that the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] had "created such a perfect art of building that there was in it nothing mysterious, hidden or unclear." This was yet another formulation of the concept of perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

[[Daniele Barbaro]], in his 1567 translation of [[Vitruvius]], classically defined perfection as "that which lacks nothing and to which nothing can be added."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 147"/&gt;

The Renaissance showed a marked concern with ''preeminence'' in perfection. Leonardo concluded that the most perfect of the [[arts]] was [[painting]]. In 1546 [[Benedetto Varchi]] compared great masters in the arts. Others compared [[art]] and [[science]], [[art]] and [[nature]], and perfection in the arts of the ancients with that in the modern masters. The 16th century saw comparisons of their music, the 17th — of their [[visual arts]] and especially of their [[poetry]]. These comparisons construed perfection fairly loosely; the concept was treated more strictly by [[architecture|architects]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] distinguished a variety of properties to perfection. It was variously held to be:
* an ''objective'' property ([[Petrarch]], who opposed perfection to other esthetic qualities such as grace);
* specific to ''[[art]]'' rather than to nature ([[Vasari]]);
* a ''rare'' property ([[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] felt that not even Greek architecture had attained perfection);
* a property of the ''whole'' work rather than of its parts ([[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]);
* a conjunction of ''many'' values ([[Lodovico Dolce]] thought [[Raphael]] perfect because Raphael had manifold talent, as opposed to the one-sided [[Michelangelo]]);
* something that required not merely talent but art, that is, ''[[skill]]'' ([[Vasari]]);
* not the ''sole'' value in a work of [[art]] ([[Vasari]] differentiated perfection from grace; Renaissance [[Platonism|Platonists]] such as [[Ficino]] viewed perfection as a divine attribute).&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[eclecticism|eclectic]] view of the late Renaissance, perfection in a work would require uniting the talents of ''many'' artists. [[Paolo Pino]] held that only that painter would be perfect who combined the talents of [[Titian]] and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of perfection was harder to apply to Renaissance [[literature]] but became so common — often, linked to "''eccelente''" — as to become banal. Its frequent application brought about its [[relativization]] and even [[subjectivity|subjectivization]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

Beginning with [[Sebastiano Serlio|Serlio]] and [[Palladio]], perfection in art had become less important, less definite, less objective. The striving for perfection no longer had the importance for [[man of letters|men of letters]] that it did for the great [[architect]]s. But the 17th century still revered perfection, as shown by the appearance of that word in book titles: ''De perfecta poesi'' by the [[Poland|Polish]] [[poet]] [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640); ''Le peintre parfait'' (1767 by [[André Félibien]]; and ''Idée de la perfection de la peinture'' (1662) by [[Fréart de Chambray]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

Sarbiewski offered several theses: poetry not only imitates things ''perfectissime'' ("most perfectly"), but imitates them as they ought ''perfectissime'' to be in nature; perfect art is recognized by its agreement with nature, as well as its universality; art is the more perfect, the nobler (''nobilior'') its manner of representing things; it is the more perfect, the more truths it contains; perfection has various degrees — it is higher in [[poetry]] than in [[prose]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 149"/&gt;

In [[classicism]], especially in [[France|French]] 17th-century classicism, from an ''ideal'' attainable by few, perfection became an ''obligation'' for every author. And inasmuch as the criterion of perfection had been lowered, "perfection" now meant only ''correctness.'' In the ensuing devaluation, it was not enough that art be ''perfecta'', it should be ''perfectissima''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfection, formerly the ''supreme'' characterization for a work of art, now became but one of ''many'' positive characterizations. [[Cesare Ripa]], in his ''Iconologia'' (published 1593, but typical for the 17th century), presented ''perfezione'' as a concept of equal status with grace (''grazia''), prettiness (''venustà'') and [[beauty]] (''bellezza'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s pupil, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in his ''Psychology'', wrote that beauty consists in perfection, and that this was why beauty was a source of pleasure.  No such general esthetic theory, explicitly naming perfection, had ever been formulated by any of its devotees from [[Plato]] to [[Palladio]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Edmund Burke|Burke]]]]
Wolff's theory of beauty-as-perfection was developed by the school's chief aesthetician, [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]]. This tradition remained active in Germany as late as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], who considered both [[beauty]] and [[sublimity]] to be ideas of perfection; when unity prevailed, beauty emerged; when plurality — sublimity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

In the latter part of the 18th century, [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote much in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' about perfection — inner and outer, objective and subjective, qualitative and quantitative, perceived clearly and obscurely, the perfection of nature and that of art. Nevertheless, in aesthetics Kant found that "The judgment of taste [i.e., aesthetic judgment] is entirely independent of the concept of perfection" — that is, beauty was something different from perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 150"/&gt;

Earlier in the 18th century, [[France]]'s leading aesthetician, [[Denis Diderot]], had questioned whether perfection was a more comprehensible idea than beauty. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] had treated perfection as an unreal concept, and wrote [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], "Let us not seek the [[wiktionary:chimera|chimera]] of perfection, but that which is the best possible."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], in 1757, the important aesthetician [[Edmund Burke]] denied that perfection was the cause of beauty.  Quite the contrary, he argued that beauty nearly always involved an element of ''imperfection''; for example, women, in order to heighten their attractiveness, emphasized their weakness and frailty, which is to say, their imperfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

The 18th century was the last for which perfection was a principal concept in aesthetics. In the 19th century, perfection survived only vestigially as a general expression of approval. [[Alfred de Musset]] held that "Perfection is no more attainable for us than is infinity. One ought not to seek it anywhere: not in love, nor beauty, nor happiness, nor virtue; but one should love it, in order to be virtuous, beautiful and happy, insofar as that is possible for man."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Paul Valéry]] wrote: "To strive for perfection, to devote endless time to a work, to set oneself—like [[Goethe]]—an unattainable goal, are all intents that are precluded by the pattern of modern life."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1980 p. 151"/&gt;

The dismissal of the question concerning whether artists ''can'' achieve perfection, still left the question: Do artists ''want'' to achieve it? Is that their actual goal? Some artists, schools and epochs ''have'' aimed for perfection. Others have nurtured ''other'' goals: pluralism, novelty, powerful sensations, faithfulness to truth, self-expression and expression of the world, [[creativity]] and [[originality]] — all of which may roughly be summarized as "expression."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been ages of perfection, and ages of expression. The arts of [[ancient Greece]], the [[Renaissance]] and [[neoclassicism]] were arts of perfection. In the [[mannerism|mannerist]], [[baroque]] and [[romanticism|romantic]] periods, expression has prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Aesthetic Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VII, no. 4 (autumn 1980), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ontology and theology==
The Greek philosopher [[Anaximander]] described the world as "endless" (''apeiron''), [[Xenophanes]] — as "the greatest" (''megistos'').  But while they ascribed great qualities to the world, they did not regard it as perfect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Parmenides]]]]
Only [[Parmenides]] seems to have considered [[existence]] to be "''tetelesmenon''" ("finished"); and [[Melissus of Samos|Melissos]], his successor in the [[Eleatics|Eleatic school]], said that existence "was entirely" ("''pan esti''"). Thus both saw perfection in existence; true existence was one, constant, immutable.  Moreover, Parmenides thought the world to be [[wiktionary:finite|finite]], limited in all directions, and like a [[sphere]] — which was a mark of its perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187" /&gt;

Parmenides' view was embraced to some extent by [[Plato]]. He thought that the world was the work of a good [[Demiurge]], and that this was why order and harmony prevailed in the world.  The world was the best, the most beautiful, perfect. It had a perfect shape (spherical) and a perfect motion (circular).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 187"/&gt;

But Plato said nothing about the Demiurge architect-of-the-world himself being perfect. And understandably so, for perfection implied finitude, limits; whereas it was the world, not its creator, that had limits. A similar view was held by [[Aristotle]]: the world could be perfect, but God could not.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the [[pantheism|pantheist]] [[Stoics]] held the divinity to be perfect — precisely because they identified it with the world. [[Cicero]] wrote in ''De natura deorum'' (On the Nature of the Gods) that the world "encompasses... within itself all beings... And what could be more nonsensical than denying perfection to an all-embracing being...  Besides the world, there is no thing that does not lack something and that is harmonious, perfect and finished in every respect..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a certain moment, Greek philosophy became bound up with the religion of the [[Christianity|Christians]]: the abstract concept of [[first cause]] became linked with the religious concept of [[God]]; the ''[[primum movens]]'' became identified with the [[Creator deity|Creator]], the absolute with the divine Person. Features of an absolute existence were discovered in the Person of the Creator: He was immutable, timeless. And absolute existence took on the attributes of a person: it was good, omnipotent, omnipresent. Christian [[theology]] united the features of the [[first cause]] in Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics]]'' with those of the Creator in the ''[[Book of Genesis]]''. But the attributes of God did not include perfection, for a perfect being must be ''finite''; only of such a being might one say that it lacked nothing.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"/&gt;

There was another reason for the denial, to God, of perfection — in a branch of Christian theology that was under the influence of [[Plotinus]]. In this view, the absolute from which the world derived could not be grasped in terms of human [[concept]]s, even the most general and transcendent. Not only was that absolute not [[matter]], it was not [[spirit]] either, nor [[idea]]; it was superior to these. It exceeded any description or praise; it was incomprehensible and ineffable; it was beyond all that we may imagine — including perfection.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 188"/&gt;

[[Medieval]] Christian philosophy held that the concept of perfection might describe Creation, but was not appropriate to describe God. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], indicating that he was following [[Aristotle]], defined a perfect thing as one that "possesses that of which, by its nature, it is capable." Also (''[[Summa Theologica]]''): "That is perfect, which lacks nothing of the perfection proper to it." Thus there were, in the world, things perfect and imperfect, more perfect and less perfect. God permitted imperfections in Creation when they were necessary for the good of the whole.  And for man it was natural to go by degrees from imperfection to perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Duns Scotus]] understood perfection still more simply and mundanely: "Perfection is that which it is better to have than not to have." It was not an attribute of God but a property of creation: all things partook of it to a greater or lesser degree. A thing's perfection depended on what sort of perfection it was eligible for. In general, that was perfect which had attained the fullness of the qualities possible for it.  Hence "whole" and "perfect" meant more or less the same ("''totum et perfectum sunt quasi idem''").&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|[[Benedict Spinoza|Spinoza]]]]
This was a [[teleology|teleological]] concept, for it implied an [[telos (philosophy)|end]] (goal or purpose). God created things that served certain purposes, created even those purposes, but He himself did not serve any purpose.  Since God was not finite, He could not be called perfect: for the concept of perfection served to describe ''finite'' things. Perfection was not a [[theology|theological]] concept, but an [[ontology|ontological]] one, because it was a feature, in some degree, of every [[being]]. The 9th-century thinker [[Paschasius Radbertus]] wrote: "Everything is the more perfect, the more it resembles God." Still, this did not imply that God himself was perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of perfection, as an attribute of God, entered [[theology]] only in modern times, through [[René Descartes]] — and in the ''[[plural]]'', as the "perfections" of God.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 190–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Descartes, the concept of perfection as a principal concept in philosophy was upheld by other great 17th-century thinkers. In [[Benedict Spinoza]]'s philosophy, however, there was no personal God, and perfection became a property of — even a synonym for — the existence of reality (that is, for the essence of things).&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] wrote: "As M. Descartes states, ''existence'' itself is perfection." Leibniz added: "Perfection, I call any simple quality, if it is positive and absolute, such that, if it expresses something, it does so without limits."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"/&gt;

At the same time, Leibniz also construed perfection, in his ''[[Monadology]]'', in an utterly different way: "Only that is perfect which possesses no limits, that is, only God."  This concept would last out the entire 17th century.  Subsequently, [[Immanuel Kant]] would describe perfection as "''omnitudo realitatis''" ("the omnitude of reality").  Thus perfection, which during the [[Middle Ages]] could be a property of any individual being, in 17th-century philosophy became as well, and indeed preeminently, a property of God.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 191"/&gt;

Leibniz's pupil and successor, [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], took up this concept of perfection — but with a difference. Wolff ascribed perfection not to being as a whole, but once again to its individual constituents. He gave, as examples, an eye that sees faultlessly, and a watch that runs faultlessly. He also distinguished variants — ''perfectio simplex'' and ''composita'', ''primaria'' and ''secundaria'' — and differentiated the magnitude of perfection (''magnitudo perfectionis'').&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), pp. 191–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolff's pupil, [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], derived perfection from rules, but anticipated their collisions (''regularum collisio'') leading to exceptions (''exceptio'') and limiting the perfection of things. Baumgarten distinguished perfection ''simplex'' and ''composita'', ''interna'' and ''externa'', ''transcendentalis'' and ''accidentalis''; and, positing so broad a construction, he arrived at the conclusion that "everything is perfect."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "Ontological and Theological Perfection," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 1 (winter 1981), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, Wolff and his pupils had returned to the [[ontology|ontological]] concept of perfection that the [[Scholastics]] had used. The ''[[theology|theological]]'' concept of perfection had lived only from Descartes to Leibniz, in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

Thanks to Wolff's school, the concept of perfection lasted in [[Germany]] through the 18th century. In other western countries, however, especially [[France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], in that century the concept of perfection was already in decline. It was ignored by the French ''[[Grande Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

The history of the concept of perfection had undergone great evolutions — from "''Nothing'' in the world is perfect", to "''Everything'' is perfect"; and from "Perfection is ''not'' an attribute of God", to "Perfection ''is'' an attribute of God."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

With [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s school, every thing had become perfect. This was a singular moment in the history of the [[ontology|ontological]] concept of perfection; and soon thereafter, that history came to an end.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz 1981 p. 192"/&gt;

==Many concepts==
The foregoing discussion shows that the ''term'' "perfection" has been used to designate a variety of ''[[concept]]s'':
* The word "perfection" has a special meaning in [[mathematics]], where it gives a ''[[proper name]]'' to certain [[number]]s that demonstrate uncommon properties.
* In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], "perfection" designates a ''[[scientific model|model]]'' — a conceptual construct for bodies that in reality do not precisely correspond to the model.
* Elsewhere the term "perfection" is used consistently with the word's [[etymology]] ("perfect" = "finished"). That is perfect which ''lacks nothing''. This is how the term has been used in [[ontology]] (a perfect being), [[ethics]] (a perfect life) and [[medicine]] (perfect health). In these fields, the concept is understood variously as ''ideal [[model (abstract)|model]]'' or as ''actual [[approximation]]'' to the model.
* Also called "perfect" is that which completely ''achieves its purpose''. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] gave examples from [[biology]] (perfect vision) and [[technology]] (a clock that runs neither slow nor fast).  Here "perfection" is less fictitious [[model (abstract)|model]] than actual ''[[approximation]]'' to the model.
* That is "perfect," which completely fulfills its functions. In ''social'' discourse, one speaks of a perfect artist, engineer or carpenter. The term is used similarly in [[art]] criticism, when speaking of perfect technique or of the perfect likeness of a portrait. Here again, "perfection" is either ideal model or approximate realization of the model.
* In [[aesthetics]] and [[art theory]], perfection is ascribed to what is fully [[harmony|harmonious]] — to what is constructed in accordance with a single principle (e.g., the [[Parthenon]], the ''[[Odyssey]]'').&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz p. 11"&gt;'''[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]]''', "On Perfection:  Conclusion,"  ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for the first, mathematical sense, all these concepts of "perfection" show a kinship and oscillate between [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] and [[approximation]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz p. 11" /&gt;

However, the expression "perfect" is also used [[colloquial]]ly as a [[superlative]] ("perfect idiot," "perfect scoundrel," "perfect storm"). Here ''perfectum'' is confused with ''excellens'' of an approving, admiring or condemnatory kind.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "On Perfection:  Conclusion," ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perfection has also been construed as that which is ''the best''. In [[theology]], when [[Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] termed [[God]] "perfect," they had in mind something other than ''[[model (abstract)|model]]''; than that which ''lacks nothing''; than that ''achieves its purpose''; than that fulfills its functions; or than that ''is [[harmony|harmonious]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, "On Perfection:  Conclusion,"  ''Dialectics and Humanism'', vol. VIII, no. 2 (spring 1981), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17649">'''Political satire''' is [[satire]] that specializes in gaining entertainment from [[politics]]; it has also been used with [[subversive]] intent where [[Political discourse analysis|political speech]] and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.

Political satire is usually distinguished from political [[protest]] or [[political dissent]], as it does not necessarily carry an agenda nor seek to influence the political process. While occasionally it may, it more commonly aims simply to provide entertainment. By its very nature, it rarely offers a constructive view in itself; when it is used as part of protest or dissent, it tends to simply establish the error of matters rather than provide solutions.

==Origins and genres==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Ghjkl.JPG|left|thumb|Animated shows like South Park are notorious for political satire]] --&gt;
Satire can be traced back throughout history; wherever organized [[government]], or social categories, has existed, so has satire.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The oldest example that has survived till today is [[Aristophanes]]. In his time satire targeted top politicians, like Cleon,&lt;ref&gt;Stephanos Matthaios, Franco Montanari, Antonios Rengakos [https://books.google.com/books?id=EZuetiBvK-wC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207 ''Ancient Scholarship and Grammar: Archetypes, Concepts and Contexts''] pp.207-8&lt;/ref&gt; and religion, at the time headed by Zeus. "Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith," leading to an increased doubt towards religion by the general population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Ehrenberg (historian)|Ehrenberg, Victor]] (1962) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oikOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263 ''The people of Aristophanes: a sociology of old Attic comedy''] p.263 quotation: {{quotation|The fact that the gods could be brought down to a human or 'far too human' level is certainly rooted in the very nature of Greek religion, and there is no doubt that this attitude contributed to the gradual undermining of the old belief in the gods. [...] To tell immoral and scandalous stories about the gods did not offend average religious feeling; it troubled only advanced spirits like Xenophanes and Pintar [...] and it is clear that people no longer believed either in the story or in Zeus. Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith, above all faith in the gods' power, and it was from this that doubt began to grow.&lt;br&gt; The power of the gods, whose dignity and stringth were impressively reflected in most of the tragedies, however different the religious attitudes of the tragic poets were, this same power was on the same festival days belittled and questioned by the comic poets who made fun of the gods and represented traditional and sacred forms in a starling manner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman period, for example, gives us the satirical poems and epigrams of [[Martial]]. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers often engaged in political satire.

Due to lack of political freedom of speech in many ancient civilizations, [[covert satire]] is more usual than overt satire in ancient literatures of [[political liberalism]]. Historically, the [[public opinion]] in the [[Athenian democracy]] was remarkably influenced by the political [[satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307-19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching or reading satire has since ancient time been considered one of the best ways to understand a culture and a society.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes I: Clouds, Wasps, Birds'', Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emil J. Piscitelli (1993) [http://mysite.verizon.net/thelogos/lect-2.htm ''Before Socrates-Diotima''] ''The Special Case of Aristophanes: Tribal and Civil Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Aristophanes'', pp.42-seq&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th and 21st Centuries satire is found in an increasing number of media (in [[cartoon]]s as [[political cartoon]]s with heavy [[caricature]] and exaggeration, and in [[List of political magazines|political magazine]]s) and the parallel exposure of [[political scandal]]s to performances (including [[television]] shows). Examples include musicians such as [[Tom Lehrer]], live performance groups like the [[Capitol Steps]] and the [[Montana Logging and Ballet Co.]], and public television and live performer [[Mark Russell]]. Additional subgenres include such literary classics as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and more recently, internet ''[[Ezine]]'' and website sources such as ''[[The Onion]]''.

==19th century==
===France===
One example is [[Maurice Joly]]'s 1864 pamphlet entitled ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'' (''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu''), which attacks the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]]. It was first published in [[Brussels]] in 1864. The piece used the literary device of a [[dialogue]] between two diabolical plotters in [[Hell]], the historical characters of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], to cover up a direct, and illegal, attack on Napoleon's rule.  The noble baron Montesquieu made the case for [[liberalism]]; the [[Florence|Florentine]] political writer Machiavelli presented the case for cynical [[despotism]]. In this manner, Joly communicated the secret ways in which liberalism might spawn a despot like Napoleon III. However, [[The Prince#Interpretation of The Prince as political satire|''The Prince'']] itself has also been sometimes understood as political satire.

===Germany===

According to [[George Santayana|Santayana]], Nietzsche was actually "a keen satirist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/Santayana%27s%20Criticism%20of%20Nietzsche.htm#The%20Superman George Santayana : ''Egotism in German Philosophy''. 1915. chapter 13.]&lt;/ref&gt;
"Nietzsche's satire" was aimed at Lutheranism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1kRbO4M5CB0C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Nietzsche+%22Lutheran+revivalist%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gniaAiHyMW&amp;sig=bx8O9CCvIvECzRJ3MPV81Nr-I2o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bFrSSYrzKorItgfV14zxBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Christa Davis Acampora &amp; Ralph R. Acampora : ''A Nietzchean Bestiary''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003. p. 109]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In UK media==
The UK has a long tradition of political satire, dating from the early years of English literature. In some readings, a number of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays can be seen – or at least performed – as satire, including ''[[Richard III]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Later examples such as [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' are more outright in their satirical nature.

In modern era, political satire in the [[United Kingdom]] includes pamphlets and newspaper articles, such as ''[[Private Eye]]'', topical television panel shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', and television series such as ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'' and ''[[The Thick of It]]'' and ''[[ToryBoy The Movie]]''.

==On American television==
Satire became more visible on American television during the 1960s. Some of the early shows that used political satire include the British and American versions of the program ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' (airing on the [[American Broadcasting Company]], or ABC, in the U.S.), [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. During the months leading up to the 1968 presidential election, [[Richard Nixon]] appeared on ''Laugh-In'' and repeated the program's catch-phrase "Sock it to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=satire+tv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones &amp; Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of satire of the 1960s and early 1970s typically used the sitcom format, such as the show ''[[All in the Family]]''.

When ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' debuted in 1975, the show began to change the way that comedians would depict the president on television. [[Chevy Chase]] opened the fourth episode of the show with his impersonation of a bumbling [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=satire+tv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, "With All Due Respect: Satirizing Presidents from ''Saturday Night Live'' to ''Lil' Bush''", in Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones &amp; Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; Chase did not change his appearance to look like President Ford, and he portrayed the president by repeatedly falling down on the stage. Some of the other famous presidential impersonations on ''Saturday Night Live'' include [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] caricatures, [[Dana Carvey]] as [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Darrell Hammond]] as [[Bill Clinton]], [[Will Ferrell]] as [[George W. Bush]], and [[Jay Pharoah]] as [[Barack Obama]]. Hammond was the first cast member to impersonate [[Donald Trump]], but now [[Alec Baldwin]] portrays him.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, ''Saturday Night Live'' gained wide attention because former cast member [[Tina Fey]] returned to the show to satirize Republican Vice Presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]]. In addition to Fey's striking physical resemblance to Palin, the impersonation of the vice presidential candidate was also noteworthy because of Fey's humorous use of some of exactly the same words Palin used in media interviews and campaign speeches as a way to perform political satire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b_Kaca5Fp-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=entertaining+politics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BryaUZqoKYb_4AOXtoDQBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, ''Entertaining Politics: Satiric Television and Political Engagement''. 2nd edition. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2010. p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saturday Night Live'' also uses political satire throughout its ''[[Weekend Update]]'' sketch. ''Weekend Update'' is a fake news segment on the show that satirizes politics and current events. It has been a part of ''SNL'' since the first episode of the show on October 11, 1975.

''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' use stylistic formats that are similar to ''Weekend Update''. On ''The Daily Show'', host [[Jon Stewart]] used footage from news programs to satirize politics and the news media. [[Stephen Colbert]] performed in character on ''The Colbert Report'' as a right-wing news pundit. Both hosts' television programs were broadcast on [[Comedy Central]], while ''The Daily Show'' continues to run featuring [[Trevor Noah|a new host]]. Colbert became the host of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|The Late Show]]'', succeeding David Letterman. With their shows, Stewart and Colbert helped increase public and academic discussion of the significance of political satire. ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' and ''[[The Jim Jefferies Show]]'' are also examples of political commentary.

== Influence in politics ==

=== Contributions ===
According to the findings of the 2004 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Survey]], both younger and older audiences are turning to late-night comedy shows as not only a source of entertainment, but also for an opportunity to gain political awareness.&lt;ref name="Baym"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Communication|volume=22|pages=259–276|doi=10.1080/10584600591006492|issn=1091-7675}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Geoffrey Baym suggests that shows that make use of political satire, such as ''[[The Daily Show]]'', should be considered as a form of [[alternative media|alternative journalism]].&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Utilizing satire has shown to be an attractive feature in news programming, drawing in the audiences of less politically engaged demographic cohorts. Moreover, satire news programming can be considered alternative because satire plays an important role in dissecting and critiquing  power.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;

In his article ''The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism'', Baym detailed how ''[[The Daily Show]]'', then hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], presented news stories. For the satire news show, presenting information in a comprehensive manner was used to give viewers a greater perspective of a situation.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Often, Stewart studded his segments with additional background information, or reminders of relevant and past details.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; For example, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' displayed the full video of [[George W. Bush|Bush's]] comments regarding [[George Tenet|Tenet's]] resignation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; This was a deliberate choice by the show in attempt to give a more sincere representation of the event.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Moreover, it can be seen as a challenge and critique of what more traditional news shows failed to include.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; In this way, satire news can be seen as more informative than other news sources. Notably, research findings released by [[National Annenberg Election Survey|National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES)]] concede that followers of satire news are more knowledgeable and consume more news than the general population.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Joseph Faina has considered the satire used in news shows as a facilitator in developing a [[Citizen journalism|public journalism]] practice.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Faina explains in his article that the nature of satire encourages viewers to become politically engaged, and a [[Citizen journalism|civic participant]], in which the humor exercised by hosts elicit responses in viewers.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; However, Faina has acknowledged that this model is somewhat idealistic.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Nevertheless, Faina argues that the potential still exists.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Not to mention, with the rise in technology and the growing ubiquity of cellular phones, it can be argued that civic participation is all the more easier to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=Natalie|editor1-last=Allan|editor1-first=Stuart|title=News in the Digital Age|journal=The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism (1|date=October 2009|pages=557–567|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns ===
Though satire in news is celebrated as a vehicle toward a more informed public, such view is not universally shared among scholars.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Dannagal G.|title=Lighten up: How satire will make American politics relevant again|url=http://archives.cjr.org/cover_story/lighten_up.php|website=Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have expressed their hesitancy toward the infiltration of lighthearted practices to cover more dire topics like political affair.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; Potentially off-color remarks, or vulgar comments made by the likes of [[Stephen Colbert]] of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', or [[Samantha Bee]], host of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee]]'', can be used as examples of what critics are concerned over. Here, satire is believed to diminish the gravity of a topic.&lt;ref name="Faina"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faina|first1=Joseph|title=Public journalism is a joke: The case for Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert|journal=Journalism|date=2012|volume=14|issue=4|pages=541 –555|doi=10.1177/1464884912448899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baym proposes that as these shows are [[alternative media|alternative]], they have no obligation to "abide by standard practices".&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Unlike traditional news sources, which may be required to adhere to certain agendas, like political affiliation or advertising restrictions, hosts of satire news shows are free and zealous to showcase personal contributions through their mentions of disdain, qualms, and excitement. Critics of satire in news shows thus believe that the showcasing of an overly and openly frustrated host will induce or perpetuate "cynicism in viewers".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt;

The '''Public Dance Halls Act 1935''' ({{lang-ga|Acht Um Hallai Rinnce Puibli, 1935}}) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Oireachtas]] which regulates [[dance hall]]s in Ireland by introducing a licensing system and a tax on admission tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dance Theatre in Ireland: Revolutionary Moves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2EbCeH5DWQIC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=7 December 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-03547-9|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The proposals were based on the recommendations of the 1932 report of the Carrigan Commission into [[juvenile sex crimes]].&lt;ref name="history707"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/707|title=Review of 'Ireland’s Magdalen Laundries and the Nation’s Architecture of Containment'|last=Murphy|first=Paula|date=December 2008|work=Reviews in History|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Carrigan Report recommendations were enacted in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, which raised the [[age of consent]] and banned artificial [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="history707" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0006/index.html|title=Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On dance halls, the report stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In the course of the Inquiry no form of abuse was blamed more persistently for pernicious consequences than the unlicensed dances held all over the country in unsuitable buildings and surroundings, for the profit of persons who are liable to no control or supervision by any authority. The scandals that are the outcome of such a situation are notorious. They have been denounced in [[Pastoral letter|pastoral]]s, exposed in the Press, and condemned by clergy, judges and justices, without avail. Before us the Commissioner, speaking for the [[Garda Síochána|Civic Guard]], said these dance gatherings in many districts were turned into "orgies of dissipation, which in the present state of legislation the police are powerless to prevent." In short, there is no effective legislation to put down this nuisance.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Public Dance Halls Bill was introduced in 1934 by the [[Government of the 8th Dáil|then government]] of [[Fianna Fáil]], and supported by the opposition [[Fine Gael]] and [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1934062800016?opendocument|title=In Committee on Finance. - Public Dance Halls Bill, 1934—Second Stage.|date=28 June 1934|work=Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was supported by [[Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference|the Catholic hierarchy]]. Secular nationalist institutions like the [[Gaelic League]] the legislation were seen as beneficial for protecting Irish culture against foreign influence.&lt;ref name="Gedutis2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Gedutis|title=See You at the Hall: Boston's Golden Era of Irish Music And Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtO3jbQ1YZ0C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=1 July 2005|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-640-4|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural effect==
Licensing is administered at the [[District Court (Ireland)|district court]], subject to the discretion of the local judge. In the early years of its effect, they were less tolerant of more recently introduced musical styles, such as [[set dancing]] (seen as "foreign") and [[1930s in jazz|jazz]] dance clubs.&lt;ref name="Roche2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Roche|title=The Cambridge Companion to Brian Friel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jexvtdc88PMC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=19 October 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-82767-6|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StokesBohlman2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Stokes|author2=Philip V.

This set the conditions for the predominance of the [[céilidh]], with its large and loud musical ensembles and wide open dance spaces.&lt;ref name="Gedutis2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallely1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fintan Vallely|title=The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xN1VS6sWsEC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=28 April 2013|year=1999|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-8802-8|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ceilidh]] arose at the expense of older traditional music, which declined in popularity for decades until the creation of the [[Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann]], and later the [[Folk Revival]] brought new attention to traditional Irish music.&lt;ref name="StokesBohlman2003"/&gt;

'''Quentin Kenihan''' (27 February 1975 – 6 October 2018) was an Australian disability advocate, writer and actor. He was born with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], a rare bone disease.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Benjamin |title=Disability advocate Quentin Kenihan dies |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/disability-advocate-quentin-kenihan-dies-20181007-p50892.html |accessdate=7 October 2018 |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WaddesdonManor.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Waddesdon Manor]], seat of the [[Rothschild family]], 1874]]

'''Renaissance Revival''' (sometimes referred to as "'''Neo-Renaissance'''") is a broad designation that covers many 19th century [[Revivalism (architecture)|architectural revival styles]] which were neither Grecian (see [[Greek Revival]]) nor Gothic (see [[Gothic Revival]]) but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes. Under the broad designation "[[Renaissance architecture]]" nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in [[Florence]] and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of [[Humanism]]; they also included styles we would identify as [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] or [[Baroque]]. Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century: "Neo-Renaissance" might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called "[[Italianate]]", or when many [[French Baroque]] features are present ([[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]]).

The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe, particularly in France and Italy, has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture. A comparison between the breadth of its source material, such as the English [[Wollaton Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Wollaton_Hall.html |title=Wollaton Hall |publisher=Greatbuildings.com |date= |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian [[Palazzo Pitti]], the French [[Château de Chambord]], and the Russian [[Palace of Facets]]—all deemed "''Renaissance''"—illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take.

==Origins of Renaissance architecture==
{{main article|Renaissance architecture}}
The origin of Renaissance architecture is generally accredited to [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446)&lt;ref name=copplestone&gt;Copplestone, Trewin (1963). ''World Architecture''. Hamlyn.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|243}} Brunelleschi and his contemporaries wished to bring greater "order" to architecture, resulting in strong symmetry and careful proportion. The movement grew from scientific observations of nature, in particular human anatomy.

Neo-Renaissance architecture is formed by not only the original Italian architecture but by the form in which Renaissance architecture developed in France during the 16th century. During the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in [[northern Italy]], bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war [[treasure|booty]], but also stylistic ideas. In the [[Loire valley]] a wave of [[chateau]] building was carried out using traditional French Gothic styles but with ornament in the forms of pediments, arcades, shallow pilasters and entablatures from the [[Italian Renaissance]].

In England the Renaissance tended to manifest itself in large square tall houses such as [[Longleat House]]. Often these buildings had symmetrical towers which hint at the evolution from medieval fortified architecture. This is particularly evident at [[Hatfield House]] built between 1607 and 1611, where medieval towers jostle with a large Italian cupola. This is why so many buildings of the early English Neo-Renaissance style often have more of a "castle air" than their European contemporaries, which can add again to the confusion with the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival style]].

==Birth of the Neo-Renaissance==
[[File:Mentmore Towers from angle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mentmore Towers]] English [[Jacobethan]] Neo-Renaissance completed in 1854, derives motifs from [[Wollaton Hall]] completed in 1588]]
[[File:Spb 06-2012 Palace Embankment various 09.jpg|thumb|right|Russia: The façade of the [[Vladimir Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] (1867–1872) redolent of [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s designs.]]
[[File:Prague 07-2016 View from Petrinska Tower img4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Czech Republic]]: [[National Theatre (Prague)|Prague, National Theatre]] 1862]]

When in the 19th century Renaissance style architecture came into vogue, it often materialized not just in its original form according to geography, but as a hybrid of all its earlier forms according to the whims of architects and patrons rather than geography and culture. If this were not confusing enough, the new Neo-Renaissance then frequently borrowed architectural elements from the succeeding Mannerist period, and in many cases the even later Baroque period. Mannerism and Baroque being two very opposing [[Architectural style|styles of architecture]]. Mannerism was exemplified by the [[Palazzo del Te]] and Baroque by the [[Wurzburg Residenz]].

Thus Italian, French and Flemish Renaissance coupled with the amount of borrowing from these later periods can cause great difficulty and argument in correctly identifying various forms of 19th-century architecture. Differentiating some forms of French Neo-Renaissance buildings from those of the [[Gothic revival]] can at times be especially tricky, as both styles were simultaneously popular during the 19th century.

[[John Ruskin]]'s panegyrics to architectural wonders of Venice and Florence contributed to shifting "the attention of scholars and designers, with their awareness heightened by debate and restoration work"&lt;ref&gt;Rosanna Pavoni. ''Reviving the Renaissance: The Use and Abuse of the Past in Nineteenth-Century Italian Art''. Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-48151-1}}. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--the work is available online through Google Books.--&gt; from [[Neoclassicism|Late Neoclassicism]] and Gothic Revival to the Italian Renaissance. As a consequence, a self-consciously "Neo-Renaissance" manner first began to appear circa 1840. By 1890 this movement was already in decline. [[The Hague]]'s [[Peace Palace]] completed in 1913, in a heavy French Neo-Renaissance manner was one of the last notable buildings in this style.

[[Charles Barry]] introduced the Neo-Renaissance to England with his design of the [[Travellers Club]], [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] (1829–1832). Other early but typical, domestic examples of the Neo-Renaissance include [[Mentmore Towers]] and the [[Château de Ferrières]], both designed in the 1850s by [[Joseph Paxton]] for members of the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] banking family. The style is characterized by original Renaissance [[Motif (art)|motifs]], taken from such Quattrocento architects as [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]. These motifs included [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] masonry and [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]], windows framed by [[architrave]]s and doors crowned by [[pediment]]s and [[entablature]]s. If a building were of several floors, the uppermost floor usually had small square windows representing the minor [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine floor]] of the original Renaissance designs. However, the Neo-renaissance style later came to incorporate [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Baroque]] features not found in the original Renaissance architecture which was often more severe in its design.

Like all architectural styles, the Neo-Renaissance did not appear overnight fully formed but evolved slowly. One of the very first signs of its emergence was the [[Würzburg]] Women's Prison, which was erected in 1809 designed by [[Peter Speeth]]. It included a heavily rusticated ground floor, alleviated by one semicircular arch, with a curious [[Egypt]]ian style miniature [[portico]] above, high above this were a sequence of six tall arched windows and above these just beneath the slightly projecting roof were the small windows of the upper floor. This building foreshadows similar effects in the work of the American architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] whose work in the Neo-Renaissance style was popular in the USA during the 1880s. Richardson's style at the end or the revival era was a severe mix of both Romanesque and Renaissance features.&lt;ref name=copplestone /&gt;{{rp|300–318}} This was exemplified by his "Marshall Field Warehouse" in [[Chicago]] (completed in 1887, now demolished).

However, while the beginning of  Neo-Renaissance period can be defined by its simplicity and severity, what came between was far more ornate in its design. This period can be defined by some of the great [[opera house]]s of Europe, such as [[Gottfried Semper]]'s Burgtheater in Vienna, and his Opera house in [[Dresden]]. This ornate form of the Neo-Renaissance, originating from France,&lt;ref name=copplestone /&gt;{{rp|311}} is sometimes known as the "Second Empire" style, by now it also incorporated some [[Baroque]] elements. By 1875 it had become the accepted style in Europe for all public and bureaucratic buildings.&lt;ref name=copplestone /&gt;{{rp|p. 311; caption 938}} In England, where Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] designed the London [[Foreign Office]] in this style between 1860 and 1875, it also incorporated certain [[Palladian]] features.

Starting with the [[orangery]] of [[Sanssouci]] (1851), "the Neo-Renaissance became the obligatory style for university and public buildings, for banks and financial institutions, and for the urban villas" in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Modern German Culture''. Cambridge University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-521-56870-6}}. Page 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most accomplished examples of the style were Villa Meyer in Dresden, [[Villa Haas]] in [[Hesse]], Palais Borsig in [[Berlin]], Villa Meissner in [[Leipzig]]; the German version of Neo-Renaissance culminated in such turgid projects as the Town Hall in [[Hamburg]] (1886–1897) and the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in Berlin (completed in 1894).

In Austria, it was pioneered by such illustrious names as [[Rudolf Eitelberger]], the founder of the Viennese College of Arts and Crafts (today the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]]). The style found particular favour in [[Vienna]], where whole streets and blocks were built in the so-called Neo-Renaissance style, in reality, a classicizing conglomeration of elements liberally borrowed from different historical periods.

[[File:Andrássy út Budapest 1896.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrássy Avenue]] with the [[Hungarian State Opera House]] in 1896]]
[[File:Institute of Technology (today Eötvös Loránd University), Budapest.jpg|thumb|right|Institute of Technology (today [[Eötvös Loránd University]]), [[Budapest]] by [[Imre Steindl]]]]

Neo-Renaissance was also the favourite style in [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 1870s and 1880s. In the fast-growing capital, [[Budapest]] many monumental public buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style like [[Saint Stephen's Basilica]] and the [[Hungarian State Opera House]]. [[Andrássy Avenue]] is an outstanding ensemble of Neo-Renaissance townhouses from the last decades of the 19th century. The most famous Hungarian architect of the age, [[Miklós Ybl]] preferred Neo-Renaissance in his works.

In Russia, the style was pioneered by [[Auguste de Montferrand]] in the [[:File:Demidovhouse.jpg|Demidov House]] (1835), the first in [[Saint Petersburg]] to take "a story-by-story approach to façade ornamentation, in contrast to the classical method, where the façade was conceived as a unit".&lt;ref name=buckler&gt;Julie A. Buckler. ''Mapping St. Petersburg: Imperial Text and Cityshape''. Princeton University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-691-11349-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} [[Konstantin Thon]], the most popular Russian architect of the time, used Italianate elements profusely for decorating some interiors of the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (1837–1851). Another fashionable architect, [[Andrei Shtakenschneider|Andrei Stackensneider]], was responsible for [[Marie Palace]] (1839–1844), with "the faceted rough-hewn stone of the first floor" reminiscent of 16th-century Italian palazzi.&lt;ref name=buckler /&gt;{{rp|45}}

[[File:The Breakers Newport.jpg|right|thumb|United States: [[The Breakers]], [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], 1893]]

The style was further elaborated by architects of the [[Vladimir Palace]] (1867–1872) and culminated in the [[Stieglitz Museum]] (1885–1896). In [[Moscow]], the Neo-Renaissance was less prevalent than in the Northern capital, although interiors of the neo-Muscovite [[Moscow City Hall|City Duma]] (1890–1892) were executed with emphasis on Florentine and Venetian décor. While the Neo-Renaissance is associated primarily with secular buildings, Princes [[Yusupov]] commissioned the interior of [[:File:Arkhang.jpg|their palace church]] (1909–1916) near [[Moscow]] to be decorated in strict imitation of the 16th-century Venetian churches.

The style spread to [[North America]], where it became a favourite domestic architectural style of the wealthiest Americans. [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], was a residence of the [[Vanderbilt family]] designed by [[Richard Morris Hunt]] in 1892; it and contemporaneous [[Gilded Age]] mansions exemplify the ambitions of wealthy Americans in equaling and surpassing the ostentatious lifestyles of European aristocrats. During the latter half of the 19th century [[Fifth Avenue|5th Avenue]] in [[New York City]] was lined with "Renaissance" French chateaux and Italian [[palazzo|palazzi]], all designed in Neo-Renaissance styles. Most of these have since been demolished.

==Features of Renaissance Revival architecture==

[[File:Hotel de Ville de Paris, West view, cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Paris [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] completed circa 1880 in an unequivocal French Neo-Renaissance style.]]

One of the most widely copied features of Renaissance architecture were the great staircases from the chateaux of [[Chateau de Blois|Blois]] and [[Château de Chambord|Chambord]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=27457&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Chateau de Chambord] retrieved 19 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Blois had been the favourite residence of the [[List of French monarchs|French Kings]] throughout the renaissance. The [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] wing, completed in 1524,  of which the staircase is an integral part was one of the earliest examples of [[French Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castles.org/castles/Europe/Western_Europe/France/france110.htm |title=Chateau de Blois |publisher=Castles.org |date= |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; French renaissance architecture was a combination of the earlier [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style coupled with a strong Italian influence represented by arches, arcades, balustrading and, in general, a more flowing line of design than had been apparent in the earlier Gothic. The Chateau de Blois's triumphal staircase was imitated almost from the moment of its completion, and was certainly the predecessor of the "double staircase" (sometimes attributed to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]) at the [[Château de Chambord]] just a few years later.

A Grand Staircase whether based on that of Blois, or the [[Villa Farnese]] was to become one of the features of Neo-Renaissance design. It became a common feature for the staircase to be not just a feature of the internal architecture but also the external. But whereas at Blois the stairs had been open to the elements in the 19th century new and innovative use of glass was able to give protection from the weather, giving the staircase the appearance of being in the true renaissance open style, when it was in fact a truly internal feature. Further and more adventurous use of glass also enabled the open and arcaded Renaissance courtyards to be reproduced as lofty halls with glazed roofs. This was a feature at Mentmore Towers and on a far larger scale at the  [[Warsaw University of Technology]], where the large glazed court contained a monumental staircase. The "Warsaw University of Technology staircase", though if Renaissance in spirit at all, is more in the lighter, more [[column]]ed style of [[Ottaviano Nonni]]'s (named il Mascherino) staircase designed for [[Pope]] [[Gregory XIII]] at Rome's [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo Quirinale]] in 1584, thus demonstrating that architects wherever their location were selecting their Neo-Renaissance styles reardless of geography

==Combined historicism==

===Gothic influences on the Renaissance Revival===
{{See also|Gothic Revival architecture|Scottish baronial style}}
[[File:Neorenaissancedoor.gif|thumb|right|150px|This Renaissance Revival doorway illustrates a [[French Gothic architecture|Gothic]] influence on French Renaissance design. A basket-handle portal is surmounted by a floral [[ogee]] hood moulding.]]

Gothic influences on both period and revived Renaissance architecture are readily apparent, first as much building occurred during the period of transition from the Gothic to the Renaissance style; and also as Renaissance−era design took the form of the addition of Renaissance ornamentation to Gothic−era buildings thus creating an accretion of details from disparate sources. Architects who designed in the Renaissance Revival style usually avoided any references to [[Gothic Revival]] architecture, drawing instead on a variety of other classically based styles. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  However, there are exceptions and occasionally the two distinct styles are mixed. The sub-variety of Gothic design most frequently employed is floral [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian Gothic]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, as seen in the [[Doge's Palace#Courtyard|Doge's Palace]] courtyard, built in the 1480s.

===Baroque influences on the Renaissance Revival===
[[File:Wut-interior.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The staircase at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]], with strong [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque Revival]] influences.]]
{{See also|Baroque Revival architecture}}
A common [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] feature introduced into the Renaissance Revival styles was the "imperial staircase" (a single straight flight dividing into two separate flights).

The [[staircase]] at [[Mentmore Towers]] designed by Joseph Paxton, and the one at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] designed by Bronisław Rogóyski and Stefan Szyller (late 19th century), both rise from [[pastiche]]s of true Renaissance courtyards. Both staircases seem more akin to [[Balthasar Neumann]]'s great Baroque staircase at the [[Würzburg Residenz]] than anything found in a true Renaissance Palazzo. The apparent Baroque style staircase at Mentmore is not without a Renaissance influence, its first flight is similar to "The staircase of the Giants" rises from the Doge's Palace Courtyard, designed when the Venetian Gothic was being uncomfortably merged with Renaissance style. Similarly to that at Mentmore, the Staircase of the Giant's terminates on to an arcaded loggia. Perhaps not ironically the Hall and Staircase at Mentmore were designed by Paxton to display furniture formerly housed in the Doge's Palace.

Paris is home to many historicist buildings that partake equally from Renaissance and Baroque source material, such as the [[Opera Garnier]]. However, the Parisian [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] faithfully replicates the true [[French Renaissance architecture|French Renaissance]] style, complete with the steeply pitched roofs and towers, as it was a reconstruction, completed circa 1880, of the previous Hôtel de Ville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviewoncities.com/paris/hoteldeville.htm |title=Hôtel de Ville |publisher=Aviewoncities.com |date= |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[British Raj]] in 1880, the [[façade]]s of the 1777 [[Writers' building]] in [[Kolkata]] were redesigned in the Renaissance Revival style then popular in colonial India, though this version was remarkable in its unique design. Loggias of [[Palladian window|Serlian arches]] deceptively form an almost Indian appearance, yet they sit beneath a [[Mansard]] roof. In what at first glance appears an Indian building, on closer examination shows a Historicist example of Classical [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] combined with the French Renaissance, a uniquely distinctive interpretation of the Renaissance Revival style.

==Renaissance Revival interiors==
[[File:Hubert Robert 003.jpg|thumb|right|350px|True [[Renaissance]]: The [[Villa Farnese]]: the curved staircase, tall segmented windows, and marble [[baluster|balustrading]] were all features frequently reproduced in the 19th century revival.]]

As mentioned above, the Neo-Renaissance style was in reality an eclectic blending of past styles, which the architect selected on the whims of his patrons. In the true Renaissance era there was a [[division of labour]] between the architect, who designed the exterior highly visible shell, and others—the artisans—who decorated and arranged the interior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"&gt;Dal Lago, Adalbert (1966). ''Ville Antiche''. Milan: Fratelli Fabbri.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Italian mannerist house was a place for relaxation and entertaining, convenience and comfort of the interior being a priority; in the later Baroque designs, comfort and [[interior design]] were secondary to outward appearance. This was followed by the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] period, which gave importance to the proportions and dignity of interiors, but still lost the comfort and internal convenience of the mannerist period. It was during the Neo-Renaissance period of the 19th century that the mannerist comforts were re-discovered and taken a step further. Not only did the improved building techniques of the 1850s allow the [[glass|glazing]] of formerly open [[loggia]]s and [[arch]]es with the newly invented sheets of plate glass, providing the first "picture windows", but also the blending of architectural styles allowed interiors and exteriors to be treated differently. It was at this time that the concept of "furnishing styles" manifested itself, allowing distinctions to be made between interior rooms and external appearances, and indeed between the various rooms themselves.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966" /&gt; Thus the modern concept of treating a room individually, and differently from its setting and neighbours, came into its infancy. Classic examples of this are the great [[Rothschild properties in Buckinghamshire|Rothschild house in Buckinghamshire]], [[Cross-genre|hybrids]] of various Renaissance [[chateau]]x, and 16th century [[English country house]]s, all  with interiors ranging from "Versailles" to "[[Medici]]", and in the case of Mentmore Towers a huge central hall, resembling the arcaded courtyard of a Renaissance villa, conveniently glazed over, furnished in [[Venice|Venetian]] style and heated by a fireplace designed by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] for his house in Antwerp&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's. ''Mentmore''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:NatWestLB.JPG|thumb|right|Provincial Neo-Renaissance English style: the [[NatWest]] Bank at Leighton Buzzard, [[Bedfordshire]], England is an example of the manner in which Neo-Renaissance architecture evolved among lesser architects in more modest surroundings as it gained in popularity.]]

By the beginning of the 20th century Neo-Renaissance was a commonplace sight on the main streets of thousands of towns, large and small around, the world. In [[southern Europe]] the  Neo-Renaissance  style began to fall from favour circa 1900. However, it was still extensively practiced in the 1910s in [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Buenos Aires]] by such architects as [[Leon Benois]], [[Marian Peretyatkovich]], or [[Francisco Tamburini]] ([[:File:Buenos Aires-ColonTeatre-P3050009.jpg|picture]]).

In England it was so common that  today one finds "Renaissance Italian Palazzi" serving as banks or municipal buildings in the centres of even the smallest towns. It has been said "''It is a well-known fact that the nineteenth century had no art style of its own.''"&lt;ref&gt;Lessenich, Rolf P. [https://web.archive.org/web/20041116165123/http://www.uni-erfurt.de/eestudies/eese/artic24/rless/1_2004.html "Ideals Versus Realities: Nineteenth-Century Decadent Identity and the Renaissance"].  2004-01. Accessed 10 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  While to an extent this may be true, the same could be said of most eras until the early 20th century, the Neo-Renaissance in the hands of provincial architects did develop into a style not always instantly recognisable as a derivative of the Renaissance. In this less obvious guise the Neo-Renaissance was to provide an important undercurrent in totalitarian architecture of various countries, notably in [[Stalinist architecture]] of the [[Soviet Union]], as seen in some pavilions of the [[All-Soviet Exhibition Centre]].

[[File:Yar april 16.jpg|center|thumb|Neo-Renaissance Russian style: a little recorded, Neo-Renaissance building showing [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] influences in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia.]]

Neo-Renaissance architecture, because of its diversity, is perhaps the only style of architecture to have existed in so many forms, yet still common to so many countries.

[[File:Jucundus pushkin.jpg|thumb|Roman portraiture is characterized by its "[[wikt:warts and all|warts and all]]" realism; bust of [[Lucius Caecilius Iucundus]], a cast in the [[Pushkin Museum]]; the original in bronze was found in [[Pompeii]], and is now in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]]]

'''Roman portraiture''' was one of the most significant periods in the development of [[portrait]] art. Originating from [[ancient Rome]], it continued for almost five centuries. Roman portraiture is characterised by unusual realism and the desire to convey images of nature in the high quality style often seen in [[ancient Roman art]]. Some busts even seem to show clinical signs.&lt;ref&gt;Engmann B: Neurologic diseases in ancient Roman sculpture busts. Neurol Clin Pract December 2013 vol.3 no.6:539-541. doi: 10.1212/CPJ.0b013e3182a78f02&lt;/ref&gt; Several images and statues made in marble and bronze have survived in small numbers. [[Roman funerary art]] includes many portraits such as [[married couple funerary reliefs]], which were most often made for wealthy [[freedmen]] rather than the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] elite. 

Portrait sculpture from the Republican era tends to be somewhat more modest, realistic, and natural compared to early Imperial works. A typical work might be one like the standing figure "A Roman Patrician with Busts of His Ancestors" (c. 30 B.C.).&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

By the imperial age, though they were often realistic depictions of human anatomy, portrait sculpture of Roman emperors were often used for propaganda purposes and included ideological messages in the pose, accoutrements, or costume of the figure. Since most emperors from Augustus on were deified, some images are somewhat idealized. The Romans also depicted warriors and heroic adventures, in the spirit of the Greeks who came before them.

==Ideology==
===Religious functions and origins===
[[File:Old man vatican pushkin01.jpg|thumb|upright|Veristic portrait bust of an old man, head covered ''([[capite velato]])'', either a priest or ''[[paterfamilias]]'' (marble, mid-1st century BC)]]
The origin of the realism of Roman portraits may be, according to some scholars, because they evolved from wax [[death mask]]s. These death masks were taken from bodies and kept in a home altar. Besides wax, masks were made from bronze, marble and terracotta. The molds for the masks were made directly from the deceased, giving historians an accurate representation of typically Roman features.

===Politics===
In the days of the Republic, full-size statues of political officials and military commanders were often erected in public places. Such an honor was provided by the decision of the Senate, usually in commemoration of victories, triumphs and political achievements. These portraits were usually accompanied by a dedicatory inscription. If the person commemorated with a portrait was found to have committed a crime, the portrait would be destroyed.

===Social and psychological aspect===
Development of the Roman portrait was associated with increased interest in the individual, with the expansion of the [[social circle]] portrayed. At the heart of the artistic structure of many Roman portraits is the clear and rigorous transfer of unique features of the model, while still keeping the general style very similar. Unlike the ancient Greek portraits that strived for idealization (the Greeks believed that a good man must be beautiful), Roman portrait sculpture was far more natural and is still considered one of the most realistic samples of the genre in the history of art.

[[File:Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland logo.svg|100px|thumb|Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland logo]]
The '''Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland''' ('''RIAS''') is the [[professional body]] for [[architects]] in [[Scotland]].

==History==
Previously the (lapsed) '''Architectural Institute of Scotland''', it was re-founded in 1916 as the '''Incorporation of Architects in Scotland''' by architect [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] (1834–1921) from his sick bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200041 |title=(Sir) Robert Rowand Anderson, DSA Architect Biography Report |work=Dictionary of Scottish Architects |accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson donated his [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[townhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]] to be used as its home, where the organisation remains to this day.  It was given its first [[Royal charter]] in 1922, followed by a second in 1929.

==Organisation==
The RIAS comprises six chapters across Scotland:- 
*[[Aberdeen Society of Architects]] (ASA)
*[[Dundee Institute of Architects|Dundee Institute of Architects (DIA)]]
*Edinburgh Architectural Association (EAA)
*Glasgow Institute of Architects (GIA)
*Inverness Architectural Association (IAA)
*Stirling Society of Architects (SSA)
Associate membership is available to anyone registered as an architect who lives and works in Scotland.

The Incorporation is an independent body representing Architects working in Scotland although it consults regularly with the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) regarding UK-wide professional issues.  It lobbies Scottish Ministers and the [[Scottish Government]] directly on relevant issues.

The President is Willie Watt and the Treasurer and Secretary is Neil Baxter.  The Incorporation is run by an elected National Council comprising representatives of individual Chapters and nationally elected members.

The Incorporation offers accreditation in specialist fields including historic building conservation and environmental sustainability.

==RIAS Award for Architecture==

{{main|RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture}}

The RIAS award was founded in 2002 by the architect Andrew Doolan, whose work included the Point Hotel in Edinburgh.  The award is given to the best new building in Scotland, as judged by a jury of assessors. The value of the prize is £25,000, making it the largest prize for architecture in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Initially the prize money came from Doolan, but following his death in 2004 there were doubts as to whether the award could continue. The responsibility now lies with his mother Mrs Margaret Doolan who now patronises the award and from 2005 the award has been renamed the "RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture" in his memory.  Winners have included: the [[Enric Miralles]]' [[Scottish Parliament building]]; [[Bennetts Associates]]' University of Edinburgh [[Informatics Forum]]; and Reiach &amp; Hall's [[Pier Arts Centre]] in [[Orkney]].  The [[Maggie's Centres]] in [[Dundee]], [[Kirkcaldy]] and [[Inverness]] have all been nominated, with the one in Inverness by [[Page\Park Architects]] winning the award in 2006.

==RIAS Publishing==

RIAS publications include a series of architectural guides covering Scotland aimed at the general reader. Although smaller in size and more limited in scope, the aims are similar to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s eponymous series of [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Architectural Guides]] to England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Some volumes were published under RIAS's imprint, The Rutland Press. Others were co-published with [[Mainstream Publishing]]. Several volumes (marked *) have been updated as new editions, but not all volumes are currently in print.

'''Sacamantecas'''  ("Fat extractor" in Spanish) or '''mantequero'''&lt;ref name="Brenan"&gt;''Al Sur de Granada'', pages 190-193, [[Gerald Brenan]], 1997, Fábula - Tusquets Editores. Originally ''[[South from Granada (book)|South from Granada]]'', 1957&lt;/ref&gt; ("Fat seller/maker") is the Spanish name for a kind of [[bogeyman]]&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/drae/?type=3&amp;val=Sacamantecas Sacamantecas] in the [[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]&lt;/ref&gt; or criminal&lt;ref name="DRAE"/&gt; characterized by killing for [[human fat]].

==Anthropology==
[[Julian A. Pitt-Rivers|Julian Pitt-Rivers]] reports&lt;ref name="Pitt-Rivers"&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/peopleofthesierr001911mbp/peopleofthesierr001911mbp_djvu.txt The People of the Sierra]'', [[J. A. Pitt-Rivers]], page 205, 1954, [[Criterion Books]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; in his study of [[Alcalá de la Sierra]] the belief that village children can be stolen by an outsider, disguised as a beggar or a trader, who is hired by a [[anti-rich sentiment|rich man]] whose ill child can only be cured with the blood of healthy babies.
The practice of [[blood donation]] lent credence to the myth.

[[Gerald Brenan]]&lt;ref name="Brenan"/&gt; describes the ''mantequero'' as a monster in human form who lives in deserted areas and feeds on ''manteca''&lt;ref name="DRAEmanteca"&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/drae/srv/search?val=manteca&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0 manteca] in the DRAE&lt;/ref&gt; ("[human] [[adipose tissue|fat]]").
Upon capture, he shouts in a high pitch and, unless just fed, looks thin.
Brenan found the myth alive during his stays in the [[Alpujarra]] (Andalusia):
In 1927 or 1928, he had sublet his [[Yegen]] home to the British writer [[Dick Strachey]], nephew of [[Lytton Strachey]].
One day, Strachey was walking on rough terrain where he saw three suspicious men.
Fearing of [[wikt:bandolero|bandolero]]s, he ran away, but the three [[Romani people in Spain|Gipsies]] chased him and drew their knives shouting at him as a ''mantequero''.
The first impulse of the Gipsies was to kill the ''mantequero'' and [[blood magic|use his blood]] for magical remedies.
However the eldest Gipsy, a convict, judged safer to bring Strachey to the mayor.
They offered to slit his throat themselves, but the British man claimed in his rudimentary Spanish to be a relative of king [[George V of England]], convincing the mayor that he was not dealing with a monster.

A friend of Brenan found that in [[Torremolinos]] all the girls believed in ''mantequeros''.
In the urban version of the legend,&lt;ref name="Brenan"/&gt; an old evil marquis needs baby [[blood transfusion]]s to rejuvenate.

'''Scenic design''' (also known as [[scenography]], '''stage design''', '''set design''', or [[production designer|production design]]) is the creation of [[Theatre|theatrical]], as well as [[film]] or [[television]] [[theatrical scenery|scenery]].  Scenic designers come from a variety of artistic backgrounds, but in recent years, are mostly trained professionals, holding a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]] or [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] degrees in theater arts. Scenic designers design [[Theatrical scenery|set]]s and scenery that aim to support the overall artistic goals of the production.

== Scenic designer ==
A designer looks at the details searching for evidence through research to produce conceptual ideas that’s best toward supporting the content and values with visual elements. The subject of, “How do we generate creative ideas?” is a very legitimate question. The most consuming part of expanding our horizons toward scenic concepts is much more than witnessing creativity, and creative people. It starts with us opening our mind to the possibilities.  To have an attitude toward learning, seeking, and engaging in creativity and to be willing to be adventurous, inquisitive and curious. Our imagination is highly visual. Whether outside or inside, colorful trees or concerts, star lit skies or the architecture of a great building, scenic design is a process of discovery. Discovering what will best clarify and support the setting, environment, atmosphere, ambience, &amp; world that is being created.

The scenic designer works with the director and other designers to establish an overall visual concept for the production and design the stage environment. They are responsible for developing a complete set of design drawings that include the following:
*''basic ground plan'' showing all stationary scenic elements;
*''composite ground plan'' showing all moving scenic elements, indicating both their onstage and storage positions;
*section of the stage space incorporating all elements;
*''front elevations'' of every ''scenic element'', and additional elevations or sections of units as required.
All of these required drawing elements can be easily created from one accurate 3-D [[CAD model]] of the set design.

==Responsibility==
[[File:Robert Edmond Jones.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Scenic designer [[Robert Edmond Jones]] (1887-1954) drawing at a waist high table (c. 1920).]]
The scenic designer is responsible for collaborating with the [[theatre director]] and other members of the production design team to create an environment for the production and then communicating the details of this environment to the [[technical director]], [[production manager]], [[charge artist|charge scenic artist]] and [[property master|prop master]].  Scenic designers are responsible for creating [[scale model]]s of the scenery, [[artistic rendering|renderings]], paint elevations and scale construction drawings as part of their communication with other production staff.

==Training==
In Europe and Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sceno.org/theatre-design-101/training-as-a-theatre-designer/ |publisher=Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London article |title=Training as a Theatre Designer |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; scenic designers take a more holistic approach to theatrical design and will often be responsible not only for scenic design but costume, lighting and sound and are referred to as theatre designers or scenographers or production designers.

Notable scenic designers, past and present, include: Alban Piot, [[Adolphe Appia]], [[Boris Aronson]], [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Alison Chitty]], [[Antony McDonald]], [[Barry Kay]], [[Caspar Neher]], [[Cyro Del Nero]],  [[Aleksandra Ekster]], [[Daniil Lider]], [[David Borovsky]], [[David Gallo]], [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Es Devlin]], [[Ezio Frigerio]], [[Franco Colavecchia]], [[Christopher Gibbs]], [[Franco Zeffirelli]], [[George Tsypin]], [[Howard Bay (designer)|Howard Bay]], [[Inigo Jones]], [[Jean-Pierre Ponnelle]], [[Jo Mielziner]], [[John Lee Beatty]], [[Josef Svoboda]], [[Ken Adam]], [[Léon Bakst]], [[Luciano Damiani]], [[Maria Björnson]], [[Ming Cho Lee]], [[Motley Theatre Design Group|Motley]], [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Nathan Altman]], [[Nicholas Georgiadis]], [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]], [[Ralph Koltai]], [[Neil Patel (designer)|Neil Patel]], [[Robert Brill]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], [[Russell Patterson]], [[Brian Sidney Bembridge]], [[Santo Loquasto]], [[Sean Kenny (theatre designer)|Sean Kenny]], [[Todd Rosenthal]], [[Robin Wagner (designer)|Robin Wagner]], [[Tony Walton]], [[Roger Kirk (designer)|Roger Kirk]].

The [[Spectrum Award]] for Grand Master has been awarded annually since 1995 by the Spectrum Fantastic Art Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.spectrumfantasticart.com/board.php|title = Spectrum Fantastic Advisory Board|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Grand Master, as Arnie Fenner (SFA Advisory Board member) has explained, is an artist who has worked for at least twenty years at a consistently high level of quality; who has influenced and inspired other artists; and who has left his or her mark on the field as a whole. "Craft alone" he writes, " is not sufficient to receive the honor: There are many painters who produce solid professional work. But (and this is the key) it fails to resonate. It is admired in the moment and immediately forgotten. A Grand Master's art, on the other hand, gets stuck in the viewer's heart and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spectrum 21: The Best In Contemporary Fantastic Art|last = Fleskes|first = John|publisher = Flesk Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-933865-58-4|location = |pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnie Fenner also states "At the time of the designation is given the artist must be living. Recently, two GM honorees died prior to the announcement --Al Williamson and Ralph McQuarrie-- which confused a few people, but...both were still with us when the Board bestowed the honor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/10/grand-master.html|title = Grand Master post by Arnie Fenner on Muddy Colors|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frans Hals 013.jpg|thumb|''The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1627'']]
'''''The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1627''''' refers to a [[schutterstuk]] painted by [[Frans Hals]] for the St. George (or St. Joris) civic guard of [[Haarlem]], and today is considered one of the main attractions of the [[Frans Hals Museum]] there.

In this group, each man wears a sash belonging to the color of the "rot", in this painting all three are represented with their flag-bearers wearing the colours Orange, white or blue. These officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. The man with the orange sash holding a glass of wine sitting at the table on the left and looking at Captain [[Michiel de Wael]] with an empty glass, is Colonel [[Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn]], who heads the table.

The men featured are from left to right Lieutenant [[Cornelis Boudewijns]] (standing above Colonel Aernout Druyvesteyn), Captain [[Nicolaes Verbeek]], Flag bearer [[Boudewijn van Offenberg]], Lieutenant [[Jacob Pietersz Olycan]], Captain Michiel de Wael, and above him, standing, is Flag bearer [[Dirck Dicx]] looking down at Jacob Olycan. Just behind him in the background is the servant [[Arent Jacobsz Koets]], and below him, seated, is Lieutenant [[Frederik Coning]]. Behind the servant in the far right, is the flag bearer [[Jacob Cornelisz Schout]] who towers above the dwarf in the lower right, Captain [[Nicolaes le Febure]].

The painting previously hung with others in the old "St. Jorisdoelen" complex, known today as the [[Proveniershuis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=search&amp;cOffset=1&amp;cLimit=25&amp;oOrder=ASC&amp;cSubmit=1&amp;sCompMonNr=19243 report] on [[Rijksmonument]] number 19243&lt;/ref&gt;  The paintings by Hals and others hung in the main hall of the complex in the [[Grote Houtstraat]]. Today a [[hofje]] with the main hall used as a restaurant, the main buildings were used for years as an inn, where the schutterstukken were tourist attractions. Today all of the schutterstukken that once hung here have been transferred to the Frans Hals Museum.

'''''The Death of Actaeon''''' is a late work by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Titian]], painted in oil on canvas from about 1559 to his death in 1576 and now in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London.  It is very probably one of the two paintings the artist stated he had started and hopes to finish (one of which he calls "[[Actaeon]] mauled by [[Actaeon#Names_of_the_dogs_who_devoured_Actaeon|hounds]]") in a letter to their commissioner [[Philip II of Spain]] during June 1559.  However, most of Titian's work on this painting possibly dates to the late 1560s, but with touches from the 1570s. Titian seems never to have resolved it to his satisfaction, and the painting apparently remained in his studio until his death in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 250, 253&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been considerable debate as to whether it is finished or not, as with other very late Titians, such as the ''[[Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)|Flaying of Marsyas]]'', which unlike this has a signature, perhaps an indication of completion.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 248-252; Jaffé, 27-28, 59, 151-153, 166, the various authors offering a variety of views.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels - Petworth House.jpg|thumb|This painting is visible upper-right in ''[[Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels (Petworth)]]'', 1651]]

It is a sequel of Titian's work ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'' showing the story's tragic conclusion, which approximately follows the Roman poet [[Ovid]]'s account in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'': after Actaeon surprised the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] bathing naked in the woods, she transformed him into a stag and he was attacked and killed by his own hounds.&lt;ref name=nationalgallery-death&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/titian-the-death-of-actaeon "The Death of Actaeon"]. ''[[National Gallery]]''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both paintings belong to a group of large-scale mythological paintings inspired by the ''Metamorphoses'' and referred to by Titian himself as ‘poesie’, the visual equivalent of poetry, which he began producing for Philip II of Spain in 1551&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/titians-poesie-paintings "Titian’s ‘poesie’ paintings"]. ''National Gallery''. London.&lt;/ref&gt; and which also include ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' (many versions, Philip's in the [[Prado]], [[Madrid]]), ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (private collection, London, but also other versions), ''[[Perseus and Andromeda (Titian)|Perseus and Andromeda]]'' ([[Wallace Collection]], London), ''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'' ([[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]], [[Boston]]), ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'' and ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (shared by [[National Gallery of Scotland]] with NG London).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/titians-poesie-paintings/*/viewPage/3 "Titian's 'poesie' in Britain"]. ''National Gallery''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as ''The Death of Actaeon'' was never delivered to Philip, it is not always counted in the series.

==Subject==
Ovid's account does not include Diana herself pursuing Actaeon, or shooting at him, though in some other classical accounts she does chase him.  She seems to have just loosed an arrow, but there is no sign of the arrow in the painting, nor is the bowstring visible.  The goddess does not have her attribute of the small crescent in her hair that Titian's other two depictions in the ''poesie'' do, which troubled one early critic.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 252-257; Jaffé, 166&lt;/ref&gt;

There were ancient reliefs and [[engraved gem]]s showing either Diana hunting with dogs, or Actaeon being attacked by his dogs, and a few Renaissance works, but the subject was rare, and "it may be that Titian had never seen another painting or other representation of the subject."&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 252-253, 252 quoted; Jaffé, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was probably still in Titian's studio at his death in 1576, and presumably sold in Venice by his heirs.  It probably belonged to the famous Venetian collection of [[Bartolomeo della Nave]], most of which was bought for [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton]] (then still a Marquess) in 1636-38, one of the great collectors of the period in Britain.  Hamilton's brother-in-law, [[Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh]] (as he later became) was English ambassador to Venice, and helped to arrange the purchase. A list of available paintings he sent Hamilton includes "A Diana shooting Adonis in forme of a Hart not quite finished" by Titian.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton, who was a Royalist commander in the [[English Civil War]], was captured and executed in 1649 after losing the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]] to [[Oliver Cromwell]].  This, like most of his collection, was bought by [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1647 to 1656.  The painting appears (looking rather lighter in tone than today) in [[David Teniers the Younger]]'s painting of the ''[[Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (Brussels)|Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]]'' (1651, now [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], Brussels),&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 253; [https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/nl/de-collectie/david-ii-teniers-aartshertog-leopold-willem-in-zijn-galerij-italiaanse-schilderijen Aartshertog Leopold Willem in zijn galerij Italiaanse schilderijen] in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] collection&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his different versions of the subject now in [[Petworth House]] and the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna.

The archduke seems to have given it to Queen [[Christina of Sweden]], whose route into exile went through the [[Spanish Netherlands]], before she settled in Rome. It does not appear in an inventory of her collection made in [[Antwerp]] in 1656, but is in one made in Rome in 1662 or 1663.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 253-254&lt;/ref&gt;  After her death it eventually passed, with much of her collection, into the [[Orleans Collection]] in Paris in 1721.  Like most of the collection, it was bought by a consortium in London after the [[French Revolution]], and then sold in 1798 to [[Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet]] for the modest sum of 200 guineas, the price no doubt reflecting that it was considered by Hume and others as unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 255-257; Jaffé, 166&lt;/ref&gt;  Hume described it as "a great painting never finished but quite beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 252, translating from the Italian.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume was the author of the first [[monograph]] on Titian, published in 1829, and "was especially appreciative of preliminary sketches by Venetian artists (or what he believed to be such)."&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 204, 254 (quoted)&lt;/ref&gt;  His collection passed by descent to [[Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow]], who was made a Trustee of the National Gallery in 1897.  By 1914 Brownlow needed to raise some cash, and offered the gallery this painting for £5,000 and a portrait by [[Anthony van Dyck]] for £10,000, writing "I only ask from the Gallery what I consider to be a very low price because I am anxious to see them in the gallery".&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 255&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The van Dyck was bought but the Titian declined, because of the opposition of another trustee, [[Alfred de Rothschild]], who declared that the Titian "would not fetch £5 at [[Christie's]]".  Other trustees may have been in favour but the "difficult character" of Rothschild, who was hoped to be planning a bequest to the gallery, might have resigned if the purchase was made.  In 1919 the painting was bought via the dealers [[Colnaghi's]] for £60,000 by [[Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood]] (then Viscount Lascelles), giving "the measure of Rothschild's expertise and of Brownlow's generosity".&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 255&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1971, when the painting had already been on loan to the National Gallery for ten years, the trustees of the [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|7th Earl]] sold the painting at [[Christie's]] for £1,680,000.  It was bought by the dealer Julius Weitzner and swiftly resold to the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] for £1,763,000.  At this point an export licence was needed, and the [[Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art]] suspended granting one for one year to allow a British buyer to match this price.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 255&lt;/ref&gt;  The public campaign in 1971 to buy it for the United Kingdom was one of the great successes of [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]]'s directorship of the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], despite Davies's own lukewarm enthusiasm for the painting.  It was eventually purchased in 1972 (as catalogue number NG6420) with £1,000,000 from the gallery's funds and a special Treasury grant matching other donations pound for pound; these included £100,000 from the [[The Art Fund|Art Fund]] and £50,000 from the [[Pilgrim Trust]], the rest raised by a public appeal, then a great innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">The '''Trinity Session''' is a [[contemporary art]] production team directed by [[Stephen Hobbs]] and [[Marcus Neustetter]].

The Trinity Session is defined by exchanges with their home-city [[Johannesburg]] ([[South Africa]], in relation to Africa and similar developed / developing contexts. Key activities include temporary interventions and performances, in addition to producing and curating large scale public art programmes. Concerned with context specific technology applications and site-specific social practices, the artistic output of Hobbs/Neustetter, guided by issues of urban decay, xenophobia and public access, results in live actions and video documentation works.

Some of the most recent works of The Trinity Session include: ''Temporary But Permanent Projects'' a Survey exhibition at Museum of African Design, Johannesburg (2015) and ''at The Athenaeum'' in Port Elizabeth (South Africa, 2014); Renaming the City, commissioned artwork for the Ars
Electronica Festival in Linz (Austria, 2015); ''Exquisite Corpse'', a video performance presented at the Subtle Tech festival in Toronto (Canada, 2014);'' Platform 1'', a public intervention with the Swallows Foundation, GIFT Festival in Gateshead (United Kingdom, 2013); ''Bessengue B’etoukoa'' a public intervention in Douala commissioned for Across the board: ''Public Space/ Public Sphere'' curated by Elvira Dyangani Ose (Tate Modern, London), for the SUD – Salon Urbain de Douala 2013 (Cameroon); ''ATAYA'', a public performance France/South Africa Cultural Seasons in St Ouen and Paris (France, 2013); ''Fluid Stop'', a site-specific installation and public projection at Greenhouse, St Etienne (France).

'''''Urban Light''''' (2008) is a large-scale [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] [[sculpture]] by [[Chris Burden]] located at the Wilshire Boulevard entrance to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]. The 2008 installation consists of restored street lamps from the 1920s and 1930s. Most of them once lit the streets of Southern California.&lt;ref name=LATimesYourScene&gt;{{cite news|title=Your Scene: Chris Burden's 'Urban Light' sculpture at LACMA|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/25/entertainment/la-et-urban-light-as-icon-20110125|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow"&gt;{{cite news|last=Freudenheim|first=Susan|title=A glow in the dark: Chris Burden's collection of restored lamps will put LACMA in 'Urban Light.'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/30/entertainment/et-burden30|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Urban Light'' is composed of 202 street lamps arranged in a near grid. The lamps mostly came from the streets of Southern California, including Hollywood, Glendale, and Anaheim, with some from Portland, Oregon. There are 16 different streetlight models represented, many of which were commissioned for particular neighborhoods and streets.&lt;ref&gt;Mandelkern, India (February 20, 2018) [https://unframed.lacma.org/2018/02/20/great-streetlight-scavenger-hunt "The Great Streetlight Scavenger Hunt"] Unframed. Retrieved 5-24-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway Rose, the largest and most ornate of the models, is represented by six lamps. The style was found in [[downtown Los Angeles]]; a few can still be seen on Sixth Avenue between Olive and Flower Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mandelkern|first1=India|title=Urban Light: A Field Guide|date=February 9, 2018|publisher=LACMA|location=Los Angeles|pages=24|edition=1|url=https://www.thelacmastore.org/products/chris-burdens-urban-light-a-field-guide|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture's glass globes are of three general shapes: round, acorn, and cone. The 309 LED bulbs are solar powered and switch on from dusk until dawn, governed by an [[astronomical timer]].&lt;ref name="LACMA-CBurden"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.lacma.org/node/214966|title=LACMA collections: Chris Burden|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Los Angeles County Art Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-lacma-urban-light-20180214-htmlstory.html|title='Urban Light': Everything you didn't know about L.A.'s beloved landmark|last=Vankin|first=Deborah|date=February 14, 2018|website=latimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Susan Freudenheim described the restored lamps as displaying "elaborate floral and geometric patterns" at the base, with "fluted shafts and glass globes that cap them...meticulously cleaned, painted and refurbished to create an exuberant glow."&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Urban_Light_By_Day.jpg|thumb|left|left|''Urban Light'' by daylight as seen from Wilshire Blvd.]]
Burden viewed his sculpture as a formal entry way to the museum on [[Wilshire Boulevard]]: "I've been driving by these buildings for 40 years, and it's always bugged me how this institution turned its back on the city."&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

Burden first began collecting street lamps in December 2000 without a specific work in mind, and continued collecting them for the next seven years. He purchased his first two lamps at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] Flea Market at $800 each after they were pointed out by curator [[Paul Schimmel (curator)|Paul Schimmel]]'s son Max. The vendor, Jeff Levine, had been restoring the lamps by salvaging parts and later sold Burden more of his collection. Burden purchased others from contractor and collector Anna Justice, who was instrumental in the restoration of sandblasting, recasting missing parts, rewiring to code, and then painting a uniform grey. As Burden's collection grew, the ground around his [[Topanga Canyon]] studio became littered with parts, which the artist referred to as "lamp carcasses".&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LACMA-CBurden /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unframed.lacma.org/2018/02/06/story-urban-light|title=The Story of Urban Light (including a December 2008 conversation between Michael Govan and Chris Burden)|last=|first=|date=|website=unframed.lacma.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2003, Burden discussed installing a hundred of the lamps at the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in New York, but the gallery eventually balked at the cost. While he later sent 14 lamps to an exhibition in London, his goal was to keep as much of his then 150-piece collection together as possible. To that end, he invited visitors to view the street lamps outside his studio, where he had installed them in dense rows on two sides of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chris Burden: Extreme Measures|last=Philips|first=Lisa|last2=Johanna Burton|publisher=New Museum, New York and Skira Rizzoli Publications|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=208–209|quote=|display-authors=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prospective purchasers in mid-2006 was The [[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien|MAK Museum for Applied Art]] in Vienna and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, represented by its new director, [[Michael Govan]]. He visited the studio at twilight, and from the driveway, saw the lights lit and concluded that the installation would be a perfect fit. Govan was followed by Andrew M. Gordon, a [[Goldman Sachs]] executive who would later become chairman of the museum's board. Gordon approved the purchase through his family foundation for an undisclosed price.&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

''Urban Light'' was preceded by [[Sheila Klein]]'s ''[[Vermonica]]'' (1993)'','' which placed 25 Los Angeles street lamps in a parking lot at the corner of Vermont Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-haddad/meet-las-original-urban-l_b_7528372.html|title=Meet L.A.'s Original 'Urban Light'|date=June 8, 2015|publisher=The Huffington Post|issue=|agency=|ref=|last1=Haddad|first1=Paul|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The ''Urban Light'' installation took place amid changes to the LACMA campus, which included a new building, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, and two new open spaces. The sculpture dominates one of them, a [[forecourt]] located between Wilshire Boulevard and LACMA's entry pavilion.&lt;ref name="HawthorneReview" /&gt;

''Los Angeles Times'' critic Christopher Hawthorne gave the arrangement a mixed review, describing ''Urban Light'' as "a kind of pop temple, deftly straddling the lines between art and architecture and between seriousness and irony." "It's also a joy to walk through, but there's no getting around the fact that it turns what might have been an actual public square along Wilshire—a space defined from day to day by the people using it—into an outdoor room for one sizable and very insistent piece of art."&lt;ref name="HawthorneReview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawthorne|first=Christopher|title=ARCHITECTURE REVIEW; County museum's expansion reflects two clashing visions; The new building is Eli Broad's realm, while LACMA's director applies his influence elsewhere|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/07/entertainment/et-bcamarch7|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hawthorne also argued that ''Urban Light'' was the first of four large-scale installations at LACMA in which Michael Govan challenged and undermined "the polite axial symmetry of the master plan he inherited from" architect [[Renzo Piano]] and his patrons.  Those installations also include Tony Smith's black aluminum sculpture, called "Smoke", that fills the atrium of the Ahmanson Building, a palm garden by [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]] installed along the edge of the Resnick Pavilion, and, just north, [[Michael Heizer]]'s ''[[Levitated Mass]]''.&lt;ref name="LA Times Large scale art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawthorne|first=Christopher|title=Critic's Notebook: Art on an architectural scale at LACMA|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-rock-notebook-20120708,0,1083093.story|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although ''Urban Light'' fills what had been Renzo Piano's planned "public square" space, it nevertheless succeeded where the empty public space dismally failed.  K. M. Williamson, social ecologist and director of [[Public Art in Public Places]], saw ''Urban Light'' as not reducing the plaza space but instead fundamentally redefining it and enlivening it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apalosangeles.org/public-art-in-public-places-l-a-s-iconic-urban-light/|title=L.A.'s Iconic "Urban Light": August is Art Appreciation Month - What if it was also Public Space Planning Appreciation Month?"|last=Williamson|first=K. M.|date=August 15, 2014|website=American Planning Association {{!}} Los Angeles|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Govan believed that ''Urban Light'' imparted a "feeling of walking through an ancient temple", one that echos the Greco-Roman temple facades of many East Coast museums. Those facades "are really faux; they’re neoclassical,...and here [Burden has] assembled an honest-to-goodness Los Angeles temple made of local materials, in our time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  ,

==Cultural status==
Since its 2008 installation, ''Urban Light'' has become an extremely popular attraction.  According to Public Art in Public Places, ''Urban Light'' has become the most visited, photographed and well-known public artwork in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/urban-light/vgGacTHf37eEwQ|title=Urban Light - Chris Burden 2008|last=Public Art in Public Places|first=|date=2016|website=Google Arts &amp; Culture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Director [[Ivan Reitman]] was one of the first filmmakers to incorporate the public artwork in a motion picture, using the location for a scene in his film ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]''. Echoing Burden's own view,&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt; he called the artwork "an extraordinary beacon" that "lights up a desperate part of Wilshire that felt almost abandoned at night." ''Urban Light'' was featured in the [[Tori Amos]] video ''Maybe California'' and the film ''[[Valentine's Day (2010 film)|Valentine's Day]]''. The work appeared in a [[Guinness]] commercial and in a ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article featuring cast members of the television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', as well as in numerous amateur photos posted online. LACMA itself has featured the work as part of its own promotional efforts, including a 3D public service announcement preceding the film ''[[Megamind]]''.&lt;ref name=LATimes-sceens&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Jori|title='Urban Light' lights up the screen|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/25/entertainment/la-et-urban-light-as-icon-20110125|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the sculpture was used in a dance scene in VH1's [[Hit the Floor (TV series)|''Hit the Floor'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Dance9Tiffany/status/473676624366665728|title = Tiffany Maher feed: 'A night I will never forget ~ @hitthefloor #devilgirls @LACMA @VH1'|date = June 2, 2014|website = Twitter|publisher = |last = Maher|first = Tiffany}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first known selfie taken at the sculpture was shot four days after the work opened and was posted to [[Flickr]]. The sculpture has its own hashtag: #urbanlight. While not rented out as a wedding site, ''Urban Light'' has been the setting for many vows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Vollard Suite.2869.jpg|thumb|Prints from the ''Vollard Suite'']]

The '''''Vollard Suite''''' is a set of 100 [[etching]]s in the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical style]] by the Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]], produced from 1930-37. Named for the art dealer who commissioned them, [[Ambroise Vollard]] (1866-1939), the suite is in a number of museums, and individual etchings from the suite are collectible. More than 300 sets were created, but many were broken up and the prints sold separately.&lt;ref name="TelegNov11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8923722/City-fund-manager-in-1m-Picasso-giveaway.html|title=City fund manager in £1m Picasso giveaway|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|author=Anita Singh|accessdate=2012-05-19|date=2011-11-29|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1930 Picasso was commissioned to produce the etchings by the art dealer and publisher Ambroise Vollard in exchange for paintings by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-reviews/9251599/Picasso-The-Vollard-Suite-British-Museum-review.html|title=Picasso, The Vollard Suite, British Museum, review|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|author=Richard Dormant|accessdate=2012-05-19|date=2012-05-08|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Picasso worked extensively on the set in the spring of 1933, and completed the suite in 1937.&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-reviews/9251599/Picasso-The-Vollard-Suite-British-Museum-review.html|title=Picasso, The Vollard Suite, British Museum, review|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|author=Richard Dormant|accessdate=2012-05-19|date=2012-05-08|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took a further two years for the printmaker Roger Lacourière to finish printing the 230 full sets, but the death of Vollard in 1939 and the Second World War meant that the sets only started coming onto the art market in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"/&gt;

A 1971 exhibition of the suite in Madrid was attacked by a [[paramilitary]] group, the Guerrilleros del Christo Rey ([[Warriors of Christ the King]]) who tore the pictures and poured acid over the prints. The group attacked things associated with Spanish exiles like Picasso who aligned themselves with the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican cause]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]&lt;ref name="Hensbergen2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gijs Van Hensbergen|title=Guernica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TO5wF6wUfoC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=19 May 2012|date=1 October 2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-7475-6873-5|pages=268–}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A [[moving skyscraper|spinning residential building]] in Brazil was named [[Suite Vollard]] after the suite.&lt;ref name="EconMar09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13174449|title=Monitor:Revolutionary Buildings|publisher=''[[The Economist]]''|author=Jane Kinsman|accessdate=2012-05-19|date=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete set is owned by the [[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;ref name="NatGalAus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/exhibitions/picasso/index.html|title=Vollard Suite|publisher=[[National Gallery of Australia]]|author=Jane Kinsman|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a complete set was acquired by the [[British Museum]] in 2011 after a donation of £1 million from financier Hamish Parker, a director of Mondrian Investment Partners. The donation was in memory of Parker's father, Major Horace Parker&lt;ref name="TelegNov11"/&gt;. It had been the British Museum's ambition to own the set and the acquisition was described by the museum's director, [[Neil MacGregor]], as "one of the institution's most important acquisitions of the past 50 years"&lt;ref name="TelegNov11"/&gt;.

==The series==
The works are not based on a literary source, and are not titled, although according to the [[Fundación Juan March]], "Some of the themes have a remote origin in [[Honoré de Balzac]]’s short story ''Le Chef-d’oeuvre inconnu'' (The Unknown Masterpiece, 1831), which greatly impressed Picasso. It tells the story of a painter’s efforts to capture life itself on canvas through the means of feminine beauty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.march.es/arte/ingles/cuenca/exposiciones/picasso/picasso.asp Vollard Suite], Museo de Arte Abstracto Español (Fundación Juan March)&lt;/ref&gt; The works are inscribed by Picasso with the year month and day that he drew the image.&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"/&gt; Writing in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' Richard Dorment claims that as Picasso took such a long time to create the suite, "the imagery and the emotional register of the prints constantly shifts to reflect Picasso's erotic and artistic obsessions, marital vicissitudes, and the darkening political situation in Europe...In the years Picasso worked on the series, fascism spread through Europe, and civil war erupted in Spain. These anxieties also found their way into the Vollard Suite, so that by the time you reach the end of the show and the last images of the blind minotaur, you feel that you are in a different emotional universe from the sunlit [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadia]] you encountered at the show’s beginning".&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"/&gt;

The suite begins with prints exploring the theme of the sculptor's studio, Picasso's mistress, [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]], is portrayed as a model lying in the arms of a bearded sculptor. Picasso had recently been inspired by Marie-Thérèse to create a series of monumental bronze heads in the neoclassical style.&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"/&gt; Picasso had also recently been commissioned by the publisher [[Albert Skira]] in 1928 to create original [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] prints for his translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', which appeared in 1931.&lt;ref name="NatGalAus"/&gt;

Dorment comments that a [[minotaur]] appears, joining in scenes of bacchic excess, but the minotaur is transformed from a gentle lover and bon vivant into a rapist and devourer of women, reflecting Picasso's turbulent relationships with Marie-Thérèse and his wife Olga.&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"/&gt; In a third transformation, the minotaur becomes pathetic, blind and impotent, he wanders by night, led by a little girl with the features of Marie-Thérèse.&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"/&gt; The final three prints from the suite are portraits of Vollard.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/picasso-faun-revealing-a-sleeping-woman-jupiter-and-antiope-after-rembrandt-p11360|title=Vollard Suite|publisher=[[Tate]]|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso learned new techniques of etching during the suite, from relatively simple line etchings, through [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], [[dry point]], [[aquatinting]] and sugar aquatinting learnt through {{ill|Roger Lacourière|fr}} in his workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.mchampetier.com/sitephp/phpfr/det_cimaise.php?page_numero=3&amp;nom_cim=Atelier%20Lacouri%E8re%20&amp;%20Fr%E9laut|title=Atelier Lacourière &amp; Frélaut|website=mchampetier.com|year=2014|access-date=2014-06-08|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140608111033/http://www.mchampetier.com/sitephp/phpfr/det_cimaise.php?page_numero=3&amp;nom_cim=Atelier%20Lacouri%E8re%20&amp;%20Fr%E9laut|archive-date=2014-06-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, this enabled him to achieve more painterly effects.&lt;ref name="TelegMay12"/&gt;  Most of the prints were completed to Picasso's satisfaction in a single [[state (printmaking)|state]], but others, especially the erotic compositions, exist in several states, fourteen in one case.

'''War Memorial Cross, Beeston''' is a [[Grade II listed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|429361|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; structure in [[Beeston, Nottinghamshire]].

[[File:Yellow Arrow sticker in New York City.jpg|thumb|A Yellow Arrow sticker in New York CIty]]
'''''Yellow Arrow''''' was a public art project created by Christopher Allen, [[Brian House]], and [[Jesse Shapins]] that was active from 2004-2006. The project is an important example of [[locative media]] and mobile phone art and draws concepts from [[psychogeography]].

''Yellow Arrow'' stickers were obtained from the project website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/01/AR2005070102280.html |title=Targeting the 'Art' Around Every Corner |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2005-07-02|accessdate=2011-04-10 |first=Tommy |last=Nguyen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed anywhere in the public realm.  When encountering a sticker on the street, one could send the unique code printed on it as a [[short message service|text message]] to the project phone number.  Moments later a message would be received that was left by the person who placed the sticker.

The ''Yellow Arrow'' symbol means "there’s more here: a hidden detail, a funny story, a memory, and a crazy experience." Each arrow linked digital content to a specific location using the mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/technology/techspecial2/25geo.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22yellow%20arrow%22&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Ethan | last=Todras-Whitehill | title=Making Connections, Here and Now | date=2006-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an underground phenomenon, the project developed an international community, and 7535 ''Yellow Arrow'' stickers were placed in 467 cities and 35 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=House|first=Brian|title=Yellow Arrow|url=http://brianhouse.net/works/yellow_arrow/|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since first appearing at the [[Psy-Geo-Conflux]] in New York in May 2004, ''Yellow Arrow'' has been featured in The New York Times, Wired,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=Text in the City|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/play.html?pg=3|accessdate=14 September 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsweek, The Washington Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nguyen|first=Tommy|title=Targeting the 'Art' Around Every Corner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/01/AR2005070102280.html|accessdate=14 September 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2005-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Globe, CNN and NBC, the London Times, Politiken,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/fakta_kultur/ECE115054/yellow-arrow---et-globalt-kunstprojekt/|title=Yellow Arrow - et globalt kunstprojekt
|trans-title=Yellow Arrow - a global art project|accessdate=14 September 2012|newspaper=Politiken|date=2005-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberation, [[Diari de Barcelona]], and de Volkskrant. ''Yellow Arrow'' was also featured in Lonely Planet's Guide to Experimental Travel.

In ''Toward the Sentient City'', Mark Shepard writes, "In place of the ubiquitous bronze plaque providing "official narratives" affixed to the side of "significant" urban structures or spaces, ''Yellow Arrow'' provides for the unofficial annotation of everyday urban places by ordinary citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepard|first=Mark|title=Sentient City|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-51586-3|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yellow Arrow'' was included in the exhibition ''Design and the Elastic Mind'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA.org {{!}} Design and The Elastic Mind|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the project was discontinued and its content was archived on [[Flickr]].
