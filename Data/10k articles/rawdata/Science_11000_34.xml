'''Agnes Meyer Driscoll''' (July 24, 1889 – September 16, 1971), known as ''Miss Aggie'' or ''Madame X'', was an [[United States|American]]
[[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. [[Edwin T. Layton]] described her as "without peer as a cryptanalyst".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll |url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/driscoll.htm |website=Agnes Meyer Driscoll |accessdate=14 June 2014 |location=Website cites the book "And I Was There" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726113217/http://www.nsa.gov/women/women00021.cfm |archivedate=26 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Born in Illinois in 1889, Agnes May Meyer moved with her family to [[Westerville, Ohio]] in 1895 where her father, Gustav Meyer, had taken a job teaching music at [[Otterbein College]]. In 1909 he donated the family home to the [[Anti-Saloon League]], which had recently moved its headquarters to Westerville.

==Education==
Meyer attended [[Otterbein College]] from 1907 to 1909. In 1911, she received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[Ohio State University]], having majored in mathematics and physics&lt;ref name=nsaBrief&gt;{{cite web|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/women/honorees/driscoll.shtml|website=Women in american Cryptology|publisher=NSA|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied foreign languages, statistics, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll |url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/driscoll.htm |website=Biographies of Women Mathematicians |accessdate=14 June 2014 |location=Website cites the book "The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726113217/http://www.nsa.gov/women/women00021.cfm |archivedate=26 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was fluent in English, French, German, Latin, and Japanese.&lt;ref name=nsaBrief /&gt; From her earliest days as a college student, she pursued technical and scientific studies. After graduation, she moved to [[Amarillo, Texas]], where she lived from 1911 to 1918&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Agnes-Meyer-Driscoll|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll|last=Hanyok|first=Robert|date=|website=|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as director of music at a military academy, and, later, chair of the mathematics department at the local high school.

==World War I and after==
On June 22, 1918, about one year after America entered [[World War I]], Agnes Meyer enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] – America had just started allowing women to enlist.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanac&gt;{{cite web|title=Cryptologic Almanac 50th Anniversary Series |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_Meyer_Driscoll.pdf |publisher=NSA? |accessdate=14 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015635/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_Meyer_Driscoll.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was recruited at the highest possible rank of chief [[yeomanettes|yeoman]] and after a stint in the Postal Cable and Censorship Office she was assigned to the Code and Signal section of the Director of Naval Communications.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanac /&gt; After the war ended she made use of an option to continue working at her post as a civilian.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanac /&gt; Except for a two-year hiatus, when she worked for a private firm, she would remain a leading [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] for the U.S. Navy until 1949.

Her efforts were not limited to manual systems; she was involved also in the emerging machine technology of the time, which was being applied both to making and breaking ciphers. In her first days in the Code and Signal section, she co-developed one of the U.S. Navy's cipher machines, the "[[Communications Machine|CM]]." This cipher machine would become a standard enciphering device for the Navy in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanac /&gt; In 1923, she solved a puzzle published in a magazine that was advertised as impossible. The creator, [[Edward Hebern]] of the fledgling Hebern Electric Code Company, was attempting to create a cipher machine; he offered Agnes a job as technical advisor which she left the Navy to accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Code Breakers|last=Kahn|first=David|publisher=Scribner|year=1996|isbn=978-0-684-83130-5|location=New York|pages=415, 417}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked on developing an early cipher machine.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanac /&gt; Although Hebern's company ultimately failed, its work in rotor technology would affect machine cryptography for years to come. Agnes returned to the navy in the spring of 1924. In August 1924 she married Michael Driscoll, a [[Washington, D.C.]] lawyer.

In early 1935, Agnes Driscoll led the attack on the Japanese M-1 cipher machine (also known to the U.S. as the ORANGE machine), used to encrypt the messages of Japanese naval attaches around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the same time she sponsored the introduction of early machine support for cryptanalysis against Japanese naval code systems.

In her thirty-year career, Agnes Driscoll and Lieutenant Joseph Rochefort broke [[Japanese naval codes|Japanese Navy manual codes]]—the Red Book Code in 1926 after three years of work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monday 201 File: Agnes Meyer Driscoll|url=http://bletchleyparkreview.blogspot.com/2012/07/monday-201-file-agnes-meyer-driscoll.html|website=The Bletchley Park Review (blog)|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Blue Book Code in 1930, and in 1940 she made critical inroads into [[JN-25]], the Japanese fleet's operational code, which the U.S. Navy exploited after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] for the rest of the [[Pacific War]]. She would be unable to finish this work, however, because she was transferred to a team working to break the German naval Enigma cipher.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanac /&gt;

==World War II and after==
After getting the work against JN-25 started, Driscoll headed up a new group to attack the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] ciphers using a catalog approach. Unfortunately the U.S. and U.K. did not communicate effectively and her approach both was fruitless and had been tried by the British, who determined that it was unlikely to work.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanacTwilight&gt;{{cite web|title=Madame X: Agnes in Twilight,The Last Years of the Career of Agnes Driscoll, 1941–1957. |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_in_Twilight.pdf |publisher=NSA |accessdate=14 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015634/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Madame_X_Agnes_in_Twilight.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately this work was superseded by the US-UK cryptologic exchanges of 1942–43. She worked under [[Laurance Safford]] and [[Joseph Rochefort]].

In 1943 she worked with a team to break the Japanese cipher Coral. It was broken two months later, although Driscoll is said to have had little influence on the project.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanacTwilight /&gt;

In 1945 she appears to have worked on attacking Russian ciphers.&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanacTwilight /&gt;

Driscoll was part of the navy contingent that joined the new national cryptologic agencies, firstly the [[Armed Forces Security Agency]] in 1949 and then the [[National Security Agency]] in 1952. While with the Armed Forces Security Agency she may have contributed to attacking a cipher called [[Venona project|Venona]].&lt;ref name=nsaAlmanacTwilight /&gt;

She retired from [[Armed Forces Security Agency]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=agnesscott&gt;{{cite web|title=Agnes Meyer Driscoll |url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/driscoll.htm |website=Biographies of Women Mathematicians |accessdate=14 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726113217/http://www.nsa.gov/women/women00021.cfm |archivedate=26 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
She died in 1971 and is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=agnesscott /&gt;

==Honors==
In 2000 she was inducted into the [[National Security Agency]]'s Hall of Honor.

'''Andrew Fraknoi''' (born 1948) is a retired professor of astronomy recognized for his lifetime of work using everyday language to make astronomy more accessible and popular for both students and the general public. In 2017 Fraknoi retired from his position as Chair of the Department of Astronomy at [[Foothill College]]. In retirement he continues to teach through the [[Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning]] and the [[Osher Lifelong Learning Institute]] at [[San Francisco State University]], to give public lectures, and to continue to add to his body of written work. He is the recipient of numerous awards and honors in his field.&lt;ref name="Los Altos Town Crier" /&gt;

Fraknoi continues to serve on the Board of Trustees of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ([[SETI]]) Institute, a scientific and educational organization. He is also an elected [[fellow]] of the [[California Academy of Sciences]], vice chair of the [[Lick Observatory]] Council, University of California's astronomical observatory, and a fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]. He has a special interest in debunking astrology and other pseudosciences connected to astronomy.&lt;ref name="CSI Fellow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Fraknoi|url=https://www.csicop.org/author/andrewfraknoi|website=CSI|publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Early life and education==

Andrew Fraknoi was born in [[Hungary]] in 1948. Eight years later, following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], he and his family fled their home in [[Budapest]]. They spent almost a year in an [[Austria|Austrian]] refugee camp and finally resettled in [[New York City]]. He entered his first American school at age 11, unable to speak English. Comic books, with their pictures and simple language, became his preferred entry point to learning. His initial interest was [[super hero]] [[comic books]], and then comics with [[outer space]] themes. “This isn’t just comic books – this is real," he recalls thinking about space.&lt;ref name="Los Altos Town Crier"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Jane|title=Astro superstar explores strange new worlds: Local prof voyages to realm of science fiction|url=https://www.losaltosonline.com/news/sections/schools/210-school-features/55697-astro-superstar-explores-strange-new-worlds-local-prof-voyages-to-realm-of-science-fiction|website=The Los Altos Town Crier|publisher=The Los Altos Town Crier|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercury"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sevrens Lyons|first1=Julie|title=Foothill College professor’s rising star|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/11/14/foothill-college-professors-rising-star/|website=The Mercury News|publisher=Bay Area News Group|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraknoi graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1966. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in Astronomy (with a minor in Physics) from [[Harvard University]] in 1970, and his [[Master of Arts|M.A]]. in Astronomy from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="Foothill About Andrew Fraknoi" /&gt;

==Professional career== 

Fraknoi held the position of Chair of the Department of Astronomy at Foothill College from 1992-2017. He also taught astronomy and physics at other institutions including San Francisco State University, [[City College of San Francisco]], [[Cañada College]], and several campuses of the University of California Extension Division. Fraknoi served as the Executive Director of the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] from 1978 to 1992&lt;ref name="Past Executive Director ASP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Past ASP Board Presidents and Executive Directors|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/past-asp-board-presidents-and-executive-directors/|website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, edited its popular magazine "Mercury", both expanding circulation and reaching out to lay people as well as teachers. In this role he also established the newsletter "The Universe in the Classroom" specifically for teachers.&lt;ref name="Universe in the classroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe in the Classroom|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/publication/universe-in-the-classroom/|website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercury Magazine 1989 pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury Magazine and the Challenges of Growth|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/about/history/ch15.pdf|website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder and was director of "Project ASTRO", which sets up partnerships between volunteer astronomers and 4th-9th grade teachers; each astronomer "adopts" one classroom for a year, visits at least four times, and works with the teacher to do hands-on activities in astronomy. The program is still operating in sites around the country.&lt;ref name="Project ASTRO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Project ASTRO|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/education/k12-educators/project-astro/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foothill College About Andrew Fraknoi" /&gt; Later he founded and directed "Family ASTRO", a project to design activities, kits and games to help families share the excitement of astronomical discovery.&lt;ref name="Family Astro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Astro|url=https://astrosociety.org/edu/family/about/history.html|website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fraknoi is recognized for both his multi-dimensional approach, and his innovation, in making astronomy more accessible to all. His popular interdisciplinary course on [[Albert Einstein]]'s life and work, ''Physics for Poets'' (nick-named "Einstein Without Tears"), won the 2005 “Innovation of the Year” award from the League for Innovation. In this course students learn about areas of modern physics that Einstein had a role in creating or changing, and then read novels, stories, and poems, and hear music influenced by Einstein's work and ideas. According to Thuy Thi Nguyen, president of Foothill College at the time of Fraknoi's retirement, the college sent a memo to the student body to warn them that spring semester 2017 would be their last chance to attend this very popular course. &lt;ref name="Los Altos Town Crier" /&gt; Fraknoi also created and offered various other courses for non-science majors. 

In 2007 Fraknoi was the narrator for [[Gustav Holst]]'s “[[The Planets]]” for the California Symphony Orchestra,&lt;ref name="Mercury" /&gt; a role he repeated with the Peninsula Symphony in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Planets|url=https://peninsulasymphony.org/2017may/|website=Peninsula Symphony|publisher=Peninsula Symphony|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a long-time interest in astronomically correct science fiction, which he also uses in his teaching and writing. He has compiled an extensive resource with examples of scientifically accurate science fiction. He also is a science fiction author in his own right with published stories in 2 science fiction anthologies.&lt;ref name="SciFiRef"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fraknoi|first1=Andrew|title=Science Fiction Stories with Good Astronomy &amp; Physics: A Topical Index|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/education/astronomy-resource-guides/science-fiction-stories-with-good-astronomy-physics-a-topical-index/|website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1999, Fraknoi has organized and moderated the Silicon Valley Astronomy Lecture Series where noted [[Image:Andrew Fraknoi.jpg|right|thumb|Fraknoi hosting Silicon Valley Lecture Series 2017]] astronomers from around California and the nation give nontechnical public talks on new developments in our exploration of the universe in the large Smithwick Theater at Foothill College. Cosponsored by [[NASA]]'s [[Ames Research Center]], the SETI Institute, and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, the talks, attended by 400 to 900+ people each time, have featured Nobel laureates, members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and many other distinguished scientists.&lt;ref name="ASP Silicon Valley Lecture Series"&gt;{{cite web|title=Silicon Valley Astronomy Lectures|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/education/silicon-valley-astronomy-lectures/|website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lectures have been taped and are available on [[YouTube]]. &lt;ref name="YouTube Lecture Series"&gt;{{cite web|title=SVAstronomyLectures|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SVAstronomyLectures/|website=youtube.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraknoi has served on the Board of Trustees of the [[SETI Institute]], a scientific and educational organization devoted to the search for life in the universe, since its inception in 1985. From 2010 to 2012, he was vice-chair of the Board and served on the program committee planning the first and second [[SETIcon]], a national weekend public conferences devoted to the scientific quest for our counterparts among the stars. In 2013, he was elected to the Board of Trustees of the Friends of the [[Lick Observatory]], now called the Lick Observatory Council.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In his retirement Fraknoi continues to teach classes at both the Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning through University of San Francisco, and the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at San Francisco State University.

==Written Works== 

Fraknoi is the author or co-author of 14 books in the field of astronomy. He was the lead author of ''Voyages through the Universe'', an introductory college astronomy textbook published by Brooks-Cole, which went through three editions.&lt;ref name="wonderfest andy fraknoi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonderfest.org/andy-fraknoi/|title=Andy Fraknoi|last=Yao|first1=Eric|date=|website=wonderfest.org|publisher=wonderfest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, he co-edited with [[Byron Preiss]] two collections of science articles and science fiction stories, "The Universe" and "The Planets." With [[Sidney Wolff]], Fraknoi founded and was co-editor of the first on-line journal devoted to astronomy education, "Astronomy Education Review".&lt;ref name="AAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Subject Index to Papers in Astronomy Education Review (2001-2013)|url=https://aas.org/teach/subject-index-papers-astronomy-education-review-2001-2013|website=American Astronomical Society|publisher=American Astronomical Society|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited two collections of resources for K-12 teachers, ''The Universe at Your Fingertips'' and ''More Universe at Your Fingertips'' published through the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.&lt;ref name="wonderfest andy fraknoi" /&gt; Additionally, he is the lead author of the 2016 college textbook "Astronomy", published by [[OpenStax]] as a free book for college students around the world, part of a project at [[Rice University]] (supported by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]]) to make college more affordable.&lt;ref name="Open Stax"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=https://openstax.org/about|website=OpenStax.org|publisher=Open Stax|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also authored multiple resources for young people. He is the co-author of the richly illustrated 2017 children’s book about eclipses "When the Sun Goes Dark", that came out just ahead of the North American solar eclipse in August 2017.&lt;ref name="when the sun goes dark"&gt;{{cite web|title=When the Sun Goes Dark|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315643176_When_the_Sun_Goes_Dark|website=ResearchGate.net|publisher=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, his first children's book "Wonderful World of Space" was published by Disney. When asked about the book in a 2008 podcast interview, Fraknoi explained, "This has been a fun project. My son, who was 13 at the time, and I got a chance to write a picture book on astronomy for Disney and the challenge was how can we convey some of these modern ideas, including the Big Bang, to kids who are in 4th or 5th grade."&lt;ref name="POI podcast 2008"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/andrew_fraknoi_the_cosmic_history_of_your_body/|title= Andrew Fraknoi - Your Body’s Cosmic History|website=Point of Inquiry |publisher= |host= Douglas James D.J. Grothe|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2015 book, "Solar Science", published by the National Science Teachers Association, is full of 45 hands-on activities about the Sun, the seasons, the Moon, eclipses, and more.&lt;ref name="Solar Science"&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Science: Exploring Sunspots, Seasons, Elipses, and More|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291337415_Solar_Science_Exploring_Sunspots_Seasons_Eclipses_and_More|website=ResearchGate.net|publisher=ResearchGate.net|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraknoi frequently writes articles on interdisciplinary topics, such as using music, poetry, or science fiction to teach science. He has published a list of [[science fiction]] stories using good astronomy, as well as a resource guide to music inspired by astronomy.&lt;ref name="SciFiRef" /&gt; Fraknoi himself has had two stories published in science fiction anthologies.&lt;ref name="Los Altos Town Crier" /&gt; The story "Cave in Arsia Mons" is published in the book "Building Red: Mission Mars," edited by Janet Cannon, and the story "Supernova Rhythm" is published in the book "Science Fiction by Scientists," edited by Mike Brotherton and published by Springer.&lt;ref name="Foothill College About Andrew Fraknoi" /&gt;

==Media appearances==

Fraknoi has been a frequent radio, television and podcast guest explaining astronomical developments in everyday language. According to his published biography at [[Wonderfest]], the science education organization that awarded him their 2002 Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization, Fraknoi "appeared for over 20 years on the Jim Eason Show on KGO or KSFO radio and [as] a regular guest on both the ''Pete Wilson Show'' (later the "Gil Gross Show") on KGO and Michael Krasny’s ''Forum'' program on [[KQED]]. Nationally, he has been heard regularly on [[Science Friday]] and ''Weekend [[All Things Considered]]'' on [[National Public Radio]]. He has given over 400 public lectures on topics ranging from the death of stars to the origin of the universe."&lt;ref name="BayAreaWonderfest-2002 carl sagan prize"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eric|title=Andy Fraknoi|url=http://wonderfest.org/andy-fraknoi/|website=Wonderfest, the Bay Area Beacon of Science|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His television appearances include ''[[The Today Show]]'', ''[[CBS Morning News]]'', and ''[[Larry King Live]]''.&lt;ref name="xanthus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Fraknoi Expert in Astronomy|url=http://www.xanthuscom.com/fraknoi.html|website=xanthuscom|publisher=Xanthus Communications|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also posts frequently on his own blog ''Exploring the Universe'' http://fraknoi.blogspot.com/.

==Awards and recognition==

Fraknoi has been the recipient of many notable awards throughout his career. In 1994 he was awarded the American Astronomical Society's Annenberg Foundation Award -- then the highest honor in the field of astronomy education, as well as the [[Klumpke-Roberts Award]] of The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (given for a lifetime of contributions to popularizing astronomy). In 2002 he received the [[Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization]]. In 2007 he was named California Professor of the Year by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] and the [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education]]. Additionally he was conferred the Astronomical Society of the Pacific's 2007 [[Richard H. Emmons]] award&lt;ref name="2007 ASP award"&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 ASP Annual Award Recipients|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/membership/awards/bios/fraknoi.html|website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=6 February 2018|ref=Astronomical Society of the Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Institute of Physics]]' 2007 [[Andrew Gemant Award]] (given for a lifetime of contributions to the intersection of physics and culture).&lt;ref name="Faraday Award" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foothill About Andrew Fraknoi"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Andrew Fraknoi|url=https://foothill.edu/astronomy/fraknoi.html|website=Astronomy|publisher=Foothill College|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he was elected an Honorary Member by the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]]&lt;ref name="Royal Astronomical Society of Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Andrew Fraknoi (USA)|url=https://www.rasc.ca/honorary-members|website=Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|publisher=Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 was conferred the Faraday Science Communicator Award.&lt;ref name="Faraday Award"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Fraknoi Wins 2013 Faraday Science Communicator Award|url=https://aas.org/posts/news/2013/04/andrew-fraknoi-wins-2013-faraday-science-communicator-award|website=AAS.org|publisher=American Astronomical Society|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asteroid 4859 was named Asteroid Fraknoi by the [[International Astronomical Union]] "to honor his work in sharing the excitement of modern astronomy with students, teachers and the public".&lt;ref name="Foothill College About Andrew Fraknoi"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Andrew Fraknoi|url=https://foothill.edu/astronomy/fraknoi.html|website=Foothill College|publisher=Foothill College|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal Philosophy==

Fraknoi has demonstrated, through a lifetime of work, his commitment to advancing public understanding of astronomy and science using everyday language.&lt;ref name="xanthus" /&gt; He said in an interview after being named 2007 California Professor of the Year: "I believe that an understanding of our place in the wider universe and the methods of science are part of the birthright of everyone living on our planet... Yet, the way science is taught in this country can often discourage non-science majors from taking a life-long interest, or even a course-long interest, in science. My philosophy is to show students that science is engaging, human, and part of our cultural heritage."&lt;ref name="ASP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Former ASP Executive Director Andrew Fraknoi Named 2007 California Professor of the Year|url=https://www.astrosociety.org/news/fraknoi.html|website=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Fraknoi received the Faraday Science Communicator Award. [[Michael Faraday]], for whom the award was named, was an influential 19th century scientist and a great advocate for rigorous, skeptical thinking and recognizing how easy it is for the mind to deceive itself. Fraknoi was quoted on receipt of the award, "I too try to encourage students and the public to examine claims at the fringes of science with skepticism and fact-based thinking".&lt;ref name="Faraday award-skeptic quote"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Fraknoi Wins 2013 Faraday Science Communicator Award|url=https://aas.org/posts/news/2013/04/andrew-fraknoi-wins-2013-faraday-science-communicator-award|publisher=American Astronomical Society|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Fraknoi and his wife live in San Francisco. They have one son.&lt;ref name="Mercury" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2172">A '''causal patch''' is a region of spacetime connected within the relativistic framework of causality (causal light cones).

==Background==

After [[Leonard Susskind]] proposed the [[black hole complementarity]] conjecture for [[black hole]]s in [[quantum gravity]], he realized it would also apply to a [[de Sitter universe]] with a positive [[cosmological constant]] with the [[cosmological horizon]] in place of the [[event horizon]]. The region within the horizon is the '''causal patch''',&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and it is self-contained. This means we may neglect what happens beyond the cosmological horizon. A consequence of this radical conjecture is that the total number of states of the universe is finite.

The '''classical-map hypernetted-chain method''' ('''CHNC method''') is a method used in [[many-body problem|many-body]] [[theoretical physics]] for interacting uniform electron liquids in two and three dimensions, and for interacting [[hydrogen plasma]]s. The method extends the famous [[Hypernetted-chain equation|hypernetted-chain method]] (HNC) introduced by [[J. M. J van Leeuwen]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;

The classical HNC, together with the [[Percus–Yevick approximation]], are the two pillars which bear the brunt of most calculations in the theory of interacting [[classical fluid]]s. Also, HNC and PY have become important in providing basic reference schemes in the theory of fluids,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence they are of great importance to the physics of many-particle systems.

The HNC and PY integral equations provide the [[pair distribution function]]s of the particles in a classical fluid, even for very high coupling strengths. The coupling strength is measured by the ratio of the potential energy to the kinetic energy. In a classical fluid, the kinetic energy is proportional to the temperature. In a quantum fluid, the situation is very complicated as one needs to deal with quantum operators, and matrix elements of such operators, which appear in various perturbation methods based on [[Feynman diagram]]s. The CHNC method provides an approximate "escape" from these difficulties, and applies to regimes beyond perturbation theory. In [[Robert B. Laughlin]]'s famous Nobel Laureate work on the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]], an HNC equation was used  within a classical plasma analogy.
 
In the CHNC method, the pair-distributions of the interacting particles are calculated using a mapping which ensures that the quantum mechanically correct non-interacting pair distribution function is recovered when the Coulomb interactions are switched off.&lt;ref&gt;

Comparison of the calculated ''g''(''r'') with results from Quantum Monte Carlo show remarkable agreement, even for very strongly correlated systems.

The interacting pair-distribution functions obtained from CHNC have been used to calculate the exchange-correlation energies, [[Landau parameter]]s of [[Fermi liquid]]s and other quantities of interest in many-body physics and [[density functional theory]], as well as in the theory of hot plasmas.

'''''Clavaviridae''''' is a family of double-stranded viruses that infect archaea. This family was first described by the team led by D. [[David Prangishvili|Prangishvili]] in 2010. There is one genus in this family (''Clavavirus''). Within this genus, only a single species has been described to date: ''[[Aeropyrum pernix bacilliform virus 1]]''.

The name is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''clava'' meaning stick.

'''Deep-sea fish''' are [[fish]] that live in the darkness below the sunlit surface waters, that is below the [[epipelagic]] or [[photic zone]] of the [[sea]]. The [[lanternfish]] is, by far, the most common deep-sea fish. Other [[deep sea]] fishes include the [[Anomalopidae|flashlight fish]], [[cookiecutter shark]], [[Gonostomatidae|bristlemouth]]s, [[anglerfish]], [[viperfish]], and some species of [[eelpout]].

Only about 2% of known marine species inhabit the [[pelagic]] environment. This means that they live in the [[water column]] as opposed to the [[benthic]] organisms that live in or on the sea floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trujillo, Alan P. |author2=Harold V. Thurman |year=2011|title=Essentials of Oceanography 10th ed |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Boston |pages=354|isbn=978-0321668127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep-sea organisms generally inhabit [[bathypelagic]] (1000–4000m deep) and [[abyssopelagic]] (4000–6000m deep) zones. However, characteristics of deep-sea organisms, such as [[bioluminescence]] can be seen in the [[mesopelagic]] (200–1000m deep) zone as well. The mesopelagic zone is the disphotic zone, meaning light there is minimal but still measurable. The oxygen minimum layer exists somewhere between a depth of 700m and 1000m deep depending on the place in the ocean. This area is also where nutrients are most abundant. The [[bathypelagic]] and [[abyssopelagic]] zones are [[aphotic]], meaning that no light penetrates this area of the ocean. These zones make up about 75% of the inhabitable ocean space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trujillo, Alan P. |author2=Harold V. Thurman |year=2011|title=Essentials of Oceanography 10th ed |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Boston |pages=365|isbn=978-0321668127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The epipelagic zone (0–200m) is the area where light penetrates the water and photosynthesis occurs. This is also known as the photic zone. Because this typically extends only a few hundred meters below the water, the deep sea, about 90% of the ocean volume, is in darkness.  The deep sea is also an extremely hostile environment, with temperatures that rarely exceed 3&amp;nbsp;°C (37.4&amp;nbsp;°F) and fall as low as −1.8&amp;nbsp;°C (28.76&amp;nbsp;°F) (with the exception of hydrothermal vent ecosystems that can exceed 350&amp;nbsp;°C, or 662&amp;nbsp;°F), low oxygen levels, and pressures between 20 and 1,000 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (between 2 and 100 [[megapascal]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trujillo, Alan P. |author2=Harold V. Thurman |year=2011|title=Essentials of Oceanography 10th ed |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Boston |pages=457;460|isbn=978-0321668127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment ==
[[File:Wfm pelagic.png|thumb|right|150px|Scale diagram of the layers of the pelagic zone]]

In the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone, and support very different types of pelagic fishes adapted to living in these deeper zones.&lt;ref name="Moyle585"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 585&lt;/ref&gt;

In deep water, [[marine snow]] is a continuous shower of mostly organic [[detritus]] falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive [[photic zone]]. Marine snow includes dead or dying [[plankton]], [[protist]]s ([[diatom]]s), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The "snowflakes" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source.

Some deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the [[lanternfish]], [[ridgehead]], [[marine hatchetfish]], and [[Phosichthyidae|lightfish]] families are sometimes termed ''pseudoceanic'' because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably [[seamount]]s and over [[continental slope]]s. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.

Hydrostatic pressure increases by 1 atmosphere for every 10m in depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wharton, David. |year=2002|title=Life at the Limits: Organisms in Extreme Environments |publisher=Cambridge UP |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=198|isbn=978-0521782128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep-sea organisms have the same pressure within their bodies as is exerted on them from the outside, so they are not crushed by the extreme pressure. Their high internal pressure, however, results in the reduced fluidity of their membranes because molecules are squeezed together. Fluidity in cell membranes increases efficiency of biological functions, most importantly the production of proteins, so organisms have adapted to this circumstance by increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the lipids of the cell membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wharton, David |year=2002 |title=Life at the Limits: Organisms in Extreme Environments |publisher=Cambridge UP |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=199; 201–202 |isbn=978-0521782128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to differences in internal pressure, these organisms have developed a different balance between their metabolic reactions from those organisms that live in the epipelagic zone. David Wharton, author of ''Life at the Limits: Organisms in Extreme Environments'', notes "Biochemical reactions are accompanied by changes in volume. If a reaction results in an increase in volume, it will be inhibited by pressure, whereas, if it is associated with a decrease in volume, it will be enhanced".&lt;ref name="Wharton, David. 2002 199"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wharton, David. |year=2002|title=Life at the Limits: Organisms in Extreme Environments |publisher=Cambridge UP |location=Cambridge, UK |pages=199|isbn=978-0521782128}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that their metabolic processes must ultimately decrease the volume of the organism to some degree.

[[File:Frill shark.jpg|thumb|left| Humans seldom encounter [[frilled shark]]s alive, so they pose little danger (though scientists have accidentally cut themselves examining their teeth).&lt;ref name="compagno"&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |year=1984 |title=Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date |publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations |isbn=92-5-101384-5 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Most fish that have evolved in this harsh environment are not capable of surviving in laboratory conditions, and attempts to keep them in captivity have led to their deaths. Deep-sea organisms contain gas-filled spaces (vacuoles).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7t8IQ1x6x3IC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=Deep-sea+organisms+contain+gas-filled+spaces+(vacuoles)#v=onepage&amp;q=Deep-sea%20organisms%20contain%20gas-filled%20spaces%20(vacuoles)&amp;f=false|title=Life at the Limits: Organisms in Extreme Environments|last=Wharton|first=David A.|date=2007-07-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139431941|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas is compressed under high pressure and expands under low pressure. Because of this, these organisms have been known to blow up if they come to the surface.&lt;ref name="Wharton, David. 2002 199"/&gt;

The fish of the deep-sea are among the strangest and most elusive creatures on Earth. In this deep dark unknown lie many unusual creatures that have yet to be studied. Since many of these fish live in regions where there is no natural [[illumination (lighting)|illumination]], they cannot rely solely on their eyesight for locating prey and mates and avoiding predators; deep-sea fish have [[evolution|evolved]] appropriately to the extreme sub-photic region in which they live. Many of these organisms are blind and rely on their other senses, such as sensitivities to changes in local pressure and smell, to catch their food and avoid being caught. Those that aren't blind have large and sensitive eyes that can use [[bioluminescent]] light. These eyes can be as much as 100 times more sensitive to light than human eyes. Also, to avoid predation, many species are dark to blend in with their environment.&lt;ref name="Trujillo, Alan P., and Harold V. Thurman 2011 415"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trujillo, Alan P. |author2=Harold V. Thurman |year=2011|title=Essentials of Oceanography 10th ed |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Boston |pages=415|isbn=978-0321668127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many deep-sea fish are [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]], with extremely large eyes adapted to the dark. Bioluminescent organisms are capable of producing light biologically through the agitation of molecules of luciferin, which then produce light. This process must be done in the presence of oxygen. These organisms are common in the mesopelagic region and below (200m and below). More than 50% of deep-sea fish as well as some species of shrimp and squid are capable of bioluminescence. About 80% of these organisms have photophores – light producing glandular cells that contain luminous bacteria bordered by dark colorings. Some of these photophores contain lenses, much like those in the eyes of humans, which can intensify or lessen the emanation of light. The ability to produce light only requires 1% of the organism's energy and has many purposes: It is used to search for food and attract prey, like the anglerfish; claim territory through patrol; communicate and find a mate;  and distract or temporarily blind predators to escape. Also, in the mesopelagic where some light still penetrates, some organisms camouflage themselves from predators below them by illuminating their bellies to match the color and intensity of light from above so that no shadow is cast. This tactic is known as counter illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Trujillo, Alan P. |author2=Harold V. Thurman |year=2011|title=Essentials of Oceanography 10th ed |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Boston |pages=414–415|isbn=978-0321668127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifecycle of deep-sea fish can be exclusively deep water although some species are born in shallower water and sink upon maturation. Regardless of the depth where eggs and larvae reside, they are typically pelagic. This planktonic — drifting — lifestyle requires neutral buoyancy. In order to maintain this, the eggs and larvae often contain oil droplets in their plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Randall, David J. |author2=Anthony Peter Farrell |year=1997 |title=Deep-sea Fishes |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego |pages=217 |isbn=978-0123504401}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these organisms are in their fully matured state they need other adaptations to maintain their positions in the water column. In general, water's density causes upthrust — the aspect of buoyancy that makes organisms float. To counteract this, the density of an organism must be greater than that of the surrounding water. Most animal tissues are denser than water, so they must find an equilibrium to make them float.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Randall, David J. |author2=Anthony Peter Farrell |year=1997 |title=Deep-sea Fishes |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego |pages=195|isbn=978-0123504401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organisms develop swim bladders (gas cavities) to stay afloat, but because of the high pressure of their environment, deep-sea fishes usually do not have this organ. Instead they exhibit structures similar to hydrofoils in order to provide hydrodynamic lift. It has also been found that the deeper a fish lives, the more jelly-like its flesh and the more minimal its bone structure. They reduce their tissue density through high fat content, reduction of skeletal weight — accomplished through reductions of size, thickness and mineral content — and water accumulation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Randall, David J. |author2=Anthony Peter Farrell |year=1997|title=Deep-sea Fishes |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego |pages=196; 225|isbn=978-0123504401}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes them slower and less agile than surface fish.

Due to the poor level of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] light reaching deep-sea environments, most fish need to rely on [[organic compound|organic]] matter sinking from higher levels, or, in rare cases, [[hydrothermal vents]] for nutrients. This makes the deep-sea much poorer in [[primary production|productivity]] than shallower regions. Also, animals in the pelagic environment are sparse and food doesn’t come along frequently. Because of this, organisms need adaptations that allow them to survive. Some have long feelers to help them locate prey or attract mates in the pitch black of the deep ocean. The deep-sea angler fish in particular has a long fishing-rod-like adaptation protruding from its face, on the end of which is a bioluminescent piece of skin that wriggles like a worm to lure its prey. Some must consume other fish that are the same size or larger than them and they need adaptations to help digest them efficiently. Great sharp teeth, hinged jaws, disproportionately large mouths, and expandable bodies are a few of the characteristics that deep-sea fishes have for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Trujillo, Alan P., and Harold V. Thurman 2011 415"/&gt; The [[Saccopharyngiformes|gulper eel]] is one example of an organism that displays these characteristics.

Fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic [[Diel vertical migration|vertically migrating]] plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic [[anglerfish]]es, and the deep water benthic [[rattail]]s. "&lt;ref name="Moyle591"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acanthopterygii|Ray finned]] species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep sea fishes, which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Haedrich1996"/&gt; The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the [[Beryciformes]] and [[Lampriformes]], which are also ancient forms. Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments. In contrast, deep water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes.&lt;ref name="Moyle586"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, page 586&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the epipelagic zone, conditions change rapidly. Between 200 metres and about 1000 metres, light continues to fade until there is almost none. Temperatures fall through a [[thermocline]] to temperatures between 3.9&amp;nbsp;°C (39&amp;nbsp;°F) and 7.8&amp;nbsp;°C (46&amp;nbsp;°F). This is the '''twilight''' or [[mesopelagic]] zone. Pressure continues to increase, at the rate of one atmosphere every 10 metres, while nutrient concentrations fall, along with dissolved oxygen and the rate at which the water circulates."&lt;ref name="Moyle585"/&gt;

Sonar operators, using the newly developed sonar technology during World War II, were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor 300–500 metres deep at day, and less deep at night. This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swimbladders that reflected the sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and can become shallower when clouds pass over the moon. This phenomenon has come to be known as the [[deep scattering layer]].&lt;ref name="TeAraMZ"&gt;Ryan P [http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/SeaLife/DeepSeaCreatures/2/en "Deep-sea creatures: The mesopelagic zone"] ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''. Updated 21 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most mesopelagic fish make daily [[Diel vertical migration|vertical migration]]s, moving at night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, and returning to the depths for safety during the day.&lt;ref name="Moyle585"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bone &amp; Moore 2008, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; These vertical migrations often occur over large vertical distances, and are undertaken with the assistance of a [[swimbladder]]. The swimbladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting.

Mesopelagic [[Filter feeder|plankton feeders]] have small mouths with fine [[gill raker]]s, while the [[piscivore]]s have larger mouths and coarser gill rakers.&lt;ref name="Moyle585"/&gt; The vertically migratory fish have [[swimbladder]]s.&lt;ref name="Haedrich1996"&gt;Haedrich RL (1996) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119203565/abstract "Deep-water fishes: evolution and adaptation in the earth's largest living spaces"] ''Journal of Fish Biology'' '''49'''(sA):40-53.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesopelagic fish are adapted for an active life under low light conditions. Most of them are visual predators with large eyes. Some of the deeper water fish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only [[rod cell]]s that look upwards. These give binocular vision and great sensitivity to small light signals.&lt;ref name="Moyle585"/&gt; This adaptation gives improved terminal vision at the expense of lateral vision, and allows the predator to pick out [[squid]], [[cuttlefish]], and smaller fish that are silhouetted against the gloom above them.

Mesopelagic fish usually lack defensive spines, and use colour to [[camouflage]] themselves from other fish. [[Ambush predator]]s are dark, black or red. Since the longer, red, wavelengths of light do not reach the deep sea, red effectively functions the same as black. Migratory forms use [[Countershading|countershaded]] silvery colours. On their bellies, they often display [[photophore]]s producing low grade light. For a predator from below, looking upwards, this [[bioluminescence]] camouflages the silhouette of the fish. However, some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the (red deficient) ambient light, leaving the bioluminescence visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Munz WRA | year = 1976 | title = On yellow lenses in mesopelagic animals | url = | journal = Marine Biological Association of the UK | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 963–976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[brownsnout spookfish]], a species of [[barreleye]], is the only vertebrate known to employ a mirror, as opposed to a lens, to focus an image in its eyes.&lt;ref name="wagner et al"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wagner, H.J. |author2=Douglas, R.H. |author3=Frank, T.M. |author4=Roberts, N.W. |author5=Partridge, J.C.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A Novel Vertebrate Eye Using Both Refractive and Reflective Optics |journal=Current Biology |volume=19 |pages=108–114 |date=Jan 27, 2009 | pmid=19110427 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.11.061 |issue=2

[[Bigeye tuna]] are an epipelagic/mesopelagic species that eats other fish. Satellite tagging has shown that bigeye tuna often spend prolonged periods cruising deep below the surface during the daytime, sometimes making dives as deep as 500 metres.  These movements are thought to be in response to the vertical migrations of prey organisms in the [[deep scattering layer]].

Below the mesopelagic zone it is pitch dark. This is the midnight (or [[bathypelagic zone]]), extending from 1000 metres to the bottom deep water [[benthic zone]]. If the water is exceptionally deep, the pelagic zone below 4000 metres is sometimes called the lower midnight (or [[abyssopelagic zone]]).

Conditions are somewhat uniform throughout these zones; the darkness is complete, the pressure is crushing, and temperatures, nutrients and dissolved oxygen levels are all low.&lt;ref name="Moyle585"/&gt;

Bathypelagic fish have special [[adaptation]]s to cope with these conditions – they have slow [[metabolism]]s and unspecialized diets, being willing to eat anything that comes along. They prefer to sit and wait for food rather than waste energy searching for it. The behaviour of bathypelagic fish can be contrasted with the behaviour of mesopelagic fish. Mesopelagic fish are often highly mobile, whereas bathypelagic fish are almost all lie-in-wait predators, normally expending little energy in movement.&lt;ref name="Moyle594"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 594&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant bathypelagic fishes are small [[bristlemouth]] and [[anglerfish]]; [[fangtooth]], [[viperfish]], [[daggertooth]] and [[barracudina]] are also common. These fishes are small, many about 10 centimetres long, and not many longer than 25&amp;nbsp;cm. They spend most of their time waiting patiently in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors. What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish.&lt;ref name="Moyle594"/&gt; About 20 percent of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic zone,&lt;ref name="TeAraMZ" /&gt; but only about 5 percent filters down to the bathypelagic zone.&lt;ref name="TeAraBZ"&gt;Ryan P [http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/SeaLife/DeepSeaCreatures/3/en "Deep-sea creatures: The bathypelagic zone"] ''Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand''. Updated 21 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bathypelagic fish are sedentary, adapted to outputting minimum energy in a habitat with very little food or available energy, not even sunlight, only bioluminescence. Their bodies are [[wiktionary:elongate|elongated]] with weak, watery muscles and [[skeleton|skeletal]] structures. Since so much of the fish is water, they are not compressed by the great pressures at these depths. They often have extensible, hinged [[Jaw#The jaw in fish|jaws]] with recurved teeth. They are slimy, without [[Fish scale|scale]]s. The central nervous system is confined to the lateral line and olfactory systems, the eyes are small and may not function, and [[gill]]s, kidneys and hearts, and [[swimbladder]]s are small or missing.&lt;ref name="TeAraBZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moyle587"&gt;Moyle and Cech, 2004, p. 587&lt;/ref&gt;

These are the same features found in fish [[larvae]], which suggests that during their evolution, bathypelagic fish have acquired these features through [[neoteny]]. As with larvae, these features allow the fish to remain suspended in the water with little expenditure of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1984) "Progenetic tendencies in deep-sea fishes", pp. 91-101 in Potts GW and Wootton RJ (eds.) (1984) ''Fish reproduction: strategies and tactics'' Fisheries Society of the British Isles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their ferocious appearance, these beasts of the deep are mostly miniature fish with weak muscles, and are too small to represent any threat to humans.

The swimbladders of deep sea fish are either absent or scarcely operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations. Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs. Some deep sea fishes have swimbladders which function while they are young and inhabit the upper epipelagic zone, but they wither or fill with fat when the fish move down to their adult habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Horn MH | year = 1970 | title = The swimbladder as a juvenile organ in stromateoid fishes | url = https://archive.org/stream/breviora351379harv/breviora351379harv_djvu.txt | journal = Breviora | volume = 359 | issue = | pages = 1–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important sensory systems are usually the [[inner ear]], which responds to sound, and the [[lateral line]], which responds to changes in water pressure. The [[olfactory]] system can also be important for males who find females by smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jumper GY, Bair RC | year = 1991 | title = Location by olfaction: a model and application to the mating problem in the deep-sea Hatchetfish ''Argyropelecus hemigymnus'' | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 138 | issue = 6| pages = 1431–1458 | jstor=2462555 | doi=10.1086/285295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bathypelagic fish are black, or sometimes red, with few [[photophore]]s. When photophores are used, it is usually to entice prey or attract a mate. Because food is so scarce, bathypelagic predators are not selective in their feeding habits, but grab whatever comes close enough. They accomplish this by having a large mouth with sharp teeth for grabbing large prey and overlapping [[gill raker]]s which prevent small prey that have been swallowed from escaping.&lt;ref name="Moyle587"/&gt;

It is not easy finding a mate in this zone. Some species depend on [[bioluminescence]]. Others are [[hermaphrodite]]s, which doubles their chances of producing both eggs and sperm when an encounter occurs.&lt;ref name="TeAraBZ" /&gt; The female anglerfish releases [[pheromone]]s to attract tiny males. When a male finds her, he bites on to her and never lets go. When a male of the anglerfish species ''[[Haplophryne mollis]]'' bites into the skin of a female, he releases an [[enzyme]] that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair to the point where the two circulatory systems join up. The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of [[gonads]]. This extreme [[sexual dimorphism]] ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.&lt;ref name="doran"&gt;{{cite journal | url =http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author =Theodore W.

Many forms other than fish live in the bathypelagic zone, such as squid, large whales, octopuses, sponges, [[brachiopod]]s, sea stars, and [[echinoid]]s, but this zone is difficult for fish to live in.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1044">In grammar, a '''dependent statement''' is a statement converted into a [[noun clause]], normally, in [[English language|English]], by the addition of ''that'' at the beginning, and made dependent on another clause (e.g. as subject or object). For example, the statement ''I had saved his brother'' appears as object of the verb ''knew'' in the following quotation:

I would he knew ''that I had saved his brother!'' (Shakespeare).

The statement ''They were unprepared'' is made subject of ''is'' in the following:

''That they were unprepared'' is obvious.

Further examples:

Methoughts ''that I had broken from the Tower'' (Shakespeare).

His majesty hath straitly given in charge ''that no man shall have private conference, of what degree soever, with his brother'' (Shakespeare).

You shall confess ''that you are both deceived'' (Shakespeare).

The dual systems model hypothesizes that early maturation of the socioemotional system (including brain regions like the [[striatum]]) increases adolescents' attraction for exciting, pleasurable, and novel activities during a time when cognitive control systems (including brain regions like the [[prefrontal cortex]]) are not fully developed and thus cannot regulate these appetitive, and potentially hazardous, impulses. The temporal gap in the development of the socioemotional and cognitive control systems creates a period of heightened vulnerability to risk-taking during mid-adolescence.  In the dual systems model, "reward sensitivity" and "[[Executive functions|cognitive control]]" refer to neurobiological constructs that are measured in studies of brain structure and function. Other models similar to the dual systems model are the maturational imbalance model,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casey|first=B.j.|last2=Jones|first2=Rebecca M.|last3=Hare|first3=Todd A.|date=2008-03-01|title=The Adolescent Brain|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1196/annals.1440.010/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1124|issue=1|pages=111–126|doi=10.1196/annals.1440.010|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; the driven dual systems model,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://content.apa.org/books/14643-005|title=Adolescent brain development: Implications for the juvenile criminal justice system.|last=Luna|first=Beatriz|last2=Wright|first2=Catherine|pages=91–116|language=en|doi=10.1037/14643-005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the triadic model.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernst|first=Monique|title=The triadic model perspective for the study of adolescent motivated behavior|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278262614000086|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=89|pages=104–111|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2014.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical perspective ==
The dual systems model arose out of evidence from developmental cognitive neuroscience providing insight into how patterns of brain development could explain aspects of adolescent decision-making. In 2008, [[Laurence Steinberg]]'s laboratory at [[Temple University]] and BJ Casey's laboratory at [[Cornell University|Cornell]] separately proposed similar dual systems theories of adolescent risky decision-making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|date=2008|title=A Social Neuroscience Perspective on Adolescent Risk-Taking|journal=Developmental review : DR|volume=28|issue=1|pages=78–106|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2007.08.002|issn=0273-2297|pmc=2396566|pmid=18509515|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|last2=Albert|first2=Dustin|last3=Cauffman|first3=Elizabeth|last4=Banich|first4=Marie|last5=Graham|first5=Sandra|last6=Woolard|first6=Jennifer|title=Age differences in sensation seeking and impulsivity as indexed by behavior and self-report: Evidence for a dual systems model.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0012955|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=44|issue=6|pages=1764–1778|doi=10.1037/a0012955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey et al. termed their model the maturational imbalance model.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Models ==
[[File:Models of Adolescent Brain Development.png|thumb|482x482px|Development of the socioemotional and cognitive control systems as depicted by the dual systems model, maturational imbalance model, and driven dual systems model]]

=== Maturational imbalance model ===
Both the dual systems model and the maturational imbalance model conceive of a slower developing cognitive control system that matures through late adolescence. The dual systems model proposes an inverted-U shape development of the socioemotional system, such that reward responsivity increases in early adolescence and declines thereafter. The maturational imbalance model portrays a socioemotional system that reaches its peak around mid-adolescence and then plateaus into adulthood. Further, the dual systems model proposes that the development of the cognitive control and socioemotional systems is independent whereas the maturational imbalance proposes that the maturation of the cognitive control system leads to dampening of socioemotional responsivity.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Driven dual systems model ===
Recently, another variation of the dual systems model was proposed called the "driven dual systems model".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This model proposes an inverted-U shaped trajectory of socioemotional system responsivity, similar to the dual systems model, but hypothesizes a cognitive control trajectory that plateaus in mid-adolescence. This cognitive control trajectory differs from that proposed by the dual systems model and maturational imbalance model which continues to increase into the early 20s. Similar to the driven dual systems model, a model has been proposed including a hyperactive socioemotional system that undermines the regulatory ability of the cognitive control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciana|first=Monica|last2=Collins|first2=Paul F.|date=2012-12-01|title=Incentive Motivation, Cognitive Control, and the Adolescent Brain: Is It Time for a Paradigm Shift?|journal=Child Development Perspectives|volume=6|issue=4|pages=392–399|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00252.x|issn=1750-8592|pmc=3607661|pmid=23543860}}&lt;/ref&gt; These later models hypothesize that cognitive control development is completed by mid-adolescence and attribute increased risk-taking during adolescence to the hyperarousal of the socioemotional system. The dual systems model and maturational imbalance model propose that cognitive control development continues into early adulthood and that increased risk-taking in adolescence is attributable to a developmental imbalance where the socioemotional system is at its peak of development but the cognitive control system developmental trajectory lags behind.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shulman|first=Elizabeth P.|last2=Smith|first2=Ashley R.|last3=Silva|first3=Karol|last4=Icenogle|first4=Grace|last5=Duell|first5=Natasha|last6=Chein|first6=Jason|last7=Steinberg|first7=Laurence|title=The dual systems model: Review, reappraisal, and reaffirmation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1878929315001292|journal=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=17|pages=103–117|doi=10.1016/j.dcn.2015.12.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Triadic model ===
The "triadic model", which includes a third brain system responsible for emotion processing and primarily implicating the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ERNST|first=MONIQUE|last2=PINE|first2=DANIEL S.|last3=HARDIN|first3=MICHAEL|date=2006|title=Triadic model of the neurobiology of motivated behavior in adolescence|journal=Psychological medicine|volume=36|issue=3|pages=299–312|doi=10.1017/S0033291705005891|issn=0033-2917|pmc=2733162|pmid=16472412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triadic model proposes that this emotion system increases [[impulsivity]] during adolescence by increasing the perceived cost of delaying [[decision-making]]. This model posits that impulsivity and risk seeking in adolescence is due to a combination of hyperactive reward systems causing adolescents to approach appetitive stimuli, emotion processing systems causing adolescents to enhance perceived costs of delaying behaviors and reduce avoidance of potentially negative stimuli, and an underdeveloped cognitive control system that is unable to regulate reward-seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== Adolescent risk-taking ==
Risk-taking in certain, but not all, domains peaks during adolescence. Most notably, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] rates increase significantly from childhood to adolescence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Ronald E.|date=June 2004|title=Adolescent brain development: a period of vulnerabilities and opportunities.

The primary cause for this increase in mortality/morbidity among adolescents is preventable injury. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control,]] in 2014 about 40% of all adolescent deaths (ages 15–19 years) were caused by unintentional accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_05.pdf|title=Deaths: Leading Causes for 2014|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|first=|date=June 30, 2016|website=www.cdc.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 to 2006, almost one-half of all adolescent deaths (ages 12–19 years) were due to accidental injury.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db37.htm|title=Mortality Among Teenagers Aged 12-19 Years: United States, 1999-2006|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|first=|date=May 2010|website=www.cdc.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these unintentional injuries, about 2/3 are due to [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle accidents]], followed by unintentional [[poisoning]], unintentional [[drowning]], other land transportation accidents, and unintentional discharge of firearms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The dual systems model proposes that mid-adolescence is the time of highest biological propensity for risk-taking, but that older adolescents may exhibit higher levels of real-world risk-taking (e.g., [[binge drinking]] is most common during the early 20s)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy001022/abstract|title=Handbook of Adolescent Psychology|last=Chassin|first=Laurie|last2=Hussong|first2=Andrea|last3=Beltran|first3=Iris|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780470479193|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy001022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Willoughby|first=Teena|last2=Good|first2=Marie|last3=Adachi|first3=Paul J.C.|last4=Hamza|first4=Chloe|last5=Tavernier|first5=Royette|title=Examining the link between adolescent brain development and risk taking from a social–developmental perspective|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278262613001437|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=83|issue=3|pages=315–323|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2013.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; not due to greater propensity for risk-taking but due to greater opportunity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, individuals in their early 20s compared to mid-adolescence have less adult supervision, greater financial resources, and greater legal privileges. The dual systems model looks to experimental paradigms in developmental neuroscience for evidence of this greater biological propensity for risk-taking.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

There is also a consistent relation between age and crime with adolescents and young adults being more likely to engage in violent and non-violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=L|date=2013|title=The influence of neuroscience on US Supreme Court decisions about adolescents' criminal culpability.|url=|journal=Nat. Rev. Neurosci.|volume=14|pages=513–518|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are linked to increases in [[Sensation seeking|sensation-seeking]], which is the tendency to seek out novel, exciting, and rewarding stimuli, during adolescence, and continued development of impulse control, which is the ability to regulate one's behavior. The dual systems model points to brain development as a mechanism for this association.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== Reward seeking ===
Across many species including humans, rodents, and nonhuman [[primate]]s, adolescents demonstrate peaks in reward-seeking behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spear|first=Linda Patia|date=2011-10-01|title=Rewards, aversions and affect in adolescence: Emerging convergences across laboratory animal and human data|journal=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=1|issue=4|pages=390–403|doi=10.1016/j.dcn.2011.08.001|issn=1878-9293|pmc=3170768|pmid=21918675}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;  For example, adolescent rats are more sensitive than adult rats to rewarding stimuli&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Nicholas W.|last2=Moghaddam|first2=Bita|title=Neural processing of reward in adolescent rodents|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1878929314000826|journal=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=11|pages=145–154|doi=10.1016/j.dcn.2014.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and show enhanced behavioral responses to novelty and peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=Lewis A.|last2=Varlinskaya|first2=Elena I.|last3=Spear|first3=Linda P.|date=November 2003|title=Novel-object place conditioning in adolescent and adult male and female rats: effects of social isolation|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=80|issue=2-3|pages=317–325|issn=0031-9384|pmid=14637231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VARLINSKAYA|first=E|title=Social interactions in adolescent and adult Sprague–Dawley rats: Impact of social deprivation and test context familiarity|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016643280700647X|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=188|issue=2|pages=398–405|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2007.11.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent humans show peaks in self-reported sensation-seeking,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|last2=Graham|first2=Sandra|last3=O'Brien|first3=Lia|last4=Woolard|first4=Jennifer|last5=Cauffman|first5=Elizabeth|last6=Banich|first6=Marie|date=2009-01-01|title=Age Differences in Future Orientation and Delay Discounting|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01244.x/abstract|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=80|issue=1|pages=28–44|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01244.x|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased neural activation to monetary and social rewards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ethridge|first=Paige|last2=Kujawa|first2=Autumn|last3=Dirks|first3=Melanie A.|last4=Arfer|first4=Kodi B.|last5=Kessel|first5=Ellen M.|last6=Klein|first6=Daniel N.|last7=Weinberg|first7=Anna|title=Neural responses to social and monetary reward in early adolescence and emerging adulthood|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12957/abstract|journal=Psychophysiology|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/psyp.12957|issn=1469-8986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ernst|first=Monique|last2=Nelson|first2=Eric E.|last3=Jazbec|first3=Sandra|last4=McClure|first4=Erin B.|last5=Monk|first5=Christopher S.|last6=Leibenluft|first6=Ellen|last7=Blair|first7=James|last8=Pine|first8=Daniel S.|date=2005-05-01|title=Amygdala and nucleus accumbens in responses to receipt and omission of gains in adults and adolescents|journal=NeuroImage|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1279–1291|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.12.038|issn=1053-8119|pmid=15850746}}&lt;/ref&gt;  greater [[Time preference|temporal discounting]] of delayed rewards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whelan|first=Robert|last2=McHugh|first2=Louise A.|date=2009-04-01|title=Temporal Discounting of Hypothetical Monetary Rewards by Adolescents, Adults, and Older Adults|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03395661|journal=The Psychological Record|language=en|volume=59|issue=2|pages=247–258|doi=10.1007/bf03395661|issn=0033-2933}}&lt;/ref&gt; and heightened preferences for primary rewards (e.g., sweet substances).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galván|first=Adriana|last2=McGlennen|first2=Kristine M.|date=2012-11-19|title=Enhanced Striatal Sensitivity to Aversive Reinforcement in Adolescents versus Adults|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_00326|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=25|issue=2|pages=284–296|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00326|issn=0898-929X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensation-seeking is a type of reward seeking involving the tendency to seek out novel, exciting, and rewarding stimuli. Sensation-seeking has been found to increase in preadolescence, peak in mid-adolescence, and decline in early adulthood.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harden|first=K.

==== Hyperactivity ====
Neuroimaging studies using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) have shown that the ventral striatum is more active among adolescents compared to children and adults when receiving monetary rewards,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Leijenhorst|first=Linda|last2=Zanolie|first2=Kiki|last3=Van Meel|first3=Catharina S.|last4=Westenberg|first4=P.

==== Hypoactivity ====
Some studies have found that striatum activity is blunted compared to children and adults when anticipating rewards,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjork|first=James M.|last2=Knutson|first2=Brian|last3=Fong|first3=Grace W.|last4=Caggiano|first4=Daniel M.|last5=Bennett|first5=Shannon M.|last6=Hommer|first6=Daniel W.|date=2004-02-25|title=Incentive-elicited brain activation in adolescents: similarities and differences from young adults|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1793–1802|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4862-03.2004|issn=1529-2401|pmid=14985419}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been linked to greater risk-taking behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Sophia|last2=Peters|first2=Jan|last3=Bromberg|first3=Uli|last4=Brassen|first4=Stefanie|last5=Miedl|first5=Stephan F.|last6=Banaschewski|first6=Tobias|last7=Barker|first7=Gareth J.|last8=Conrod|first8=Patricia|last9=Flor|first9=Herta|date=January 2012|title=Risk taking and the adolescent reward system: a potential common link to substance abuse|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=169|issue=1|pages=39–46|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11030489|issn=1535-7228|pmid=21955931}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory linking this hypoactivation to greater risk-taking is that adolescents experience less gratifying experience from anticipating rewards and they are therefore motivated to seek out more reward-inducing experiences to achieve the same level of reward sensation as other age groups.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Current consensus ====
Although evidence exists for both adolescent hyper-responsiveness to rewards and hypo-responsiveness to rewards, the field of [[Developmental cognitive neuroscience|developmental neuroscience]] has generally converged on the view of hyper-responsiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galvan|first=Adriana|date=2010-02-12|title=Adolescent Development of the Reward System|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=4|doi=10.3389/neuro.09.006.2010|issn=1662-5161|pmc=2826184|pmid=20179786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that is, that adolescents are motivated, in part, to engage in greater reward-seeking behaviors because of developmental changes in the striatum that contribute to hypersensitivity to reward.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Cognitive control system ==
The cognitive control system refers to the lateral prefrontal, lateral parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. The most commonly investigated region is the prefrontal cortex which undergoes substantial development throughout adolescence.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The development of the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the ability to regulate behavior and engage in inhibitory control.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paus|first=Tomás|date=February 2005|title=Mapping brain maturation and cognitive development during adolescence|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=9|issue=2|pages=60–68|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.12.008|issn=1364-6613|pmid=15668098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of synaptic pruning and myelination of the prefrontal cortex, improvements in executive functions have been observed during adolescence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Synaptic pruning ===
During development, the brain undergoes overproduction of [[neuron]]s and their [[Synaptic pruning|synaptic]] connections and then prunes those that are unnecessary for optimal functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huttenlocher|first=P. R.|last2=Dabholkar|first2=A. S.|date=1997-10-20|title=Regional differences in synaptogenesis in human cerebral cortex|journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology|volume=387|issue=2|pages=167–178|issn=0021-9967|pmid=9336221}}&lt;/ref&gt; This developmental process results in [[grey matter]] reduction over development. During adolescence, this pruning process is specialized with some areas losing approximately half of their synaptic connections but others showing little change.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogtay|first=Nitin|last2=Giedd|first2=Jay N.|last3=Lusk|first3=Leslie|last4=Hayashi|first4=Kiralee M.|last5=Greenstein|first5=Deanna|last6=Vaituzis|first6=A.

The process of grey matter loss (i.e., maturation) occurs differentially in different brain regions with frontal and [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] poles losing grey matter early, but the prefrontal cortex losing grey matter only at the end of adolescence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Myelination ===
In addition to synaptic pruning, the brain undergoes [[myelin]]ation, which influences the speed of information flow across brain regions. Myelination involves neuronal [[axon]]s connecting certain brain areas to become insulated with a white, fatty substance called myelin that increases the speed and efficiency of transmission along axons. Myelination increases dramatically during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paus|first=Tomáš|title=Growth of white matter in the adolescent brain: Myelin or axon?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278262609001006|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=72|issue=1|pages=26–35|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myelination contributes to the developmental thinning or reduction in grey matter in the prefrontal cortex during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tau|first=Gregory Z.|last2=Peterson|first2=Bradley S.|date=January 2010|title=Normal development of brain circuits|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=35|issue=1|pages=147–168|doi=10.1038/npp.2009.115|issn=1740-634X|pmc=3055433|pmid=19794405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Links to inhibitory control ===
Evidence supporting the dual systems model theory of delayed maturation of the cognitive control system is supported by evidence of structural changes like cortical thinning&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; as well as less diffuse activation of frontal regions during inhibitory control tasks from adolescence to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casey|first=B.

== Experimental paradigms ==
{{Off topic|date=July 2018}}
=== Reward tasks ===
Three primary [[Experiment|experimental paradigms]] are used to study reward behavior in adolescents (1) passive receipt of reward, (2) reward conditional on task performance, and (3) decision-making selecting different types of reward options.

==== Passive exposure tasks ====
Passive exposure tasks generally involve exposing the participant to pleasant stimuli (e.g., monetary reward, attractive faces). These paradigms also involve exposure to negative stimuli for the purposes of comparison (e.g., monetary loss, angry faces). Although these tasks are more commonly used to investigate emotion processing rather than reward, some studies have used a slot-machine passive task&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Leijenhorst|first=Linda|last2=Moor|first2=Bregtje Gunther|last3=Macks|first3=Zdeňa A.

Faces have also been used as reward for motivational paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohls|first=Gregor|last2=Schulte-Rüther|first2=Martin|last3=Nehrkorn|first3=Barbara|last4=Müller|first4=Kristin|last5=Fink|first5=Gereon R.|last6=Kamp-Becker|first6=Inge|last7=Herpertz-Dahlmann|first7=Beate|last8=Schultz|first8=Robert T.|last9=Konrad|first9=Kerstin|date=June 2013|title=Reward system dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=5|pages=565–572|doi=10.1093/scan/nss033|issn=1749-5016|pmc=3682440|pmid=22419119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive exposure tasks have been found to activate the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, with striatal activation greater in adolescents in response to rewarding stimuli but orbitofrontal activation greater in adults in response to negative stimuli.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== Performance contingent tasks ====
Reward tied to task performance typically involves participants being asked to complete a task in order to obtain a reward (and sometimes to avoid losing a reward). Task performance is not necessarily directly related to the reward. Examples of this type of task are the Pirate's paradigm,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; monetary incentive delay (MID) task,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knutson|first=B.|last2=Adams|first2=C.

Differences in activation to anticipation of reward versus preparation to try and achieve reward have been reported on performance related reward tasks.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==== Decision-making tasks ====
Reward decision-making tasks involve participants being asked to choose among different options of reward. Sometimes the rewards differ on [[probability]], magnitude, or type of reward (e.g., social versus monetary). These tasks are typically conceived to not have a correct or incorrect response, but rather to have decision-making based on the participants' preference. Examples of decision making tasks include delay discounting tasks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christakou|first=Anastasia|last2=Brammer|first2=Mick|last3=Rubia|first3=Katya|date=2011-01-15|title=Maturation of limbic corticostriatal activation and connectivity associated with developmental changes in temporal discounting|journal=NeuroImage|volume=54|issue=2|pages=1344–1354|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.08.067|issn=1095-9572|pmid=20816974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Driving Game.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During feedback on decision-making tasks, greater striatal activation to rewarding outcomes has been observed in adolescents compared to adults.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Response inhibition tasks ===
Common response inhibition tasks are the Go/No-Go, [[Eriksen flanker task|Flanker]], [[Stroop effect|Stroop]], Stop Signal, and [[Antisaccade task|anti-saccade]] tasks. Individuals who perform well on these tasks generally activate the prefrontal cortex to a greater extent than individuals who perform poorly on these tasks.&lt;ref name="Durston 1–8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubia|first=Katya|last2=Smith|first2=Anna B.|last3=Woolley|first3=James|last4=Nosarti|first4=Chiara|last5=Heyman|first5=Isobel|last6=Taylor|first6=Eric|last7=Brammer|first7=Mick|date=December 2006|title=Progressive increase of frontostriatal brain activation from childhood to adulthood during event-related tasks of cognitive control|journal=Human Brain Mapping|volume=27|issue=12|pages=973–993|doi=10.1002/hbm.20237|issn=1065-9471|pmid=16683265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubia|first=Katya|last2=Lim|first2=Lena|last3=Ecker|first3=Christine|last4=Halari|first4=Rozmin|last5=Giampietro|first5=Vincent|last6=Simmons|first6=Andrew|last7=Brammer|first7=Michael|last8=Smith|first8=Anna|title=Effects of age and gender on neural networks of motor response inhibition: From adolescence to mid-adulthood|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811913007210|journal=NeuroImage|volume=83|pages=690–703|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance on these tasks improves with age.

==== Go/No-Go task ====
The Go/No-Go task requires participants to respond, usually by pressing a button or a key on a computer keyboard, to a designated cue or withhold a response, by not pressing the button/key, to a different designated cue. Variants of this task include [[alphabet]] letters, shapes, and faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tashjian|first=Sarah M.|last2=Goldenberg|first2=Diane|last3=Galván|first3=Adriana|title=Neural connectivity moderates the association between sleep and impulsivity in adolescents|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1878929317301111|journal=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=27|pages=35–44|doi=10.1016/j.dcn.2017.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tottenham|first=Nim|last2=Hare|first2=Todd A.|last3=Casey|first3=B.

==== Flanker task ====
The [[Eriksen flanker task|Flanker]] task typically involves presentation of a target flanked by non-target stimuli that is either in the same direction as the target (congruent) or in the opposite direction of a target (incongruent) or neither direction (neutral). Participants have to respond to the direction of the target ignoring the non-target stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verbruggen|first=Frederick|last2=Notebaert|first2=Wim|last3=Liefooghe|first3=Baptist|last4=Vandierendonck|first4=André|date=2006-04-01|title=Stimulus- and response-conflict-induced cognitive control in the flanker task|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03193852|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=328–333|doi=10.3758/bf03193852|issn=1069-9384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stroop tasks ====
[[Stroop effect|Stroop]] tasks require participants to respond to one facet of the presented stimuli (e.g., read the word) but ignore another competing facet (e.g., ignore a contradictory color).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klopfer|first=Dale S.|date=2016-05-06|title=Stroop Interference and Color-Word Similarity|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00348.x|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=150–157|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stop signal task ====
The Stop Signal task is similar to the Go/No-Go task in that participants see a cue indicating a go trial. For stop trials, participants see the go cue but then are presented with the stop signal (typically a sound) indicating they should not respond to the go trial. Presenting the stop signal after the go cue makes this task more difficult than traditional Go/No-Go tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnstone|first=Stuart J.|last2=Dimoska|first2=Aneta|last3=Smith|first3=Janette L.|last4=Barry|first4=Robert J.|last5=Pleffer|first5=Carly B.|last6=Chiswick|first6=Dale|last7=Clarke|first7=Adam R.|title=The development of stop-signal and Go/Nogo response inhibition in children aged 7–12&amp;nbsp;years: Performance and event-related potential indices|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167876006002054|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|volume=63|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2006.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Anti-saccade task ====
[[Antisaccade task|Anti-saccade]] tasks typically require participants to fixate on a motionless target. A stimulus is then presented on one side of the target and the participant is asked to make a saccade (either move their eyes or respond with a button press) in the direction away from the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unsworth|first=Nash|last2=Schrock|first2=Josef C.|last3=Engle|first3=Randall W.|title=Working Memory Capacity and the Antisaccade Task: Individual Differences in Voluntary Saccade Control.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0278-7393.30.6.1302|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|language=en|volume=30|issue=6|pages=1302–1321|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.30.6.1302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal relevance ==
Adolescent developmental immaturity and culpability were central to three [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] cases: ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Roper v. Simmons 543 U.S. 551 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Graham v. Florida]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Miller v. Alabama|''Miller v.'' ''Alabama'']].&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to ''Roper'' in 2005, the Supreme Court had relied on common sense standards to determine adolescent culpability. For example, in ''[[Thompson v. Oklahoma]]'',&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the Court prohibited capital punishment for individuals under the age of 16 stating that "Contemporary standards of decency confirm our judgment that such a young person is not capable of acting with the degree of culpability that can justify the ultimate penalty."&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; In ''Roper'', however, the Court looked to developmental science as rationale for abolishing [[capital punishment]] for [[Juvenile delinquency|juveniles]]. In 2010, the Court ruled life without parole was unconstitutional for juveniles in ''Graham'' and in 2012 the Court ruled that States could not mandate life without parole for juveniles even in the case of homicide in ''Miller.'' In ''Miller'', the Court stated "It is increasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in regions and systems related to higher-order executive functions such as impulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance."&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
There have been some critiques of the dual systems model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfeifer|first=Jennifer H.|last2=Allen|first2=Nicholas B.|date=June 2012|title=Arrested development? Reconsidering dual-systems models of brain function in adolescence and disorders|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=16|issue=6|pages=322–329|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2012.04.011|issn=1879-307X|pmc=3711850|pmid=22613872}}&lt;/ref&gt; purporting that: (1) there are too few studies to provide enough [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] support for the model; (2) empirical evidence are contrary to the model, namely that activation of the ventral affective or socioemotional system has been associated with [[Adaptive behavior|adaptive]] behavior and activation of the cognitive control system has been associated with [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] functioning; and (3) the model is overly simplistic in its description of brain development. Respondents continue to assert the value in the dual systems model despite acknowledging that it is a simplified model of real-world behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strang|first=Nicole M.|last2=Chein|first2=Jason M.|last3=Steinberg|first3=Laurence|date=2013-05-27|title=The value of the dual systems model of adolescent risk-taking|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00223|issn=1662-5161|pmc=3664310|pmid=23750132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have criticized the triadic model for a lack of evidence implicating the emotion processing systems (e.g., the amygdala) in risk-taking during adolescence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Ecosystem diversity''' deals with the variations in [[ecosystem]]s within a [[geographical location]] and its overall impact on human existence and the [[environmental impact|environment]].

Ecosystem diversity is a type of [[biodiversity]]. It is the variation in the [[ecosystems]] found in a region or the variation in ecosystems over the whole planet. Biodiversity is important because it clears out our water, changes out climate, and provides us with food. Ecological diversity includes the variation in both [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Ecological diversity can also take into account the variation in the [[complexity]] of a [[biological community]], including the number of different [[ecological niche|niches]], the number of [[trophic level]]s and other ecological processes. An example of ecological diversity on a global scale would be the variation in ecosystems, such as [[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[wetland]]s and [[ocean]]s. Ecological diversity is the largest scale of biodiversity, and within each ecosystem, there is a great deal of both [[Species diversity|species]] and [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Margaret|last= Cunningham|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-biodiversity-definition-and-relation-to-ecosystem-stability.html|website=study.com|series= DSST Environment &amp; Humanity: Study Guide &amp; Test Prep |title=What is Biodiversity? - Definition and Relation to Ecosystem Stability|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=2009|chapter=Ecosystems|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;u=colu91149&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CCX3233900080&amp;asid=ece573364e176588534845e3350339a7|title=Environmental Science: In context|series=In Context Series |volume=1|pages=242–246|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|oclc=277051356|isbn=978-1-4103-3754-2

== Impact ==

Diversity in the ecosystem is significant to human existence for a variety of reasons. Ecosystem diversity boosts the availability of [[oxygen]] via the process of [[photosynthesis]] amongst plant organisms domiciled in the habitat. Diversity In an aquatic environment helps in the [[water purification|purification of water]] by plant varieties for use by humans. Diversity increases plant varieties which serves as a good source for medicines and [[herb]]s for human use.  A lack of diversity in the ecosystem produces an opposite result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naveh|first=Z.|date=1994-09-01|title=From Biodiversity to Ecodiversity: A Landscape-Ecology Approach to Conservation and Restoration|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.1994.tb00065.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.1994.tb00065.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Some examples of ecosystems that are rich in diversity are:
* [[Deserts]]
* [[Forests]]
* [[Large marine ecosystem]]s
* [[Marine ecosystem]]s
* [[Old growth forest]]s
* [[Rainforest]]s
* [[Tundra]]
* [[Coral Reef]]s
* [[Marine biology|Marine]]


== Ecosystem diversity as a result of evolutionary pressure ==
Ecological diversity around the world can be directly linked to the evolutionary and [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] that constrain the [[Diversity index|diversity]] outcome of the ecosystems within different [[Niche segregation|niches]]. [[Tundra|Tundras]], [[Rainforest|Rainforests]], coral reefs and [[deciduous forests]] all are formed as a result of [[Evolutionary pressure|evolutionary pressures]]. Even seemingly small evolutionary interactions can have large impacts on the diversity of the [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] throughout the world. One of the best studied cases of this is of the honey bee's interaction with [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]] on every continent in the world except [[Antarctica|Antartica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animals.mom.me/continents-bees-not-found-5374.html|title=On What Continents Are Bees Not Found?|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 Robert Brodschneider, and Karl Crailsheim conducted a study about the health and nutrition in honey bee colonies, the study conducted focused on: overall colony health, adult nutrition, and [[larva]] nutrition as a function of the effect of [[Pesticide|pesticides]], [[Monoculture|monocultures]] and genetically modified crops to see if the anthropogenically created problems can have an effect pollination levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodschneider|first=Robert|date=2010|title=Nutrition and health in Honey bees|url=https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2010/03/m09120.pdf|journal=Apidologie|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicate that human activity does have a role in the destruction of the fitness of the bee colony. The extinction or near extinction of these pollinators would result in many plants that feed humans on a wide scale, needing alternative pollination methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2015/2015/bee_tech.html|title=Mission 2015: Bee Technology|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crop pollinating insects are worth annually 14.6 billion to the [[Economy of the United States|US economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand|title=Decline of bees forces China's apple farmers to pollinate by hand|website=www.chinadialogue.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost to hand pollinate over insect pollination will cost an estimated 5,715-$7,135 per hectare additionally. Not only will there be a cost increase but also an decrease in colony fitness, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity, which studies have shown has a direct link to the long term survival of the honey bee colonies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130617111341.htm|title=Genetic diversity key to survival of honey bee colonies|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a study, there are over 50 plants that are dependent on bee pollination, many of these being key staples to feeding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020735/http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/beeclass/Pollination.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2007-09-30|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study conducted states that as a direct result of a lack of [[Plant diversity and evolution|plant diversity]], will lead to a decline in the bee population fitness, and a low bee colony fitness has impacts on the fitness of plant ecosystem diversity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2018/08/22/Plant-biodiversity-essential-to-bee-health/7391534949396/|title=Plant biodiversity essential to bee health|work=UPI|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing for bee pollination and working to reduce [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenically]] harmful footprints, bee pollination can increase flora growth genetic diversity and create a unique ecosystem that is highly diverse and can provide a habitat and niche for many other organisms to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/why-bees-are-important-to-our-planet/|title=Why Bees Are Important to Our Planet - One Green Planet|website=www.onegreenplanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the evolutionary pressures of bees being located on six out of seven continents, there can be no denying the impact of [[Pollinator|pollinators]] on the ecosystem diversity. The [[pollen]] collected by the bees is harvested and used as an energy source for winter time, this act of collecting pollen from local plants also has a more important effect of facilitating the movement of genes between [[Organism|organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Min|last2=Compton|first2=Stephen G.|last3=Peng|first3=Fo-En|last4=Zhang|first4=Jian|last5=Chen|first5=Xiao-Yong|date=2015-06-07|title=Movements of genes between populations: are pollinators more effective at transferring their own or plant genetic markers?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455804/|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=282|issue=1808|doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.0290|issn=0962-8452|pmc=4455804|pmid=25948688}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new evolutionary pressures that are largely [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenically]] catalyzed can potentially cause wide spread collapse of ecosystems. In the north Atlantic sea, a study was conducted that followed the effects of the human interaction on surrounding ocean habitats. They found that in there was no [[habitat]] or [[trophic level]] that in some way was effected negatively by human interaction, and that much of the diversity of life was being stunted as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lotze|first=Heike K.|last2=Milewski|first2=Inka|date=October 2004|title=TWO CENTURIES OF MULTIPLE HUMAN IMPACTS AND SUCCESSIVE CHANGES IN A NORTH ATLANTIC FOOD WEB|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/03-5027|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=1428–1447|doi=10.1890/03-5027|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fire ecology''' is a scientific discipline concerned with natural processes involving [[fire]] in an [[ecosystem]] and the [[ecology|ecological]] effects, the interactions between fire and the abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem, and the role as an ecosystem process. Many ecosystems, particularly [[prairie]], [[savanna]], [[chaparral]] and [[coniferous forest]]s, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to [[habitat]] vitality and renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128027493|title=The Ecological Importance of Mixed-Severity Fires -  ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plant species in  fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce.  [[Wildfire suppression]] not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutto|first=Richard L.|date=2008-12-01|title=The Ecological Importance of Severe Wildfires: Some Like It Hot|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/08-0895.1/abstract|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1827–1834|doi=10.1890/08-0895.1|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of wildfire suppression in the United States|Campaigns in the United States]] have historically molded public opinion to believe that [[wildfire]]s are always harmful to nature. This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and [[biodiversity]] of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire.  More generally, fire is now regarded as a 'natural disturbance', similar to [[flood]]ing, [[Storm|wind-storms]], and [[landslide]]s, that has driven the evolution of species and controls the characteristics of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11134082|title=The ecology of natural disturbance and patch dynamics|date=1985|publisher=Academic Press|others=Pickett, Steward T., 1950-, White, P. S.|isbn=0125545207|location=Orlando, Fla.|oclc=11134082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire suppression, in combination with other human-caused environmental changes, may have resulted in unforeseen consequences for natural ecosystems. Some large wildfires in the United States have been blamed on years of fire suppression and the continuing expansion of people into fire-adapted ecosystems, but [[climate change]] is more likely responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westerling|first=A.

==Fire components==

A [[fire regime]] describes the characteristics of fire and how it interacts with a particular ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Whitlock2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitlock|first=Cathy|author2=Higuera, P.E.|author3=McWethy, D.B.|author4=Briles, C.E.|title=Paleoecological Perspectives on Fire Ecology: Revisiting the Fire-Regime Concept|journal=Open Journal of Ecology|year=2010|volume=3|pages=6–23|url=http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toecolj/articles/V003/S10001TOECOLJ/6TOECOLJ.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2013|doi=10.2174/1874213001003020006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130222755/http://www.benthamscience.com/open/toecolj/articles/V003/S10001TOECOLJ/6TOECOLJ.pdf|archivedate=30 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its "severity" is a term that ecologists use to refer to the impact that a fire has on an ecosystem. Ecologists can define this in many ways, but one way is through an estimate of plant mortality. Fire can burn at three levels. Ground fires will burn through soil that is rich in organic matter. Surface fires will burn through dead plant material that is lying on the ground. Crown fires will burn in the tops of shrubs and trees. Ecosystems generally experience a mix of all three.&lt;ref name="BondKeeley2005" /&gt;

Fires will often break out during a dry season, but in some areas wildfires may also commonly occur during a time of year when lightning is prevalent. The frequency over a span of years at which fire will occur at a particular location is a measure of how common wildfires are in a given ecosystem. It is either defined as the average interval between fires at a given site, or the average interval between fires in an equivalent specified area.&lt;ref name="BondKeeley2005"&gt;Bond and Keeley 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined as the energy released per unit length of fireline (kW m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), wildfire intensity can be estimated either as

* the product of 
**the linear spread rate (m s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), 
** the low heat of combustion (kJ kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;),
**  and the combusted fuel mass per unit area, 
*or it can be estimated from the flame length.&lt;ref name="Byram1959"&gt;Byram, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abiotic responses==
Fires can affect soils through heating and combustion processes. Depending on the temperatures of the soils caused by the combustion processes, different effects will happen- from evaporation of water at the lower temperature ranges, to the combustion of soil organic matter and formation of pyrogenic organic matter, otherwise known as charcoal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santín|first=Cristina|last2=Doerr|first2=Stefan H.|date=2016-06-05|title=Fire effects on soils: the human dimension|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1696/20150171|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B|language=en|volume=371|issue=1696|pages=20150171|doi=10.1098/rstb.2015.0171|issn=0962-8436|pmid=27216528|pmc=4874409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fires can cause changes in soil nutrients through a variety of mechanisms, which include oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water, but the event must usually be of high temperatures in order of significant loss of nutrients to occur. However, quantity of nutrients available in soils are usually increased due to the ash that is generated, and this is made quickly available, as opposed to the slow release of nutrients by decomposition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pivello|first=Vânia Regina|last2=Oliveras|first2=Imma|last3=Miranda|first3=Heloísa Sinátora|last4=Haridasan|first4=Mundayatan|last5=Sato|first5=Margarete Naomi|last6=Meirelles|first6=Sérgio Tadeu|date=2010-12-01|title=Effect of fires on soil nutrient availability in an open savanna in Central Brazil|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-010-0508-x|journal=Plant and Soil|language=en|volume=337|issue=1–2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1007/s11104-010-0508-x|issn=0032-079X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock spalling (or [[Spall#Exfoliation|thermal exfoliation]]) accelerates weathering of rock and potentilly the release of some nutrients.

Increase in the pH of the soil following a fire is commonly observed, most likely due to the formation of calcium carbonate, and the subsequent decomposition of this calcium carbonate to calcium oxide when temperatures get even higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It could also be due to the increased cation content in the soil due to the ash, which temporarily increases soil pH. Microbial activity in the soil might also increase due to the heating of soil and increased nutrient content in the soil, though studies have also found complete loss of microbes on the top layer of soil after a fire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mataix-Solera|first=J.|last2=Cerdà|first2=A.|last3=Arcenegui|first3=V.|last4=Jordán|first4=A.|last5=Zavala|first5=L.M.|title=Fire effects on soil aggregation: A review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012825211001322|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|language=en|volume=109|issue=1–2|pages=44–60|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.08.002|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, soils become more [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] (higher pH) following fires because of [[acid]] combustion. By driving novel chemical reactions at high temperatures, fire can even alter the [[Soil#Texture|texture]] and [[Soil#Structure|structure of soils]] by affecting the clay content and the [[Soil#Porosity|soil's porosity]].

Removal of vegetation following a fire can cause several effects on the soil, such as increasing the temperatures of the soil during the day due to increased solar radiation on the soil surface, and greater cooling due to loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves to intercept rain will also cause more rain to reach the soil surface, and with fewer plants to absorb the water, the amount of water content in the soils might increase. However, it might be seen that ash can be water repellent when dry, and therefore water content and availability might not actually increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robichaud|first=Peter R.|last2=Wagenbrenner|first2=Joseph W.|last3=Pierson|first3=Fredrick B.|last4=Spaeth|first4=Kenneth E.|last5=Ashmun|first5=Louise E.|last6=Moffet|first6=Corey A.|title=Infiltration and interrill erosion rates after a wildfire in western Montana, USA|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0341816216300431|journal=CATENA|language=en|volume=142|pages=77–88|doi=10.1016/j.catena.2016.01.027|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotic responses and adaptations==
{{See also|Fire adaptations}}

===Plants===
[[Image:LodgepolePine 6915.jpg|right|thumb|Lodgepole pine cones]]
Plants have evolved many [[adaptation]]s to cope with fire.  Of these adaptations, one of the best-known is likely ''[[serotiny|pyriscence]]'', where maturation and release of seeds is triggered, in whole or in part, by fire or smoke; this behaviour is often erroneously called ''serotiny'', although this term truly denotes the much broader category of seed release activated by any stimulus.  All pyriscent plants are serotinous, but not all serotinous plants are pyriscent (some are necriscent, hygriscent, xeriscent, soliscent, or some combination thereof).  On the other hand, [[germination]] of seed activated by trigger is not to be confused with pyriscence; it is known as ''physiological dormancy''.

In [[chaparral]] communities in Southern [[California]], for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/fire/wildland-fire/learning-center/fire-in-depth/different-ecosystems/chaparral-sw.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) and the young plants can then capitalize on the lack of [[competition (biology)|competition]] in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire-activated buds. The cones of the [[Lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"&gt;USDA Forest Service&lt;/ref&gt; Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant [[giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum''), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves.&lt;ref name="USNPS"&gt;US National Park Service&lt;/ref&gt; Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire-intolerant, fire-tolerant or fire-resistant.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"&gt;Kramp ''et al.'' 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fire intolerance====
Fire-intolerant plant species tend to be highly flammable and are destroyed completely by fire. Some of these plants and their seeds may simply fade from the community after a fire and not return; others have adapted to ensure that their offspring survives into the next generation. "Obligate seeders" are plants with large, fire-activated seed banks that germinate, grow, and mature rapidly following a fire, in order to reproduce and renew the seed bank before the next fire.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KnoxClarke2005"&gt;Knox and Clarke 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
Seeds may contain the receptor protein KAI2, that is activated by the growth hormones [[karrikin]] released by the fire.&lt;ref name="Salk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salk.edu/news/pressrelease_details.php?press_id=613 | title=Smoke signals: How burning plants tell seeds to rise from the ashes | publisher=Salk Institute for Biological Studies | work=Salik researchers | date=April 29, 2013 | accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Eucalypt trees, Australia, 15 months after a bushfire.jpg|right|thumb|Fire tolerance. Typical regrowth after an Australian bushfire]]

====Fire tolerance====
Fire-tolerant species are able to withstand a degree of burning and continue growing despite damage from fire. These plants are sometimes referred to as "[[resprouter]]s." Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KnoxClarke2005"/&gt; For example, after an [[Bushfires in Australia|Australian bushfire]], the [[Mountain Grey Gum]] tree (''Eucalyptus cypellocarpa'') starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves from the base of the tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves.

====Fire resistance====
Fire-resistant plants suffer little damage during a characteristic fire regime. These include large trees whose flammable parts are high above surface fires. Mature [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') is an example of a tree species that suffers virtually no crown damage under a naturally mild fire regime, because it sheds its lower, vulnerable branches as it matures.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pyne2002"&gt;Pyne 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals, birds and microbes===
[[Image:Fire hawks.jpg|right|thumb|A mixed flock of hawks hunting in and around a bushfire]]
Like plants, animals display a range of abilities to cope with fire, but they differ from most plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although [[bird]]s are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit from being able to take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some anthropological and ethno-ornithological evidence suggests that certain species of fire-foraging raptors may engage in intentional fire propagation to flush out prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosford|first1=Robert|title=Ornithogenic Fire: Raptors as Propagators of Fire in the Australian Savanna|journal=2015 Raptor Research Foundation Annual Conference, Nov 4 – 8 , Sacramento, California|date=Nov 2015|url=http://www.raptorresearchfoundation.org/files/2015/11/2015_conference_program.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonta|first1=Mark|title=Intentional fire-spreading by "firehawk" raptors in Northern Australia|journal=Journal of Ethnobotany|date=2017|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mammal]]s are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. [[Amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud.&lt;ref name="Kramp1986"/&gt; Some [[arthropod]]s also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"&gt;DeBano ''et al.'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microbial]] organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but are more likely to be able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A low fire intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire.&lt;ref name="Hart2005"&gt;Hart ''et al.'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil microbial population diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of plant cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersson|first1=Michael|title=Tropical savannah woodland: effects of experimental fire on soil microorganisms and soil emissions of carbon dioxide|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=5 May 2014|volume=36|issue=5|pages=849–858|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2004.01.015|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071704000513|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain species of fungi, such as ''Cylindrocarpon destructans'' appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit re-population of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Widden|first1=P|title=The effects of a forest fire on soil microfungi|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=March 1975|volume=7|issue=2|pages=125–138|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(75)90010-3.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire and ecological succession==
Fire behavior is different in every ecosystem and the organisms in those ecosystems have adapted accordingly. One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to those that have been untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of [[ecological succession]] in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire.&lt;ref name="Begon1996p692"&gt;Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg. 692&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing [[herbaceous]] plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants.&lt;ref name="Begon1996p700"&gt;Begon ''et al.'' 1996, pg 700&lt;/ref&gt; Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"&gt;Keddy 2007, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting different stages in this process of succession, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape. Soil characteristics will be a factor in determining the specific nature of a fire-adapted ecosystem, as will climate and topography.

Mild to moderate fires burn in the [[forest]] [[understory]], removing small trees and herbaceous [[groundcover]]. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns of the trees and kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates [[complex early seral forest]] habitat, or [[snag forest]] with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as [[climate]] and [[topography]] play an important role in determining fire severity and fire extent.&lt;ref name="BeatyTaylor2001"&gt;Beaty and Taylor (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing.

====Forests in British Columbia====
In [[Canada]], forests cover about 10% of the land area and yet harbor 70% of the country’s bird and terrestrial mammal species. Natural fire regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of [[vertebrate]] species in up to twelve different forest types in [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Bunnell1995"&gt;Bunnell (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the initial fire, such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are able to use the burned areas.&lt;ref name="Bunnell1995" /&gt;

===Shrublands===
[[File:2011-08-04 20 00 00 Susie Fire in the Adobe Range west of Elko Nevada.jpg|thumb|Lightning-sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences on shrublands and grasslands in [[Nevada]].]]
[[Shrub]] fires typically concentrate in the canopy and spread continuously if the shrubs are close enough together. [[Shrubland]]s are typically dry and are prone to accumulations of highly volatile fuels, especially on hillsides. Fires will follow the path of least moisture and the greatest amount of dead fuel material. Surface and below-ground soil temperatures during a burn are generally higher than those of forest fires because the centers of combustion lie closer to the ground, although this can vary greatly.&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; Common plants in shrubland or chaparral include [[manzanita]], [[Adenostoma fasciculatum|chamise]] and [[Coyote Brush]].

====California shrublands====
California shrubland, commonly known as [[chaparral]], is a widespread plant community of low growing species, typically on arid sloping areas of the [[California Coast Ranges]] or western foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. There are a number of common shrubs and tree shrub forms in this association, including [[salal]], [[toyon]], [[Rhamnus californica|coffeeberry]] and [[Western poison oak]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 "Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721044257/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 |date=July 21, 2009 }}, GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Strömberg&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration following a fire is usually a major factor in the association of these species.

====South African Fynbos shrublands====
[[Fynbos]] shrublands occur in a small belt across [[South Africa]]. The plant species in this ecosystem are highly diverse, yet the majority of these species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have [[Coevolution|coevolved]] into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils.&lt;ref name="Wisheu2000"&gt;Wisheu ''et al.'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid [[evolution]] and [[speciation]] in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.&lt;ref name="Wisheu2000" /&gt;

===Grasslands===
[[Grasslands]] burn more readily than forest and shrub ecosystems, with the fire moving through the stems and leaves of herbaceous plants and only lightly heating the underlying soil, even in cases of high intensity. In most grassland ecosystems, fire is the primary mode of [[decomposition]], making it crucial in the [[nutrient cycle|recycling of nutrients]].&lt;ref name="DeBano1998"/&gt; It has been hypthesized that fire only recently became the primary mode of decomposition in many grassland ecosystems after the removal or extinction of large migratory herds of browsing or grazing megafauna driven by predator pressure. In this view, in the absence of functional communities of large migratory herds of herbivorous megafauna and attendant predators, overuse of fire to maintain grassland ecosystems may lead to excessive oxidation, loss of carbon, and desertification in susceptible climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961894493|title=Holistic management : a commonsense revolution to restore our environment|last1=Savory|first1=Allan|last2=Butterfield|first2=Jody|isbn=9781610917438|edition=Third|location=Washington|oclc=961894493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South African savanna====
In the [[savanna]] of [[South Africa]], recently burned areas have new growth that provides palatable and nutritious forage compared to older, tougher grasses. This new forage attracts large [[herbivores]] from areas of unburned and grazed grassland that has been kept short by constant grazing. On these unburned "lawns", only those plant species adapted to heavy grazing are able to persist; but the distraction provided by the newly burned areas allows grazing-intolerant grasses to grow back into the lawns that have been temporarily abandoned, so allowing these species to persist within that ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Archibald2005"&gt;Archibald et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longleaf pine savannas===
[[image:Sarracenia Flava JPG01.jpg|thumb|100px|Yellow pitcher plant is dependent upon recurring fire in coastal plain savannas and flatwoods.]]
Much of the southeastern United States was once open [[longleaf pine]] forest with a rich understory of grasses, sedges, carnivorous plants and orchids. The above maps shows that these ecosystems (coded as pale blue) had the highest fire frequency of any habitat, once per decade or less. Without fire, deciduous forest trees invade, and their shade eliminates both the pines and the understory.  Some of the typical plants associated with fire include [[Sarracenia flava|Yellow Pitcher Plant]] and [[Pogonia ophioglossoides|Rose pogonia]]. The abundance and diversity of such plants is closely related to fire frequency. Rare animals such as [[gopher tortoise]]s and [[indigo snake]]s also depend upon these open grasslands and [[flatwoods]].&lt;ref&gt;Means, D. Bruce. 2006. Vertebrate faunal diversity in longleaf pine savannas.  Pages 155-213 in S. Jose, E. Jokela and D. Miller (eds.) Longleaf Pine Ecosystems: Ecology, Management and Restoration.  Springer, New York. xii + 438 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the restoration of fire is a priority to maintain species composition and biological diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Peet, R. K. and Allard, D. J. (1993).

Hermann, pp. 45–81. Tallahassee, FL: Tall Timbers Research Station.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire in wetlands===
Although it may seem strange, many kinds of wetlands are also influenced by fire. This usually occurs during periods of drought.  In landscapes with peat soils, such as bogs, the peat substrate itself may burn, leaving holes that refill with water as new ponds. Fires that are less intense will remove accumulated litter and allow other wetland plants to regenerate from buried seeds, or from rhizomes.  Wetlands that are influenced by fire include [[coastal marsh]]es, wet prairies, [[peat bog]]s, [[floodplain]]s, prairie marshes and [[flatwoods]].&lt;ref name="Keddy 2010"&gt;Keddy 2010, p. 114-120.&lt;/ref&gt; Since wetlands can store large amounts of carbon in peat, the fire frequency of vast northern peatlands is linked to processes controlling the carbon dioxide levels of the atmosphere, and to the phenomenon of global warming.&lt;ref name="Vitt  2010"&gt;Vitt et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire suppression==
{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}
Fire serves many important functions within fire-adapted ecosystems. Fire plays an important role in nutrient cycling, diversity maintenance and habitat structure. The suppression of fire can lead to unforeseen changes in ecosystems that often adversely affect the plants, animals and humans that depend upon that habitat. Wildfires that deviate from a historical fire regime because of fire suppression are called "uncharacteristic fires".

===Chaparral communities===
In 2003, southern [[California]] witnessed powerful [[chaparral]] wildfires. Hundreds of homes and hundreds of thousands of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads,&lt;ref name="Minnich1983"&gt;Minnich 1983&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case.&lt;ref name="Keeley1999"&gt;Keeley ''et al.'' 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

One consequence of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of [[invasive species|invasive]] and [[introduced species|non-native]] plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those that had already been burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs in these communities are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the [[selective pressure]]s on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that are better able to exploit the novel post-fire conditions.&lt;ref name="Keeley2005"&gt;Keeley ''et al.'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish impacts===
The [[Boise National Forest]] is a US national forest located north and east of the city of [[Boise, Idaho]]. Following several uncharacteristically large wildfires, an immediately negative impact on fish populations was observed, posing particular danger to small and isolated fish populations.&lt;ref name="Burton2005"&gt;Burton (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In the long term, however, fire appears to rejuvenate fish habitats by causing [[hydraulic]] changes that increase flooding and lead to [[silt]] removal and the deposition of a favorable habitat substrate. This leads to larger post-fire populations of the fish that are able to recolonize these improved areas.&lt;ref name="Burton2005" /&gt; But although fire generally appears favorable for fish populations in these ecosystems, the more intense effects of uncharacteristic wildfires, in combination with the fragmentation of populations by human barriers to dispersal such as weirs and dams, ''will'' pose a threat to fish populations.

==Fire as a management tool==
[[Restoration ecology]] is the name given to an attempt to reverse or mitigate some of the changes that humans have caused to an ecosystem. [[Controlled burn]]ing is one tool that is currently receiving considerable attention as a means of restoration and management. Applying fire to an ecosystem may create habitats for species that have been negatively impacted by fire suppression, or fire may be used as a way of controlling invasive species without resorting to herbicides or pesticides. However, there is debate as to what state managers should aim to restore their ecosystems to, especially as to whether "natural" means pre-human or pre-European. [[Native American use of fire]], not natural fires, historically maintained the diversity of the [[Pre-Columbian savannas of North America|savannas of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/heritage/docum/Fire/Bibliography%20-%20Indian%20Use%20of%20Fire.pdf|title=REFERENCES ON THE AMERICAN INDIAN USE OF FIRE IN ECOSYSTEMS|last=Williams|first=Gerald W.|date=2003-06-12|accessdate=2008-07-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160607/http://www.blm.gov/heritage/docum/Fire/Bibliography%20-%20Indian%20Use%20of%20Fire.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When, how, and where managers should use fire as a management tool is a subject of debate.

===The Great Plains shortgrass prairie===
{{details|Shortgrass prairie}}
A combination of heavy livestock grazing and fire-suppression has drastically altered the structure, composition, and diversity of the shortgrass prairie ecosystem on the [[Great Plains]], allowing woody species to dominate many areas and promoting fire-intolerant invasive species. In semi-arid ecosystems where the decomposition of woody material is slow, fire is crucial for returning nutrients to the soil and allowing the grasslands to maintain their high productivity.

Although fire can occur during the growing or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most effective at increasing the grass and [[forb]] cover, [[biodiversity]] and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies.&lt;ref name="Brockwayet"&gt;Brockway et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire if they want to restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive [[spotted knapweed]] (''Centaurea maculosa'') on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.&lt;ref&gt;Emery and Gross (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed conifer forests in the US Sierra Nevada===
Mixed [[conifer]] forests in the United States [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] used to have fire return intervals that ranged from 5 years up to 300 years, depending on the local climate. Lower elevations had more frequent fire return intervals, whilst higher and wetter elevations saw much longer intervals between fires. Native Americans tended to set fires during fall and winter, and land at a higher elevation was generally occupied by Native Americans only during the summer.&lt;ref name="Anderson1996"&gt;{{Cite book|last=ANDERSON|first=M.

=== Finnish boreal forests ===
The decline of habitat area and quality has caused many species populations to be red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to a study on forest management of Finnish boreal forests, improving the habitat quality of areas outside reserves can help in conservation efforts of endangered deadwood-dependent beetles. These beetles and various types of fungi both need dead trees in order to survive. Old growth forests can provide this particular habitat. However, most Fennoscandian boreal forested areas are used for timber and therefore are unprotected. The use of controlled burning and tree retention of a forested area with deadwood was studied and its effect on the endangered beetles. The study found that after the first year of management the number of species increased in abundance and richness compared to pre-fire treatment. The abundance of beetles continued to increase the following year in sites where tree retention was high and deadwood was abundant. The correlation between forest fire management and increased beetle populations shows a key to conserving these red-listed species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyvarinen|first1=Esko|last2=Kouki|first2=Jari|last3=Martikainen|first3=Petri|title=Fire and Green-Tree Retention in Conservation of Red-Listed and Rare Deadwood-Dependent Beetles in Finnish Boreal Forests|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 February 2006|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1711–1719|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00511.x|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=aee65b99-0f41-4054-a741-ff200aca6310%40sessionmgr105&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=110|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian eucalypt forests===
Much of the old growth eucalypt forest in Australia is designated for conservation. Management of these forests is important because species like ''Eucalyptus grandis'' rely on fire to survive. There are a few eucalypt species that do not have a [[lignotuber]], a root swelling structure that contains buds where new shoots can then sprout. During a fire a lignotuber is helpful in the reestablishment of the plant. Because some eucalypts do not have this particular mechanism, forest fire management can be helpful by creating rich soil, killing competitors, and allowing seeds to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tng|first1=David Y. P.|last2=Goosem|first2=Steve|last3=Jordan|first3=Greg J.|last4=Bowman|first4=David M.J.S.|title=Letting giants be - rethinking active fire management of old-growth eucalypt forest in the Australian tropics|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|date=2014|volume=51|pages=555–559|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12233|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2f35e2f6-ed9f-4aa9-9846-8e72e1870104%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=110|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management policies==

===United States===
Fire [[policy]] in the United States involves the federal government, individual state governments, tribal governments, interest groups, and the general public. The new federal outlook on fire policy parallels advances in ecology and is moving towards the view that many ecosystems depend on disturbance for their diversity and for the proper maintenance of their natural processes. Although human safety is still the number one priority in fire management, new US government objectives include a long-term view of ecosystems. The newest policy allows managers to gauge the relative values of private property and resources in particular situations and to set their priorities accordingly.&lt;ref name="USDAFS"/&gt;

One of the primary goals in fire management is to improve public education in order to suppress the "[[Smokey Bear]]" fire-suppression mentality and introduce the public to the benefits of regular natural fires.

Hash fossils are not actually one [[fossil]], they are many fossils in the same [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. The term hash fossil describes the fossil formed when all the [[organic material]] in an environment falls to the ocean floor and fossilizes, hence the name "[[wikt:hash|hash]]". When you look at a hash fossil, you actually are looking at a piece of ancient [[seabed]]. In hash fossils you can usually find the pieces of [[coral]]s, [[crinoid]]s, [[bryzoan]]s, and [[brachiopod]]s. Also you can rarely find a piece of a [[trilobite]].  Hash fossils are very common, and are most easily found in limestone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2714">In [[theoretical physics]], '''G-parity''' is a [[multiplicative quantum number]] that results from the generalization of [[C-parity]] to [[multiplet]]s of particles.

''C''-parity applies only to neutral systems; in the [[pion]] triplet, only π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; has ''C''-parity. On the other hand, [[strong interaction]] does not see [[electrical charge]], so it cannot distinguish amongst π&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, π&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and π&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;. We can generalize the ''C''-parity so it applies to all charge states of a given multiplet: 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal G \begin{pmatrix} \pi^+ \\ \pi^0 \\ \pi^- \end{pmatrix} = 
\eta_G \begin{pmatrix} \pi^+ \\ \pi^0 \\ \pi^- \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;		 	
where ''η&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ±1 are the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''G''-parity. The ''G''-parity operator is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal G = \mathcal C \, e^{(i \pi I_2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; is the ''C''-parity operator, and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the operator associated with the 2nd component of the [[isospin]] "vector". ''G''-parity is a combination of [[charge conjugation]] and a [[Pi|π]] [[radian|rad]] (180°) rotation around the 2nd axis of isospin space. Given that charge conjugation and isospin are preserved by strong interactions, so is ''G''. Weak and electromagnetic interactions, though, are not invariant under ''G''-parity. 

Since ''G''-parity is applied on a whole multiplet, charge conjugation has to see the multiplet as a neutral entity. Thus, only multiplets with an average charge of 0 will be eigenstates of ''G'', that is 

:&lt;math&gt; \bar Q = \bar B = \bar Y = 0&lt;/math&gt; 

(see [[electrical charge|Q]], [[baryon number|B]], [[hypercharge|Y]]). 

In general
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_G = \eta_C \, (-1)^I&lt;/math&gt;
where ''η&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a ''C''-parity eigenvalue, and ''I'' is the isospin. For [[fermion|fermion-antifermion]] systems, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_G = (-1)^{S + L + I}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
where ''S'' is the total [[spin (physics)|spin]], ''L'' the total orbital [[angular momentum quantum number]]. For [[boson|boson–antiboson]] systems we have 
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_G = (-1)^{L + I}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Doping in sport sidebar|expanded=Substances and types}}

'''Gene doping''' is the hypothetical non-therapeutic use of [[gene therapy]] by athletes in order to improve their performance in those sporting events which prohibit such applications of genetic modification technology,&lt;ref name="PEDs in sports review" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Anti-Doping Agency [https://web.archive.org/web/20071030051804/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/2008_List_En.pdf The World Anti-Doping Code: The 2008 Prohibited List of International Standards] pages 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; and for reasons other than the treatment of disease. {{As of|April 2015}}, there is no evidence that gene doping has been used for athletic performance-enhancement in any sporting events.&lt;ref name="PEDs in sports review" /&gt; Gene doping would involve the use of [[Transfection#Methods|gene transfer]] to increase or decrease [[gene expression]] and [[protein biosynthesis]] of a specific human protein; this could be done by directly injecting the gene carrier into the person, or by taking cells from the person, transfecting the cells, and administering the cells back to the person.&lt;ref name="PEDs in sports review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Momaya A, Fawal M, Estes R | title = Performance-enhancing substances in sports: a review of the literature | journal = Sports Med. | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 517–531 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25663250 | doi = 10.1007/s40279-015-0308-9 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical development of interest in gene doping by athletes and concern about the risks of gene doping and how to detect it moved in parallel with the development of the field of gene therapy, especially with the publication in 1998 of work on a [[transgenic mouse]] overexpressing [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] that was much stronger than normal mice, even in old age, preclinical studies published in 2002 of a way to deliver [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) via gene therapy, and publication in 2004 of the creation of a "marathon mouse" with much greater endurance than normal mice, created by delivering the gene expressing [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPAR gamma]] to the mice. The scientists generating these publications were all contacted directly by athletes and coaches seeking access to the technology.  The public became aware of that activity in 2006 when such efforts were part of the evidence presented in the trial of a German coach.

Scientists themselves, as well as bodies including the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA), the [[International Olympic Committee]], and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], started discussing the risk of gene doping in 2001, and by 2003 WADA had added gene doping to the list of banned doping practices, and shortly thereafter began funding research on methods to detect gene doping.

Genetic enhancement includes manipulation of genes or [[gene transfer]] by healthy athletes for the purpose of physically improving their performance. Genetic enhancement includes gene doping and has potential for abuse among athletes, all while opening the door to political and ethical controversy.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;Wells DJ. 2008. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2439520&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract "Gene doping: the hype and the reality"]. Br. J. Pharmacol. [Internet] 154:623–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of concern about the potential for gene doping follows the [[Gene therapy#History|history of gene therapy]], the medical use of genes to treat diseases, which was first clinically tested in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt;  Interest by the athletic community was especially spurred by the creation in a university lab of a "mighty mouse", created by administering a virus carrying the gene expressing [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] to mice; the mice were stronger and remained strong even as they aged, without exercise.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt; The lab had been seeking treatments for [[Muscle atrophy|muscle wasting]] diseases, but when their work was made public, the lab was inundated with calls from athletes seeking the treatment, with one coach offering his whole team.&lt;ref name =NYT&gt;Gretchen Reynolds for The New York Times. June 3, 2007. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/sports/playmagazine/0603play-hot.html?_r=0 Outlaw DNA]&lt;/ref&gt; The scientist told ''The New York Times'' in 2007:  "I was quite surprised, I must admit.  People would try to entice me, saying things like, 'It'll help advance your research.' Some offered to pay me."  He also told the ''Times'' that every time similar research is published he gets calls and that he explains that, even should the treatment became ready for use in people, which would take years, there would be serious risks, including death; he also said that even after he explains this, the athletes still want it.&lt;ref name =NYT/&gt;

In 1999, the field of gene therapy was set back when [[Jesse Gelsinger]] died in a gene therapy clinical trial, suffering a massive inflammatory reaction to the drug.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt; This led regulatory authorities in the US and Europe to increase safety requirements in clinical trials even beyond the initial restrictions that had been put in place at the beginning of the biotechnology era to deal with the risks of [[recombinant DNA]].&lt;ref name=GeneDoping2013rev/&gt;

In June 2001, Theodore Friedmann, one of the pioneers of gene therapy, and [[Johann Olav Koss]] an Olympic gold medallist in speed skating, published a paper that was the first public warning about gene doping.&lt;ref name=GeneDoping2013rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 11407894 |url=http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v3/n6/pdf/mt2001106a.pdf|year=2001|last1=Friedmann|first1=T|title=Gene transfer and athletics- an impending problem|journal=Molecular Therapy|volume=3|issue=6|pages=819–20|last2=Koss|first2=J. O.|doi=10.1006/mthe.2001.0347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June 2001, a Gene Therapy Working Group, convened by the Medical Commission of the International Olympic Committee noted that "we are aware that there is the potential for abuse of gene therapy medicines and we shall begin to establish procedures and state-of-the-art testing methods for identifying athletes who might misuse such technology".&lt;ref name=GeneDoping2013rev/&gt;

Research was published in 2002 about a preclinical gene therapy called [[Repoxygen]], which delivered the gene encoding  [[erythropoietin]] (EPO) as a potential treatment for [[anemia]].&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt;  The scientists from that company also received calls from athletes and coaches.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt;  In that same year the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] held its first meeting to discuss the risk of gene doping,&lt;ref name=GeneDoping2013rev/&gt;&lt;ref name ="WADA"/&gt; and the US [[The President's Council on Bioethics]] discussed gene doping in the context of [[human enhancement]] at several sessions.&lt;ref&gt;President's Council on Bioethics [https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcbe/transcripts/apr02/index.html April 25-26, 2002 Agenda, [https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcbe/background/workpaper7.html Working Paper 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;President's Council on Bioethics [https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcbe/transcripts/jul02/index.html July 11-12, 2002 Meeting Agenda] [https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcbe/transcripts/jul02/session4.html Session 4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;President's Council on Bioethics [https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcbe/transcripts/sep02/index.html September 12-13, 2002  Meeting Agenda] [https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcbe/transcripts/sep02/session7.html  Session 7: Enhancement 5: Genetic Enhancement of Muscle],  H. Lee Sweeney, Ph.D., Professor and Chairman of Physiology, University of Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the field of gene therapy took a step forward and a step back; first gene therapy drug was approved, [[Gendicine]], which was approved in China for the treatment of certain cancers,&lt;ref name="Gend"&gt;{{cite journal|title=China approves first gene therapy|journal=Nature Biotechnology|year=2004|volume=22|issue=1|pages=3–4|doi=10.1038/nbt0104-3|pmid=14704685|last1=Pearson|first1=Sue|last2=Jia|first2=Hepeng|last3=Kandachi|first3=Keiko}}&lt;/ref&gt; but children in France who had seemingly been effective treated with gene therapy for [[severe combined immunodeficiency (non-human)]] began developing leukemia.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;  In 2003 the [[BALCO scandal]] became public, in which chemists, trainers and athletes conspired to evade doping controls with new and undetectable doping substances.&lt;ref name=GeneDoping2013rev/&gt;  In 2003 the World Doping Agency proactively added gene doping to the list of banned doping practices.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt; Also in 2003, a symposium convened by the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] focused on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;UCSD Public Relations: February 18, 2003 [http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/friedmann0218.htm News Release: Bigger, Faster, Stronger: Genetic Enhancement and Athletics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2004 showing that mice given gene therapy coding for a protein called [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPAR gamma]] had about double the endurance of untreated mice and were dubbed "marathon mice"; those scientists received calls from athletes and coaches.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt;  Also in 2004 the World Anti-Doping Agency began to fund research to detect gene doping, and formed a permanent expert panel to advise it on risks and to guide the funding.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt;&lt;ref name ="WADA"/&gt;

In 2006 interest from athletes in gene doping received widespread media coverage due its mention during the trial of a German coach who was accused and found guilty of giving his athletes [[performance enhancing drugs]] without their knowledge; an email in which the coach attempted to obtain Repoxygen was read in open court by a prosecutor.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt;&lt;ref name =NYT/&gt; This was the first public disclosure that athletes were interested in gene doping.&lt;ref name=Barry2008/&gt;

In 2011 the second gene therapy drug was approved; [[Neovasculgen]], which delivers the gene encoding [[VEGF]], was approved in Russia to treat [[peripheral artery disease]].&lt;ref&gt;AdisInsight [http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800041695 Vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy - HSCI] Page accessed June 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neuvasculgen"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gene Therapy for PAD Approved|url=http://www.dddmag.com/news/2011/12/gene-therapy-pad-approved|accessdate=5 August 2015|date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Glybera]], a treatment for a rare [[inherited disorder]], became the first treatment to be approved for clinical use in either Europe or the United States.&lt;ref name=Richards2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Sabrina|title=Gene Therapy Arrives in Europe|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33166/title/Gene-Therapy-Arrives-in-Europe/|work=The Scientist|date=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;Gallagher, James.

As the field of gene therapy has developed, the risk of gene doping becoming a reality has increased with it.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;

== Agents ==
There are numerous genes of interest as agents for gene doping.&lt;ref name="PEDs in sports review" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Birzniece2015&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=25369881|year=2015|last1=Birzniece|first1=V|title=Doping in sport: Effects, harm and misconceptions|journal=Internal Medicine Journal|volume=45|issue=3|pages=239–48|doi=10.1111/imj.12629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GeneDoping2013rev&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 23322893|year= 2013|last1= Van Der Gronde|first1= T|title= Gene doping: An overview and current implications for athletes|journal= British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume= 47|issue= 11|pages= 670–8|last2= De Hon|first2= O|last3= Haisma|first3= H.

The risks of gene doping would be similar to those of gene therapy: immune reaction to the native protein leading to the equivalent of an [[genetic disease]], massive inflammatory response, cancer, and death, and in all cases, these risks would be undertaken for short-term gain as opposed to treating a serious disease.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=GeneDoping2013rev/&gt;

[[ACTN3|Alpha-actinin-3]] is found only in [[skeletal muscle]] in humans, and has been identified in several genetic studies as having a different [[Genetic polymorphism|polymorphism]] in world-class athletes compared with normal people.  One form that causes the gene to make more protein is found in sprinters and is related to increased power; another form that causes the gene to make less protein is found in endurance athletes.&lt;ref name=Birzniece2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=2016revGenetics/&gt;  Gene doping agents could be designed with either polymorphism, or for endurance athletes, some DNA construct that interfered with expression like a [[small interfering RNA]].&lt;ref name=Birzniece2015/&gt;

=== Myostatin ===
{{see also|Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy}}
[[Myostatin]] is a [[protein]] responsible for inhibiting [[muscle]] differentiation and growth.  Removing the myostatin [[gene]] or otherwise limiting its [[gene expression|expression]] leads to an increase in muscle size and power.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;  This has been demonstrated in [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] lacking the gene that were dubbed "[[Schwarzenegger]] mice".&lt;ref name="DopInSport"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://biologyofexercise.com/images/issues/51.pdf|doi=10.4127/jbe.2009.0021|title=Gene doping in modern sport|journal=Journal Biology of Exercise|volume=5|year=2009|last1=Cieszczyk|first1=Pawel|last2=MacIejewska|first2=Agnieszka|last3=Sawczuk|first3=Marek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans born with defective genes can also serve as "knockout models"; a German boy with a mutation in both copies of the myostatin gene was born with well-developed muscles.&lt;ref name="Haisma"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=6572366|pmc=393457|year=1983|last1=Gavish|first1=B|title=Adiabatic compressibility of globular proteins|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=80|issue=3|pages=750–4|last2=Gratton|first2=E|last3=Hardy|first3=C. J.|doi=10.1073/pnas.80.3.750}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The advanced muscle growth continued after birth, and the boy could lift weights of 3&amp;nbsp;kg at the age of 4.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt; In work published in 2009, scientists administered [[follistatin]]  via gene therapy to the quadriceps of non-human primates, resulting in local muscle growth similar to the mice.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;

=== Erythropoietin (EPO) ===
[[Erythropoietin]] is a [[glycoprotein]] that acts as a [[hormone]], controlling red blood cell production. Athletes have injected the EPO protein as a [[performance-enhancing substance]] for many years ([[blood doping]]). When the additional EPO increases the production of red blood cells in circulation, this increases the amount of oxygen available to muscle, enhancing an athlete's endurance.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=3731603|year=2012|last1=Gould|first1=D|title=Gene doping: Gene delivery for olympic victory|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=76|issue=2|pages=292–298|doi=10.1111/bcp.12010|pmid=23082866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 16180943|year= 2005|last1= Diamanti-Kandarakis|first1= E|title= Erythropoietin abuse and erythropoietin gene doping: Detection strategies in the genomic era|journal= Sports Medicine|volume= 35|issue= 10|pages= 831–40|last2= Konstantinopoulos|first2= P.

P.|doi=10.2165/00007256-200535100-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies suggest it may be possible to introduce another EPO gene into an animal in order to increase EPO production [[endogenous]]ly.&lt;ref name="Haisma"/&gt;  EPO genes have been successfully inserted into mice and [[monkey]]s, and were found to increase [[hematocrit]]s by as much as 80 percent in those animals.&lt;ref name="Haisma"/&gt;  However, the endogenous and [[transgene]] derived EPO elicited [[autoimmune]] responses in some animals in the form of severe [[anemia]].&lt;ref name="Haisma"/&gt;

=== Insulin-like growth factor 1 ===
[[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] is a protein involved in the mediation of the [[growth hormone]]. Administration of IGF-1 to mice has resulted in more muscle growth and quicker muscle and nerve regeneration.&lt;ref name=Birzniece2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt; If athletes were to use this the sustained production of IGF-1 could cause heart disease and cancer.&lt;ref name=Birzniece2015/&gt;

===Others===
Modulating the levels of proteins that affect psychology are also potential goals for gene doping; for example pain perception depends on [[endorphins]] and [[enkephalins]],  response to stress depends on [[BDNF]], and an increase in synthesis of [[Monoamine neurotransmitter|monamines]] could improve the mood of athletes.&lt;ref name=Birzniece2015/&gt;  [[Preproenkephalin]] has been administered via gene therapy using a replication-deficient [[herpes simplex virus]], which targets nerves, to mice with results good enough to justify a Phase I clinical trial in people with terminal cancer with uncontrolled pain.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt; Adopting that approach for athletes would be problematic since the pain deadening would likely be permanent.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;

[[VEGF]] has been tested in clinical trials to increase blood flow and has been considered as a potential gene doping agent; however long term follow up of the clinical trial subjects showed poor results.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;  The same is true of [[fibroblast growth factor]].&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt; [[Glucagon-like peptide-1]] increases the amount of [[glucose]] in the liver and has been administered via gene therapy to the livers of mouse models of diabetes and was shown to increase [[gluconeogenesis]]' for athletes this would make more energy available and reduce the buildup of [[lactic acid]].&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;

== Detection ==
The [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) is the main [[regulation|regulatory]] organization looking into the issue of the detection of gene doping.&lt;ref name ="WADA"&gt;World Anti Doping Agency. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160107013459/https://www.wada-ama.org/en/gene-doping Gene Doping] Page archived January 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Both direct and indirect testing methods are being researched by the organization. Directly detecting the use of gene therapy usually requires the discovery of [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant proteins]] or gene insertion [[Vector (molecular biology)|vectors]], while most indirect methods involve examining the athlete in an attempt to detect bodily changes or structural differences between [[endogenous]] and recombinant proteins.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brazil"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=22030863 |url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjmbr/v44n12/1177.pdf|year=2011|last1=Oliveira|first1=R.

Indirect methods are by nature more subjective, as it becomes very difficult to determine which anomalies are proof of gene doping, and which are simply natural, though unusual, biological properties.&lt;ref name=GouldRev2013/&gt;  For example, [[Eero Mäntyranta]], an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Cross-country skiing|cross country skier]], had a mutation which made his body produce abnormally high amounts of red blood cells.  It would be very difficult to determine whether or not Mäntyranta's red blood cell levels were due to an innate genetic advantage, or an artificial one.&lt;ref name = "SciAm"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sweeney | first1 = H.L. | year = 2004 | title = Gene Doping | url =https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gene-doping/ | journal = Scientific American | volume = | issue = | pages = 63–69|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113090004/http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=000E7ACE-5686-10CF-94EB83414B7F0000|archivedate=13 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A 2016 review found that about 120 DNA polymorphisms had been identified in the literature related to some aspect of athletic performance, 77 related to endurance and 43 related to power.  11 had been replicated in three or more studies and six were identified in [[genome-wide association studies]], but 29 had not been replicated in at least one study.&lt;ref name=2016revGenetics&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 26231489|id=review|year=2015|last1=Ahmetov|first1=I.

* [[RBFOX1]] rs7191721 G
* [[TSHR]] rs7144481 C

== Ethics ==
The [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) determined that non therapeutic form of genetic manipulation for enhancement of athletic performance is not allowed in sport. The WADA code implemented guidelines to determine if said technology should be prohibited in sport. If two of the three conditions are met, then the technology is prohibited in sport; harmful to one's health, performance enhancing, and/or against the "spirit of sport".&lt;ref name=Miah&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miah|first1=A|title=Rethinking enhancement in sport.|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=December 2006|volume=1093|pages=301–20|doi=10.1196/annals.1382.020|pmid=17312265}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high risks associated with gene therapy can be outweighed by the potential save the lives of individuals with diseases. According to Alain Fischer, who was involved in clinical trials of gene therapy in children with [[severe combined immunodeficiency]], "Only people who are dying would have reasonable grounds for using it. Using gene therapy for doping is ethically unacceptable and scientifically stupid."&lt;ref name=Filipp2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Filipp|first1=F|title=Is science killing sport? Gene therapy and its possible abuse in doping.|journal=EMBO Reports|date=May 2007|volume=8|issue=5|pages=433–5|pmid=17471256|pmc=1866212|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As seen with past cases, including the steroid tetrahydrogestrinone [[Tetrahydrogestrinone|THG]], athletes may choose to incorporate risky genetic technologies into their training regimes.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;

The mainstream perspective is that gene doping is dangerous and unethical, as is any application of a therapeutic intervention for non-therapeutic or enhancing purposes, and that it compromises the ethical foundation of medicine and the spirit of sport.&lt;ref name=Barry2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barry|first1=Patrick|title=Finding the Golden Genes|journal=Science News|date=2008|volume=174|issue=3|pages=16–21|jstor=20494726|doi=10.1002/scin.2008.5591740321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kayser | first1 = B. | last2 = Mauron | first2 = A. | last3 = Miah | first3 = A. | title = Current anti-doping policy: A critical appraisal | doi = 10.1186/1472-6939-8-2 | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 8 | pages = 2 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17394662| pmc =1851967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FriedmannSci2010&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/migrate/uploads/Science-2010-Friedmann-647-8.pdf|pmid= 20133558|year= 2010|last1= Friedmann|first1= T|title= Ethics.

'''''Genius by Stephen Hawking''''' is a television series aired on [[PBS]] hosted by [[Stephen Hawking]]. It premiered on May 18, 2016 and ended on June 1, 2016, with only one season being produced before Hawking's death in 2018.

==Premise==
''Genius by Stephen Hawking'' is a series that first aired on [[PBS]] on Wednesdays, from May 18 to June 1, 2016. Professor Stephen Hawking challenges volunteers to think like geniuses and solve some of humanity's most enduring questions. ''What, Why, Where, are We'' (as in humanity) are covered, as well as ''Are We Alone'' and ''Can We Time Travel''. Generally three volunteers with these questions are followed as they try to find the answers to their questions. The idea is to teach the volunteers and watchers how to think like a genius. All are G-rated TV hour episodes originally aired in pairs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="120102">[[Image:Wooden hourglass 3.jpg|upright|thumb|An [[hourglass]] keeping track of elapsed time. The hourglass was one of the earlier timekeeping devices and has become a symbol of the concept of time.]]
For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track of [[time]]. The current [[sexagesimal]] [[Numeral system|system]] of time [[systems of measurement|measurement]] dates to approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|{{sc|bc}}]]&lt;!--See talk page--&gt; from the  [[Sumer]]ians.

The  Egyptians divided the day into two 12-hour periods, and used large [[obelisk]]s to track the movement of the [[sun]]. They also developed [[water clock]]s, which were probably first used in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], and later outside Egypt as well; they were employed frequently by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who called them ''clepsydrae''. The [[Zhou dynasty]] is believed to have used the outflow water clock around the same time, devices which were introduced from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2000{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.

Other ancient timekeeping devices include the [[candle clock]], used in [[ancient China]], [[ancient Japan]], [[England]] and Mesopotamia; the [[Sundial#Shepherd dials – Timesticks|timestick]], widely used in [[India]] and [[Tibet]], as well as some parts of [[Europe]]; and the [[hourglass]], which functioned similarly to a water clock.  The [[sundial]], another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.  It is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the [[gnomon]] was not aligned with the [[Earth's axis]]).

The earliest known clock with a [[water-power]]ed [[escapement]] mechanism, which transferred [[rotational energy]] into intermittent motions,&lt;ref name="Samual l. Jackson 18f."&gt;David Landes: "Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World", rev. and enlarged edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2000, {{ISBN|0-674-00282-2}}, p.18f.&lt;/ref&gt; dates back to 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} in [[ancient Greece]];&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=343–369 (356f.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science and technology in China|Chinese engineers]] later invented clocks incorporating [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century,&lt;ref name="needham 411"/&gt; followed by [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Iranian engineers]] inventing water clocks driven by [[gear]]s and [[Maintaining power|weights]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Hassan/&gt;

The first [[mechanical clock]]s, employing the [[verge escapement]] mechanism with a [[Balance wheel|foliot]] or [[balance wheel]] timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the [[pendulum clock]] was invented in 1656.  The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.

The pendulum clock remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when [[quartz oscillator]]s were invented, followed by [[atomic clock]]s after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of [[microelectronics]] in the 1960s made [[quartz clock]]s both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and [[wristwatch]]es.

Atomic clocks are far more accurate than any previous timekeeping device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the [[International Atomic Time]]; a [[standardized]] civil system, [[Coordinated Universal Time]], is based on atomic time.

Egyptian shadow clocks divided [[Daytime (astronomy)|daytime]] into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts.&lt;ref name="One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt"/&gt; One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon.&lt;!--Why?--&gt; Obelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice|winter]] [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref name=bruton/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |work=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=2 April 2008 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080315060613/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html| archivedate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, was similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]]. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The ''T'' was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at [[noon]], so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;Barnett, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/hourglass.html |title= How does an hourglass measure time? |accessdate=31 March 2008|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Berlev, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings on the side of the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of [[pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep I]] (1525–1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbin, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using [[Plumb-bob|plumb-lines]] called [[merkhet]]s. In use since at least 600{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, two of these instruments were aligned with [[Polaris]], the north [[pole star]], to create a north–south [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the ''merkhets''.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"&gt;Whitrow, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a [[siphon]]. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm.&lt;ref name=answers.com /&gt; The Greeks and [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]] regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer, [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]], supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.
[[File:Aerides Athens 2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Tower of the Winds]] in [[Athens]], Greece, a 1st-century-BC [[clocktower]] from the period of [[Roman Greece]]]]
In Greek tradition, clepsydrae were used in [[court]]; later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted this practice, as well. There are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Plato]] says that "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on".&lt;ref name="Water clocks in court"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H8YOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook|last=Humphrey|first=John William|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=518–519|accessdate=11 April 2008|isbn=0-415-06136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mention occurs in [[Lucius Apuleius]]' ''[[The Golden Ass]]'': "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief witness for the prosecution to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transformations of Lucius, Otherwise Known as The Golden Ass|last=Apuleius|first=Lucius|others=Translated by Robert Graves|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|year=1951|page=54|authorlink3=Apuleius|isbn=0-374-50532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.&lt;ref name="Waterclockhistory"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rees, Abraham |title=Rees's clocks, watches, and chronometers (1819–20); a selection from the Cyclopaedia, or Universal dictionary of arts, sciences, and literature |publisher=C.

Although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials—they could be used indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as accurate; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QcE2pBCLE8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Empires of Time: Calendars, Clocks, and Cultures|last=Aveni|first=Anthony F.|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2000|isbn=1-86064-602-6|accessdate=22 June 2008|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making the reading of the clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by [[water pressure]]: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman [[horology|horologists]] beginning in 100{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and improvements continued to be made in the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Collier, James Lincoln |title=Clocks |publisher=Benchmark Books |location=[[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], NY |year=2003 |page=25 |isbn=0-7614-1538-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 270{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}500, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] ([[Ctesibius]], [[Hero of Alexandria]], [[Archimedes]]) and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[horology|horologists]] and [[astronomer]]s began developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang [[bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[gong]]s, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed [[astrology|astrological]] models of the universe.

Although the Greeks and Romans did much to advance water clock technology, they still continued to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer [[Theodosius of Bithynia]], for example, is said to have invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it.&lt;ref name=oconnor&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor |first=J.

[[File:Ancient water clock used in qanat of gonabad 2500 years ago.JPG|thumb|Ancient Persian clock]]
[[File:میرآب.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of the scene of a water clock manager (MirAab), Iran]]
According to [[Callisthenes]], the [[Persia]]ns were using [[water clock]]s in 328{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from [[qanat]]s to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in [[Iran]], especially in [[Zeebad]], dates back to 500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the ''[[Nowruz]]'', ''Chelah'', or ''[[Yaldā]]'' – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.&lt;ref name=Qanat&gt;[http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/science_education/technical/c3c1183387267p1.php/%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86 Conference of Qanat in Iran – water clock in Persia 1383], in Persian&lt;/ref&gt;

Water clocks, or ''Fenjaan'', in Persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a [[qanat]] or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt; Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"&gt;[http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 سايه‌ي شهرداري نجف‌آباد بر كهن‌ترين «ساعت آبي»‌ شهر] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429163019/http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 |date=April 29, 2014 }} Amordad News (in Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"/&gt;

The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as ''khaneh fenjaan''. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a ''staryab'' or [[astrolabe]], but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt;

===Ancient and medieval China===
{{See also|History of science and technology in China|Su Song}}
[[Joseph Needham]] speculated that the introduction of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from [[Mesopotamia]], occurred as far back as the 2nd millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, during the [[Shang Dynasty]], and at the latest by the 1st millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. By the beginning of the [[Han Dynasty]], in 202{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling [[pressure head]] in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, [[Zhang Heng]] added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor [[Shen Kuo]]. Around 610, this design was trumped by two [[Sui Dynasty]] inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the [[steelyard balance]].&lt;ref name=needham&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |pages=479–480 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Needham states that:
{{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;[the balance clepsydra] permitted the seasonal adjustment of the pressure head in the compensating tank by having standard positions for the counterweight graduated on the beam, and hence it could control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night. With this arrangement no overflow tank was required, and the two attendants were warned when the clepsydra needed refilling.&lt;ref name=needham/&gt;}}

==Timekeeping innovations in medieval and pre-modern periods==
The term '[[clock]]' encompasses a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from [[wristwatch]]es to the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. The English word ''clock'' is said to derive from the [[Middle English]] ''clokke'', [[Old French|Old North French]] ''cloque'', or [[Middle Dutch]] ''clocke'', all of which mean ''[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]'', and are derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''clocca'', also meaning bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clock |title=Clock Etymology |accessdate=27 April 2008|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Clock|title=Merriam-Webster Online: Clock|accessdate=20 June 2008|work=[[Webster's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/31/C0413100.html |accessdate=4 December 2007 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-395-82517-2 |author=executive editor, Joseph P.

The clock continued to be improved, with the first [[pendulum clock]] being designed and built in the 17th century.

===Candle clocks===
{{Main|Candle clock}}
[[Image:Kerzenuhr.jpg|thumb|right|A [[candle clock]]]]
The earliest mention of [[candle clock]]s comes from a Chinese poem, written in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}520 by You Jianfu. According to the poem, the graduated candle was a means of determining time at night. Similar candles were used in Japan until the early 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm |title=History of Time |accessdate=8 April 2008 |last=Flamer |first=Keith |year=2006|work=International Watch Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162954/http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm|archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candle clock most commonly mentioned and written of is attributed to King [[Alfred the Great]]. It consisted of six candles made from 72&amp;nbsp;[[pennyweight]]s of wax, each {{convert|12|in|cm}} high, and of uniform thickness, marked every inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm). As these candles burned for about four hours, each mark represented 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Once lit, the candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes, to prevent the flame from extinguishing.&lt;ref name="alfred"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |url=http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |title=Clockworks: Candle clock |accessdate=16 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126001057/http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated candle clocks of their time were those of [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206. One of his candle clocks included a [[Dial (measurement)|dial]] to display the time and, for the first time, employed a [[Bayonet mount|bayonet fitting]], a [[Fastener|fastening mechanism]] still used in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwGfw1YW9Js|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Routledge Hill]] described Al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows:

{{quote|The candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against the underside of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;}}

[[Image:Oil-lamp clock00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[oil-lamp clock]]]]

A variation on this theme were [[oil-lamp clock]]s. These early timekeeping devices consisted of a graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.

===Incense clocks===
{{Main article|Incense clock}}

While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the [[Song dynasty]]. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"&gt;Bedini, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sundials===
{{Main|Sundial}}
[[Image:SevillaGlorietaDelReloj01.JPG|thumb|A 20th-century [[sundial]] in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]], Spain]]
Sundials had been used for timekeeping since [[Ancient Egypt]]. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. Every day was divided into 12&amp;nbsp;equal segments regardless of the time of year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The [[sundial]] was further developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]]. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in 1371, based on earlier developments in [[trigonometry]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī]] (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that "using a [[gnomon]] that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year". His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the sundial |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=2 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010044606/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Sundial And Geometry|first=Lawrence|last=Jones|journal=North American Sundial Society|volume=12|issue=4|date=December 2005|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acceptance of [[heliocentrism]] and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the [[Renaissance]], when they were built in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Mayall, Margaret W. |author2=Mayall, R.

===Hourglass===
{{Main|Hourglass}}
Since the [[hourglass]] was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting ''Allegory of Good Government'', by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], from 1338.&lt;ref&gt;Frugoni p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices.

===Clocks with gears and escapements===
The earliest instance of a liquid-driven escapement was described by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] engineer [[Philo of Byzantium]] (fl. 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}) in his technical treatise ''Pneumatics'' (chapter 31) where he likens the escapement mechanism of a [[washstand]] [[automaton]] with those as employed in (water) clocks.&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"/&gt; Another early clock to use [[escapement]]s was built during the 7th century in [[Chang'an]], by [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] monk and mathematician, [[Yi Xing]], and government official [[Liang Lingzan]].&lt;ref name="ASME"&gt;{{Cite book|last=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|title=Proceedings of the 2002 ASME Design Engineering Technical Conferences|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|isbn=0-7918-3624-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafer"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Schafer | first = Edward H. | authorlink = Edward H.

[It] was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit&amp;nbsp;... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000817/081712eo.pdf |title=The mechanical clock |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |accessdate=16 April 2008 | date=October 1988|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Yi Xing's clock was a [[water clock]], it was affected by temperature variations. That problem was solved in 976 by [[Zhang Sixun]] by replacing the water with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which remains liquid down to {{convert|-39|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Zhang implemented the changes into his [[clock tower]], which was about {{convert|10|m}} tall, with escapements to keep the clock turning and bells to signal every quarter-hour. Another noteworthy clock, the elaborate Cosmic Engine, was built by [[Su Song]], in 1088. It was about the size of Zhang's tower, but had an automatically rotating [[armillary sphere]]—also called a celestial globe—from which the positions of the stars could be observed. It also featured five panels with [[mannequins]] ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] in horology.&lt;ref name="needham 411"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |page=411 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in the capital of [[Kaifeng]], it was dismantled by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin army]] and sent to the capital of [[Fanyang|Yanjing]] (now [[Beijing]]), where they were unable to put it back together.

In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called ''Due Mori'' (''Two [[Moors]]''), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the [[Prague Astronomical Clock]] by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker [[Mikuláš of Kadaň]] and mathematician [[Jan Šindel]].

The religious necessities and technical skill of the medieval monks were crucial factors in the development of clocks, as the historian [[Thomas Woods]] writes:
{{quote|text=The monks also counted skillful clock-makers among them. The first recorded clock was built by the future [[Pope Sylvester II]] for the German town of [[Magdeburg]], around the year 996.

[[Salisbury cathedral clock]], dating from about 1386, is one of the oldest working clocks in the world, and may be the oldest.  It still has most of its original parts,&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite web| title= Oldest Working Clock, Frequently Asked Questions, Salisbury Cathedral|url= http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.faqs.php?id=23|accessdate= 4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its original [[verge and foliot]] timekeeping mechanism is lost, having been converted to a [[pendulum]], which was replaced by a replica verge in 1956.

The framework is held together with metal dowels and pegs.  Two large stones, hanging from pulleys, supply the power. As the weights fall, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels. One barrel drives the main wheel, which is regulated by the escapement, and the other drives the striking mechanism and the air brake.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"/&gt;

During the Middle Ages, clocks primarily served religious purposes; the first employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In [[Dublin]], the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood on top of the [[Tholsel]] (the city court and council chamber).&lt;ref name="Dublin60"&gt;Clarke, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of its kind to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand.&lt;ref name="Dublin60"/&gt; The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks.&lt;ref name="Bottomley34"&gt;Bottomley, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A 1435 example survives from [[Leeds castle]]; its face is decorated with the images of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[St George]].&lt;ref name="Bottomley34"/&gt;

Early clock dials showed hours: the display of minutes and seconds evolved later.

====Wristwatch====
{{Main article|Wristwatch|history of watches}}
[[File:Leicester as Governor-General engraving by Goltzius.jpg|thumb|upright|right|One of the earliest references to a wristwatch – an 'arm watch' given to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] by her favourite [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]].]]
The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. [[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was not just a matter of fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the [[waistcoat]] was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], the consort to [[Queen Victoria]], introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as [[bracelet]]s, for women.&lt;ref name="Evolu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=THe Evolution of the Wristwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

During the [[Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin &amp; Webb]] began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at the Sudan in 1898]] and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

[[File:First Battle of Passchendaele - barrage map (colour balance).jpg|thumb|right|Planning map for an Allied creeping barrage at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] – a tactic that required precise synchronisation between the artillery and infantry.]]
These early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Frères &amp; Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], an early aviator, asked his friend, a French [[watchmaker]] called [[Louis Cartier]], to design a watch that could be useful during his flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lego Mindstorms NXT Hacker's Guide|last=Prochnow|first=Dave|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=0-07-148147-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches. His Rolex wristwatch of 1910 became the first such watch to receive certification as a chronometer in Switzerland and it went on to win an award in 1914 from [[Kew Observatory]] in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|author=John E. Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed in the air as much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British [[War Office|War Department]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Paul|title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight|publisher=Hyperion Press|year=2004|isbn=0-7868-8571-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cortjump1.jpg|thumb|A ''Cortébert'' wristwatch from the 1920s.|left]]
The company H. Williamson Ltd., based in [[Coventry]], was one of the first to capitalize on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] it was noted that "...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can." By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on – the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that "...the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire." Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

====Equation clock====
{{Main|Equation clock}}
In the late 17th and 18th Centuries, [[equation clock]]s were made, which allowed the user to see or calculate apparent [[solar time]], as would be shown by a [[sundial]]. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the [[equation of time]] made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.

==Era of precision timekeeping==

H. |quote=As William J. H. Andrewes (2006) notes: "In the 16th century Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] and his contemporaries tried to use clocks for scientific purposes, yet even the best ones were still too unreliable. Astronomers in particular needed a better tool for timing the transit of stars and thereby creating more accurate maps of the heavens. The pendulum proved to be the key to boosting the accuracy and dependability of timekeepers. [[Galileo Galilei]], the Italian physicist and astronomer, and others before him experimented with pendulums, but a young Dutch astronomer and mathematician named Christiaan Huygens devised the first pendulum clock on Christmas Day in 1656. (...) Pendulum clocks were about 100 times as accurate as their predecessors, reducing a typical gain or loss of 15 minutes a day to about a minute a week. News of the invention spread rapidly, and by 1660 English and French artisans were developing their own versions of this new timekeeper. &lt;br/&gt; In 1675 Huygens devised his next major improvement, the spiral balance spring. (...) The spiral balance spring revolutionized the accuracy of watches, enabling them to keep time to within a minute a day. This advance sparked an almost immediate rise in the market for watches, which were now no longer typically worn on a chain around the neck but were carried in a pocket, a wholly new fashion in clothing." |date=1 February 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was "the most ingenious watchmaker of all time" (in [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]'s own words).&lt;ref&gt;Gindikin, Simon; Shuchat, Alan (2007).

Innovations to the mechanical clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th.&lt;ref name="Davies434"/&gt; In the 1580s, the Italian [[polymath]] [[Galileo Galilei]] investigated the regular swing of the [[pendulum]], and discovered that it could be used to regulate a clock.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pockets"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies |first=Eryl |title=Pockets: Inventions |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London |year=1995 |isbn=0-7513-5184-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; The first pendulum clock was designed and built by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]], in 1656.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10&amp;nbsp;seconds, very accurate for their time.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;

In [[England]], the manufacturing of pendulum clocks was soon taken up.&lt;ref name="histworld"/&gt; The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the [[grandfather clock]]) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the [[anchor escapement]] mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa072801a.htm |title=The History of Mechanical Pendulum Clocks and Quartz Clocks |work=about.com |year=2012 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in about 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900|last=Derry|first=T.

To avoid the need for a very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39&amp;nbsp;inches) long to the center of the bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/clock.htm|title=How Pendulum Clocks Work|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by [[Daniel Quare]], a London clock-maker, and the Second Hand was introduced.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were another major contributor to the development of pendulum clocks in the 17th and 18th centuries, having had an "unusually keen appreciation of the importance of precision".&lt;ref name="Woods100"&gt;Woods, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods103"&gt;Woods, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In measuring an accurate one-second pendulum, for example, the Italian astronomer Father [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] persuaded nine fellow Jesuits "to count nearly 87,000 oscillations in a single day".&lt;ref name="Woods103"/&gt; They served a crucial role in spreading and testing the scientific ideas of the period, and collaborated with contemporary scientists, such as Huygens.&lt;ref name="Woods100"/&gt;

[[File:Russian finished watch movement.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A [[mechanical watch]] [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]]. From its invention in 1675 by Huygens, the spiral [[hairspring]] ([[balance spring]]) system for portable timekeepers, is still used in [[mechanical watch]]making industry today. Like pendulum clocks, [[balance spring|spiral-hairspring]] [[watch]]es were early precision timekeeping devices.]]

The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the [[balance wheel]] in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist [[Robert Hooke]] (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the actual inventor of the [[balance spring]]. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day.  The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a [[harmonic oscillator]] like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed [[resonant frequency]] and resisted oscillating at other rates.  This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day,&lt;ref name="nistrevolution"/&gt; resulting in the addition of the [[Clock face|minute hand]] to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13458392&amp;search_terms=DTL59|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1737|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Like the invention of [[pendulum clock]], Huygens' spiral [[hairspring]] ([[balance spring]]) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern [[watchmaking]] industry.

===Pocket watch===

In 1675, Huygens and [[Robert Hooke]] invented the [[spiral balance]], or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the [[balance wheel]]. This crucial advance finally made accurate [[pocket watch]]es possible.&lt;ref name="Pockets"/&gt;  This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes per day, similar to the effect of the pendulum upon mechanical clocks.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Milham | first= Willis I. | title=Time and Timekeepers | year=1945 | publisher=MacMillan | location=New York | isbn=0-7808-0008-7|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.&lt;ref name="histworld"&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF CLOCKS|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented the rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, which was a great improvement over the previous mechanism. The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.

===Marine chronometer===
{{Main|Marine chronometer}}
[[File:Harrison H4 clock in The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper 1767.jpg|thumb|left|Drawings of [[John Harrison|Harrison]]'s H4 [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] of 1761, published in ''The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper'', 1767.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aB8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Marine chronometer]]s are clocks used at sea as [[time standard]]s, to determine [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref name=marinechrono/&gt;
A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would have to keep the time of a fixed location—usually [[Greenwich Mean Time]]—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock.&lt;ref name=marinechrono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nawcc.org/museum/nwcm/galleries/marine/marine.htm |title=Marine Chronometers Gallery |accessdate=20 May 2008 |publisher=[[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manitoba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html |title=Science News – The Marine Chronometer |accessdate=20 May 2008 |first=Jérôme |last=Marchildon |publisher=[[Manitoba Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919035618/http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html|archivedate=September 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longitudeprize&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |title=Chronometers, precision watches, and timekeepers |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |location=[[Greenwich]] |accessdate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029165741/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

[[Image:MIH-film12 color cerrected denoise.jpg|thumb|right|A twin-barrel box chronometer.]]
After the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]] where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large [[longitude prize|prize]] of £20,000, equivalent to millions of pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by [[Yorkshire]] carpenter [[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.

In 1735 Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.

The chronometer was trialled in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

[[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], a Scottish clock and instrument maker, was the first to invent and patent the [[electric clock]] in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[pendulum]] and an [[electric current]] is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.

===Atomic clock===
{{Main article|Atomic clock}}
Atomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in practical use today. Accurate to within a few seconds over many thousands of years, they are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DNwfG5hQ7-YC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PA484,M1|title=Sky and Ocean Joined: The U.S. Naval Observatory, 1830–2000|last=Dick|first=Stephen|page=484|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81599-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first accurate atomic clock, a [[caesium standard]] based on a certain transition of the [[caesium-133]] atom, was built by [[Louis Essen]] in 1955 at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;

==Clock and watch-making industry==
{{Main article|Clockmaking|Watchmaking}}
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|A [[pocket watch]]]]
The first professional clockmakers came from the [[guild]]s of [[locksmith]]s and [[jeweller]]s. Clockmaking developed from a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years.&lt;ref name="Davies435" /&gt;

[[Paris]] and [[Blois]] were the early centres of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as [[Julien Le Roy]], clockmaker of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], were leaders in case design and ornamental clocks.&lt;ref name="Davies435"&gt;Davies, Norman; p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy belonged to the fifth generation of a family of clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as "the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, a face that could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500&amp;nbsp;watches. The competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately.&lt;ref name="Leroy"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Getty Center]]|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=556 |title=Julien Le Roy |accessdate=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1794 and 1795, in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], the French government briefly mandated [[decimal time|decimal clocks]], with a day divided into 10&amp;nbsp;hours of 100&amp;nbsp;minutes each.&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;Alder, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer and mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; A clock in the [[Palais des Tuileries]] kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread.&lt;ref name="Alder162"&gt;Alder, pp. 150–162&lt;/ref&gt; Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the [[metric system]], and it was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Alder162"/&gt;

In Germany, [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]] were the early clockmaking centers, and the [[Black Forest]] came to specialize in wooden [[cuckoo clocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Antiques|last=Shull|first=Thelma|publisher=C. E. Tuttle Co.|year=1963|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pocketwatch movement.png|thumb|left|220px|An antique pocket watch movement, from an 1891 encyclopedia.]]
The English became the predominant clockmakers of the 17th and 18th centuries. The main centres of the British industry were in the [[City of London]], the [[West End of London]], [[Soho]] where many skilled French [[Huguenot]]s settled and later in [[Clerkenwell]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] was established in 1631 as one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the City of London.

[[Thomas Tompion]] was the first English clockmaker with an international reputation and many of his pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury [[pendulum]], and his pupil [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] who created the first [[lever escapement]]. Famous clockmakers of this period included [[Joseph Windmills]], Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and [[Christopher Pinchbeck]] who invented the alloy [[Pinchbeck (alloy)|pinchbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22169|title=Clock and Watch-Making|publisher=British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later famous horologists included [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] who made the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, [[Thomas Earnshaw]] who was the first to make these available to the public, [[Daniel Quare]], who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand.

Quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By the rise of [[consumerism]] in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England: Where watchmaking all began|url=http://www.watchpro.com/england-where-watchmaking-all-began/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following the influx of [[Huguenot]] craftsmen, and in the 19th century, the Swiss industry "gained worldwide supremacy in high-quality machine-made watches". The leading firm of the day was [[Patek Philippe]], founded by [[Antoni Patek]] of [[Warsaw]] and [[Adrien Philippe]] of [[Bern]].&lt;ref name="Davies435"/&gt;

'''''How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, Monsters, and Zombies''''' is a semi-[[satirical]] non-fiction book by [[Daniel H. Wilson|Daniel Wilson]] published in December 2007.

==Summary==
Daniel H. Wilson’s third book is obviously fiction, but contains a lot of useful information nonetheless. ''How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies'' not only deals with how to reprogram household robots to defend against aliens but literally every imaginable monster. From vampires to Godzilla Wilson has you covered. With section titles such as "How to Slay a Vampire Clan"&lt;ref name=HowToBuild&gt;Wilson, Daniel H. How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies. First. Bloomsbury, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
and "How to Repel Godzilla"&lt;ref name=HowToBuild/&gt; there is no adversary that this book would leave you unprepared for. Although [[Annalee Newitz]] would beg to differ and "go out on a limb and claim that Earth is desperately unprepared for any kind of alien attack." &lt;ref&gt;Annalee Newitz. “Robotics Expert Daniel Wilson Says Earth Is Unprepared for Alien Invasion”, n.d. http://io9.com/how-to-build-a-robot-army.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there is a section in the book that deals specifically with that scenario, "How to Thwart an Alien Invasion".&lt;ref name=HowToBuild/&gt; Despite its apocalyptic aura the book is an easy read. The sections are all short and to the point with little to no flowery language but a lot of humor mixed in. Each section goes into describing what sort of attack you are facing and the monsters involved. Then looks at a typical personal robot that is available for reprogramming. The reprogramming goes in depth but again is easy to follow and stays on point to the hostile situation.

==Relevance in Science Fiction==
This book, ''How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies'',&lt;ref name=HowToBuild/&gt; is similar to [[Daniel H. Wilson]]’s other works because it is heavily laden with accurate and possibly useful information. The easy-to-follow prose that Wilson uses in this book not only fully outlines how to properly reprogram a multitude of robotic devices but also entices young readers. In 2009 ''How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies''&lt;ref name=HowToBuild/&gt; was awarded the “2009 Quick Pick for reluctant Young Adult Readers” by the [[American Library Association]] (ALA). Obviously the book gets kids reading because it easily engages them. As Susan Lee Stutler says in her article “From The Twilight Zone to Avatar: Science Fiction Engages the Intellect, Touches the Emotions, and Fuels the Imagination of Gifted Learners”&lt;ref name=Gifted&gt;Stutler, Susan Lee. “From The Twilight Zone to Avatar: Science Fiction Engages the Intellect, Touches the Emotions, and Fuels the Imagination of Gifted Learners.” Gifted Child Today, Spring 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; science fiction is interesting not only to gifted learners but all children because “Science fiction is rife with connections to the real world”{link to footnote} and the multitude of layers within each story. ''How to Build a Robot Army: Tips on Defending Planet Earth Against Alien Invaders, Ninjas, and Zombies''&lt;ref name=HowToBuild/&gt; is not a purely instructional book about robotics programming but follows many story lines each involving artificial intelligence. To bring up Stutler again science fiction is plainly this: “Advanced technology, artificial intelligence, extrasensory perception, mind control, fantastic future worlds, anti-utopian societies, strange extraterrestrials, intrepid travels through time and space, large-scale catastrophe, and the problem solving that comes with it—these are the elements of science fiction.” &lt;ref name=Gifted/&gt; and Wilson’s ''How to Build a Robot Army''&lt;ref name=HowToBuild/&gt; includes all of these and more, the more being Godzilla.

==Awards==
• Chosen by the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) as a “2009 Quick Pick for Reluctant Young Adult Readers."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6712">In [[biochemistry]], a '''hypothetical protein''' is a [[protein]] whose existence has been [[prediction|predicted]], but for which there is a lack of experimental evidence that it is expressed [[in vivo]]. Sequencing of several genomes has resulted in numerous predicted open reading frames to which functions cannot be readily assigned. These proteins, either orphan or conserved hypothetical proteins, make up ~ 20% to 40% of proteins encoded in each newly sequenced genome.&lt;ref name="pmid18628897"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Galperin MY | title = Conserved 'hypothetical' proteins: new hints and new puzzles. | journal = Comp Funct Genomics.  | volume = 2 | issue =1 | pages = 14–18 | year = 2001 | pmid =  18628897 | doi = 10.1002/cfg.66| pmc=2447192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when there is enough evidence that the product of the gene is expressed, by techniques such as microarray and mass-spectrometry, it is difficult to assign a function to it given its lack of identity to protein sequences with annotated biochemical function. Nowadays, most protein sequences are inferred from computational analysis of genomic [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]]. Hypothetical proteins are created by [[gene prediction]] software during [[genome]] analysis. When the [[bioinformatic]] tool used for the gene identification finds a large [[open reading frame]] without a characterised [[Homologous protein|homologue]] in the [[Sequence database|protein database]], it returns  "hypothetical protein" as an annotation remark.

The function of a hypothetical protein can be predicted by [[protein domain|domain]] [[protein homology|homology search]]es with various confidence levels&lt;ref name="pmid25655405" /&gt;. Conserved domains are available in the hypothetical proteins which need to be compared with the known family domains by which hypothetical protein could be classified into particular protein families even though they have not been in vivo investigated. The function of hypothetical protein could also be predicted by homology modelling, in which hypothetical protein has to align with known protein sequence whose three dimensional structure is known and by modelling method if structure predicted then the capability of hypothetical protein to function could be ascertained computationally&lt;ref name="pmid25655405" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=P S Kewate |author2=R C Urade |author3=D G Gore |author4=M A Soni|author5=A P Kopulwar|journal=[[Journal of Pharmacy Research]] |title=In silico enzyme function prediction in hypothetical proteins of Mycobacterium bovis AF2122/97 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages= 182–189 |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.Further, approaches to annotate function to hypothetical proteins include determination of 3-dimensional structure of these proteins by structural genomics initiatives, understanding the nature and mode of prosthetic group/metal ion binding, fold similarity with other proteins of known functions and annotating possible catalytic site and regulatory site.&lt;ref name="pmid10679350"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eisenstein E | title = Biological function made crystal clear - annotation of hypothetical proteins via structural genomics. | journal = Curr Opin Biotechnol   | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 25–30 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10679350 | doi = 10.1016/j.exppara.2015.01.013 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structure prediction with biochemical function assessment by screening for various substrate is another promising approach to annotate function&lt;ref name="pmid25655405"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Srinivasan B | title = Prediction of substrate specificity and preliminary kinetic characterization of the hypothetical protein PVX_123945 from Plasmodium vivax. | journal = Exp Parasitol.  | volume = 151-152 | issue = | pages = 56–63 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.exppara.2015.01.013 | pmid = 25655405 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''scientia'', meaning "knowledge") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable [[Explanation|explanations]] and [[predictions]] about the universe.

[[Modern science]] is typically divided into three major [[Branches of science|branches]] that consist of the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] (e.g. [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]]), which study [[nature]] in the broadest sense; the [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]]) which study people and societies; and the [[formal sciences]] (e.g. [[mathematics]], [[Formal logic|logic]], [[theoretical computer science]]), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement, however, on the formal sciences being a science as they do not rely on [[empirical evidence]]. Disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine, are described as [[applied sciences]].

'''Intercropping''' is a multiple cropping practice involving growing two or more [[crop]]s in proximity. The most common goal of  intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources or ecological processes that would otherwise not be utilized by a single [[crop]].&lt;ref name="sustainable horticulture"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://scihub.org/ABJNA/PDF/2010/5/ABJNA-1-5-1098-1105.pdf |title=Sustainable horticultural crop production through intercropping: The case of fruits and vegetable crops: A review |last=Ouma |first=George |last2=Jeruto |first2=P |journal=Agriculture and Biology Journal of North America |year=2010 |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=1098–1105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential benefits ==

=== Resource partitioning ===
{{further|Resource partitioning}}

Careful planning is required, taking into account the [[soil]], [[climate]], crops, and [[variety (botany)|varieties]]. It is particularly important not to have crops competing with each other for physical space, [[nutrient]]s, [[water]], or [[sunlight]]. Examples of intercropping strategies are planting a deep-[[root]]ed crop with a shallow-rooted crop, or planting a tall crop with a shorter crop that requires partial shade. [[Inga alley cropping]] has been proposed as an alternative to the ecological destruction of [[slash-and-burn farming]].&lt;ref name="Elkan"&gt;Elkan, Daniel. ''Slash-and-burn farming has become a major threat to the world's rainforest'' [[The Guardian]] 21 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When crops are carefully selected, other agronomic benefits are also achieved.

=== Mutualism ===&lt;!--do not link to Mutualism (biology), that's something else entirely--&gt;

Planting two crops in close proximity can especially be beneficial when the two plants interact in a way that increases one or both of the plant's [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] (and therefore yield). For example, plants that are prone to tip over in wind or heavy rain (lodging-prone plants), may be given structural support by their companion crop.&lt;ref&gt;Trenbath, B.R. 1976. Plant interactions in mixed cropping communities. pp.&amp;nbsp;129–169 in R.I. Papendick, A. Sanchez, G.B. Triplett (Eds.), ''Multiple Cropping''. ASA Special Publication 27. American Society of Agronomy, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parthenocissus|Climbing plants]] can also benefit from structural support. Some plants are used to suppress weeds or provide nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2006|title=The science behind the Three Sisters mound system: An agronomic assessment of an indigenous agricultural system in the northeast|encyclopedia=Histories of maize: Multidisciplinary approaches to the prehistory, linguistics, biogeography, domestication, and evolution of maize|location=Amsterdam|last=Mt. Pleasant|first=Jane|pages=529–537|editor=John E. Staller|editor2=Robert H. Tykot|editor3=Bruce F. Benz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delicate or light-sensitive plants may be given shade or protection, or otherwise wasted space can be utilized. An example is the tropical multi-tier system where [[coconut]] occupies the upper tier, [[banana]] the middle tier, and [[pineapple]], [[ginger]], or leguminous [[fodder]], [[herbalism|medicinal]] or [[aromatic plants]] occupy the lowest tier.

Intercropping of compatible plants can also encourage [[biodiversity]], by providing a habitat for a variety of [[insect]]s and [[soil biology|soil organisms]] that would not be present in a single-crop environment. These organisms may provide crops valuable nutrients, such as through [[nitrogen fixation]].

=== Pest management ===
{{further|Pest control}}

There are several ways in which increasing crop diversity may help improve pest management. For example, such practices may limit outbreaks of crop [[pest (organism)|pest]]s by increasing predator biodiversity.&lt;ref name="AltieriNicholls2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miguel Angel Altieri|author2=Clara Ines Nicholls|title=Biodiversity and Pest Management in Agroecosystems, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQI0PCnnbI8C|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, reducing the homogeneity of the crop can potentially increase the barriers against [[biological dispersal]] of pest organisms through the crop.

There are several ways pests can be controlled through intercropping:
* '''[[Trap crop]]ping,''' this involves planting a crop nearby that is more attractive for pests compared to the production crop, the pests will target this crop and not the production crop.
* '''Repellant intercrops,''' an intercrop that has a repellent effect to certain pests can be used. This system involved the repellant crop masking the smell of the production crop in order to keep pests away from it.
* '''Push-pull cropping,''' this is a mixture of trap cropping and repellant intercropping. An attractant crop attracts the pest and a repellant crop is also used to repel the pest away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.uvm.edu/foodsystemsblog/2014/01/09/controlling-pests-with-plants-the-power-of-intercropping/|title=Controlling Pests with Plants: The power of intercropping - UVM Food Feed|date=2014-01-09|newspaper=UVM Food Feed|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The degree of spatial and temporal overlap in the two crops can vary somewhat, but both requirements must be met for a cropping system to be an intercrop. Numerous types of intercropping, all of which vary the temporal and spatial mixture to some degree, have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, D.J., A.H. Kassam. 1976. The importance of multiple cropping in increasing world food supplies. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–10 in R.I. Papendick, A. Sanchez, G.B. Triplett (Eds.), ''Multiple Cropping''. ASA Special Publication 27. American Society of Agronomy, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annual intercrops"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lithourgidis|first=A.S.|last2=Dordas |first2=C.A.|last3=Damalas|first3=C.A. |last4=Vlachostergios|first4=D.N.|year=2011|title=Annual intercrops: an alternative pathway for sustainable agriculture |url=http://www.cropj.com/anastasios_5_4_2011_396_410.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Crop Science|volume=5 |issue=4|pages=396–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are some of the more significant types:
* '''Mixed intercropping''', as the name implies, is the most basic form in which the component crops are totally mixed in the available space.
* '''Row cropping''' involves the component crops arranged in alternate rows. Variations include alley cropping, where crops are grown in between rows of trees, and strip cropping, where multiple rows, or a strip, of one crop are alternated with multiple rows of another crop. A new version of this is to intercrop rows of [[solar photovoltaic]] modules with agriculture crops. This practice is called [[agrivoltaics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dinesh| first = Harshavardhan| last2 = Pearce| first2 = Joshua M.| date = 2016-02-01| title = The potential of agrivoltaic systems| url = https://www.academia.edu/18406368/The_potential_of_agrivoltaic_systems| journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews| volume = 54| pages = 299–308| doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.10.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Temporal intercropping''' uses the practice of sowing a fast-growing crop with a slow-growing crop, so that the fast-growing crop is harvested before the slow-growing crop starts to mature. 
* Further temporal separation is found in '''relay cropping''', where the second crop is sown during the growth, often near the onset of reproductive development or [[fruit]]ing, of the first crop, so that the first crop is harvested to make room for the full development of the second.

==== Limitations ====
Intercropping to reduce pest damage in agriculture, has been deployed with varying success. For example, while trap cropping has reduced pest densities at a commercial in experiments, it often fails to decrease pest densities deployed in large scale commercial landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|last3=Lee|first3=Doo-Hyung|last4=Nyrop|first4=Jan P.|last5=Sanderson|first5=John P.|date=2012-06-01|title=Designing an effective trap cropping strategy: the effects of attraction, retention and plant spatial distribution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02137.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=49|issue=3|pages=715–722|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02137.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, increasing crop diversity through intercropping does not necessarily increase the presence of the predators of crop pests. In a systematic review of the literature, in 2008, in the studies examined, predators of pests tended only increased under crop diversification strategies in 53 percent of studies, and crop diversification only led to increased yield in only 32% of the studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poveda|first=Katja|last2=Gómez|first2=María Isabel|last3=Martínez|first3=Eliana|date=2008-12-01|title=Diversification practices: their effect on pest regulation and production|url=http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0120-04882008000200001&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Revista Colombiana de Entomología|volume=34|issue=2|pages=131–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loyal Blaine Aldrich''' (November 20, 1884 &amp;ndash; February 11, 1965) was an [[United States|American]] [[astrophysicist]] and [[astronomer]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  Upon graduation from the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1907, Aldrich became a [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] assistant to [[Charles Greeley Abbot]].  The observatory conducted astrophysical research on solar radiation and the amount of energy from the sun that strikes the outer edge of the earth's atmosphere.  Abbot became director of the observatory in 1907 and established solar observing stations in the United States, South America, and Africa to carry out research on solar radiation.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/historic/history.htm#astro|title=SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=2011-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213204530/http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/historic/history.htm#astro|archivedate=2012-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aldrich became director of the observatory from 1942 to 1955.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/lib/information/directors.html|title=Directors of the SAO, HCO, and CfA|publisher=[[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]]|accessdate=2011-06-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518014119/http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/lib/information/directors.html|archivedate=2012-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Harvard University]] astronomy department chairman [[Fred Lawrence Whipple]] became director of the observatory when Aldrich retired.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt;

==Family==
Aldrich married Elizabeth Stanley (born October 9, 1896).  Their son, Stanley Loyal Aldrich, assisted his father operating the observing station in the [[Chile]]an [[Andes]] until returning to the United States in 1957 so his daughters might receive education at [[Windham, Maine]], where he taught high school mathematics.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mainetoday-pressherald/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=98394751|title=Stanley L. Aldrich|publisher=[[The Portland Press Herald]]|accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Aldrich assisted Abbott's mapping of the [[infrared]] solar [[spectrum]] and carried out systematic studies of variation in solar radiation, its relation to the [[sunspot]] cycle, and its effect on [[weather]] variation.  He also studied the nature of [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] transmission and [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] and assisted Abbot perfecting various standardised instruments now widely used for measuring the [[sun]]'s heat.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt;

'''Melonite''' is a [[Telluride mineral|telluride]] of [[nickel]]; it is a [[metal]]lic [[mineral]]. Its chemical formula is NiTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is opaque and white to reddish-white in color, [[oxidation|oxidizing]] in air to a brown tarnish.  

It was first described from the Melones and Stanislaus mine in [[Calaveras County, California]] in 1866, by [[Frederick Augustus Genth]].

Melonite occurs as [[trigonal]] crystals, which cleave in a (0001) direction. It has a [[specific gravity]] of 7.72 and a [[Mohs hardness scale|hardness]] of 1–1.5 (very soft).

==Blink of an eye==
[[File:MBED Top Level Ontology.jpg|thumb|right|This [[NASA]]-generated chart expresses a framework for modeling non-military space systems architectures; but it could be construed as a military taxonomy -- modeling military space systems architectures.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, Peter and Joseph Skipper. (2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20090227132305/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39851/1/06-0876.pdf  "Toward a Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures."] NASA, JPL.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Military theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]] stressed the significance of grasping the fundamentals of any situation in the "blink of an eye" (''[[coup d'œil]]'').  In a military context, the astute tactician can immediately grasp a range of implications and can begin to anticipate plausible and appropriate courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Calusewitz, Carl. (1982). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_La4qTgECD0C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=clausewitz+coup+d%27oeil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=8UCKTI28o4&amp;sig=0ntr9cQoagmpsJVuulXii533H8U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result  ''On War,'' p. 141;] [http://www.greenchameleon.com/gc/blog_detail/defining_taxonomy/ "Defining 'Taxonomy',"] Straights Knowledge website.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clauzewitz' conceptual "blink" represents a tentative [[ontology]] which organizes a set of concepts within a [[Domain of discourse|domain]].

A conventional military taxonomy might be an hierarchical set of classifications for a given set of objects; and the progress of reasoning is developed from the general to the more specific. In such taxonomic [[Model (abstract)|schema]], a conflative term is always a [[polyseme]].&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Joseph L. (1988). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PEY0U3umLRkC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=conflation&amp;client=firefox-a  ''The Science of Linguistics in the Art of Translation: Some Tools from Linguistics for the Analysis and Practice of Translation,'' p. 112.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a less conventional approach might employ an open-ended contextual military taxonomy—a taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context; and the progress of reasoning is developed form the specific to the more general.&lt;ref&gt;Grossi, Davide, [[Frank Dignum]] and John-Jules Charles Meyer. (2005). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/9yj2lfa5cy67c78m/fulltext.pdf?page=1  "Contextual Taxonomies" in ''Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems,'' pp. 33-51].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive paradigm==
A taxonomy of terms to describe various types of military operations is fundamentally affected by the way all elements are defined and addressed—not unlike [[framing (social sciences)|framing]].

In terms of a specific military operation, a taxonomic approach based on differentiation and categorization of the entities participating would produce results which were quite different from an approach based on functional objective of an operation (such as peacekeeping, disaster relief, or counter-terrorism). An incidental advantage which flows from give-and-take in refining taxonomic terms more accurately and efficiently becomes more than a worthwhile objective in terms of anticipated outcomes or results. In today's nontraditional operations, the discussion about fundamentals also generates greater precision in how the defense and security community understands and discusses integrated operations.&lt;ref&gt;Downie, Richard D. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KNN/is_38/ai_n15631260/pg_3?tag=artBody;col1 "Defining integrated operations,"] ''Joint Force Quarterly'' (Washington, D.C.). July, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyūga class helicopter destroyer===
Military taxonomy in Japan is circumscribed by Japan's pacifist post-war constitution.  For example, this affects classification of the [[Hyūga class helicopter destroyer|''Hyūga'' class helicopter carriers]], which are ships of the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF).&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ddh-x.htm |title=16DDH "13,500 ton" ton Class |work=Global Security |accessdate=2008-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616174940/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ddh-x.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of [[helicopter carrier]] was formally identified as a helicopter [[destroyer]] (DDH) to comply with explicit constitutional limitations written in [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[  "Japan's Largest 'Helicopter Carrier' Commissioned Amid Concerns," Kyodo News International. March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ships of this class, the JS ''Hyūga'' and the JS ''Ise''  resemble a light [[aircraft carrier]] or [[amphibious assault ship]] such as the [[Marina Militare Italiana|Italian Navy]]'s 13,850-ton [[Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']], the [[Spanish Navy]]'s 17,000-ton [[Principe de Asturias (R11)|''Principe de Asturias'']] or the [[Royal Navy]]'s 21,000-ton [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible''-class carriers]].&lt;ref name="Hutchison2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htnavai/articles/20070825.aspx|title=Japan's Secret Aircraft Carriers|last=Hutchison |first=Harold C. |date=2007-08-25|work=StrategyPage|accessdate=2008-07-13}}; {{ja}} [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=cae_1188504476 JMSDF's new carrier, launch video.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, JS ''Hyūga'' is the "first Japanese aircraft carrier built since WWII;"&lt;ref&gt;PBS/WNET, NYC: [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/japans-about-face/introduction/746/ "Japan's About-Face: The military's shifting role in post-war society."] July 8, 2008; Teslik, Lee Hudson. [http://www.cfr.org/publication/10439/japan_and_its_military.html "Backgrounder; Japan and Its Military,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125200934/http://www.cfr.org/publication/10439/japan_and_its_military.html |date=2010-01-25 }} ''Council on Foreign Relations.'' April 13, 2006; Hsiao, Russell. [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA08Ad01.html "China navy floats three-carrier plan,"] ''Asia Times'' (Hong Kong). January 8, 2008; [http://informationdissemination.blogspot.com/search?q=hyuga "Meet Japan's New Destroyer - Updated,"] Information Dissemination (blog). August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but this label is controversial.  A taxonomic label of "aircraft carrier" is legally proscribed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avionews.com/index.php?corpo=see_news_home.php&amp;news_id=1101427&amp;pagina_chiamante=corpo%3Dindex.php  "Japan Commissioned Its Biggest Helicopter Carrier,"] ''AvionNews'' (World Aeronautical Press Agency). March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ship in this class has attracted media and Diet attention because of its resemblance to an aircraft carrier.  Until the 1970s, US Navy taxonomy categorized large-scale flattops as "attack aircraft carriers" and small flattops as "antisubmarine aircraft carriers." In Japan, the constitutional prohibition against having "attack" aircraft carries has been construed to encompass small aircraft carriers but not helicopter carriers.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;

A uniquely Japanese taxonomic template is applied to these ships and to their missions, which are limited to "[[military operations other than war]]" (MOOTW).&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;

==Strategic paradigm==
A number of military strategies can be parsed using a taxonomy model.  The comparative theoretical framework might posit a range of criteria, e.g., the character of envisaged political goals, the type of military strategy preferred, and the scope of forces engaged; and this template suggests discrete modes of force.  The taxonomy-model analysis suggests a useful depiction of the spectrum of the use of military force in a political context.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Stuart A. and  Efraim Inbar. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a782379359~db=all~order=page  "A taxonomy of Israel's use of military force,"] ''Journal Comparative Strategy,'' Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1991), pp. 121 - 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parsing terrorism===
In the 21st century, the ambit of a subset taxonomy of terrorism would include terms related to terrorists, terrorist groups, terrorist attacks, weapons, venues, and characteristics of terrorists and terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="cycorp2"/&gt;

==Limitations==
Taxonomies offer useful, but incomplete means of structuring information.&lt;ref name="e-mapsys1"&gt;Electronic Mapping Systems: [http://www.e-mapsys.com/Taxonomy1.htm  taxonomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxonomies are a necessary but not sufficient condition for adequate evaluation of a given data set. While the taxonomic categorizations and sub-categorizations do enhance understanding, it may be significant that the lack of detail in describing objects or elements creates room for ambiguity.&lt;ref name="e-mapsys1"/&gt;

'''NASA Research Park''' is a [[research park]] run by [[NASA]] which is developing a world-class, shared-use research and development campus in association with government entities, academia, industry and [[non-profit organisation]]s. It is situated near [[San Jose, California]]. NASA Research Park was approved by NASA HQ in the fall of 2002 and over the past decade has grown into the research park it is today with 61 tenants and partners.

==Ames Research Center==
The [[U.S. Congress]] originally established [[Ames Research Center]] (Ames) in 1939 as the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory under the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA). Ames eventually grew to occupy approximately {{convert|500|acre|km2}} at Moffett Field adjacent to the [[Naval Air Station Moffett Field]] in [[Santa Clara County, California]], in the center of the region that would, in the 1990s, become known worldwide as [[Silicon Valley]]. In 1958, Congress created [[NASA]] with the ''National Aeronautics and Space Act'' of 1958, 42 U.S.C. § 2451 ''et seq''. The Ames Aeronautical Laboratory was renamed Ames Research Center and became a NASA field center.

Ames is nearing 70 years of age, which it calls "Seven Decades of Innovation," highlighted with major accomplishments in aeronautics and space. From the 1940s through the 1990s, Ames scientists and engineers demonstrated excellence in flight research in many areas including variable stability aircraft, guidance and control displays, boundary-layer control, vertical and short takeoff and landing aircraft, and rotorcraft. Ames developed the [[swept wing]] design and the conical camber, now considered in the design of every [[supersonic]] aircraft.

Ames developed and operated critical facilities including [[flight simulator]]s and [[wind tunnel]]s, pushing the frontiers of computers and the arcjets facility to test materials at very high temperatures, which were critical to high-speed aircraft development and space vehicle re-entry. Ames largest contribution to the early space program for human missions was solving the problem of getting astronauts safely back to Earth, through the development of the blunt body design for re-entry vehicles.

Ames assisted the development of [[Apollo programme|Apollo]], developed and operated the [[Pioneer program|Pioneer Missions]] (the first spacecraft to travel through the asteroid belts, observe [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] and [[Venus]]), and developed the tiltrotor aircraft. The diversity of accomplishments led to the focus in the 1990s on Ames becoming the high-tech center of NASA. In those days in NASA parlance, Ames became the Center of Excellence for Information Technologies, taking the lead in human centered computing, a major interdisciplinary effort to develop means of optimizing the performance of mixed human and computer systems. These new technologies were critical for both aeronautics and space operations with ground-based operators, astronauts (or pilots/controllers in the air traffic management system) and robots functioning collaboratively to maximize mission science return, productivity and safety. This human centered computing focus developed the expertise for Ames to become the lead for all supercomputing in NASA, and in 2005 Ames operated the world's fastest [[supercomputer]], partnered with [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] and [[Intel]].

In the 1990s, following its historic excellence in life and space sciences, Ames developed a focused new program called Astrobiology to search for the origins of life in the universe. Ames leads NASA's [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler Mission]], a spacecraft designed to find Earth-sized planets in other galaxies that may be in or near habitable zones, distances from a star where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. Ames developed SOFIA, the new [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]], using a [[Boeing 747]] aircraft that will study the universe for the next twenty years in the infrared spectrum.

Concurrent with the outstanding innovations in science and technology, Ames has become the leader in NASA for innovative partnerships with universities and industry, both onsite and in distance collaborations. The opportunity for this new partnering became available in the early 1990s, with the potential for R&amp;D partners to move into the property obtained from the transfer of Navy Moffett Field land to NASA.

From its establishment in 1939, Ames shared the land generally known as Moffett Field with the [[United States Navy]], jointly using the major airfield on the property. In the 1930s the Navy developed Moffett Field originally for the home of the famous "Lighter than Air Era of American Military History," housing and operating large-scale airships. Through the years a number of different military organizations, including the [[United States Air Force]], used the Moffett Field facilities, and in the late 1980s the Navy operated the base.

With the enactment of the Base Realignment and Closure Act in 1991, Congress directed the Navy to close and vacate the Naval Air Station at Moffett Field. Under the framework of the ''Federal Property Administrative Services Act'' of 1949, 40 U.S.C. §471, NASA successfully negotiated custody of most of the Navy property, with the strong support of the local governments surrounding Moffett Field and the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressmen]] from the area, especially Rep. [[Norman Mineta]]. The decision was properly approved through the federal government process to transfer the property to NASA and disestablish the Naval Air Station Moffett Field. The [[United States Department of Defense]] decided to retain control of {{convert|57|ha|acre}} of military housing at Moffett Field. In 1994, the [[Department of the Navy]] transferred approximately {{convert|600|ha|acre}} to NASA. This transfer created a unique opportunity for NASA to provide stewardship for the entire 800-hectare (2,000 acre) site, except the military housing.

Prior to obtaining control of Moffett Field, NASA prepared the Moffett Field Comprehensive Use Plan (CUP) to implement its management program for the newly expanded Ames. An Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact accompanied the plan. The EA established under the CUP allows for the development of up to approximately 102,000 square meters (1.1 million square feet) of new construction.

The transfer of Moffett Field to Ames supplied the impetus to consider various new uses of the property for NASA's benefit. Ames leaders began discussions with federal, state and community leaders for potential reuse ideas.

==NASA Research Park==
In November 1996, the neighboring cities of [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] formed the Community Advisory Committee to study and provide input to Ames about the best reuses of Moffett Field. Ames developed a six-point initiative, which outlined program goals and reuse concepts for the development of the former Navy base that basically focused on university and industry building on NASA property as R&amp;D collaborative partners. In 1997, after extensive public outreach and public meetings, the final report advisory committee endorsed NASA's six-point initiative, which established the plans to develop what became the NASA Research Park.

Ames leaders reviewed studies of research parks worldwide and continued to work with the neighboring communities in preparing its preferred development plan. In 1998, Ames and the cities of Sunnyvale and Mountain View signed a memorandum of understanding to work jointly on development. Also, a number of major universities were involved in planning their potential roles in development. In mid-1998, Ames leaders presented their plan to NASA HQ and secured approval to proceed.

On December 8, 1998, NASA unveiled its visionary concept for a shared-use R&amp;D and education campus for collaborations among government, industry, academia and non-profit organizations at a national press conference with NASA Administrator Dan Goldin. Over the next year, MOUs for planning development were signed with the [[University of California]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[San Jose State University]] and [[Foothill-DeAnza Community College]].

In addition to federal, state and community leaders' inputs, Ames worked closely with a number of economic development and industry organizations in focused groups by industry: information technology, bio-technology and others to understand the needs of Silicon Valley high-tech industry. In 1999, this vision was outlined in an Economic Development Concept Workbook, which won the 2000 American Planning Association Award.

===Development===
NASA's goal is to develop a world-class, shared-use research and development campus in association with government entities, academia, industry and nonprofits. The NADP/EIS provides a framework to guide the use, renovation, management and development of facilities at Ames over the next 20 years to achieve that goal. The NRP supports NASA's overall mission in three areas: advancing NASA's research leadership; facilitating science and technology education; and creating a unique community of researchers, students and educators.

NASA's recent vision and mission statements recognize that not from NASA alone, not from industry alone and not from universities alone will tomorrow's innovations emerge. They will come from the integration of these different segments, each making the most of their unique attributes—NASA's focus on high-risk, long-term research; industry's ability to react quickly with applied technologies; and the universities' expertise in educating and providing a vibrant workforce for the future.

The Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) announced in 2004 requires NASA to reach out and partner with all kinds of relevant organizations to sustain the long-term vision. The NRP has and is continuing to bring together outstanding diverse partners, assisting the pursuit of the VSE and other NASA programs. Through the interaction of academia, industry and nonprofit organizations at a robust federal laboratory, a unique community of researchers, students and educators with a shared mission to advance human knowledge will be created. This is the goal of the NRP.

In October 2011, the President issued a Presidential Memorandum "Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Businesses" that directs federal agencies to "Facilitate Commercialization through Local and Regional Partnerships.  Agencies must take steps to enhance successful technology innovation networks by fostering increased Federal laboratory engagement with external partners, including universities, industry consortia, economic development entities, and State and local governments." and "to use existing authorities, such as Enhanced Use Leasing or Facility Use Agreements, to locate applied research and business support programs, such as incubators and research parks, on or near Federal laboratories and other research facilities to further technology transfer and commercialization. I encourage agencies with Federal laboratories and other research facilities to engage in public-private partnerships in those technical areas of importance to the agency's mission with external partners to strengthen the commercialization activities in their local region."  NRP has implemented this directive through its program of onsite and offsite industry and academic partnerships.

===External Reviews, Recognition, and Oversight===
'''2000 American Planning Association, Northern California Chapter.'''
Early in the planning process for NRP, NASA prepared its ''NRP Economic Development Concept Workbook'' used to brief key stakeholders in Silicon Valley and test real estate development concepts with end user technology companies.

'''2000-2001 National Research Council.'''
As part of the planning process for NRP, NASA commissioned the highly regarded National Research Council to review the NRP concept.  The National Research Council conducted a workshop and published its findings in "A Review of New Initiatives at NASA Ames Research Center: Summary of a Workshop." A key finding was that the proposed NSP would represent a "new model for Industry-Government Partnerships."

==Ames Core Technology Areas==
The Business Plan reviewed current partners and suggested future partners based on the core technology areas being pursued by Ames. Current and future NRP partners will contribute to breakthroughs in the areas in which NASA and Ames possess traditional competencies, such as aeronautics, air transportation management, robotics and information technology. While these core areas consist of technologies that are relatively mature, they require further advancement to enable the next generation of space flight and air travel. The development of these technologies is a key driver behind NASA's mission; as such Ames will seek to create partnerships that support these areas as described below.

===Small Spacecraft Systems===
Ames has pioneered the concept of small spacecraft and their potential for accelerating NASA's progress in exploring the moon and solar system. By inserting a mix of microsatellites and miniature landers into NASA's existing plans for robotic lunar exploration, the agency will be able to make great strides in a shorter timeframe and at a modest cost.

In May 2006, NASA's Exploration Systems Directorate assigned Ames the responsibility for developing small spacecraft missions to support agency exploration goals. Underlying this decision was the expectation that many of NASA's goals could be achieved with targeted, low-cost proposals in the $50 to $100 million range—much lower than traditional NASA missions.

The success of this program will depend in part upon partnerships with industry. Increased collaboration with the NRP's university-led Center for Robotics and Space Exploration (CREST) will aid in the development of specific concepts for future small spacecraft missions, and will accelerate the advancement of the supporting technology for these missions.

Closer relationships among NASA, industry partners, and academic institutions will allow for a degree of progress in this area that would otherwise be impossible. Adaptation to the scale of small, low-cost missions will be difficult for both NASA and industry, but can be achieved in short order in a collaborative environment. Furthermore, partners, such as Google, may contribute non-traditional yet valuable expertise to the venture of developing computer systems for the new low-cost payloads.

One of the NRP partners, m2mi (machine-to-machine intelligence) developed the third ever in NASA, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement or CRADA, that will combine their unique capabilities in software technology, sensors, Global Systems awareness, adaptive control and commercialization capabilities with Ames' expertise in nanosensors, wireless networks and nanosatellite technologies to develop a Fifth Generation (5G) (VOIP-Video-Data-Wireless-m2mi) telecommunications system. A large number of these nanosats (a constellation) will be placed in low earth orbit (LEO) to provide the first ever, Fifth Generation (5G) Telecommunications system to enable Internet Protocol (IP) based services to the global user community.

===Intelligent Adaptive Systems and Robotics===
The next generation of space exploration systems will require a much greater degree of system intelligence than is currently available. The ability of systems to engage in autonomous decision making and to adapt to changes in the environment will enable NASA to expand its operations in austere environments, reduce costs of operations, and increase safety. NASA and Ames have been leaders in the development of these kinds of systems. However, by leveraging the base of knowledge in the commercial world, and by working with partners at the cutting edge of this technology, NASA can advance its science base in automated learning, intelligent execution and adaptive control beyond what is currently possible. There is great potential with Carnegie Mellon University's expertise in this area along with many Silicon Valley businesses.

===Integrated Next Generation Computer Systems===
NASA's spacecraft, landers, and other exploration systems are heavily reliant upon computers, sensors and information technology. By partnering with the top firms in these areas, Ames will be better positioned to integrate these technologies into future NASA architectures. Google, Cisco, and Apprion are examples of companies currently in negotiation with Ames, and could add a great deal of value to this area once brought on board. Other potential partners include Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, Intel, AMD, and a host of other IT firms located in the San Francisco Bay Area.

===Materials Science and Thermal Protection Systems (TPS)===
Ames has played a significant role in the development of the TPS system for the Space Shuttle and possesses the baseline capabilities needed to develop systems for future spacecraft. NASA can greatly benefit by reaching out to partners beyond the pool of traditional suppliers of orbital thermal protection technology. For example, Ames will reach out to major chemical companies such as Dow Chemical, Du-Pont and BASF, to involve them in the search for next-generation heat shielding solutions. Such collaboration will greatly enhance the pool of talent available to advance technology in this area, and will advance the technology for future space transportation systems. In addition, nanotechnology materials development has great potential in the NRP as a number of companies and universities are interested, including the UCSC planned construction of a new Bio-Info-Nano R&amp;D Lab.

===Human Factors and Life Sciences===
To ensure the highest degree of safety and efficiency, future space exploration will require a greater understanding of the impact of low and zero-gravity environments upon human physiology. The effects of prolonged exposure to the low-gravity of the moon, for example, will challenge the ability of future explorers to maintain a significant lunar presence. As a result, NASA must continue to charge forward in developing technology and processes that overcome this challenge. Areas of current collaboration in the NRP include advanced muscle augmentation and bone density growth. Ames is currently working with NRP partners Changene and Tibion to advance these technologies. Ames has also been working with firms such as Bigelow and Hamilton Standard on water filtration devices for use on board future spacecraft or orbital habitats. The San Francisco Bay Area hosts over one-third of the world's biotech companies and discussions are underway with the potential for a biotech cluster in the NRP.

==Key Partners==
===Google===
On September 30, 2005, NASA and [[Google]] announced a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) at a national press conference to pursue R&amp;D collaborations with Ames in the areas of: large-scale data management; massively distributed computing; Bio-Info-Nano Convergence; and R&amp;D activities to encourage the entrepreneurial space industry and plan to build {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2}} of new facilities. In 2006, NASA and Google signed a major Space Act Agreement for Research and Development Collaboration with planned continuing new R&amp;D annexes being added. In 2007, Google announced their [[Lunar X PRIZE]], a $30 million international competition to safely land a robot on the surface of the [[Moon]], travel 500 meters over the lunar surface, and send images and data back to the Earth.  In 2008, Google Inc. and NASA signed a long-term ground lease for 42 acres in NRP.  The [[San Jose Business Journal]] awarded the NASA/Google ground lease its "Deal of the Year" award in 2008. In late 2012 Google broke ground to construct up to 1.2 million in new office/R&amp;D facilities near its [[Googleplex]] in [[Mountain View, CA]].  Google released details of its planned construction of its new campus to [http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/02/exclusive-preview-googleplex] [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] in February 2013 and simultaneously issued a press statement confirming construction plans to the media.  The announcement has been reported internationally, including the [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324503204578320753525354828] [[Wall Street Journal]] in the United States.

===Singularity University===
{{Main|Singularity University}}
[https://su.org/ Singularity University] was jointly founded by Dr. Peter H. Diamandis and Dr. Ray Kurzweil. The concept of a new university that could leverage the power of exponential technologies to solve humanity's grand challenges was proposed by Diamandis to Kurzweil and to International Space University colleagues Dr. Robert D. Richards and Michael Simpson in April 2007. An exploratory meeting was held at NASA Research Park, Moffett Field in November 2007, followed by a Founders Conference on September 20, 2008 also hosted at NASA.  Singularity University opened in the summer of 2009 and has attracted widespread press coverage of its classes, competitions, and events.&lt;ref&gt;See New York Times:  https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/business/13sing.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;  It hosted over 150 students in 2011 and has a faculty and staff of 40 located at NRP.

===Carnegie Mellon University - Silicon Valley Campus===
In 2002, Carnegie Mellon University established a [http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/about-us/index.html branch campus] in Silicon Valley to connect its many distinctive technology education programs to the innovative business community at the epicenter of the 21st century technology revolution. The university's Silicon Valley Campus offers master's programs in Software Engineering, Software Management, Engineering &amp; Technology Innovation Management, and Information Technology, as well as a bicoastal Ph.D. program in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus in Mobility offered in conjunction with the new CyLab Mobility Research Center. Over 600 graduate-level students have received degrees at the Silicon Valley campus located in two historic buildings at NRP.

==Environmental issues==
The Navy has the responsibility to remediate the PCB hazard in the metal outer structure of the Hangar One building. The exterior skin is in the process of being removed, and the course of action for the remaining structural skeleton has yet to be publicly announced. The long and public process - of developing and analyzing courses of action - is ongoing. Many have expressed hope that this dynamic {{convert|360000|sqft|m2}} historic icon of the South Bay Area can be saved and utilized for a public purpose.

Parts of the research park lands are on a [[superfund]] site. However, NASA studies have shown that the lands are still usable and only require a particular type of construction.

== Automated grid generation ==
Automated grid generation&lt;ref name=Krause2010 /&gt; is one of the great advantages of ''OpenLB'' over other CFD software packages. The main advantages are listed below:
 
* Use of geometries in the [[STL (file format)|STL file format]] or geometrically primitive forms (e.g. ball, cylinder, cone) and their union, intersection and difference
* Very fast voxelization: 600&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 1 minute
* Handling non-watertight surfaces
* Memory-friendly using [[octree]]s
* [[Load balancing (computing)|Load distribution]] for parallel execution with MPI and OpenMP.
 
The automatic grid generation can assume both an STL file as well as primitive geometries. For the geometry, a uniform and rectangular grid is created which encloses the entire space of the geometry. The superfluous grid cells are then removed and the remaining cuboids are shrunk to fit the given geometry. Finally, the grid is distributed to different threads or processors for the parallel execution of the simulation. The boundary conditions and start values can be set using material numbers.

==Puli spacecraft==
The Puli [[spacecraft]] was planned to be finished by 2014. It was planned to be launched by a commercial [[carrier rocket]], and to reach the [[Moon]] on its own.

In the team's early concept traveling on the [[lunar surface]] was planned to be achieved by changing the spherical lander's [[center of mass]], making it roll. Later they redesigned the rover to run on four "wheg" (wheel of legs) structures. During 2012 the second, bigger rover of that concept (Iteration 2) was constructed and underwent running tests.

'''[[Royal Research Ship|RRS]] ''Sir David Attenborough''''' is a [[research vessel]] owned by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]], to be operated by the [[British Antarctic Survey]] for the purposes of both research and logistic support.&lt;ref name=bas&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/ship/new-uk-polar-research-vessel/ |title=The next generation of polar research vessel |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=British Antarctic Survey |access-date=6 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509021803/https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/ship/new-uk-polar-research-vessel/ |archivedate=9 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the ship is intended to replace a pair of existing vessels, {{ship|RRS|James Clark Ross}} and {{ship|RRS|Ernest Shackleton}}.&lt;ref name=BBC44828136&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44828136 |title=Sir David Attenborough polar ship set for launch |first=Jonathon |last=Amos |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel is named after famed broadcaster and naturalist [[David Attenborough]], and is currently being fitted out.

==Background==
In 2014, the [[UK Government]] announced funding for the construction of a new polar research vessel for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) to replace a pair of existing ships.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt; This new ship was intended not only to be fully equipped with the latest instrumentation for the purposes of carrying out research in polar regions, for which it would have an improved [[icebreaker|icebreaking]] capability and greater endurance over the existing polar research vessel, but also to serve as a logistic support vessel for BAS teams in inshore locations.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt;

BAS contracted [[Houlder Line|Houlder Ltd]] to undertake the basic design in which suggestions for the final configuration of the new ship were taken. Following the consultation period, in 2015, [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]] was selected to execute the detailed design and [[Cammell Laird]] in [[Birkenhead]] was selected as the preferred bidder to construct the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/merseyside-beats-global-competition-to-build-200-million-polar-research-ship|title=Merseyside beats global competition to build £200&amp;nbsp;million polar research ship|work=UK Government|date=12 October 2015|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
The ship will be about {{convert|125|m|ft}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of about {{convert|24|m|ft}}. The [[Draft (hull)|draught]] will be about {{convert|7|m|ft}} with a planned cruising speed of {{convert|13|kn}} with a range of {{convert|19000|nmi}} at that speed. She will be capable of carrying a [[helicopter]] and will have a capacity for approximately {{convert|900|m3|cuft}} of cargo. Accommodation will be provided for 30 crew and 60 research staff.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt;

''Sir David Attenborough'' will have a twin-shaft hybrid [[diesel-electric]] propulsion system. The vessel's power plant will consist of two {{convert|3600|kW|hp|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[straight-six engine|6-cylinder]] [[Bergen Marine|Bergen]] B33:45L6A and two {{convert|5400|kW|hp|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[straight-nine engine|9-cylinder]] Bergen B33:45L9A main diesel generators, a {{convert|885|kW|hp|adj=on|abbr=on}} harbor generator and two 2,500{{nbsp}}kW battery systems. The power plant, which can run with different configurations depending on the mission and operating conditions, produces electricity to four {{convert|2750|kW|hp|adj=on|abbr=on}} asynchronous electric motors driving two 5-bladed [[controllable pitch propeller]]s. This gives ''Sir David Attenborough'' a maximum speed of {{convert|17.5|kn}} in open water and ability to break up to {{convert|1|m|ft|adj=on}} thick level ice at a speed of {{convert|3|kn}}.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt; At an economical cruising speed of {{convert|13|kn}}, she will have an operating range of {{convert|19000|nmi}}. For maneuvering and [[dynamic positioning]], the vessel will have four {{convert|1580|kW|hp|adj=on|abbr=on}} Tees White Gill thrusters, two in the bow and two in the stern.&lt;ref name="cl_datasheet" /&gt;

The vessel will be strengthened according to the [[International Association of Classification Societies]] (IACS) ''Unified Requirements for Polar Class Ships''. Her ice class, [[Polar Class 4]], is intended for year-round operation in thick first-year ice which may include old ice inclusions. However, her propulsion system is rated for ''Polar Class 5'' which is intended for medium first-year ice.&lt;ref name="cl_datasheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;[http://www.iacs.org.uk/document/public/Publications/Unified_requirements/PDF/UR_I_pdf410.pdf Unified Requirements for Polar Class ships] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iacs.org.uk%2Fdocument%2Fpublic%2FPublications%2FUnified_requirements%2FPDF%2FUR_I_pdf410.pdf&amp;date=2012-09-11 |date=11 September 2012 }}. International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), April 2016. {{retrieved|accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The first steel for the construction of the ship was cut in July 2016. The keel laying ceremony for the ship, [[yard number]] 1390, took place on 17 October 2016.&lt;ref name=BBC37648915&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37648915 |title=Ceremony to mark start of Attenborough polar ship construction |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship will be constructed by combining individually fabricated blocks, much like the [[Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier | ''Queen Elizabeth''-class aircraft carrier]]s. The majority of the blocks will be manufactured by [[Cammell Laird]] at [[Birkenhead]], but due to a tight schedule, the [[stern]] of the ship (named 'Block 10') was fabricated at the [[A&amp;P Group]] on the [[River Tyne]]. The section was transported to [[Merseyside]] on a [[barge]] in August 2017. The stern section was loaded onto the barge by heavy lifting company [[ALE (company)|ALE]], using [[Self Propelled Modular Trailer|self-propelled modular trailers (SPMT)]]. The same procedure in reverse was then used to get the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] segment on to the [[slipway]] at Birkenhead.&lt;ref name=BBC40999836&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-40999836 |title=RRS Sir David Attenborough's stern on the move |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hull of ''Sir David Attenborough'' was named by her namesake and launched on 14 July 2018. She was moved into a wet dock for the addition of her superstructure and fitting out.&lt;ref name=LE14907916&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/business/live-launch-major-new-ship-14907916 |title=Live: Launch of major new ship the Sir David Attenborough at Cammell Laird |first=Alastair |last=Houghton |publisher=Reach PLC |work=Liverpool Echo |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship is scheduled to be completed by October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=British Antarctic Survey|title=British Antarctic Survey|date=2018-01-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKhFnkvNc0I&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ramboll.co.uk/news/ruk/polar-preparations-progress|title=The RRS Sir David Attenborough: Polar preparations progress|work=United Kingdom|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This quickly became the most popular choice and was the runaway winner when the poll closed, with 124,109 votes.&lt;ref name=bbcpoll /&gt; The name has been described as a homage to "Hooty McOwlface", an owl named through an "Adopt-A-Bird" program in 2012 that became popular on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boaty McBoatface tops poll but will vote be scuppered?|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boaty-mcboatface-tops-poll-but-will-vote-be-scuppered-mmgddzn9z|work=The Times|author=Tom Whipple|url-access=limited|quote=Yet the runaway winner was RSS Boaty McBoatface, itself an homage to the owl that was named Hooty McOwlface after a similar exercise.|date=16 April 2016|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 2016, British science minister [[Jo Johnson]] announced that the choice had been made to name the ship after naturalist Sir [[David Attenborough]], but that ''[[Boaty McBoatface]]'' would be the name of one of ''David Attenborough''{{'s}} remotely controlled [[submersibles]].&lt;ref name=nerc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2016/18-ship/|title=£200m polar research ship named in honour of Sir David Attenborough|website=NERC|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/05/06/boatymcboatface-to-live-on-as-yellow-submarine-science-minister/|title=‘BoatyMcBoatface’ to live on as yellow submarine, science minister Jo Johnson announces|first=Sarah|last=Knapton|date=6 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A petition calling for Sir David Attenborough to change his name to Sir Boaty McBoatface "in the interest of democracy and humour" soon received over 3,800 signatures.&lt;ref name=ITV2016-05-08a&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-05-08/petition-for-david-attenborough-to-be-renamed-boaty-mcboatface/ |title=Petition for David Attenborough to be renamed 'Boaty McBoatface'|publisher=[[ITV News]]|date=8 May 2016|accessdate=10 May 2016|quote=The author, Mr Jackson, wrote: ...

In response to the poll, the [[Science and Technology Committee (House of Lords)|Science and Technology Committee]], a [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] of the [[House of Lords]], announced that they were to review the process by which the ship was named. NERC chief executive Professor [[Duncan Wingham]] and NERC head of communications Julia Maddock faced the committee on 10 May. Professor James Wilsdon, an outreach director at [[Sheffield University]], told MPs that he voted for ''Boaty McBoatface''. Despite the controversy, NERC directors felt that their poll was a successful initiative in that it generated a lot of publicity regarding their organisation and research mission among the lay public.&lt;ref name="wilsdon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloom|first1=Dan|title='I voted for Boaty McBoatface' Top scientist stuns MPs with surprise confession|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i-voted-boaty-mcboatface-top-7938473|accessdate=13 May 2016|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spain|Spanish]] [[Internet troll]]s promoted the choice ''[[Blas de Lezo]]'', a Spanish Admiral who gave a humiliating defeat to the British Navy in 1741. The organisers removed the option, which gathered more than 38,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cereceda |first=Rafael |date=31 March 2016 |title=How Spanish trolls tried to sink a British boat competition |url=http://www.euronews.com/2016/03/31/how-spanish-trolls-tried-to-sink-a-british-boat-competition |work=Euronews |access-date=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on popular culture===
On 12 May 2016, Google released a [[Natural language parsing|natural language parser]] named ''Parsey McParseface'' in reference to the boat naming contest, as part of their [[open-source]] [[SyntaxNet]] [[neural network]] framework.&lt;ref name=Parser&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/announcing-syntaxnet-worlds-most.html |title=Announcing SyntaxNet: The World’s Most Accurate Parser Goes Open Source |publisher=Google Research Blog |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] formally named its new stealth bomber currently under development as the [[Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider|Northrop Grumman B-21 "Raider"]].  The name was chosen through a survey of [[Airman#United States Air Force|airmen]]; among the rejected names was "Stealthy McStealthface".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Air Force Names B-21 Stealth Bomber ‘Raider’|url=http://aviationweek.com/defense/us-air-force-names-b-21-stealth-bomber-raider|website=Aviation Week|first=James|last=Drew|date=September 19, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1942">In [[population ecology]], a '''regulating factor''' is something that keeps a [[population]] at [[Punctuated equilibrium|equilibrium]] (neither increasing nor decreasing in size over time).

An example of a regulating factor would be [[food supply]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=The Significance of Limiting and Regulating Factors on the Demography of Moose and White-Tailed Deer
|author=Francois Messier
|journal=The Journal of Animal Ecology

|pages=377–393
|doi=10.2307/5285
|jstor=5285
}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the population increases to a certain size, there will be less food for each organism. This will lead to fewer [[births]] (a decrease in [[fecundity]]) and more [[deaths]], making a negative [[population growth rate|growth rate]]. As there are now fewer [[animal]]s, the amount of food for each organism will increase, meaning the growth rate will become positive. This would lead to a large population size again, and the cycle would start over. Therefore, food is a regulating factor in this scenario, as food supply keeps the population at relative equilibrium.

All regulating factors are [[Population density|density]]-dependent, meaning they keep populations at equilibrium by counteracting fluctuations in population size per unit area (or per unit volume for species living within three dimensional environments, such as water).  Other regulating factors of the human population at present are [[drinking water]] supply, amount of arable land (obviously a more fundamental term for food), [[air pollution]] and prevalence of communicable disease.  The major regulating factor for the human population in current times is inadequacy of safe [[drinking water]], since waterborne disease is the principal environmental cause of mortality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10497">A '''research design''' is the set of methods and procedures used in collecting and analyzing measures of the variables specified in the research problem [[research]]. The design of a study defines the study type (descriptive, correlation, semi-experimental, experimental, review, meta-analytic) and sub-type (e.g., descriptive-longitudinal [[case study]]), [[research problem]], [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Dependent and independent variables|independent and dependent variables]], [[Design of experiments|experimental design]], and, if applicable, data collection methods and a statistical analysis plan. A research design is a framework that has been created to find answers to research questions.

==Design types and sub-types==
There are many ways to classify research designs, but sometimes the distinction is artificial and other times different designs are combined. Nonetheless, the list below offers a number of useful distinctions between possible research designs. A research design is an arrangement of conditions or collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2591803'' Muaz, Jalil Mohammad (2013), Practical Guidelines for conducting research. Summarizing good research practice in line with the DCED Standard'']&lt;/ref&gt;

*Descriptives (e.g., [[case-study]], [[naturalistic observation]], [[Survey methodology|survey]])
*Correlational (e.g., [[case-control study]], [[observational study]])
*Semi-experimental (e.g., [[field experiment]], [[quasi-experiment]])
*Experimental ([[Experiment#Controlled experiments|experiment]] with random assignment)
*Review ([[literature review]], [[systematic review]])
*Meta-analytic ([[meta-analysis]])

Sometimes a distinction is made between "fixed" and "flexible" designs. In some cases, these types coincide with [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] research designs respectively,&lt;ref&gt;Robson, C. (1993). Real-world research: A resource for social scientists and practitioner-researchers. Malden: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; though this need not be the case. In fixed designs, the design of the study is fixed before the main stage of data collection takes place. Fixed designs are normally theory-driven; otherwise, it is impossible to know in advance which variables need to be controlled and measured. Often, these variables are measured quantitatively. Flexible designs allow for more freedom during the data collection process. One reason for using a flexible research design can be that the variable of interest is not quantitatively measurable, such as culture. In other cases, the theory might not be available before one starts the research.

===Grouping===
The choice of how to group participants depends on the research hypothesis and on how the participants are [[sampling (statistics)|sampled]]. In a typical experimental study, there will be at least one "experimental" condition (e.g., "treatment") and one "control" condition ("no treatment"), but the appropriate method of grouping may depend on factors such as the duration of measurement phase and participant characteristics:

*[[Cohort study]]
*[[Cross-sectional study]]
*[[Cross-sequential study]]
*[[Longitudinal study]]

==Confirmatory versus exploratory research==

'''Confirmatory''' research tests ''a priori'' hypotheses — outcome predictions that are made before the measurement phase begins. Such ''a priori'' hypotheses are usually derived from a theory or the results of previous studies. The advantage of confirmatory research is that the result is more meaningful, in the sense that it is much harder to claim that a certain result is generalizable beyond the data set. The reason for this is that in confirmatory research, one ideally strives to reduce the probability of falsely reporting a coincidental result as meaningful. This probability is known as [[Statistical significance|α-level]] or the probability of a [[Type I and type II errors|type I error]]. 

'''Exploratory''' research, on the other hand, seeks to generate ''a posteriori'' hypotheses by examining a data-set and looking for potential relations between variables. It is also possible to have an idea about a relation between variables but to lack knowledge of the direction and strength of the relation. If the researcher does not have any specific hypotheses beforehand, the study is exploratory with respect to the variables in question (although it might be confirmatory for others). The advantage of exploratory research is that it is easier to make new discoveries due to the less stringent methodological restrictions. Here, the researcher does not want to miss a potentially interesting relation and therefore aims to minimize the probability of rejecting a ''real'' effect or relation; this probability is sometimes referred to as β and the associated error is of [[Type I and type II errors|type II]]. In other words, if the researcher simply wants to see whether some measured variables could be related, he would want to increase the chances of finding a significant result by lowering the threshold of what is deemed to be ''significant''.

Sometimes, a researcher may conduct exploratory research but report it as if it had been confirmatory ('Hypothesizing After the Results are Known', HARKing—see [[Hypotheses suggested by the data]]); this is a questionable research practice bordering on fraud.

==State problems versus process problems==

A distinction can be made between state problems and process problems. State problems aim to answer what the state of a phenomenon is at a given time, while process problems deal with the change of phenomena over time. Examples of state problems are the level of mathematical skills of sixteen-year-old children or the level, computer skills of the elderly, the depression level of a person, etc. Examples of process problems are the development of mathematical skills from puberty to adulthood, the change in computer skills when people get older and how depression symptoms change during therapy.

State problems are easier to measure than process problems. State problems just require one measurement of the phenomena of interest, while process problems always require multiple measurements. Research designs such as repeated measurements and longitudinal study are needed to address process problems.

==Examples of fixed designs==
===Experimental research designs===
{{See also|Experiment}}

In an experimental design, the researcher actively tries to change the situation, circumstances, or experience of participants (manipulation), which may lead to a change in behaviour or outcomes for the participants of the study. The researcher randomly assigns participants to different conditions, measures the variables of interest and tries to control for [[Confounding|confounding variables]]. Therefore, experiments are often highly fixed even before the [[data collection]] starts.

In a good [[Design of experiments|experimental design]], a few things are of great importance. First of all, it is necessary to think of the best way to operationalize the variables that will be measured, as well as which statistical methods would be most appropriate to answer the research question. Thus, the researcher should consider what the expectations of the study are as well as how to analyse any potential results. Finally, in an experimental design, the researcher must think of the practical limitations including the availability of participants as well as how representative the participants are to the target population. It is important to consider each of these factors before beginning the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adèr, H. J.]], [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|Mellenbergh, G. J.]], &amp; Hand, D. J. (2008). Advising on research methods: a consultant's companion. Huizen: Johannes van Kessel Publishing. {{ISBN|978-90-79418-01-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many researchers employ power analysis before they conduct an experiment, in order to determine how large the sample must be to find an effect of a given size with a given design at the desired probability of making a [[Type I and type II errors|Type I or Type II error]].

===Non-experimental research designs===

Non-experimental research designs do not involve a manipulation of the situation, circumstances or experience of the participants. Non-experimental research designs can be broadly classified into three categories. First, in relational designs, a range of variables are measured. These designs are also called correlation studies because correlation data are most often used in the analysis. Since [[correlation does not imply causation]], such studies simply identify co-movements of variables. Correlational designs are helpful in identifying the relation of one variable to another, and seeing the frequency of co-occurrence in two natural groups (''See [[correlation and dependence]]''). The second type is [[comparative research]]. These designs compare two or more groups on one or more variable, such as the effect of gender on grades. The third type of non-experimental research is a longitudinal design. A longitudinal design examines variables such as performance exhibited by a group or groups over time. ''See [[Longitudinal study]].''

==Examples of flexible research designs==

===Case study===
{{See also|Case study}} 
Famous case studies are for example the descriptions about the patients of Freud, who were thoroughly analysed and described.

Bell (1999) states “a case study approach is particularly appropriate for individual researchers because it gives an opportunity for one aspect of a problem to be studied in some depth within a limited time scale”.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J. (1999). Doing your research project. Buckingham: OUP.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnographic study===
{{See also|Ethnography}}
This type of research is involved with a group, organization, culture, or community. Normally the researcher shares a lot of time with the group.

===Grounded theory study===

[[Grounded theory]] research is a systematic research process that works to develop "a process, and action or an interaction about a substantive topic".&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2012).  Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Residential Cluster Development''', or '''[[open space development]]''', is the grouping of residential properties on a development site in order to use the extra land as open space, recreation or agriculture.  It is increasingly becoming popular in [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision development]] because it allows the developer to spend much less on land and obtain much the same price per unit as for detached houses.  The shared garden areas can be a source of conflict however.  Claimed advantages include more green/[[public space]], closer community, and an optimal storm water management. Cluster development often encounters planning objections. 

According to [[William H. Whyte]], the author of “Cluster Development” there are two types of cluster development. [[Townhouse]] development and super development. Examples of townhouse development include [[Morrell Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], Hartshone in Richmond, and Dudley Square in Shreveport. Examples of Super Development include [[Reston, Virginia]], [[Crofton, Maryland]], and Americana Fairfax in Virginia.

==Background==
In many ways cluster development has been practiced since the earliest communities — from the medieval village to the [[New England town]]. However, it wasn’t formalized as a modern concept until the onset of [[suburban sprawl]] and ubiquity of [[detached house]] developments. The idea of a Cluster development was created as the alternative to the ‘conventional subdivision’. The first conscious application of a Cluster development was in [[Radburn, New Jersey]] in 1928. Though it was based on English planning and [[Ebenezer Howard]]’s Garden Cities movement, it used principles of cluster development. Following Radburn, many other towns in New Jersey applied those principles to their planning notably the ‘village green’ in [[Hillsborough, NJ]] and Brunswick Hill in South Brunswick.  In the rest of the country the use of cluster development grew in principally in Maryland and Virginia; notably in Reston and American Fairfax County.

Currently cluster development is applied all over the United States. There is particularly a strong push for it in the Midwestern states that have had significant problems with large lot suburban sprawl, such as Minnesota, Illinois, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

==What is Cluster Development?==
Cluster Development, also known as [[conservation development]], is a site planning approach that is an alternative to conventional subdivision development. It is a practice of Low Impact Development that groups residential properties in a proposed subdivision closer together in order to utilize the rest of the land for open space, recreation or agriculture. Cluster development differs from a [[planned unit development]] (PUD) due to the fact that a PUD contains a mix of residential, commercial, industrial, or other uses, whereas the cluster development primarily focuses on residential area. &lt;ref&gt;Whyte, William. Clust Development&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of cluster development is to:
#promote integrated site design that is considerate to the natural features and topography
#protect environmentally sensitive areas of the development site, as well as permanently preserve important natural features, prime agricultural land, and open space
#minimize non-point source pollution through reducing the area of [[impervious surface]]s on site
#encourage saving costs on infrastructure and maintenance through practices such as decreasing the area that needs to be paved and the decreasing distance that utilities need to be run
#the primary purpose is to create more area for open space, recreation and more social interaction&lt;ref&gt;Smart Growth Codes 2.0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Thanks to there being more porous ground coverings and fewer impervious surfaces such as asphalt and concrete, the risk of flooding and erosion from stormwater is reduced.  Economical benefits of cluster development can include there being less infrastructure to build— fewer roads, sewers, and utility lines.  The higher density of the clusters of housing also tends to mean more efficiency for services such as public transit, and can also promote increased bicycle usage and the encouragement of pedestrians.  The extra open space made available by this type of development leaves room for parks, trails, and [[community-supported agriculture]].

==Issues==
Following World War II, migration from the cities to suburbs became a dominant trend in America. People were acquiring any land they could find; as a result developers attempted to squeeze as many lots as they could on development sites. Communities then developed zoning regulations to limit the number of units and density allowed on a site. Though this zoning protected land for communities and to an extent preserved land from development, it was what ultimately led to the suburban sprawl as we know it today.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, William. Cluster Development&lt;/ref&gt; It is this zoning that cluster development attempts to amend, and is the primary issue it faces.

Most municipalities have established zoning which restricts developers, planning boards and communities to use only this conventional subdivision development. Thus, the practice of traditional development is difficult to change because of the set standard, familiarly of the procedure, and the fear of undertaking something new. In response to this, groups such as the [[American Planning Association]] have developed a model ordinance that provides the framework for cluster development. This ordinance is not difficult to implement administratively, but politically, it is problematic because of conservative resistance.

People's perception of personal space has a large part to do with this resistance. Many cases people chose to live in suburbs with the intention of having a large lot property; therefore, it is hard to convince those individuals to live closer together. Convincing people to accept small lot sizes and higher density living remains one of the biggest obstacles of cluster development. This obstacle can be mostly overcome with proper site design, which grants homes unobstructed views and effective private space. As well as educating people about the benefits of having better community and open space can serve as encouragement to change perceptions.

An additional obstacle to cluster development is the difficulty for creating small lot sizes when no municipal sewer system is in place. When septic systems are used, enough land needs to be available on each building lot for a leach field (sometimes land is required for two leach fields, the additional land set aside as a back-up). The amount of land needed is in proportion to the size of the septic system and the soil conditions, which must allow for the percolation of wastewater safely into the ground. In areas where well water is used, additional lot area may be required to sufficiently separate the well from the leach field. This can lead to minimum lot sizes of {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} or more, making cluster development difficult.

However, installing a package wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for the development (which acts as a small cluster plant, eliminating the need for individual septic tanks) or using biofilters with each septic system make smaller lot sizes acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Larz. Planning the Built Environment&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, providing a package WWTP reduces the diameter and depth of collection sewer lines for the cluster, thus reducing the overall cost of infrastructure. 

The final primary issue with cluster development is the issue of dealing with open, recreational, and agricultural space. These areas serve as benefits in many respects but are also issues that are required to be dealt with. The maintenance of open and recreational space requires the formation of home owners associations that necessitate fees for taxes, insurance and general upkeep. This would not be necessary under a typical subdivision, but people would have their own maintenance expenses. As to agriculture: people enjoying living next to it until there is a need to apply fertilizer or pesticides. This fact cannot be avoided, but through proper use of cluster development, there can be wider gaps and barriers between agricultural land and residential properties, which would limit exposure to unwanted byproducts.

==Application==
The model ordinance for cluster development is section 4.7 in the Smart Growth Codes, issued by the American Planning Association. Along with introducing the concept of residential cluster development, the ordinance outlines the process of application, [[site planning]] and implementation. 

The primary requisites for application of cluster development are that all principal or accessory uses are allowed and that multifamily dwelling, duplexes, and townhouses are permitted. As well the application of maximal lot coverage, floor area ratios, building height, and parking requirements to the entire site as opposed to the individual lot. Provisions of a cluster development require that the site is at least 2 to {{convert|5|acre|m2}} and there is no minimum to lot dimensions; furthermore each house can be no more than {{convert|12|ft|m}} from the street with yard that is at least {{convert|25|ft|m}}. There also needs to be the ability to place more than one principal building on each lot, and lastly no less than 25% of the site is used for open space. 

Included in the application, the site plan is required to consist of the street and sidewalk layout, the maximum number and type of dwelling units proposed, and how much area they will occupy, with calculations; as well as the area of parking, open space, and other accessories. To calculate the permitted amount of dwellings, one must measure the gross area of the site in acres and tenths of an acre, then subtract the gross area of the public and private streets and public dedicated improvement; the remainder will be the build able area. Then divide the net build able area by the smallest minimum lot size; round this number to the nearest lower number and the figure will be the maximum number of units.

==Design Features==
There are various distinct design features in cluster development notably: the consideration of natural features/topography, smaller lot size, the use of cul-de-sacs, and the use of certain waste/storm water management techniques.

Along with site design, waste/storm water management design features are a principle aspect of cluster development. Through the maximizing of over land water flow and the strategic use of landforms and plants to slow, hold, and treat runoff it is possible to handle the majority of storm water. As well, there many options in dealing with waste water; techniques such as community drain fields, irrigation systems, and package plants can dramatically reduce the cost of infrastructure, and improve the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rheopecty''' or '''rheopexy''' is the rare property of some [[non-Newtonian fluid]]s to show a time-dependent increase in [[viscosity]] ([[time-dependent viscosity]]); the longer the fluid undergoes [[shearing force]], the higher its viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/22880407&lt;/ref&gt; Rheopectic fluids, such as some [[lubricant]]s, thicken or solidify when shaken. The opposite and much more common type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called [[thixotropy]].

Examples of rheopectic fluids include [[gypsum]] pastes and printer [[ink]]s. In the body [[synovial fluid]] exhibits the extraordinary property of inverse thixotropy or rheopexy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Neill |first=p.l |date=1996 |title=The Inverse Thixotropic Behaviour of Synovial Fluid |url=http://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/the-inverse-thixotropic-behaviour-of-synovial-fluid(3352d9b1-b3a5-4e7c-95d1-5cc4a04d86e8).html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is ongoing research into new ways to make and use rheopectic materials. There is great interest in possible military uses of this technology. Moreover, the high end of the [[sports]] market has also begun to respond to it. [[Body armor]] and combat vehicle armor are key areas where efforts are being made to use rheopectic materials. Work is also being done to use these materials in other kinds of protective equipment, which is seen as potentially useful to reduce apparent impact stress in [[track and field athletics|athletics]], [[motor sports]], [[transportation]] accidents, and all forms of [[parachuting]]. In particular, [[footwear]] with rheopectic [[shock absorption]] is being pursued as a [[dual-use technology]]  that can provide better support to those who must frequently run, leap, climb, or descend.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Confusion between rheopectic and dilatant fluids==
An incorrect example often used to demonstrate rheopecty is [[cornstarch]] mixed with water, which is a very viscous, white fluid. It is a cheap and simple demonstrator, which can be picked up by hand as a semi-solid, but flows easily when not under pressure. However, cornstarch in water is actually a [[dilatant]] fluid, since it does not show the time-dependent, shear-induced change required in order to be labeled rheopectic. These terms are often and easily confused since the terms are rarely used; a true rheopectic fluid would when shaken be liquid at first, becoming thicker as shaking continued.

Just as the opposite behaviour of becoming thinner with time is [[thixotropy|thixotropism]] (time dependent [[pseudoplastic]] behaviour), rheopectic behaviour may be described as time-dependent dilatant behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sato |first=Tatsuo |date=August 1995 |title=Rheology of suspensions |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA17471415&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=9ebe594d3119d8f1994b55c83c35264e |journal=The Journal of Coatings Technology |page=69 |doi= |pmid= |access-date=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">A '''scientific wager''' is a [[Gambling|wager]] whose outcome is settled by [[scientific method]]. They typically consist of an offer to pay a certain sum of money on the scientific proof or disproof of some currently-uncertain statement. Some wagers have specific date restrictions for collection, but many are open. Wagers occasionally exert a powerful galvanizing effect on society and the scientific community.

Notable scientists who have made scientific wagers include [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Richard Feynman]]. [[Stanford Linear Accelerator]] has an open book containing about 35 bets in [[particle physics]] dating back to 1980; many are still unresolved.

== Notable scientific wagers ==
{{Prose|section|date=September 2016}}
* In 1870, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] bet a [[Flat Earth|flat-Earth theorist]] named [[John Hampden (flat earther)|John Hampden]] that he could prove the flat Earth hypothesis incorrect. The sum staked was £500 (equivalent to about £{{inflation|UK|500|1870|r=-3}} in present-day terms{{inflation-fn|UK}}). A test (now known as the [[Bedford Level experiment]]) involving a stretch of the [[Old Bedford River]], in [[Norfolk]], was agreed on: Wallace measured the curvature of the canal's surface using two markers separated by about {{convert|5|km|mi}} and suspended at equal heights above the water's surface. Using a [[telescope]] mounted 5&amp;nbsp;km from one of the markers, Wallace established that the nearer one appeared to be the higher of the two. An independent referee agreed that this showed the Earth's surface to curve away from the telescope, and so Wallace won his money. However, Hampden never accepted the result and made increasingly unpleasant threats to Wallace.
* In 1975, [[physical cosmology|cosmologist]] [[Stephen Hawking]] bet fellow cosmologist [[Kip Thorne]] a subscription to [[Penthouse magazine|''Penthouse'' magazine]] for Thorne against four years of ''[[Private Eye]]'' for him that [[Cygnus X-1]] would turn out to not be a [[black hole]]. In 1990, Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet. Hawking's explanation for his position was that if black holes didn't actually exist much of his research would be incorrect, but at least he'd have the consolation of winning the bet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Stephen Hawking |year=1997 |title=Black Holes |medium=VHS |language=English | publisher= New River Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1978, chess International Master [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]] won £1250 from four [[artificial intelligence]] experts by never losing a match to a chess program in a ten-year span from 1968 to 1978.
* In 1980, [[biology|biologist]] [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] bet [[economics|economist]] [[Julian Lincoln Simon]] that the price of a portfolio of $200 of each of five mineral commodities ([[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]]) would rise over the next 10 years. He lost, and paid the amount the total price had declined: $576.07. See: [[Simon–Ehrlich wager]]
* In 1997, [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Kip Thorne]] made a bet with [[John Preskill]] on the ultimate resolution of the apparent contradiction between [[Hawking radiation]] resulting in loss of [[information]], and a requirement of [[quantum mechanics]] that information cannot be destroyed. Hawking and Thorne bet that information must be lost in a black hole; Preskill bet that it must not. The formal wager was: "When an initial pure [[quantum state]] undergoes [[gravitational collapse]] to form a black hole, the final state at the end of black hole evaporation will always be a pure quantum state". The stake was an [[encyclopaedia]] of the winner's choice, from which "information can be recovered at will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capri|first=Anton Z|title=From Quanta to Quarks: More Anecdotal History of Physics|year=2007|publisher=World Scientific|location=Hackensack, NJ|isbn=978-981-270-916-5|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking conceded the bet in 2004, giving a baseball encyclopaedia to John Preskill. Thorne has not formally conceded. See: [[Thorne-Hawking-Preskill bet]]
* In 2005, British climate scientist [[James Annan]] proposed bets with [[climate change denial|global warming denialists]] concerning whether future temperatures will increase. Two Russian solar physicists, Galina Mashnich and Vladimir Bashkirtsev, accepted the wager of US$10,000 that the average global temperature during 2012–2017 would be lower than during 1998–2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jim|last=Giles|title=Climate sceptics place bets on world cooling down|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|doi=10.1038/436897a|pmid=16107801|year=2005|volume=436|issue=7053|page=897|url=http://www.nature.com/search/executeSearch?sp-q=james+annan+sceptic&amp;sp-c=10&amp;sp-x-9=cat&amp;sp-s=date&amp;sp-q-9=NATURE&amp;submit=go&amp;sp-a=sp1001702d&amp;sp-sfvl-field=subject%7Cujournal&amp;sp-x-1=ujournal&amp;sp-p-1=phrase&amp;sp-p=all|bibcode = 2005Natur.436..897G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Annan first directly challenged [[Richard Lindzen]]. Lindzen had been willing to bet that global temperatures would drop over the next 20 years. Annan says that Lindzen wanted odds of 50–1 against falling temperatures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4953">[[Statistics]], like all mathematical disciplines, does not [[infer]] valid conclusions from nothing. Inferring interesting conclusions about real [[statistical population]]s almost always requires some background assumptions. Those assumptions must be made carefully, because incorrect assumptions can generate wildly inaccurate conclusions.

Here are some examples of statistical assumptions.

*[[Independence (probability theory)|Independence]] of observations from each other (this assumption is an especially common error&lt;ref&gt;Kruskall, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;).
*Independence of observational error from potential [[confounding]] effects.
*Exact or approximate [[Normal distribution|normality]] of observations (or errors).
*Linearity of graded responses to quantitative stimuli, e.g. in [[linear regression]].

==Classes of assumptions==
There are two approaches to [[statistical inference]]: ''model-based inference'' and ''design-based inference''.&lt;ref&gt;Koch G. G., Gillings D. B. (2006), "Inference, design-based vs. model-based", ''[[Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences]]'' (editor&amp;mdash;Kotz S.), [[Wiley-Interscience]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, 2006, ch.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Gruijter et al., 2006, &amp;sect;2.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Both approaches rely on some [[statistical model]] to represent the data-generating process. In the model-based approach, the model is taken to be initially unknown, and one of the goals is to [[model selection|select]] an appropriate model for inference. In the design-based approach, the model is taken to be known, and one of the goals is to ensure that the sample data are selected randomly enough for inference.

Statistical assumptions can be put into two classes, depending upon which approach to inference is used.
*Model-based assumptions. These include the following three types:
**Distributional assumptions. Where a [[statistical model]] involves terms relating to [[random errors]], assumptions may be made about the [[probability distribution]] of these errors.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 1990, &amp;sect;3.4.1&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the distributional assumption relates to the observations themselves.
**Structural assumptions. Statistical relationships between variables are often modelled by equating one variable to a function of another (or several others), plus a [[random error]]. Models often involve making a structural assumption about the form of the functional relationship, e.g. as in [[linear regression]]. This can be generalised to models involving relationships between underlying unobserved [[latent variable]]s.
**Cross-variation assumptions. These assumptions involve the [[joint probability distribution]]s of either the observations themselves or the random errors in a model. Simple models may include the assumption that observations or errors are [[statistically independent]].
*Design-based assumptions.  These relate to the way observations have been gathered, and often involve an assumption of [[randomization]] during [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]].&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 1990, &amp;sect;3.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Gruijter et al., 2006, &amp;sect;2.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The model-based approach is the most commonly used in statistical inference; the design-based approach is used mainly with [[survey sampling]]. With the model-based approach, all the assumptions are effectively encoded in the model.

==Checking assumptions==
Given that the validity of any conclusion drawn from a statistical inference depends on the validity of the assumptions made, it is clearly important that those assumptions should be reviewed at some stage. Some instances—for example where [[missing data|data are lacking]]—may require that researchers judge whether an assumption is reasonable. Researchers can expand this somewhat to consider what effect a departure from the assumptions might produce. Where more extensive data are available, various types of procedures for statistical model validation are available—e.g. for [[regression model validation]].

'''''The Discovery of Grounded Theory'''''  is a 1967 book ({{ISBN|0-202-30260-1}}) by [[Barney Glaser]] and [[Anselm Strauss]] on [[grounded theory]].

After their success with ''[[Awareness of Dying]]'', Glaser and Strauss decided to write a book on methodology. ''The Discovery of Grounded Theory'' was meant to invite and motivate people to use the newly developed methodology. Unlike later works, it does not provide much advice on how to put the theory into practice.

The authors had several goals in mind when writing the book:
* Legitimize [[qualitative research]]. Having a reference book by established authors helped students defend qualitative studies which were not widely accepted at the time.
* Criticize [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalists]] like [[Talcott Parsons]] and his student [[Robert K. Merton]] who in turn had been a teacher of Barney Glaser.
* Demonstrate the possibility of building theories from data, something that many qualitative researchers doubt to this day, instead choosing to stick with mere [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] descriptions.

'''''Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West''''' ({{ISBN|0684811073}}), written by [[Stephen Ambrose]], is a 1996 biography of [[Meriwether Lewis]] of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. The book is based on journals and letters written by Lewis, [[William Clark]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the members of the [[Corps of Discovery]]. While most of the book is dedicated to the expedition, several chapters are also devoted to Lewis's early life as a Virginia planter and Jefferson's personal secretary, and his later life as governor of the [[Louisiana Territory]] before his untimely death in 1809.

==Review==
The book outlines the expedition in detail including the route, interactions with Native Americans, [[List of species described by the Lewis and Clark Expedition|scientific discoveries, wildlife]], and landscape. As a biography the book is focused entirely on Lewis, and Clark, [[Sacagawea]] and the others are addressed principally in their interactions with Lewis. The expedition, and Lewis' life as a whole, is placed within the broader context of Jefferson's presidency, the opening of the American west, and early Indian Policy. The text is supplemented by maps and illustrations, including some drawn by Lewis himself.

The book was a #1. [[The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times Bestseller]] in 1996.

==TV adaptation==
In May 2014, [[HBO]] announced plans to produce a six-hour miniseries based on the book starring [[Casey Affleck]] as Meriwether Lewis and [[Matthias Schoenaerts]] as William Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/lewis-and-clark-hbo-miniseries-casey-affleck-brad-pitt-edward-norton-tom-hanks-1201419775/|website=Variety.com|accessdate=2015-01-15|title=HBO Greenlights ‘Lewis and Clark’ Miniseries From Edward Norton, Brad Pitt &amp; Tom Hanks|publisher=Variety|author=Elizabeth Wagmeister|date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VALS''' ("Values and Lifestyles")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vals Definition by SRI|url=https://www.sri.com/sites/default/timeline/timeline.php?timeline=business-entertainment#!&amp;innovation=vals-market-research}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proprietary research methodology used for [[psychographic]] [[market segmentation]]. VALS is a way of viewing people on the basis of their attitudes, needs, wants, beliefs and demographics. By using psychology to analyze and predict consumer preferences and choices, the VALS system constructs a link between personality traits and buying behavior.The system identifies current and future opportunities by segmenting the consumer market place on the basis of the personality traits that drive consumer behavior&lt;ref&gt;Raj, Mohan, M. Prasanna, and A. K. Sait. "Psychographic Profiling of Indian Young Adult Consumers of Smartphone-VALS Approach." Management Studies and Economic Systems 2, no. 2 (2015): 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==
VALS was developed in 1978 by social scientist and consumer futurist [[Arnold Mitchell]] and his colleagues at [[SRI International]]. It was immediately embraced by advertising agencies and is currently offered as a product of SRI's consulting services division. VALS draws heavily on the work of Harvard sociologist [[David Riesman]] and psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yankelovich|first=Daniel|title=Rediscovering Market Segmentation|author2=David Meer |journal=Harvard Business Review|date=February 6, 2006|pages=1–11|url=http://www.viewpointlearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/segmentation_0206.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell used statistics to identify attitudinal and [[demographic]] questions that helped categorize adult American consumers into one of nine lifestyle types: survivors (4%), sustainers (7%), belongers (35%), emulators (9%), achievers (22%), I-am-me (5%), experiential (7%), societally conscious (9%), and integrated (2%). The questions were weighted using data developed from a sample of 1,635 Americans and their [[significant other]]s, who responded to an SRI International survey in 1980.&lt;ref name=ACR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beatty|first=Sharon E.|author2=Pamela M. Homer |author3=Lynn R. Kahle |title=Problems With Vals in International Marketing Research: an Example From an Application of the Empirical Mirror Technique|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|year=1988|volume=15|pages=375–380|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/display.asp?id=6655|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main dimensions of the VALS framework are resources (the [[Y-axis|vertical dimension]]) and primary motivation (the [[X-axis|horizontal dimension]]). The vertical dimension segments people based on the degree to which they are [[innovative]] and have resources such as [[income]], [[education]], [[self-confidence]], [[intelligence]], leadership skills, and energy. The horizontal dimension represents primary motivations and includes three distinct types:

* Consumers driven by [[knowledge]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] are motivated primarily by ''[[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]]''. These consumers include groups called Thinkers and Believers.
* Consumers driven by demonstrating success to their peers are motivated primarily by ''achievement''. These consumers include groups referred to as Achievers and Strivers.
* Consumers driven by a desire for [[social]] or [[physical activity]], variety, and risk taking are motivated primarily by ''self-expression''. These consumers include the groups known as Experiencers and Makers.

At the top of the rectangle are the [[Innovator]]s, who have such high resources that they could have any of the three primary motivations. At the bottom of the rectangle are the Survivors, who live complacently and within their means without a strong primary motivation of the types listed above. The VALS Framework gives more details about each of the groups.

==VALS2==
Researchers faced some problems with the VALS method, and in response, SRI developed the VALS2 programme in 1978; additionally, SRI significantly revised it in 1989. VALS2 places less emphasis on activities and interests and more on a psychological base to tap relatively enduring attitudes and values. The VALS2 program has two dimensions. The first dimension, Self-orientation, determines the type of goals and behaviours that individuals will pursue, and refers to patterns of attitudes and activities which help individuals reinforce, sustain, or modify their social self-image. This is a fundamental human need. 

The second dimension, Resources, reflects the ability of individuals to pursue their dominant self-orientation and includes full-range of physical, psychological, demographic, and material means such as self-confidence, interpersonal skills, inventiveness, intelligence, eagerness to buy, money, position, education, etc. According to VALS 2, a consumer purchases certain products and services because the individual is a specific type of person. The purchase is believed to reflect a consumer’s lifestyle, which is a function of self–orientation and resources. 

In 1991, the name VALS2 was switched back to VALS, because of [[brand equity]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VALS™ Survey Help|url=http://ww.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/help.shtml#12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Criticisms==
[[Psychographic]] segmentation has been criticized by well-known public opinion analyst and social scientist [[Daniel Yankelovich]], who says psychographics are "very weak" at predicting people's purchases, making it a "very poor" tool for corporate decision-makers.&lt;ref name=HBR /&gt; 

The VALS Framework has also been criticized as too culturally specific for international use.&lt;ref name=ACR /&gt; 

==VALS Framework and Segment==

The following types correspond to VALS segments of US adults based on two concepts for understanding consumers: primary motivation and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Framework and VALS™ Types|url=http://www.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/ustypes.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Innovators.''''' These consumers are on the leading edge of change, have the highest incomes, and such high self-esteem and abundant resources that they can indulge in any or all self-orientations. They are located above the rectangle. Image is important to them as an expression of taste, [[independence]], and [[Persona|character]]. Their consumer choices are directed toward the "finer things in life."
*'''''Thinkers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by ideals. They are mature, responsible, well-educated professionals. Their [[leisure]] activities center on their homes, but they are well informed about what goes on in the world and are open to new ideas and [[social change]]. They have high incomes but are practical consumers and rational decision makers.
*'''''Believers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by ideals. They are [[conservative]] and predictable consumers who favor local products and established brands. Their lives are centered on [[family]], [[community]], and the nation. They have modest incomes.
*'''''Achievers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by achievement. They are successful work-oriented people who get their satisfaction from their jobs and families. They are [[politically conservative]] and respect authority and the status quo. They favor established products and services that show off their success to their peers.
*'''''Strivers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by achievements. They have values very similar to achievers but have fewer economic, social, and psychological resources. Style is extremely important to them as they strive to emulate people they admire.
*'''''Experiencers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by self-expression. They are the youngest of all the segments, with a median age of 25. They have a lot of energy, which they pour into [[physical exercise]] and social activities. They are avid consumers, spending heavily on clothing, fast-foods, music, and other youthful favorites, with particular emphasis on new products and services.
*'''''Makers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by self-expression. They are practical people who value self-sufficiency. They are focused on the familiar - family, [[employment|work]], and physical recreation - and have little interest in the broader world. As consumers, they appreciate practical and functional products.
*'''''Survivors.''''' These consumers have the lowest incomes. They have too few resources to be included in any consumer self-orientation and are thus located below the rectangle. They are the oldest of all the segments, with a median age of 61. Within their limited means, they tend to be brand-loyal consumers.

===Use of the VALS Framework===
There is little to no evidence of the use of this framework on a wide basis by any other industry other than the ad industry as indicated by SRI on what little it shares on its website (go to the SRI website for more info).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2239">'''Yevgeny Sergeyevich Korotkevich''' ({{lang-ru|Евгений Серге́евич Короткевич}}) (1918 &amp;ndash; 1 February 1994) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientist and polar explorer, [[Hero of Socialist Labor]], and Doctor of Geographical Sciences. He was one of the leading scientists of the [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]] (AARI) in the field of [[glaciology]] and geography of polar countries.

Yevgeny Korotkevich participated in and headed many [[Arctic]] expeditions. In 1947-1955, he was engaged in scientific research on [[New Siberian Islands]], [[Franz Josef Land]], [[Novaya Zemlya]], [[Severnaya Zemlya]], [[Spitzbergen]], [[Kara Sea]] islands, [[Taymyr Peninsula]]. Since 1955, Korotkevich's scientific and organizational activity was closely associated with the studies of the Antarctic nature. He took part in the [[1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] and then headed other three Antarctic expeditions.

Yevgeny Korotkevich was AARI's deputy director and head of [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] for a long time. He was also executive editor of the Information Bulletin of the [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]].
