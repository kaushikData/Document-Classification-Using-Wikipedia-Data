== History ==

Formed in 1949, the American Forensic Association was created with the goal of teaching students to utilize the skills of argumentation and advocacy. In the first decades of its existence, the AFA was primarily focused on promoting [[Debate#Competitive debate|debate competitions]], with little to no interest in individual events.

As a result in the rapid rise of interest in individual events in the late 1960s, Dr. Seth Hawkins of [[Southern Connecticut State University]], Dr. Raymond Beaty of [[Ohio University]] and Dr. Jack Howe of [[California State University, Long Beach]] began to propose ideas of an organized national tournament focused on individual events. Dr. Beaty reported that his proposals were entirely disregarded by the debate community.&lt;ref name=Bartanen /&gt; During the 1970-71 forensics season, Dr. Hawkins made the decision that, despite the lack of support from the debate community, the increased interest in IEs justified the establishment of a national championship tournament. This tournament was held on the campus of [[Ohio Northern University]], 23 schools participated, and the annual IE tournament that would eventually become known as NFA Nationals was established.&lt;ref name=iehistory&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fryar |first=Linda |title=A Brief History of Individual Events Nationals |journal=National Forensic Journal |year=1984 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=73–83 |url=http://www.nationalforensics.org/journal/vol2no2-1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221215524/http://www.nationalforensics.org/journal/vol2no2-1.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing that the NFA's new IE national tournament could perpetuate the already existing split within the community regarding the competitive validity of IEs, the AFA began working towards a solution in 1972. Jerry Anderson, the president of the AFA at the time, began calling meetings to address measures that could be taken to incorporate IEs into the AFA's agenda. Anderson proposed a change to the AFA's constitution to allow for the inclusion of IEs, this change was ratified in 1973. Anderson, along with E.R. Tame, the Chair of the Educational Policies Committee, proposed that the AFA enact institutional changes to accommodate IEs. In 1973, the AFA voted to establish the AFA Committee on Individual Events.&lt;ref name=schnoor&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yates, Guy|author2=Larry Schnoor|title=AFA-NIET History|journal=Argumentation and Advocacy|year=2000|volume=37|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the three years following its establishment, the Committee worked towards developing an inceptive procedural standard for the AFA-NIET. This effort was bolstered in 1976, as James Weaver assumed the presidency of the AFA. Weaver proved to be a staunch advocate of the NIET's establishment. Within the first year of taking office, Weaver established the National Individual Events Tournament Committee, and appointed Larry Schnoor of [[Minnesota State University, Mankato]] as Chair. Shortly thereafter, Schnoor and the committee began making preparatory arrangements for the inaugural AFA-NIET.&lt;ref name="schnoor" /&gt;

In April 1978 the inaugural AFA-NIET was hosted by [[Illinois State University]]. 58 schools attended the 1978 AFA-NIET.&lt;ref name="attendance" /&gt;

=== List of Sweepstakes Champions ===

Both team and individual sweepstakes awards are given to the best overall performing team and individual at each AFA-NIET.

Team sweepstakes awards are given to the teams with the highest total of sweepstakes points earned by the team's individual competitors.
At the AFA-NIET, team sweepstakes points are awarded as follows:
* Preliminary rounds: .5 points for each 3rd place ballot, 1 points for each 2nd, 1.5 points for each 1st. (only the school's top 3 competitors in each event earn points for preliminary rounds)
* Out-rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, finals): 1 point for 6th place, 2 points for 5th place, 3 points for 4th place, 4 points for 3rd place, 5 points for 2nd place, 6 points for 1st place.

When tabulating individual sweepstakes, only the individual competitor's ranks and placings are used, and points awarded for preliminary ballot ranks are doubled. Otherwise individual sweepstakes are tabulated identically to team sweepstakes.&lt;ref name="bylaws" /&gt;

== Events ==

There are 11 events that are sanctioned by the AFA and held at the AFA-NIET. All events fall into one of three categories:
* [[Oral interpretation|Interpretation]]
* Public Address
* Limited Preparation

=== Interpretation Events ===

There are five AFA sponsored events that fall into the interpretation category. Interpretation events involve the performer selecting and cutting a script, (usually from a play, book, or movie) and acting out the scenes. All AFA interpretation events require the performer to hold a 'black book' that contains their manuscript; this book can be used as the competitor sees fit, meaning it may be used as a prop. All interpretation events have a 10-minute time limit.

* '''Poetry Interpretation'''

Poetry interpretation involves the performance of a selected cutting of poetry with significant literary merit. The performance may be one poem, or a combination of multiple pieces (often referred to as a 'program'). Play cuttings are prohibited from use. The focus of this performance should be on the development of language.&lt;ref name=events&gt;{{cite web|title=AFA-NIET events |url=http://dworth.web.rice.edu/eventdescriptions-new09-10.pdf |accessdate=2013-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221181821/http://dworth.web.rice.edu/eventdescriptions-new09-10.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Prose Interpretation'''

Prose interpretation features the performance of a [[prose]] piece of significant literary merit. The performance may feature only one work, or it may be a program. Play cuttings and poetry pieces are prohibited from use. The focus of this performance should be on development of the narrative.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt;

* '''Drama Interpretation'''

Under the AFA rules of Drama Interpretation, the performer is to create a cutting from either stage, screen, or radio with significant literary merit. The performance may feature only one play, or it may be a program. The performer may portray multiple characters. The focus of this performance should be on the development of [[characterization]].&lt;ref name="events" /&gt;

* '''Program Oral Interpretation'''

Program Oral Interpretation, often referred to as POI (pronounced "poy"), is an event that is unique to the AFA-NIET and is not sanctioned by NFA nationals.&lt;ref name="NFA rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=NFA Event rules|url=http://www.nationalforensics.org/rules-and-documents/nfa-rules-for-individual-events|accessdate=2013-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219021834/http://www.nationalforensics.org/rules-and-documents/nfa-rules-for-individual-events|archive-date=2013-12-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In POI, the performer is to create a program of selections linked by a common theme, and consisting of at least two, or up to all three of the different genres of forensics interpretation literature (prose, poetry, and drama), with the pieces being of significant literary merit. Each genre must be represented by a unique piece of literature. (one piece may not represent multiple genres) One selection may be original. The focus of this event should be on the development of the theme through the established narrative.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt;

* '''Dramatic Duo'''

Dramatic Duo is the only AFA sponsored event to feature two competitors in the performance. The performance may feature cuttings from any genre of literature; the cutting may be only one piece, or it may be a program. The selected cutting can be either humorous, serious, or a combination of the two. The performers are not allowed to directly look at each other or touch each other. The performers may each portray multiple characters if they so choose.

=== Public Address Events ===

There are four AFA sponsored events that fall into the category of public address. Public address events involve the performance of an originally written speech covering a specific topic or issue. Audio and visual aids are permitted for use in all public address events. Performers are heavily encouraged to integrate multiple sources into their speech. All events in this category have a 10 minute time limit.

* '''Persuasive Speaking'''

[[Persuasion|Persuasive]] speaking involves the performer delivering an original speech that is intended to inspire action or change the beliefs of the audience.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; Minimal notes are permitted, but heavily discouraged. Visual aids are permitted, but not mandatory. Judging should be based on the performer's [[public speaking]] skills and the effectiveness of the message.

* '''Informative Speaking'''

In informative speaking the performer delivers an original, factual speech that is intended to inform and educate the audience about a unique subject.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; Minimal notes are permitted, but heavily discouraged.

* '''Communication Analysis'''

Also referred to as CA for short, and "rhetorical criticism" at NFA nationals; communication analysis is an original speech centered on the evaluation of a communication event, often referred to as the 'artifact'. (speeches, movements, advertisements, etc.) The evaluation should utilize [[Communication studies|rhetorical principles]] and theories.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; Manuscripts are permitted, but heavily discouraged.

* '''After Dinner Speaking'''

Often referred to as ADS for short, after dinner speaking is an original, humorous speech centered on a single theme or subject. While the speech should be mostly humorous, it should not resemble a stand-up comedy act. Judging should be based on speaking skill, speech coherence, and good taste in humor.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; Minimal notes are permitted, but heavily discouraged.

=== Limited Preparation Events ===

There are two limited preparation events sponsored by the AFA. Limited preparation events are unique from all other forensics events based on the fact that the speech is written 'on the spot' with a limited amount of time allocated to preparation. Both events are performed as speeches. Limited notes (usually a 3"x5" index card) are commonly used in these events. Audio and visual aids may ''not'' be used. All limited preparation events have a 7 minute time limit.

* '''Extemporaneous Speaking'''

{{Main|Extemporaneous speaking}}

In extemporaneous speaking, commonly referred to as extemp, competitors are given three topics covering a range of current events. The competitor will select one of the three topics, and is then given 30 minutes to prepare an original speech, utilizing multiple sources. Extemporaneous speaking is the only AFA sponsored event where competitors speak in a previously assigned order.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; Limited notes may or may not be used, and are commonplace in this event.
* '''Impromptu Speaking'''

{{Main|Impromptu speaking}}

In impromptu speaking the competitor is given a [[quotation]] to use as the topic of their speech. Impromptu speaking is known for its uniquely short preparation time, competitors are given 7 minutes to both prepare and give their speech; speakers are heavily encouraged to keep their preparation time below two minutes. The speech may be humorous, serious, or a combination of both, but should stay relevant to the quotation and the speaker's interpretation of it.&lt;ref name="events" /&gt; Minimal notes are permitted.

== Qualification ==

There are two ways that a competitor can qualify an event for the AFA-NIET:

=== At-Large Qualification ===

For an event to be qualified through the at-large process, the competitor must obtain three 'legs' (placings) in the event that total out to 8 or less. (e.g. 3rd, 3rd, 2nd; 5th, 2nd, 1st; 6th, 1st, 1st; 1st, 1st, 1st) In the event that a final round contains more than six competitors (e.g. unbreakable tie), no placing beyond 6th will count as a leg under any circumstances. A leg can be acquired at any tournament in which at least 9 schools are participating.&lt;ref name="bylaws" /&gt;

Placings will only count as a leg if the requirement for number of competitors in the event is met:
* 1st: 2-4
* 2nd: 5-8
* 3rd: 9-12
* 4th: 13-16
* 5th: 17-20
* 6th: 20+&lt;ref name="bylaws" /&gt;

=== District Qualification ===

Events may also be qualified for the AFA-NIET by placing in the top 10% of the field at their school's respective district qualifying tournament.

All AFA member schools are placed into a district. District placement is largely (but not entirely) based on the state that the school is located in:
* District 1: California, Nevada, Hawaii
* District 2: Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Alaska
* District 3: Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Missouri, Louisiana, Arkansas
* District 4: North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska
* District 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio
* District 6: Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Kentucky
* District 7: Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Staten Island, N.Y., Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont
* District 8: [dis-established due to lack of schools; merged into District 7]
* District 9: Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas (El Paso) &lt;ref name="bylaws" /&gt;

Note: Schools may enter a petitioning process if they wish to be placed in a different district.

The respective district committees determine when the district qualifying tournament will be, specifically, but it must take place after January 15 and before the third weekend of March. Events that have already been qualified through the at-large process are ineligible for competition at the district qualifying tournaments. A student qualifies an event for the AFA-NIET when they place in the top 10% of that event, rounding up. (e.g. 20 competitors: top 2; 21 competitors: top 3) If an individual has two legs coming into the district qualifier and finishes at a placing sufficient for their third leg, then that event is qualified at-large, and everyone who placed below said individual is moved up one spot, allowing them to potentially qualify.&lt;ref name="bylaws" /&gt;

'''Aulus Caecina''' the son of Aulus Caecina, was an [[Ancient Roman]] writer.

He took the side of [[Pompey]] in the civil wars, and published a violent tirade against [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], for which he was banished.  He recanted in a work called ''Querelae'', and was pardoned by Caesar following the intercession of his friends, above all, [[Cicero]], who defended him in 69 BC with the speech ''[[Pro Caecina]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Caecīna|display=Caecīna s.v. Aulus Caecina|volume=4|page=934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caecina was regarded as an important authority on the Etruscan system of [[divination]] (''[[Etruscan mythology#Etruscan Disciplina|Etrusca Disciplina]]''), which he endeavoured to place on a scientific footing by harmonizing its theories with the doctrines of the [[Stoics]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Considerable fragments of his work (dealing with lightning) are to be found in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (''[[Naturales quaestiones]]'', ii. 31–49). Caecina was on intimate terms with Cicero, who speaks of him as a gifted and eloquent man and was no doubt considerably indebted to him in his own treatise ''[[De Divinatione]]''. Some of their correspondence is preserved in Cicero's letters (''[[Epistulae ad Familiares]]'' vi. 5–8; see also ix. and xiii. 66).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[File:Edward III counting the dead on the battlefield of Crécy.jpg|thumbnail|Edward III counting the dead after the [[battle of Crécy]]]]

A '''body count''' is the total number of people killed in a particular event. In combat, a body count is often based on the number of confirmed kills, but occasionally only an estimate. Often used in reference to military combat, the term can also refer to any situation involving multiple killings, such as the actions of [[death squads]] or [[serial killer]]s.

The military gathers such figures for a variety of reasons, such as determining the need for continuing operations, estimating efficiency of new and old weapons systems, and planning follow-up operations.

==Military use==
{{Globalize|section|date=June 2010}}
Body count figures have a long history in military planning and [[propaganda]].

===Sassanian Empire===
According to [[Procopius]], when the [[Sassanian Empire|Persians]] are about to march to a war, the king sits on the throne and many baskets are set before him. The men of the army pass along the baskets one by one, each throwing one arrow in the baskets, which are then sealed with the king's seal. When the army returns to Persia, each man takes an arrow, and the number of casualties will be determined by the number of remaining arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Procopius|Prokopios]], ''The Wars of Justinian'', translated by H. B. Dewing, Hackett Publishing, 2014, {{ISBN|9781624661723}}, page &lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holocaust===
{{see also|the Holocaust|Bandenbekämpfung}}
During the [[Holocaust]] in [[The Holocaust in Russia|Russia]], [[the Holocaust in Belarus|Belarus]], [[the Holocaust in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and other eastern areas, killing was done by [[Nazi Germany]]'s military police forces, including ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], and Wehrmacht police battalions, in massacres by shooting the victims.{{sfn|Beorn|2014|p=6, 126}} Such units measured their progress by counting the number of people killed.{{sfn|Beorn|2014|p=69}} These murder operations took place under the guise of [[bandit fighting|anti-partisan warfare]], but in reality few of those killed were actually partisans.{{sfn|Beorn|2014|p=7}}

===Vietnam War===
{{main |Vietnam War body count controversy}} 
Since the goal of the United States in the [[Vietnam War]] was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically "held" already. Instead, the U.S. Army used body counts to show that the U.S. was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army would lose after the [[attrition warfare]].

According to historian [[Christian Appy]], "[[search and destroy]] was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress" in [[William Westmoreland|General Westmoreland’s]] war of attrition. Search and destroy was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the Viet Cong out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation.[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-31/news/mn-442_1_body-count] This method was controversial, due to two issues. The first is regarding the counting of unarmed civilians killed in actions as enemy combatants in [[free-fire zone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewy|first=Guenter|title=America in Vietnam|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1978|isbn=9780199874231|pages=450–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN battle operations were miscounted as "enemy KIA".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=spc4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;|title=East Asia's Other Miracle: Explaining the Decline of Mass Atrocities|last=Bellamy|first=Alex J.|date=2017-09-29|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780191083785|location=|pages=33–34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is inflation&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-31/news/mn-442_1_body-count&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorley&gt;{{cite book|last=Sorley|first=Lewis|title=A Better War: The Unexamined Victories and Final Tragedy of America's Last Years in Vietnam|publisher=Harvest|year=2007|isbn=9780156013093|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;and  fabrication of body count in after-action reports, which is reported to have given false and inaccurate casualty figures for enemy dead. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_an_American_Army.html?id=nm-ov7lIe_AC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Rise and Fall of an American Army|last=Stanton|first=Shelby L.|date=2003|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780891418276|location=|pages=xvi-xvii|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-on-going-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-army|title=The On-Going Battle for the Soul of the Army {{!}} Small Wars Journal|website=smallwarsjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq War===

{{Main|Casualties of the Iraq War}}

In the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the US military adopted an official policy of not counting deaths. General [[Tommy Franks]]' statement that "we don't do body counts" was widely reported. Critics claimed that Franks was only attempting to evade bad publicity, while supporters pointed to the failure of body counts to give an accurate impression of the state of the war in Vietnam. At the end of October 2005, it became public that the US military had been counting Iraqi fatalities since January 2004 but only those killed by insurgents and not those killed by the US forces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/international/middleeast/30civilians.html "U.S. Quietly Issues Estimate of Iraqi Civilian Casualties"], The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''broadcast flag''' is a set of status [[bit]]s (or a "[[flag (computing)|flag]]") sent in the data stream of a [[digital television]] program that indicates whether or not the data stream can be recorded, or if there are any restrictions on recorded content. Possible restrictions include the inability to save an unencrypted digital program to a [[hard disk]] or other non-volatile storage, inability to make secondary copies of recorded content (in order to share or archive), forceful reduction of quality when recording (such as reducing [[high-definition television|high-definition]] video to the resolution of [[standard-definition television|standard TVs]]), and inability to skip over [[advertisement|commercials]].

== Introduction ==
In the [[United States]], new television [[ATSC tuner|receivers]] using the [[ATSC standard]] were supposed to incorporate this functionality by July 1, 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== FCC ruling ==
Officially called "Digital Broadcast Television Redistribution Control," the FCC's rule is in 47 CFR 73.9002(b) and the following sections, stating in part: "No party shall sell or distribute in interstate commerce a Covered [[Demodulator]] Product that does not comply with the Demodulator Compliance Requirements and Demodulator Robustness Requirements." According to the rule, hardware must "actively thwart" piracy.

The rule's Demodulator Compliance Requirements insists that all HDTV demodulators must "listen" for the flag (or assume it to be present in all signals). Flagged content must be output only to "protected outputs" (such as [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] and [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] ports with [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] encryption), or in degraded form through [[analog (signal)|analog]] outputs or [[Digital data|digital]] outputs with visual resolution of 720x480 pixels ([[Enhanced-definition television|EDTV]]) or less. Flagged content may be recorded only by "authorized" methods, which may include tethering of recordings to a single device.

Since broadcast flags could be activated at any time, a viewer who often records a program might suddenly find that it is no longer possible to save their favorite show. This and other reasons lead many to see the flags as a direct affront to [[consumer rights]].

Particularly troubling to [[Open-source model|open source]] developers are the Demodulator Robustness Requirements. Devices must be "robust" against user access or modifications so that someone could not easily alter it to ignore the broadcast flags that permit access to the full digital stream. Since open-source [[device driver]]s are by design user-modifiable, a PC [[TV tuner card]] with open-source drivers would not be "robust". It is unclear whether binary-only drivers would qualify.  In theory it would likely be illegal for open-source projects such as the [[MythTV]] project, which creates [[personal video recorder]] (PVR) software, to interface with digital television demodulators.

Some companies currently manufacturing devices, such as the pcHDTV devices intended for the [[Linux]] market, would likely be forced to halt production. This portion of the rule also effectively prevents individuals from building their own high-definition television sets and receiving devices. (It may seem far-fetched to a layman, but there have been many instances in the past where engineers have built their own analog TVs, and it follows that some people would wish to continue such pursuits in the digital age. The technologies used will most likely be centered around [[software-defined radio]], fast [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADCs]] and [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] chips - tools which are so generic in their use that their availability cannot be effectively restricted.)

The [[GNU Radio]] project already successfully demonstrated that purely software-based demodulators can exist and the hardware rule is not fully enforceable.

In ''[[American Library Association v. FCC]]'', 406 F.3d 689 (D.C. Cir. 2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200505/04-1037b.pdf |title=USCA-DC Opinions - Search - 04-1037b.pdf |publisher=Pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals]] for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]] ruled that the FCC had exceeded its authority in creating this rule. The court stated that the Commission could not prohibit the manufacture of [[computer]] or video hardware without copy protection technology because the FCC only has authority to regulate transmissions, not devices that receive communications.  While it is always possible that the Supreme Court could overturn this ruling, the more likely reemergence of the broadcast flag is in legislation of the [[United States Congress]] granting such authority to the FCC.

On May 1, 2006, Sen. [[Ted Stevens]] inserted a version of the Broadcast Flag into the Communications, Consumer's Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stevens, Ted|authorlink=Ted Stevens|title=Communications, Consumer’s Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006|url=http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/06telcom.pdf|date=2006-05-01|accessdate=2006-07-07|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, 2006 Sen. [[John E. Sununu]] offered an amendment to strike the broadcast and radio flag,&lt;ref name=bill4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/475 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701092649/http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/475 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-07-01 |title=Sen.John E. Sununu amendment |publisher=Publicknowledge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this failed and the broadcast-flag amendment was approved by the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Commerce committee]]. Nonetheless, the overall bill was never passed, and thus died upon adjournment of the 109th Congress in December 2006.

On May 18, 2008, [[News.com]] reported that [[Microsoft]] had confirmed that current versions of [[Windows Media Center]] shipping with the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] family of operating systems adhered to the use of the broadcast flag, following reports of users being blocked from taping specific airings of [[NBC]] programs, mainly ''[[American Gladiators (2008 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' and ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]''. A Microsoft spokesperson said that Windows Media Center adheres to the "rules set forth by the FCC", even though no legislation actually requires following such rules.&lt;ref name=wmc1&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandoval |first=Greg |url=http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9946780-7.html?tag=nefd.riv |title=Microsoft confirms Windows adheres to broadcast flag |publisher=News.com |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2011, the FCC officially eliminated the broadcast flag regulations.&lt;ref name=fcc1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/61851.html |title=FCC eliminated rules |publisher=Politico.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio broadcast flag and RIAA ===
With the coming of digital radio, the recording industry is attempting to change the ground rules for copyright of songs played on radio. Currently, over the air (i.e. broadcast but not Internet) radio stations may play songs freely but [[RIAA]] wants Congress to insert a radio broadcast flag. On April 26, 2006, Congress held a hearing over the radio broadcast flag. Among the witnesses were musicians [[Anita Baker]] and [[Todd Rundgren]].

=== European Broadcast Flag ===
At present no equivalent signal is typically used in European [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] transmissions, although [[DVB-CPCM]] would provide such a set of signal as defined by DVB-SI, usable on clear-to-air television broadcasts. How adherence to such a system would be enforced in a receiver is not yet clear.

In the UK, the [[BBC]] introduced content protection restrictions in 2010 on Free to Air content by licensing data necessary to receive the service information for the Freeview HD broadcasts.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} However the BBC have stated the highest protection applied will be to allow only one copy to be made.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== ISDB ===
[[ISDB]] broadcasts are protected as to allow the broadcast to be digitally recorded once, but to not allow digital copies of the recording to be made. Analog recordings can be copied freely. It is possible to disallow the use of analog outputs, although this has yet to be implemented. The protection can be circumvented with the correct hardware and software.

=== DVB-CPCM ===
The Digital Video Broadcasting organization is developing [[DVB-CPCM]] which allows broadcasters (especially PayTV broadcaster) far more control over the use of content on (and beyond) home networks. The DVB standards are commonly used in Europe and around the world (for satellite, terrestrial, and cable distribution), but are also employed in the United States by [[Dish Network]]. In Europe, some entertainment companies are lobbying to legally mandate the use of DVB-CPCM in the next level of the controversial [[EU Copyright directive]]. Opponents fear that mandating DVB-CPCM will kill independent receiver manufacturers that use open source operating systems (e.g., Linux-based set-top boxes.)

Should the US broadcast flag return, CPCM would be a candidate for addition to the Table A list of approved technologies for enforcement in the US.

=== Pay-per-view use of broadcast flag ===
In the US, since April 15, 2008, [[pay-per-view]] [[movie]]s on [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] now are flagged to prevent a recording off a pay-per-view channel to a [[digital video recorder]]s or other related devices from being retained after 24 hours from the ordered time of the film. This is the standard film industry practice, including for digital rentals from the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Google Play]]. Movies recorded before that point would still be available without flagging and could be copied freely, though as of 2015 those pre-2008 DVR units are well out-of-date or probably non-functional, and the pay-per-view concern is moot for all but special events, as nearly all satellite providers and cable providers have moved to more easily restricted [[video on demand]] platforms; pay-per-view films have been drawn down to non-notable content.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The '''Bua languages''' are a subgroup of the [[Mbum–Day languages|Mbum–Day subgroup]] of the [[Savanna languages]] spoken by fewer than 30,000 people in southern [[Chad]] in an area stretching roughly between the [[Chari River]] and the [[Guera Massif]]. They were labeled "G13" in [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]] language-family proposal. They are ultimately part of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo family]], and have exerted a significant influence on [[Laal language|Laal]].

All of these languages are [[tone language|tonal]], with distinctive [[vowel length]] and [[nasal vowel]]s in limited contexts.  Most of these languages have lost the typical Niger–Congo noun class system (Goula Iro appears to have retained it to some degree.)  However, its former presence is betrayed by their quite complicated system of plural formation, combining internal [[ablaut]] with changes to final consonants and/or suffixation.

They include:
* [[Bua language]] (7,708 speakers in 1993), north of the [[Chari River]] around [[Korbol]] and [[Gabil]] (after which the group was named); mutually comprehensible with Fanian.
* [[Fanian language|Fanian]], or Mana, or Kobe (&gt; 1,100 speakers in 1997), in the villages of Mouraye, Sengué, Malakonjo, Rim, Sisi, Karo west of Lake Iro.
* [[Niellim language|Niellim]] or Lua (5,157 speakers in 1993), spoken around [[Niellim]] and Niou along the [[Chari River]] north of [[Sarh]] (including the extinct Chini dialect)
* [[Tunia language|Tunia]] (2,255 speakers in 1993), around [[Sarh]] (including the extinct Perim dialect)
* [[Noy language|Noy]] or Loo (36 speakers in 1993), spoken in [[Bedaya]], [[Balimba]], [[Djoli]], [[Koumra]], and [[Koumogo]] south of [[Sarh]].  Nearly extinct.
* '''Gula languages''':
** [[Gula Iro language|Gula Iro]] or Kulaal (3,500 speakers in 1991), around [[Lake Iro]].
** [[Zan Gula language|Zan Gula]] (4,000 speakers in 1997), around [[Zan (Chad)|Zan]] and [[Chinguil]].
** [[Bon Gula language|Bon Gula]] (&gt; 1,200 speakers in 1997), in the villages of [[Bon]] and [[Ibir]].
* [[Koke language|Koke]] (600 speakers in 1993), around [[Daguela]]
* [[Bolgo language|Bolgo]] (1,800 speakers in 1993), near [[Melfi]], in Koya, Boli, Gagne, and Bedi.

The first to note the similarity between Bua and Niellim in print was G. Nachtigal, in 1889.  [[Maurice Gaudefroy-Demombynes]] added Tunia and "Mana" (possibly an alternate name for Fanian) in 1907, forming a "Groupe Boa". Johannes Lukas (1937) likewise described a "Bua-Gruppe" consisting of Bua, Niellim, and Koke, and in [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1963 classification ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'', the three languages were placed together in the Adamawa subphylum as a group named Adamawa-13.  Later, Pairault (1965, 1969) added the more northerly Gula languages, Fanian, Koke, and Bolgo, allowing Samarin (1971) to define roughly the current membership of the Bua languages/Adamawa-13.  Palayer later added Noy.

In [[linguistics]], '''case government''' is [[Government (linguistics)|government]] of the [[grammatical case]] of [[verb argument]]s, when a verb or preposition is said to 'govern' the [[grammatical case]] on its noun phrase complement, e.g. ''zu'' governs the [[dative case]] in German: ''zu mir'' 'to me-dative'. The [[German language|German]] term for the notion is ''Rektion.'' Case government may modify the meaning of the verb substantially, even to meanings that are unrelated. Analogously in [[Mathematical programming|programming]], constructing two different [[Subroutine|function]]s of identical name but different parameters is called [[function overloading|overloading]] a function.

Case government is a more important notion in languages with many case distinctions, such as  Russian and Finnish. It plays less of a role in English, because English doesn't rely on grammatical cases, except for distinguishing subject pronouns (I, he, she, we, they) from other pronouns (me, him, her, us, them). In English, true case government is absent, but if the aforementioned subject pronouns are understood as regular pronouns in the [[accusative case]], it occurs in sentences such as ''He found me'' (not for example *''He found I'').

For example, in Finnish, a verb or sometimes even a particular meaning of a verb is associated with a case the referent noun must be in. "To go &lt;u&gt;for&lt;/u&gt; a walk" is expressed as ''mennä kävely&lt;u&gt;lle&lt;/u&gt;'' (literally "to go to a walk"), where ''mennä'' means "to go", ''kävely'' is "a walk" and ''-lle'' is a postfix that denotes the [[allative case]] (usually means "to" in English). This case ''must'' be always used in this context; one cannot say *''mennä kävelyyn'' "to go into a walk", for example.

==History==
[[Image:Besht Signature.svg|thumb|'''Figure 1:''' Signature of the [[Baal Shem Tov]] some time in the 1700s, written in the cursive Hebrew script.]]
The brief inscriptions daubed in red ink upon the walls of the [[Jewish catacombs of Venosa|catacombs of Venosa]] are probably the oldest examples of cursive script. Still longer texts in a cursive alphabet are furnished by the clay bowls found in [[Babylonia]] and bearing [[exorcism]]s against magical influences and evil spirits. These bowls date from the 7th or 8th century, and some of the letters are written in a form that is very antiquated ''([[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|Figure 3, column 1]])''. Somewhat less of a cursive nature is the manuscript, which dates from the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hebrew Papyri: Steinschneider, Hebräische Papyrusfragmente aus dem Fayyum, in Aegyptische Zeitschrift, xvii. 93 et seq., and table vii.; C. I. H. cols. 120 et seq.; Erman and Krebs, Aus den Papyrus der Königlichen Museen, p. 290, Berlin, 1899. For the Hebrew papyri in The Collection of Erzherzog Rainer, see D. H. Müller and D. Kaufmann, in Mitteilungen aus der Sammlung der Papyrus Erzherzog Rainer, i. 38, and in Führer durch die Sammlung, etc. pp. 261 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|Columns 2–14]]'' exhibit cursive scripts of various countries and centuries. The differences visible in the square alphabets are much more apparent. For instance, the Sephardi rounds off still more, and, as in [[Arabic]], there is a tendency to run the lower lines to the left, whereas the Ashkenazi script appears cramped and disjointed. Instead of the little ornaments at the upper ends of the stems, in the letters [[Image:Image1Letters.jpg]] a more or less weak flourish of the line appears. For the rest the cursive of the Codices remains fairly true to the square text. 

Documents of a private nature were certainly written in a much more running hand, as the sample from one of the oldest Arabic letters written with Hebrew letters (possibly the 10th century) clearly shows in the papyrus, in "Führer durch die Ausstellung", Table XIX., Vienna, 1894, ''([[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|compare Figure 3, column 4]])''. However, since the preservation of such letters were not held to be of importance, material of this nature from the earlier times is very scarce, and as a consequence the development of the script is very hard to follow. The last two columns of ''[[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|Figure 3]]'' exhibit the Ashkenazi cursive script of a later date. The next to the last is taken from a manuscript of [[Elias Levita]]. The accompanying specimen presents Sephardi script. In this flowing cursive alphabet the ligatures appear more often. They occur especially in letters which have a sharp turn to the left ([[ג]], [[ז]], [[כ]], [[נ]], [[צ]], [[ח]]), and above all in [[נ]], whose great open bow offers ample space for another letter ''(see Figure 2)''.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Specimen of Modern Sephardic Script.jpg||389px|thumb|right|'''Figure 2:''' "Specimen of Modern Sephardic Script" ''(Jewish Encyclopedia, 1901-1906)'']] --&gt;

The following are the successive stages in the development of each letter: 
* [[Aleph|Alef]] is separated into two parts, the first being written as [[Image:Image2Letters.jpg]], and the [[perpendicular]] stroke placed at the left [[Image:Image3Letters.jpg]]. By the turn of the 20th century, Ashkenazi cursive had these two elements separated, thus ׀c, and the [[acute angle]] was rounded. It received also an abbreviated form connected with the favorite old ligature [[Image:Image4Letters.jpg]], and it is to this ligature of Alef and [[Lamedh|Lamed]] that the contracted [[Mizrahi|Oriental]] Aleph owes its origin ''([[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|Figure 3, column 7]])''. 
* In writing [[Bet (letter)|Bet]], the lower part necessitated an interruption, and to overcome this obstacle it was made [[Image:Image5Letters.jpg]], and, with the total omission of the whole lower line, [[Image:Image6Letters.jpg]]. 
* In [[Gimel]], the left-hand stroke is lengthened more and more. 
* [[Dalet]] had its stroke put on obliquely to distinguish it from [[Resh]]; however, since in rapid writing it easily assumed a form similar in appearance to [[Resh]], [[Dalet]] in analogy with [[ב]] was later changed to [[Image:Image7Letters.jpg]]. 
* A transformation very similar to this took place in the cases of final [[Kaph|Kaf]] and of [[Qoph|Qof]] ''([[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|see columns 2, 5, 11, 14]])'', except that Kaf opened out a trifle more than Qof. 
* The lower part of [[Zayin]] was bent sharply to the right and received a little hook at the bottom. 
* The left-hand stroke of [[Teth|Ṭet]] was lengthened. 
* Lamed gradually lost its [[semicircle]] until (as in both [[Nabataean Arabic|Nabataean]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]) by the turn of the 20th century, it became a simple stroke, which was bent sharply toward the right. In the modern script today the Lamed has regained its semicircle. 
* Final [[Mem]] branches out at the bottom, and in its latest stage is drawn out either to the left or straight down. 
* In [[Samekh]] the same development also took place, but it afterward became again a simple circle. 
* To write '[[Ayin]] without removing the pen from the surface, its two strokes were joined with a curl. 
* The two forms of the letter [[Pe (letter)|Pe]] spread out in a marked flourish. 
* For [[Tsade|Tsadi]] the right-hand head is made longer, at first only to a small degree, but later on to a considerable extent. 
* In the beginning [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] develops similarly to the same letter in Nabataean, but afterward the central stroke is lengthened upward, like the right arm of Tsadi, and finally it is joined with the left stroke, and the first stroke is left off altogether. 
* The letters [[ה]], [[ד]], [[ח]], [[ן]], [[נ]], [[ר]], [[ת]], have undergone little modification: they have been rounded out and simplified by the omission of the heads.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1112">'''Cyclomancy''' is a form of [[divination]] based on spinning an object and deriving predictions or conclusions from the object's final resting direction.  In some traditions, a wheel or [[top]] is spun on a surface marked with letters or symbols, and those that fall closest to the device's pointer are consulted. &lt;ref name=evdef&gt;Boehm, Roger (2006) "Evil Defined - From a Christian Perspective", Lulu Press, Inc. {{ISBN|0-615-13489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=esent1&gt;Tuitean, Paul, Daniels Estelle (2001) "Essential Wicca", The Crossing Press, {{ISBN|1-58091-099-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other traditions, any suitable object may be spun and its direction may be used to obtain a simple yes/no answer or directional indicator. For example, an object with a distinguishing feature may be spun between two diverging paths or disparate objects, and the one closest to the feature is chosen. The party game [[Spin the Bottle]] is loosely based on this concept.

Cyclomancy is sometimes used in [[Dowsing]].

She led the creation of the ''[[Diccionario Básico Escolar]]'' (DBE; Cuban basic school dictionary) from its first edition in 2005 until its fourth edition (digital in 2013 and paper in January 2015).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/dbe/index4.html Diccionario Básico Escolar.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Diccionario Básico Escolar'' is one of the books with the greatest circulation in Cuba.

==Biography==
Eloina Miyares Bermudez studied at the Escuela Normal de Oriente, from which she graduated in 1947. She first served as a teacher of rural areas in the municipality of [[Palma Soriano]], where she participated in the literacy campaign. She then studied at the Faculty of Humanities of the [[University of Santiago de Cuba]], graduating with a degree in Letters. She taught at the university until 1972 when she became a researcher at the Center of Applied Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences. She studied [[acoustic phonetics]] at the Institute of the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecured.cu/index.php/Eloina_Miyares Eloína Miyares] Ecured.&lt;/ref&gt;

With her husband, [[philologist]] [[Julio Vitelio Ruiz Hernández]], she created a methodology for teachers and students to improve their pronunciation and spelling. The couple also founded the Center for Applied Linguistics of Santiago de Cuba (CLA) in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehu.eus/ehusfera/ixa/2011/02/25/cla_40th_anniversary/ 40th anniversary of the Centro de Lingüística Aplicada in Santiago de Cuba] Blog del grupo de investigación IXA&lt;/ref&gt;

Bermudez had at least seven sons, including Dr. Leonel Miyares Ruiz.&lt;ref name="Rojas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Martha|title=Center for Applied Linguistics in Santiago de Cuba|url=http://www.caribbeannewsdigital.com/en/noticia/center-applied-linguistics-santiago-de-cuba|publisher=Caribbean News Digital|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a type of [[semantic ambiguity|ambiguity]] that stems from a phrase having two distinct [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]], not from the grammar or structure of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Damer2008"/&gt;

Some examples of equivocation in [[syllogism]]s (a logical chain of reasoning) are below:

*Since only man [human] is rational,
:and no woman is a man [male],
:Therefore, no woman is rational.&lt;ref name="Damer2008"/&gt;

*A feather is light [not heavy].
:What is light [bright] cannot be dark.
:Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

In the above example, distinct meanings of the word "light" are implied in contexts of the first and second statements. 

*All jackasses have long ears.
:Carl is a jackass.
:Therefore, Carl has long ears.

Here, the equivocation is the metaphorical use of "jackass" to imply a simple-minded or obnoxious person instead of a male donkey.

A '''fountain pen''' is a [[Nib (pen)|nib]] [[pen]] that, unlike its predecessor, the [[dip pen]], contains an internal reservoir of liquid [[Fountain pen inks|ink]]. The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits it on paper via a combination of gravity and [[capillary action]]. Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via the use of a [[Pasteur pipette]] (eyedropper) or [[syringe]], or via an internal filling mechanism which creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) or a [[vacuum]] to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 

== History ==

=== Early prototypes of reservoir pens ===
An early historical mention of what appears to be a reservoir pen dates back to the 10th century. According to Ali Abuzar Mari (d. 974) in his ''Kitab al-Majalis wa 'l-musayarat'', the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]] demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir, allowing it to be held upside-down without leaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Journal of Semitic Studies]]|volume=26|issue=1|year=1981|pages=229–234|title=A Mediaeval Islamic Prototype of the Fountain Pen?|first=C. E.|last=Bosworth|quote=We wish to construct a pen which can be used for writing without having recourse to an ink-holder and whose ink will be contained inside it. A person can fill it with ink and write whatever he likes. The writer can put it in his sleeve or anywhere he wishes and it will not stain nor will any drop of ink leak out of it. The ink will flow only when there is an intention to write. We are unaware of anyone previously ever constructing (a pen such as this) and an indication of 'penetrating wisdom' to whoever contemplates it and realises its exact significance and purpose. I exclaimed, 'Is this possible?' He replied, 'It is possible if God so wills'.|url=https://academic.oup.com/jss/article-abstract/26/2/229/1692343/A-MEDIAEVAL-ISLAMIC-PROTOTYPE-OF-THE-FOUNTAIN-PEN|doi=10.1093/jss/26.2.229}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is compelling evidence that a working fountain pen was constructed and used during the [[Renaissance]] by artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]].  Leonardo's journals contain drawings with cross-sections of what appears to be a reservoir pen that works by both gravity and capillary action.  Historians also took note of the fact that the handwriting in the inventor's surviving journals is of a consistent contrast throughout, rather than the characteristic fading pattern typical of a quill pen caused by expending and re-dipping.  While no physical item survives, several working models were reconstructed in 2011 by artist Amerigo Bombara that have since been put on display in museums dedicated to Leonardo.&lt;ref name="tusc_Lape"&gt;{{Cite web | title = La penna di Leonardo alla sala regia | website = Tusciaweb.eu | date = September 7, 2011 | accessdate = 2016-11-09 | url = http://www.tusciaweb.eu/2011/09/la-penna-di-leonardo-alla-sala-regia/ | language = it }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European reservoir models===

The fountain pen was available in Europe in the 17th century, and is shown by contemporary references. In ''Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae'' (a 1636 magazine), [[Germans|German]] inventor [[Daniel Schwenter]] described a pen made from two [[quill]]s. One quill served as a reservoir for [[ink]] inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with [[cork (material)|cork]]. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point.&lt;ref&gt;Schwenter, Daniel, ''Deliciae physico-mathematicae'' …  (Nürnberg, (Germany):  Jeremias Dümler, 1636), vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wINSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA519#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 519–520] :  ''"Die III Auffgab.  Ein schön Secret, eine Feder zu zurichten, welche Dinten hält, und so viel lässet als man bedürfftig."''  (The third exercise.  A nice secret:  to prepare a pen which holds ink and lets [flow] as much as one requires. [with illustration])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1663 [[Samuel Pepys]] referred to a metal pen "to carry ink".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pepys|first1=Samuel|title=Diary entries from August 1663 (Pepys' Diary)|date=August 1663|publisher=Samuel Pepys|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1663/08/|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted Maryland historian Hester Dorsey Richardson (1862–1933) documented a reference to "three silver fountain pens, worth 15 shillings" in England during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], c. 1649–1685.&lt;ref name="Hester Dorsey Richardson 1913, pp. 216-217"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Hester Dorsey|last= Richardson|chapter=Chapter XLVII: The Fountain Pen in the Time of Charles II |title=Side-lights on Maryland History, with Sketches of Early Maryland Families|publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins Co.|location= Baltimore, Md.|year=1913|pages= 216–17|isbn=0-8063-1468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 18th century such pens were already commonly known as "fountain pens".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry, ''Commentary on the Whole Bible'', Zechariah iv. 2 (1710), describing a type of self-replenishing oil lamp: "Without any further Care they [i.e. the lamps] received Oil as fast as they wasted it, ('as in those which we call Fountain Inkhorns, or Fountain Pens')".&lt;/ref&gt; Hester Dorsey Richardson also found a 1734 notation made by Robert Morris the elder in the ledger of the expenses of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris the younger]], who was at the time in [[Philadelphia]], for "one fountain pen".&lt;ref name="Hester Dorsey Richardson 1913, pp. 216-217"/&gt;

===First patent===
Progress in developing a reliable pen was slow until the mid-19th century because of an imperfect understanding of the role that air pressure plays in the operation of pens. Furthermore, most inks were highly corrosive and full of sedimentary inclusions. The [[Romania]]n inventor [[Petrache Poenaru]] received a French [[patent]] on May 25, 1827, for the invention of the first fountain pen with a barrel made from a large swan quill.&lt;ref name="Best Fountain Pen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Invented The Fountain Pen?|url=https://www.bestfountainpen.com/who-invented-the-fountain-pen|website=Best Fountain Pen|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass-manufactured nibs===
In 1828, [[Josiah Mason]] improved a cheap and efficient slip-in [[Nib (pen)|nib]] in [[Birmingham]], England, which could be added to a fountain pen and in 1830, with the invention of a new machine, [[Joseph Gillott|William Joseph Gillott]], William Mitchell, and James Stephen Perry devised a way to mass manufacture robust, cheap steel [[pen nib]]s ([[Perry &amp; Co]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perry and Co|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Perry_and_Co|website=Grace's Guide|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This boosted the [[Birmingham pen trade]] and by the 1850s, more than half the steel-nib pens manufactured in the world were made in Birmingham. Thousands of skilled craftsmen were employed in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birmingham Heritage|url=http://www.birminghamheritage.org.uk/pentrade.html|website=www.birminghamheritage.org.uk|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected, enabling the city's factories to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, thus encouraging the development of education and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=22 February 1851 |title=The Manufacture of Steel Pens in Birmingham |journal=[[The Illustrated London News]] |volume=18 |issue=471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New patents and inventions===
In 1848, American inventor Azel Storrs Lyman patented a pen with "a combined holder and nib".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London, England), 15 September 1885, p. 6: Obituary&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1850s, there was a steadily accelerating stream of fountain pen [[patent]]s and pens in production. However, it was only after three key inventions were in place that the fountain pen became a widely popular writing instrument. Those were the [[iridium]]-tipped [[gold]] nib, [[Ebonite|hard rubber]], and free-flowing ink.&lt;ref name="Best Fountain Pen" /&gt;

[[Image:SafetyDemoRJJ PD.jpg|thumb|Waterman 42 Safety Pen, with variation in materials (both red and black hard vulcanized rubbers or [[ebonite]]) and retracting nibs]]
[[Image:Duofold.jpg|thumb|60px|[[The Parker Pen Company|Parker]] [[Duofold]], c. 1924]]

The first fountain pens making use of all these key ingredients appeared in the 1850s. In the 1870s Duncan MacKinnon, a Canadian living in New York City, and [[A. T. Cross Company|Alonzo T. Cross]] of Providence, Rhode Island, created [[stylographic pen]]s with a hollow, tubular nib and a wire acting as a valve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stylographic Pens|url=http://www.vintagepens.com/stylos.shtml|website=Vintage Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylographic pens are now used mostly for drafting and technical drawing but were very popular in the decade beginning in 1875. In the 1880s the era of the [[mass production|mass-produced]] fountain pen finally began. The dominant American producers in this pioneer era were [[Waterman pens|Waterman]], of [[New York City]], and Wirt, based in [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania]]. Waterman soon outstripped Wirt, along with many companies that sprang up to fill the new and growing fountain pen market. Waterman remained the market leader until the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Significant Pens of the Twentieth Century|url=http://www.richardspens.com/ref/misc/significant.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, fountain pens were almost all filled by unscrewing a portion of the hollow barrel or holder and inserting the ink by means of an eyedropper – a slow and messy procedure. Pens also tended to leak inside their caps and at the joint where the barrel opened for filling.&lt;ref name="eyedropper"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Filling System Histories: Here's Mud in Your Eye(dropper)|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/fillers/ed.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now that the materials' problems had been overcome and the flow of ink while writing had been regulated, the next problems to be solved were the creation of a simple, convenient self-filler and the problem of leakage. In 1890, W. B. Purvis, an African-American, patented a self-filler. Self-fillers began to arrive around the turn of the century; the most successful of these was probably the Conklin crescent-filler, followed by A. A. Waterman's twist-filler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filling Instructions: Twist-Fillers|url=http://www.vintagepens.com/filling_instructions_twist-fillers.shtml|website=Vintage Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crescent Filler|url=http://www.hisnibs.com/crescent.htm|website=His Nibs|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tipping point, however, was the runaway success of Walter A. Sheaffer's lever-filler, introduced in 1912,&lt;ref name="Binder Lever"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Filling System Histories: Lever Look Back|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/fillers/lever.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; paralleled by Parker's roughly contemporary button-filler.

===Pen leakage===
Meanwhile, many inventors turned their attention to the problem of leakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Fillers: Wring It Out!|url=http://www.richardspens.com/ref/fillers/twist.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest solutions to this problem came in the form of a "safety" pen with a retractable point that allowed the ink reservoir to be corked like a bottle. The most successful of these came from Francis C. Brown of the Caw's Pen and Ink Co. and from Morris W. Moore of Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety Pens|url=http://www.vintagepens.com/safety_pens.shtml|website=Vintage Pens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, [[George Safford Parker]] released the [[Parker Jointless]], named so because its barrel was single-piece to prevent leakage. The section assembly fit into the pen's end like a cork stopper; any leaked ink was kept inside the nib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle-Joint, End-Joint &amp; 'Jointless' Eyedroppers|url=https://www.vintagepens.com/middle-joint_eyedroppers.shtml|website=www.vintagepens.com|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Waterman began marketing a popular safety pen of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waterman Safeties|url=http://www.vintagepens.com/Waterman_safeties.shtml|website=Vintage Pens}}&lt;/ref&gt; For pens with non-retractable nibs, the adoption of screw-on caps with inner caps that sealed around the nib by bearing against the front of the section effectively solved the leakage problem (such pens were also marketed as "safety pens", as with the Parker Jack Knife Safety and the Swan Safety Screw-Cap).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Design Features: Safety Pens|url=http://www.richardspens.com/ref/design/safeties.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mabie Todd Swan Safety Screw Cap Eyedropper Filler|url=https://goodwriterspens.com/2011/05/07/the-mabie-todd-swan-safety-screw-cap-eyedropper-filler/|website=Good Writers' Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016|date=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further innovation===
[[File:Mabie Todd SWAN 172-52.jpg|thumb|Lever filler pen made of celluloid by Mabie Todd &amp; Co. New York (1927)]]

In Europe, the German supplies company which came to be known as [[Pelikan]] was started in 1838, and first introduced their pen in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Propas|first1=Rick|title=The PENguin – Pelikan, Parker and Other High Quality Fountain Pens|url=http://www.thepenguinpen.com/pelikan/pelikan_history.jsp|website=The PENguin|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based upon the acquisition of patents for solid-ink fountain pens from the factory of [[Slavoljub Penkala]] from [[Croatia]] (patented 1907, in mass production since 1911), and the patent of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Theodor Kovacs for the modern piston filler by 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929–1950 – The piston filling mechanism – Pelikan|url=http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US.CMS.displayCMS.93699./the-piston-filling-mechanism|website=Pelikan|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decades that followed saw many technological innovations in the manufacture of fountain pens. [[Celluloid]] gradually replaced hard [[rubber]], which enabled production in a much wider range of colors and designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nishimura|first1=David|title=What is celluloid, and why is it not the same as cellulose nitrate/nitrocellulose?|url=http://www.vintagepens.com/FAQmfr/celluloid.shtml|website=Vintage Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, manufacturers experimented with new filling systems. The inter-war period saw the introduction of some of the most notable models, such as the [[The Parker Pen Company|Parker]] [[Duofold]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parker Pens Penography: DUOFOLD|url=http://parkerpens.net/duofold.html|website=Parker Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Parker Vacumatic|Vacumatic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=The Parker Vacumatic|url=http://www.richardspens.com/ref/profiles/vac.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheaffer's Lifetime Balance series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Sheaffer's Balance|url=http://www.richardspens.com/ref/profiles/balance.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pelikan 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dating a Pelikan|url=https://thepelikansperch.com/database/dating-a-pelikan/|website=The Pelikan's Perch|accessdate=27 July 2016|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s and 1950s, fountain pens retained their dominance: early [[ballpoint pen]]s were expensive, were prone to leaks and had irregular inkflow, while the fountain pen continued to benefit from the combination of mass production and craftsmanship.(Bíró's patent, and other early patents on ball-point pens often used the term "ball-point fountain pen," because at the time the ball-point pen was considered a type of fountain pen; that is, a pen that held ink in an enclosed reservoir.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the pen|url=http://www.rickconner.net/penspotters/history.html|website=Rick Conner|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This period saw the launch of innovative models such as the [[Parker 51]], the [[Aurora (pen manufacturer)|Aurora]] 88, the Sheaffer Snorkel, and the Eversharp Skyline and (later) Skyliner, while the Esterbrook J series of lever-fill models with interchangeable steel nibs offered inexpensive reliability to the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheaffer Snorkel 1952–1959|url=http://www.penhero.com/PenGallery/Sheaffer/SheafferSnorkel.htm|website=Pen Hero|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J Series Pens|url=http://www.esterbrook.net/j.shtml|website=Esterbrook|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, refinements in ballpoint pen production gradually ensured its dominance over the fountain pen for casual use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pens – Overview|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/pens/overview|website=Collectors Weekly|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cartridge-filler fountain pens are still in common use in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, India, and the United Kingdom, and are widely used by young students in most private schools in England and at least one private school in Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Fountain pens boost 'self-esteem' | publisher = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6143844.stm | accessdate = November 25, 2006  | date=November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few modern manufacturers (especially [[Montblanc (company)|Montblanc]], Graf von Faber-Castell and Visconti) now depict the fountain pen as a collectible item or a [[status symbol]], rather than an everyday writing tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=When Buying Fountain Pens, Splurging (a Little) Is Totally Worth It|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/09/fountain-pen-hi-low/|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fountain pens continue to have a growing following among many who view them as superior writing instruments due to their relative smoothness and versatility. Retailers continue to sell fountain pens and inks for casual and calligraphic use. Recently, fountain pens have made a resurgence, with many manufacturers of fountain pens saying sales are climbing. This has led to a new wave of casual use fountain pens and custom ink manufacturers, who utilize online stores to easily sell fountain pens to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18071830|title=Why are fountain pen sales rising?|last=Brocklehurst|first=Steven|date=2012-05-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feed==
[[File:Fountain pen diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of the operation of a modern fountain pen]]

The feed of a fountain pen is the component that connects the nib of the pen with its ink reservoir.&lt;ref name="explain"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Fountain Pens Work|url=http://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-fountain-pens-work.html|website=Explain That Stuff|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It not only allows the ink to flow to the nib (in what is often described as a "controlled leak") but also regulates the amount of air flowing backwards up to the reservoir to replace this lost ink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Feeds: Revolution, Evolution, and Devolution|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/feeds/evolution.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It does this through the use of a series of narrow channels or "fissures" that run down its lower edge. As ink flows down these fissures, air is simultaneously allowed to flow upwards into the reservoir in an even exchange of volumes. The feed allows ink to flow when the pen is being put to paper but ensures ink does not flow when the pen is not in use. The feed makes use of capillary action; this is noticeable when a pen is refilled with a brightly coloured ink. The ink is taken up and into the feed by way of capillary action (and is often visible in clear demonstrator pens), but is not dispensed onto the paper until the nib makes contact.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;

How the feed is shaped may determine the wetness and flow of a particular pen. For this reason, feed material alone and its surface roughness may have a significant effect on the way two pens of the same nib size write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilmour|first1=Jono|title=Fountain Pen Guide Series, Session 1: Nibs, Feeds, and How They Come Together|url=http://www.pentorium.com/2012/08/25/fountain-pen-guide-series-session-1-nibs-feeds-and-how-they-come-together/|website=Pentorium|date=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fountainpendesign.wordpress.com/feed-supply-ink-function-foutain-pen/feeds-made-of-plastic/ Feeds made of Plastic …and not hard rubber]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pen feeds are crucial to preventing ink from dripping or leaking. Feeds often feature finned structures intended for buffering fountain pen ink. Buffering is the capacity to catch and temporary hold an overflow of ink caused by other conditions than writing towards the nib. When a fountain pen nib receives such an overflow it will result in ink blobbing or dripping also known as burping. A pen with a misconfigured feed might fail to deposit any ink whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conner|first1=Rick|title=Construction of a fountain pen|url=http://www.rickconner.net/penspotters/construction.html|website=Rick Conner|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tip of filler.jpg|right|thumb|Tip of a fountain pen nib]]

According to Mathur et al., "the modern fountain pen [[Nib (pen)|nib]] may be traced back to the original gold nib which had a tiny fragment of ruby attached to form the wear-point."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book |first1=P. |last1=Mathur |first2=K. |last2=Mathur |first3=S. |last3=Mathur |title=Developments and Changes in Science Based Technologies |isbn=1-4828-1398-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mCEAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 |accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the discovery of the [[platinum group]] of metals which include [[ruthenium]], [[osmium]] and [[iridium]], "a small quantity of iridium was isolated and used on the iridium-tipped gold [[dip pen]] nibs of the 1830s."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; Today, nibs are usually made of [[stainless steel]] or [[gold]] alloys, with the most popular gold content being [[Carat (purity)|14 carat (58⅓%)]] and 18 carat (75%).&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com materials" /&gt; [[Titanium]] is a less common metal used for making nibs. Gold is considered the optimum metal for its flexibility and its resistance to [[Galvanic series|corrosion]], although gold's corrosion resistance is less of an issue than in the past because of better stainless steel alloys and less corrosive inks.&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com materials"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=To the Point: Nib Materials|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/ttp/materials.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Visconti uses a nib made out of [[palladium]] as it is more flexible and corrosion resistant than gold.

===Nib plating===
Further gold plating provides favorable [[Wetting|wettability]], which is the ability of a solid surface to reduce the [[surface tension]] of a liquid in contact with it such that it spreads over the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penheaven.co.uk/blog/steel-vs-gold-fountain-pen-nibs/|title=Steel vs. Gold Fountain Pen Nibs|website=Pen Heaven|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nib tipping===
[[File:Pilot Parallel.jpg|thumb|An example of a type of an italic nib used in fountain pens. Often used to make art.]]
Gold and most steel and titanium nibs are tipped with a hard, wear-resistant alloy that typically includes metals from the platinum group. These metals share qualities of extreme hardness and corrosion resistance. The tipping material is often called "iridium", but there are few, if any, nib or pen manufacturers that used tipping alloys containing iridium metal since the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nibs.com/article4.html|title=Where's the Iridium?|website=The Nibster|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metals osmium, [[rhenium]], ruthenium and [[tungsten]] are used instead, generally as an alloy, with a little bit of osmium, rhenium, ruthenium and tungsten in a mix of other materials, produced as tiny pellets which are soldered or welded onto a nib tip prior to cutting the nib slit and grinding the tip into its final shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nibs.com/article5.html|journal=The PENnant|volume=XIII|issue=2|date=1999|title=How can we talk about Iridium?|author=Mottishaw, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Untipped steel and titanium points will wear more rapidly due to abrasion by the paper.&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com materials"/&gt;

===Capillary action===
The nib usually has a tapering or parallel slit cut down its centre, to convey the ink down the nib by [[capillary action]], as well as a "breather hole" of varying shape.&lt;ref name="Binder Nibs I"/&gt; The breather hole has no actual function regarding controlling the ink or air flow. Its main function is to provide an endpoint to the nib slit and forestall inaccuracies during nib slit cutting. Adding distance between the breather hole and the nib tip adds elasticity or flexibility to the nib. The breather hole also acts as a [[Stress_concentration#Prevention|stress relieving point]], preventing the nib from cracking longitudinally from the end of the slit as a result of repeated flexing during use.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;

The whole nib narrows to a point where the ink is transferred to the paper. Broad [[Western calligraphy|calligraphy]] pens may have several slits in the nib to increase ink flow and help distribute it evenly across the broad point. Nibs divided into three 'tines' are commonly known as music nibs. This is because their line, which can be varied from broad to fine, is suited for writing musical scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=To the Point: Making Music with a Pen|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/ttp/music.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of nibs===
Although the most common nibs end in a round point of various sizes (extra fine, fine, medium, broad), various other nib shapes are available. Examples of this are oblique, reverse oblique, stub, italic and 360-degree nibs.&lt;ref name="Binder Nibs I"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Nibs I: The Basics|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/nibs/primer.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broader nibs are used for less precise emphasis, with the benefit of a greater level of ink shading and/or sheen on less absorbent paper. Finer nibs (e.g. EF and F) may be used for intricate corrections and alterations, at the expense of shading and sheen. Oblique, reverse oblique, stub and italic nibs may be used for [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] purposes or for general handwritten compositions. The line width of a particular nib may vary based on its country of origin; Japanese nibs are often thinner in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Nibs II: Beyond the Basics with Specialty Nibs|url=http://www.richardspens.com/ref/nibs/beyond.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nib flexibility===
[[Flex nibs|Flexibility]] is given to nibs in several ways. First, the thickness of the nib metal changes flex. When the nib alloy has been pressed thick it will result in a hard nib, while thinly pressed nibs are more flexible. Nibs can be pressed so that they are thinner at the tip and thicker at the feed to mitigate stiffness or to give a more controlled flex. Second, the curve of the nib determines in part how stiff the nib will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grading Flex Nibs|url=http://www.vintagepen.net/grading-flex-nibs.html|website=VintagePen|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nibs pressed into more deeply convex curves, or into three or five faceted curves, will be stiffer than flatter nibs. Third, the "breather hole" size, shape, and position alter the stiffness. Heart shaped holes will improve flex as they widen, while round, small holes stiffen the pen. Fourth, the length of the tines determines how far they can spread under pressure, shorter tines make a stiffer nib. Fifth, the alloy used can affect stiffness: as mentioned before, gold is considered superior for its flex compared to steel. Moreover, purer gold (18k and 21k) is softer than most lower gold concentration (14k) alloys.&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com materials" /&gt;

Fountain pens dating from the first half of the 20th century are more likely to have flexible nibs, suited to the favored handwriting styles of the period (e.g. [[Copperplate script]] and [[Spencerian script]]). By the 1940s, writing preferences had shifted towards stiffer nibs that could withstand the greater pressure required for writing through carbon paper to create duplicate documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Rethinking The Value of Steel Nibs|url=http://www.richardspens.com/xf/2011/05.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, competition between the major pen brands such as Parker and Waterman, and the introduction of lifetime guarantees, meant that flexible nibs could no longer be supported profitably. In countries where this rivalry was not present to the same degree, for example the UK and Germany, flexible nibs are more common.&lt;ref name="gentleman"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fountain Pen Guide|url=
https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fountain-pen-guide/|website=Gentleman's Gazette|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, stiff nibs are the norm as people exchange between fountain pens and other writing modes. These more closely emulate the ballpoint pens modern users are experienced with. Despite being rigid and firm, the idea that steel nibs write "horribly" is a misconception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=To the Point: Steal the Steel|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=xf/2011/05.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More flexible nibs can be easily damaged by ballpoint users who write with excessive pressure. Ideally, a fountain pen's nib glides across the paper using the ink as a lubricant, and requires no pressure.

Good quality nibs that have been used appropriately are long lasting, often lasting longer than the lifetime of the original owner. Many vintage pens with decades-old nibs can still be used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Collect and Buy Vintage Fountain Pens|url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2015/11/19/writing-with-history-how-to-collect-and-buy-vintage-fountain-pens/|website=The Art of Manliness|accessdate=27 July 2016|date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different nib styles===
Other styles of fountain pen nibs include hooded (e.g. Parker 51, Parker 61, 2007 Parker 100 and Hero 329),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=To the Point: Nibz 'n the Hood|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/ttp/hood.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; inlaid (e.g. Sheaffer Targa or Sheaffer P.F.M) or integral Nib (Parker T-1 and Falcon, Pilot Myu 701), which may also be ground to have different writing characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Design Features: Integral Nibs|url=http://www.richardspens.com/ref/design/integral_nibs.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users are often cautioned not to lend or borrow fountain pens as the nib "wears in" at an angle unique to each individual person.&lt;ref name="gentleman" /&gt; A different user is likely to find that a worn-in nib does not write satisfactorily in their hand and, furthermore, creates a second wear surface, ruining the nib for the original user. This, however, is not a point of concern in pens with modern, durable tipping material, as these pens take many years to develop any significant wear.

== Filling mechanisms ==
[[File:Fountain pens and converters.jpg|thumb|Left to Right: Gama Supreme eyedropper, Jinhao 159 and X750 using international standard converters or ink cartridges and Lamy Studio stainless and Nexx M using proprietary Lamy converters or ink cartridges.]]
[[Image:Hero332inkfillerenl1.JPG|thumb|A squeeze filler by Hero]]

===Eyedropper filler===
The reservoirs of the earliest fountain pens were mostly filled by [[Pasteur pipette|eyedropper]]. This was a cumbersome and potentially messy process, which led to the commercial development of alternative methods that quickly dominated the industry.&lt;ref name="eyedropper"/&gt; However, newer, more convenient filling mechanisms have never entirely displaced "eyedropper-filling" pens in the marketplace, and they remain widely manufactured today. For some the simplicity of the mechanism, coupled with the large volume of ink it can encapsulate, compensates for the inconvenience of ink transfer.&lt;ref name="eyedropper" /&gt;

After the eyedropper-filler era came the first generation of mass-produced self-fillers, almost all using a rubber sac to hold the ink. The sac was compressed and then released by various mechanisms to fill the pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Filling System Histories: Capillary Pens – the Perfect Filler?|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/fillers/capillary.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-filling designs===
The Conklin crescent filler, introduced c. 1901, was one of the first mass-produced self-filling pen designs. The crescent filling system employs an arch-shaped crescent attached to a rigid metal pressure bar, with the crescent portion protruding from the pen through a slot and the pressure bar inside the barrel. A second component, a C-shaped hard rubber ring, is located between the crescent and the barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conklin Crescent Fillers|url=http://www.vintagepens.com/Conklin_crescent_fillers.shtml|website=Vintage Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordinarily, the ring blocks the crescent from pushing down. To fill the pen, one simply turns the ring around the barrel until the crescent matches up to the hole in the ring, allowing one to push down the crescent and squeeze the internal sac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conklin – Crescent Filler Collection|url=http://www.conklinpens.com/crescent_filler_collection_page.html|website=Conklin Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other filling mechanisms were introduced to compete, such as the coin-filler (where a coin or 'medallion' was supplied along with the pen), match-filler (using a matchstick) and a 'blow-filler' which unsurprisingly required the pen owner to blow into the barrel to depress the internal sac.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Piston filling innovation===
In 1907, Walter A. Sheaffer patented the Lever filler, using a hinged lever set into the pen barrel which pressed down onto a bar which in turn compressed the rubber sac inside, creating a vacuum to force ink into the pen. Introduced in 1912, this innovation was rapidly imitated by the other major pen makers. Parker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a blind cap on the end of the barrel; when pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac.&lt;ref name="Binder Lever"/&gt;

Following the crescent filler came a series of systems of increasing complexity, reaching their apogee in the Sheaffer Snorkel, introduced in 1952. The Sheaffer "Snorkel" system filled the ink sac through a retractable tube above and behind the pen point. This eliminated the need to dunk the point in ink, and the subsequent need to wipe it.&lt;ref name="snorkel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheaffer Snorkel 1952–1959|url=http://www.penhero.com/PenGallery/Sheaffer/SheafferSnorkel.htm|website=Pen Hero|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the modern plastic ink cartridge in the early 1950s, though, most of these systems were phased out in favour of convenience (but reduced capacity).

Screw-mechanism piston-fillers were made as early as the 1820s, but the mechanism's modern popularity begins with the original [[Pelikan]] of 1929, based upon a Croatian patent. The basic idea is simple: turn a knob at the end of the pen, and a screw mechanism draws a piston up the barrel, sucking in ink. Thus they were easier to fill. This is also why this filling mechanism is very popular in today's fountain pens. Some of the earlier models had to dedicate as much as half of the pen length to the mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929–1950 – The piston filling mechanism |url=http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US.CMS.displayCMS.93699./the-piston-filling-mechanism|website=Pelikan|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advent of telescoping pistons has improved this; the Touchdown Filler was introduced by [[Sheaffer]] in 1949. It was advertised as an "Exclusive Pneumatic Down-stroke Filler."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PenHero.com – PenGallery – Sheaffer Touchdown Filling System|url=http://www.penhero.com/PenGallery/Sheaffer/SheafferTouchdownGuide.htm|website=Pen Hero|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To fill it, a knob at the end of the barrel is unscrewed and the attached plunger is drawn out to its full length. The nib is immersed in ink, the plunger is pushed in, compressing and then releasing the ink sac by means of air pressure. The nib is kept in the ink for approximately 10 seconds to allow the reservoir to fill. This mechanism is very closely modeled after a similar pneumatic filler introduced by Chilton over a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=How to Restore the Touchdown Filling System|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/repair/touchdown.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern filling mechanisms===
[[File:Schmidt K5 fountain pen converter + 2.5 mm 316 Stainless Steel bearing ball.jpg|thumb|Schmidt K5 piston-style standard international size fountain pen converter, containing a user inserted 2.5 mm diameter Marine grade 316 stainless steel bearing ball]]

A [[capillary action|capillary]] filling system was introduced by [[Parker Pen Company|Parker]] in the Parker 61 in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Match|first=Richard|date=September 1956|title=Things you never knew about your pen|journal=[[Popular Science Monthly]]|location=New York|volume=169|issue=3|page=278|quote=it drinks its fill automatically, by a reverse application of our old friend capillary action}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no moving parts: the ink reservoir within the barrel was open at the upper end, but contained a tightly rolled length of slotted, flexible plastic. To fill, the barrel was unscrewed, the exposed open end of the reservoir was placed in ink and the interstices of the plastic sheet and slots initiated [[capillary action]], drawing up and retaining the ink. The outside of the reservoir was coated with [[Teflon]], a repellent compound that released excess ink as it was withdrawn. Ink was transferred through a further capillary tube to the nib. No method of flushing the device was offered, and because of problems from clogging with dried and hardened ink, production was eventually stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rickconner.net/penoply/park.06.html|title=Parker 61|last=Conner|first=Rick|date=2005-01-20|work=PRick Conner|accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the year 2000, Pelikan introduced a filling system involving a valve in the blind end of the pen, which mates with a specially designed ink bottle.&lt;ref name="richardspens.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Design Features: What Were They Thinking?|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/design/what_thinking.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus docked, ink is then squeezed into the pen barrel (which, lacking any mechanism other than the valve itself, has nearly the capacity of an eyedropper-fill pen of the same size). This system had been implemented only in their "Level" line, which was discontinued in 2006.&lt;ref name="richardspens.com"/&gt;

Most pens today use either a piston filler, squeeze-bar filler or cartridge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Filling Systems: Overview of How They Work and How to Fill Them|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/fillers/fillers.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pens are also compatible with a ''converter'', which has the same fitting as the pen's cartridge and has a filling mechanism and a reservoir attached to it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This enables a pen to either fill from cartridges, or from a bottle of ink. The most common type of converters are piston-style, but many other varieties may be found today.
Piston-style converters generally have a transparent round tubular ink reservoir. Fountain pen inks feature differing [[surface tension]]s that can cause an ink to [[adhesion|adhere]] or "stick" against the inside of the reservoir. Common solutions for this problem are adding a small (rust-proof) ink agitating object like a [[stainless steel|316 or 904L stainless steel]] or [[zirconium dioxide]] [[bearing ball]], [[Spring (device)|spring]] or hollow tube in the tubular reservoir to mechanically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Adding a very small amount of [[surfactant]] like [[Triton X-100]] used in Kodak Photo-Flo 200 wetting agent to the ink will chemically promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. However ink might react adversely to adding a surfactant.

Vacuum fillers, such as those used by [[Pilot (pen company)|Pilot]] in the Custom 823, utilize air pressure to fill the ink chamber. In this case, while the nib is submerged in ink, a plunger is pushed down the empty chamber to create a vacuum in the space behind it. The end of the chamber has a section wider than the rest, and when the plunger passes this point, the difference in air pressure in the area behind the plunger and the area ahead of it is suddenly evened out and ink rushes in behind the plunger to fill the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jetpens.com/blog/fountain-pen-filling-systems-explained/pt/912|title=Fountain Pen Filling Systems Explained - JetPens.com|website=www.jetpens.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartridges ==
A patent for an ink cartridge system for fountain pens was filed in 1890. In the early 20th century, cartridges were made from glass and thin copper tubing. However, the concept only became successful and popular after the introduction of moulded plastic cartridges, firstly by Waterman in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagepens.com/early_cartridge_pens.shtm |title=Early Cartridge Pens |website=Vintage Pens |accessdate=20 May 2014 |author=Nishimura, David }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern plastic cartridges can contain small ridges on the inside to promote free movement of the contained ink and ink/air exchange during writing. Often cartridges are closed with a small ball that gets pressed into the cartridge during insertion into the pen. This ball also aids free movement of the contained ink.

===Standard international===
[[File:International Ink Cartridge Short.svg|thumb|Dimensions of short International Ink Cartridge]]
Most European fountain pen brands (for example [[Caran d'Ache (company)|Caran d'Ache]], [[Faber-Castell]], [[Michel Perchin]], DuPont, [[Montegrappa]], [[Stipula]], [[Pelikan]], [[Montblanc (company)|Montblanc]], [[Europen (brand)|Europen]], [[Monteverde (brand)|Monteverde]], [[Sigma (pen brand)|Sigma]], [[Delta (pen manufacturer)|Delta]], [[Italix]] and [[Rotring]]) and some pen brands of other continents (for example Acura, Bexley, Retro51, [[Tombow]] and [[Platinum (pen company)|Platinum]] (with adaptor)) use so called "'''international cartridges'''" (AKA "European cartridges" or "standard cartridges" or "universal cartridges"), in short (38&amp;nbsp;mm in length, about 0.75 [[Litre|ml]] of capacity) or long (72&amp;nbsp;mm, 1.50 ml) sizes, or both. It is to some extent a standard, so the international cartridges of any manufacturer can be used in most fountain pens that accept international cartridges.&lt;ref name="goulet video"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goulet|first1=Brian|title=Who Invented Standard International Cartridges? – Q&amp;A Slices|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x571al6Y9D4|website=YouTube (Goulet Pens)|publisher=Goulet Pens|accessdate=27 July 2016|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, converters that are meant to replace international cartridges can be used in most fountain pens that accept international cartridges. Some very compact fountain pens (for example Waterman Ici et La and Monteverde Diva) accept only short international cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fountain Pen Converters|url=http://www.nibs.com/fountain-pen-converters.htm|website=Nibs|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Converters can not be used in them (except for so-called mini-converters by Monteverde). Some pens (such as the modern Waterman models) have intentional fittings which prevent the usage of short cartridges. Such pens can only take a proprietary cartridge from the same manufacturer, in this case the long Waterman cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Which Ink Cartridges Can Be Used With Which Fountain Pens?|url=http://www.nibs.com/FAQInkCartridges.htm|website=Nibs|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parker Fountain pen.jpg|thumb|[[Parker Vector]] stainless steel with proprietary [[Quink]] cartridges containing 1.4 ml ink]]

===Proprietary offerings===
Many fountain pen manufacturers have developed their own proprietary cartridges, for example [[The Parker Pen Company|Parker]], [[Lamy]], [[Sheaffer]], [[A. T. Cross Company|Cross]], Sailor, [[Platinum (pen company)|Platinum]], [[Platignum]], [[Waterman pens|Waterman]] and [[Namiki]]. Fountain pens from [[Aurora (pen manufacturer)|Aurora]], [[The Shanghai Hero Pen Company|Hero]], [[Duke (pen company)|Duke]] and [[Uranus (company)|Uranus]] accept the same cartridges and converters that '''Parker''' uses and vice versa ([[Lamy]] cartridges, though not officially, are known to interchange with Parker cartridges also). Cartridges of Aurora are slightly different from cartridges by Parker.&lt;ref name="nibs cartridges"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fountain Pen Ink Cartridges|url=http://www.nibs.com/fountain-pen-ink-cartridges.htm|website=Nibs|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding converters to be used instead of such proprietary cartridges are usually made by the same company that made the fountain pen itself. Some very compact fountain pens accept only proprietary cartridges made by the same company that made that pen, for example Sheaffer Agio Compact and Sheaffer Prelude Compact. It is not possible to use a converter in them at all. In such pens the only practical way to use another brand of ink is to fill empty cartridges with bottled ink using a [[syringe]].&lt;ref name="nibs cartridges" /&gt;

Standard international cartridges are closed by a small ball, held inside the ink exit hole by glue or by a very thin layer of plastic. When the cartridge is pressed into the pen, a small pin pushes in the ball, which falls inside the cartridge. The Parker and Lamy cartridges do not have such a ball. They are closed by a piece of plastic, which is broken by a sharp pin when inserted in the pen.&lt;ref name="goulet video" /&gt;

===Concerns and alternatives===
Pen manufacturers using a proprietary cartridge (which in almost all cases are the more expensive ones like the ones mentioned above) tend to discourage the use of cheaper&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com inks"/&gt; internationally standardised short/long cartridges or adaptations thereof due to their variance in ink quality in the cartridges which may not offer as much performance, or be of lesser quality than the manufacturer of the pen; ink that has been designed specifically for the pen. In addition, cheaper ink tends to take longer to dry on paper, may skip or produce uneven colour on the page and less "tolerant" on lower, thinner grades of paper (e.g. 75gs/m).&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com inks"/&gt;

While cartridges are mess-free and more convenient to refill than bottle filling, converter and bottle filling systems are still sold. Non-cartridge filling systems tend to be slightly more economical in the long run since ink is generally less expensive in bottles than in cartridges. Advocates of bottle-based filling systems also cite less waste of plastic for the environment, a wider selection of inks, easier cleaning of pens (as drawing the ink in through the nib helps dissolve old ink), and the ability to check and refill inks at any time.&lt;ref name="goldspot" /&gt;

== Inks ==
[[File:Green Ink Bottle - 02.jpg|thumb|A bottle of green ink]]

{{Main article|Fountain pen ink}}
[[Ink]]s intended for use with fountain pens are water-based. These inks are commonly available in bottles. Plastic cartridges came into use in the 1960s, but bottled inks are still the mainstay for most fountain pen enthusiasts. Bottled inks usually cost less than an equivalent amount in cartridges and afford a wider variety of colors and properties.&lt;ref name="penfountain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penfountain.wordpress.com/2010/09/11/fountain-pen-inks-arent-all-the-same/ |title=Fountain pen inks aren't all the same|accessdate=2011-02-20|year=2010|website=Penfountain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fountain pens are not as tightly coupled with their inks as [[ballpoint pen|ballpoints]] or [[gel pen]]s are, yet some care must be taken when selecting their inks. Contemporary fountain pen inks are almost exclusively [[dye]]-based because [[pigment]] particles usually clog the narrow passages.&lt;ref name="penfountain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://goldspotpens.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/cartridge-vs-converter.html|title=Cartridge vs. converter|accessdate=2016-07-27|year=2010|website=Goldspot Pens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[iron gall ink]]s intended for dip pens are not suitable for fountain pens as they will corrode the pen (a phenomenon known as flash corrosion) and destroy the functionality of the fountain pen.&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com inks"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binder|first1=Richard|title=Inks: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|url=http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/care/inks.htm|website=Richard Binder's Pens|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, modern surrogate iron gall formulas are offered for fountain pens. These modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro gallic compounds, but are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still be corrosive if left in the pen for a long period.&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com inks" /&gt; To avoid corrosion on delicate metal parts and ink clogging a more thorough than usual cleaning regime – which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water – is sometimes advised by manufacturers or resellers.&lt;ref name="maintenance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nibs.com/PenMaintenance.htm |title=Pen maintenance|accessdate=2016-07-27|website=Nibs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pigmented inks do exist for fountain pens, but these are uncommon. Normal [[India ink]] cannot be used in fountain pens because it contains [[shellac]] as a binder which would very quickly clog such pens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/pens/|first=Michael A. |last=Covington|website=A Few Notes About Fountain Pens|title=A Few Notes About Fountain Pens|accessdate= 2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inks ideally should be fairly free-flowing, free of sediment, and non-corrosive, though this generally excludes permanence and prevents large-scale commercial use of some colored dyes. Proper care and selection of ink will prevent most problems.&lt;ref name="www.richardspens.com inks"/&gt;

Collectors may decide to use the antiques in addition to showcasing them in closed spaces such as glass displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Lennox|title=The fascination with fountain pens|website=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20141204-a-fascination-with-fountain-pens|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, collectors got "seriously hooked" when a set of Montblancs went for $290,000 each in a fundraiser event for the [[Princess Grace Foundation]] in Monaco. Each of these Montblanc pens came with 996 diamonds and 92 rubies. It has been speculated that most collectors hail from the United States of America and China, though pen dealers in England say the trend is likely to sweep England imminently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Think Ink: Why Pen Prices Are Soaring |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hebrew punctuation}}

'''Gershayim''' ({{lang-he-n|גֵּרְשַׁיִם}}, without niqqud {{hebrew|גרשיים}}), also occasionally '''grashayim'''&lt;ref name="GHG15f"&gt;{{Cite GHG|15|f}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-he-n|גְּרָשַׁיִם}}), names two distinct [[Typography|typographical]] marks in the [[Hebrew language]]. The name literally means "double [[geresh]]".

==Punctuation mark==
Gershayim most commonly refers to the [[punctuation mark]] {{angle bracket|״}}. It is always written before the last letter of the non-inflected form of a word or numeral. It is used in the following ways:

*To indicate an [[acronym]].&lt;ref name="academy-punctuation-guidelines-31"&gt;[http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision5.html Hebrew punctuation guidelines, § 31], [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015065211/http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision5.html |date=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: {{Hebrew|דּוּ״חַ}} (singular), {{Hebrew|דּוּ״חוֹת}} (plural), "report" represents {{Hebrew|'''ד'''ין '''וח'''שבון}}; and {{Hebrew|מ״כ}} (masculine), {{Hebrew|מַ״כִּית}} (feminine), "squad commander" represents {{Hebrew|'''מ'''פקד '''כ'''יתה}}.
*To indicate a multi-digit [[Hebrew numeral]]. For example: י״ח represents 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GHG|5|k}} ff.&lt;/ref&gt; (Single-digit numerals are indicated with a following geresh.)
*To indicate the names of Hebrew letters, differentiating them from any [[homograph]]s.&lt;ref name="academy-punctuation-guidelines-31" /&gt; Compare {{Hebrew|הוּא שִׂרְטֵט עַיִן}} "he sketched an [[eye]]" with {{Hebrew|הוּא שִׂרְטֵט עַיִ״ן }} "he sketched an [[ayin]]".
*To indicate Hebrew word [[Semitic root|roots]].&lt;ref name="academy-punctuation-guidelines-31" /&gt; For example: the root of {{Hebrew|תַּשְׁבֵּצִים}}{{IPA|/taʃbeˈtsim/}} "crossword puzzles" is {{Hebrew|שב״צ}} (š—b—ṣ); the root of {{Hebrew|לְהַטּוֹת}} {{IPA|/lehaˈtot/}} "to tilt, to conjugate" is {{Hebrew|נט״ה}} (n—ṭ—h); and the root of {{Hebrew|הִסְתַּנְכְּרְנוּת}} {{IPA|/histankreˈnut/}} "becoming synchronized" is {{Hebrew|סנכר״נ}} (s–n–k–r–n).
*In older texts, to indicate the [[transliteration]] of a foreign word. This use corresponds to [[english language|English]]'s use of [[italics]]. For example: in printed works of [[Rashi]], the town of Rashi's birth, [[Troyes]], is spelled {{Hebrew|טרוי״ש}}.

==Cantillation mark==

{{details|Gershayim (trope)}}

Gershayim is the name of a disjunctive [[cantillation]] accent in the [[Tanakh]] - &lt;span style="font-size: 180%; line-height: 180%; font-family: Gisha,'Times New Roman',Arial,'Microsoft Sans Serif',Code2000,'Courier New','Ezra SIL';"&gt;֞&lt;/span&gt;. It is placed above the stressed syllable, as in &lt;span style="font-size: 180%; line-height: 180%; font-family: Gisha,'Times New Roman',Arial,'Microsoft Sans Serif',Code2000,'Courier New','Ezra SIL';"&gt;וַיִּקַּ֞ח&lt;/span&gt; (Genesis 22:3).&lt;ref name="GHG15f" /&gt;

==Computer encoding==

Most keyboards do not have a key for the gershayim. As a result, a [[quotation mark]] is often substituted for it.

'''Gustav Sandgren''' (20 August 1904 – 11 August 1983) was a Swedish author.

==Early life and writing==
Sandgren's parents were O.J. Sandgren and Karolina Adolfsson, who gave their son a poor but happy childhood. The father was, in addition to his work, a [[fiddle]]r. Their son Gustav had since childhood, both heard and played on the fiddle—a musical instrument which he handled with skill throughout life. He was fascinated by folklore, mystery and dreams.

After school Sandgren became a labourer and worked for five years at Cloetta chocolate in Ljungsbro. He eventually became a full-time writer, and was to have 47 books behind him when he died in 1983. He also wrote poetry collections (a few written with his wife Ria Wägner). Together with [[Harry Martinson]], [[Artur Lundkvist]], [[Erik Asklund]] and [[Josef Kjellgren]], he formed the literary group ''[[Fem unga]]'' ("Five young ones").&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Other accomplishments include fairy tales, and children's books. Sometimes he wrote under the pseudonym Gabriel Linde. The last name Linde referred to the [[Croft (land)|croft]] where he stayed in the summer of 1933, located about a kilometre southeast of Norrvrå station in [[Hölö]], Södermanland.

==Personal life==
He married Titti Lindstedt in 1935. They lived in Björknäs at Hållsviken west of Trosa in [[Södermanland]]. He subsequently married Ria Wägner and then spent forty years living in Lidingö, Stockholm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8537">'''Herman Wright Cappelen''' (born 1967) is a Norwegian [[philosopher]]. He is professor of philosophy at the [[University of Oslo]] and (one fifth time) at the [[University of St Andrews]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hf.uio.no/csmn/english/people/core-group/hermanc/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; He works primarily on [[philosophy of language]] and philosophical methodology and related areas in [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[metaphysics]].  In 2013, he became editor of the journal ''Inquiry.''&lt;ref&gt;http://hermancappelen.net/inquiry.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Cappelen is the son of author and publisher [[Peder Wright Cappelen]] and actress [[Kari Simonsen]].

== Education ==

Cappelen received a BA in [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] from the [[University of Oxford]], [[Balliol College]], in 1989. In 1996, Cappelen received his PhD from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The title of his dissertation was "The Metaphysics of Words and the Semantics of Quotation". His advisors were Charles Chihara, [[Stephen Neale]], and [[John Searle]].

== Academic career ==

Since 2015, Cappelen has been Professor at the University of Oslo, where he co-directs CSMN's ConceptLab.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/projects/cl/&lt;/ref&gt; He is running, with [[Øystein Linnebo]] and [[Camilla Serck-Hanssen]], a project on conceptual engineering funded by a Toppforsk award from the [[Research Council of Norway]]. Prior to that, he was, since 2007, Professor and Arché chair at the [[University of St Andrews]]. He has previously held positions at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], [[University of Oslo]], and [[Vassar College]]. He has been the Director of the Arché Philosophical Research Centre&lt;ref&gt;This is verified on the Oxford University Press author page for Herman Cappelen, accessible [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199644865.do here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was co-investigator of two research projects funded by longterm [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]] grants: "Contextualism and Relativism" and "Intuitions and Philosophical Methodology". Cappelen was one of the original applicants for the research center Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature (Norwegian Centre of Excellence) at the [[University of Oslo]]. Cappelen has been a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] since 2008.

== Work ==

Cappelen's most influential work is the 2004 book, Insensitive Semantics (written with [[Ernest Lepore|Ernie Lepore]]). The book defends a minimal role for context in semantics and advocates speech act pluralism. It is one of the most cited works in philosophy within the last 10 years.

Cappelen has argued that the role of [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuition]] in Western [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic philosophy]] is overstated.  His 2012 book, Philosophy without Intuitions, argues that intuition plays a minor role - or no role at all - in most modern philosophy, and the fear that intuition is widespread has been damaging.&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph is informed by a summary of Cappelen's 2012 book, ''Philosophy without Intuitions'', available on the [[Oxford University Press]] website, available online [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199644865.do here]&lt;/ref&gt;  His claim that the role of intuitions is overstated is controversial, and has been hotly debated.&lt;ref&gt;For more on this discussion, read [http://blog.jonathanichikawa.net/2012/10/review-of-philosophy-without-intuitions.html this blog] or [http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/no-intuitions-no-relativism/ this article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Josh Dever]], Cappelen has argued that the notion of perspective is unimportant for the philosophy of language, thought, and action. Their 2013 book ''The Inessential Indexical'' argues that the phenomena which, for example, [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] think show the importance of indexical representation of the self and time can be accounted for using resources already available in the philosophy of language and thought.&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph is informed by a summary of Cappelen's 2012 book, ''Philosophy without Intuitions'', available on the [[Oxford University Press]] website, available online [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-inessential-indexical-9780199686742?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cappelen has also authored, or co-authored, important books on the debate between contextualists and relativists (''Relativism and Monadic Truth'', with [[John Hawthorne]]), and on quotation (''Language Turned on Itself'' with [[Ernest Lepore]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/relativism-and-monadic-truth-9780199560554?q=herman%20cappelen&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=gb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/language-turned-on-itself-9780199575527?q=herman%20cappelen&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=gb&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his papers co-written with [[Ernest Lepore|Ernie Lepore]] are collected in ''Liberating Content''.&lt;ref&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/liberating-content-9780199641338?q=herman%20cappelen&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=gb&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently writing a series of philosophy of language textbooks with [[Josh Dever]], the first of which, ''Context and Communication'' was released in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/context-and-communication-9780198733065?q=herman%20cappelen&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=gb&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, his monograph ''Fixing Language: An Essay On Conceptual Engineering'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fixing-language-9780198814719?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; It surveys both historical and contemporary work on [[conceptual engineering]], and presents a theory of its nature and limitations.

'''Ikwerre''', also spelt as '''Ikwere''', is a [[language]] spoken primarily by the [[Ikwerre people]] who inhabit [[Rivers State]], [[Nigeria]].

== Classification ==
Most publications classify it as an [[Igbo language|Igbo dialect]]. The classification of Ikwerre as an Igbo dialect is a subject of controversy among some in the Ikwerre community due to political reasons. Based on lexicostatistical analysis, [[Kay Williamson]] originally asserted that the Ikwerre, [[Ekpeye]], [[Ogba language|Ogba]], Etche and [[Igbo language|Igbo]] languages belonged to the same language cluster, but were not dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Williamson | first=Kay | title=ODUMA: The Lower Niger Languages | year=1974 | volume=1 | publisher=Rivers State Council of Arts &amp; Culture, Port Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent studies by both Williamson and [[Roger Blench]] concluded that Igbo, Ikwerre, Ogba and their sister languages apart from Ekpeye form a "language cluster" and that they are somewhat [[mutually intelligible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Williamson | first=Kay |author2=Roger M. Blench | title=African languages: an introduction | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are indications that the Ikwerre society was bilingual even in the pre-colonial Nigeria, with people speaking other Igbo dialects and Ikwerre.&lt;ref name="ihemere"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Tri-Generational Study of Language Choice &amp; Shift in Port Harcourt |author= Kelechukwu U. Ihemere |publisher= Universal-Publishers |year= 2007 |pages= 28–35 |isbn= 9781581129588 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uwk5IkralBAC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=ikwerre+igbo&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=ikwerre%20igbo&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Ikwerre distinguishes vowels by quality (frontedness and height), the presence or absence of [[nasalization]], and the presence or absence of [[advanced tongue root]].
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
!colspan="2"|
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
!rowspan="2"| [[High vowel|High]]
! &lt;small&gt;[[Advanced tongue root|+ATR]]&lt;small&gt;
| {{IPA|i ĩ}}
| {{IPA|u ũ}}
|-
! &lt;small&gt;−ATR&lt;/small&gt;
| {{IPA|ɪ ɪ̃}}
| {{IPA|ʊ ʊ̃}}
|-
!rowspan="2"| [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
! &lt;small&gt;[[Advanced tongue root|+ATR]]&lt;/small&gt;
| {{IPA|e ẽ}}
| {{IPA|o õ}}
|-
! &lt;small&gt;−ATR&lt;/small&gt;
| {{IPA|ɛ ɛ̃}}
| {{IPA|ɔ ɔ̃}}
|-
! [[Low vowel|Low]]
! &lt;small&gt;−ATR&lt;/small&gt;
|colspan="2"| {{IPA|a ã}}
|}
There is also a vowel *{{IPA|/ə̃/}} which is posited to explain syllabic nasal consonants in accounts of the language which state that Ikwerre has no nasal stops. This sound is realized as {{IPA|[ɨ̃]}} or a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] nasal which is [[homorganic]] to the following consonant.

====Vowel harmony====
Ikwerre exhibits two kinds of [[vowel harmony]]:
#Every vowel in an Ikwerre word, with a few exceptions, agrees with the other vowels in the word as to the presence or absence of [[advanced tongue root]].
#Vowels of the same height in adjacent syllables must all be either front or back, i.e. the pairs {{IPA|/i/}} &amp; {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/ɪ/}} &amp; {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, {{IPA|/e/}} &amp; {{IPA|/o/}}, and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} &amp; {{IPA|/ɔ/}} cannot occur in adjacent syllables. Vowels of different heights, however, need not match for frontness/backness either. This doesn't apply to the first vowel in nouns beginning with a vowel or with {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, and doesn't apply to [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words.

The oral consonants {{IPA|[ḅ ʼḅ l ɾ j ɰ w h hʷ]}} occur before oral vowels, and their nasal allophones {{IPA|[m ʼm n ɾ̃ ȷ̃ ɰ̃ w̃ h̃ h̃ʷ]}} before nasal vowels. The "non-explosive stops" {{IPA|[ḅ ʼḅ]}} are not [[plosive]]s (not pulmonic), and are equivalent to [[implosive]]s in other varieties of Igbo.

The tap {{IPA|/ɾ/}} may sometimes be realized as an approximant {{IPA|[ɹ]}}.

'''Itza'''' (also known as '''Itza''' or '''Itzaj''') is a critically endangered Mayan language spoken by the [[Itza people]] near [[Lake Petén Itzá|Lake Peten Itza]] in north-central [[Guatemala]]. The language has only 25 fluent speakers and 60 nonfluent speakers.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ethnologue.com/16/show_language.asp?code=itz|title=Itza'|last=Lewis|first=M. Paul|date=2009|website=Ethnologue|publisher=SIL International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Itza' was the language of administration across much of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] prior to 1697, when the Itza people controlled the last significant Mayan nation in [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Itzaj Maya Grammar|last=Hofling|first=Charles Andrew|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=2000|isbn=0-87480-666-6|location=Salt Lake City|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the Itza people resettled their ancestral home in the [[Petén Basin]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The subjugation of the Itza capital by the Spanish forced the Itza people to flee or live amongst the Spaniards, such as in [[San José, El Petén|San Jose, Guatemala]], where the only modern speakers of the language live.

The modern Itza people are the last of the Lowland Maya to be able to directly trace their heritage back to the [[pre-Columbian era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atran, Medin, Ross, Lynch, Coley, Ucan Ek, Vapnarsky|first=Scott, Douglas, Norbert, Elizabeth, John, Edilberto, Valentina|year=1999|title=Folkecology and Commons Management in the Maya Lowlands|jstor=48105|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=96|pages=7598–7603|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.13.7598|url=https://jeannicod.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ijn_00000132/document}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Itza' language reflects this history in its nomenclature for the natural world: Itza' words referring to agriculture and agricultural practices remain unchanged since first being recorded.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atran, Chase, Fedick, Knapp, McKillop, Marcus, Schwartz., Webb|first=Scott, Arlen F., Scott L., Gregory, Heather, Joyce, Norman B., Malcolm C.|year=1993|title=Itza Maya Tropical Agro-Forestry|jstor=2744279|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=34|pages=633–700|doi=10.1086/204212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Itza' possesses a rich vocabulary for crops and animals that encodes specific information about different varietals and individuals of the species.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

==Classification==
Itza' belongs to the Yucatecan branch of Mayan Languages. The other languages in the Yucatecan branch are [[Yucatec]], [[Lacandon language|Lacandon]], and [[Mopan language|Mopan]]. All Yucatecan languages are closely linked with each other. However, people speaking Itza' and those speaking Yucatec have difficulties understanding each other.
There are 12 different branches of Mayan language, all with sub families like Itza'.

==History==
The government banned the speaking of Itzá in the 1930s and two generations of Itzá Maya have grown up learning only Spanish. The late 1980s brought an increase in interest among Maya people, including the Itzá, in preserving their cultural heritage. The Guatemalan government has set up an institution, the [[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]], to help develop and preserve various Mayan languages, including Itza'.&lt;ref&gt;"Language: Itza, Guatemala." Unesco.org. Discovery Channel, 2004. Web. 02 May 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Itza' is spoken on the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá in [[San José, El Petén|San José]], [[Petén Department]], Guatemala. Among the ethnic population of 2,000, there are only 12 fluent speakers and 60 non-fluent, Spanish-Itza' bilingual speakers.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

The Itza language does not contain tone nor pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bricker|first=Victoria|date=January 1994|title=Reviewed Work(s): Itzá Maya Texts with a Grammatical Overview by Charles Andrew Hofling|url=|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=60|pages=87–92|doi=10.1086/466222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===
[[Possession (linguistics)|Possession]] is marked with the same ergative particle as is used in verbal constructions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofling|first=Charles A.|year=1990|title=Possession and Ergativity in Itzá Maya|jstor=1265229|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=56|pages=542–560|doi=10.1086/466174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possession constructions are marked differently based on whether the possession is inherent or non-inherent. Body parts, family members, and personal property are marked as being possessed differently than are parts of a whole. Additional possession constructions exist and are used generally where the possessor is inanimate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

All nouns in Itza' possess [[grammatical gender]]. The masculine and feminine genders are overtly marked by a prefix, while the neutral gender is unmarked.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lois|first=Ximena|year=1998|title=Gender Markers as "Rigid Determiners" of the Itzaj Maya World|jstor=1265685|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=64|pages=224–282|doi=10.1086/466358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender is not marked on all nouns: typically, [[proper noun]]s and professions have marked gender, while other categories do not. The gender markers of Itza' also play the role of [[rigid designator]]s: specific individuals across all possible worlds will have overtly marked gender, while references to classes of objects will not.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Verbs ===
Itza' is an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative-absolutive language]] demonstrating [[split ergativity]]. Ergative [[Grammatical person|person]] markers indicate [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] subjects in the [[imperfective aspect]] and all [[Transitive verb|transitive]] subjects, while absolutive person markers indicate intransitive subjects in the [[perfective aspect]] and in [[dependent clause]]s and all objects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Itza' employs the [[Irrealis mood|Irrealis]] [[grammatical mood]] to mark the future tense: the mood is coupled with a temporal adjective to form a future construction. The past tense is similarly constructed by using the Perfect tense and temporal adjectives. Similarities in the Irrealis and Perfect constructions may suggest that the Itza' consider the past and future to be similar, which reflects the Itza' worldview that [[Maya calendar|time is cyclical]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofling|first=Charles Andrew|year=1998|title=Irrealis and Perfect in Itzaj Maya|jstor=30028624|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=40|pages=214–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sentence Structure ===
Itza' has VOS [[word order]], although VSO is also common and all word orders are possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Topicalization]] is marked by the addition of a suffix and the movement of the topicalized word to the sentence initial position.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Generally, modifiers precede the words they modify: adjectives, numerals, [[determiner]]s, and negation all follow this pattern. [[Possessive]]s, [[demonstrative]]s, and [[relative clause]]s all typically follow the words they modify; adjectives can also occur in this position.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Itza' possess a rich vocabulary of agriculture and taxonomy. Itza has specific words to encode various properties of different varietals and individuals within a species. Plants and animals of different size, color, and taste are referred to with different terms.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; Additionally, agricultural terms in Itza' have been virtually uninfluenced by contact with the Spanish, allowing some insight into the commonplace vocabulary of pre-contact Itza.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Discourse ==
Discourse in Itza' is marked by its heavy use of repetition and linguistic parallelism. Words and linguistic constructions are often repeated throughout a sentence order to draw emphasis to what is being spoken.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The resulting sentences are thus composed of several, complete phrases such as in the sentence:
:{{interlinear|lang=itz|ablist=INC:incompletive aspect
|in-ten 	k-im-b'el 	im-b'en-es-eech
|EMP-1SG.PRO 	INC-1SG.A-go 	1SG.A-go-CAUS-2SG
|"I am going to take you."}}

:{{interlinear|lang=itz|ablist=INC:incompletive aspect; DTS:dependent transitive status
|in-ten 	k-im-b'el 	inw-a'l-e(j) 	tech
|EMP-1SG.PRO 	INC-1SG.A-go 	1SG.A-say-DTS 	2SG.IO
|"I am going to tell you."}}

The repetition of the pronoun ''in-ten'' and the verb ''k-im-b'el'', as well as the near-repetition of the pronoun ''eech/tech'', is typical of Itza' discourse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such literary style is comparable to [[parataxis]] in English, a style of discourse where simple, coordinating sentences are preferred over long, subordinating sentences.

Discourse, both common and mythological, often employs framing particles—particles placed before and after a phrase in order to frame the phrase within the discourse as a whole. These particles convey the spatial and temporal relationships between new and old pieces of information in the discourse, creating larger discourse units.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofling|first=Charles A.|year=1987|title=Discourse Framing in Itzá Maya Narrative|jstor=30028117|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=29|pages=478–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The categories tense, aspect, and mood are interwoven in Itzaj Maya verbal and adverbial morphosyntax. Itzaj narrative discourse suggests a division between what a person knows from personal experience centered in one's home and town (the actual), and what is less known, but imaginable, further away in space-time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Jagdish Ramkrishna Joshi''' (9 October 1932-1978) was a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] language poet and translator from [[India]]. He received a posthumous [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1979 for his collection of poems, ''Vamal Na Van''.

== Early life ==
Joshi was born in [[Bombay]] to Annapurna and Ramakrishna Joshi. He [[matriculated]] in 1949 and completed a Bachelor of Arts in Gujarati and [[Sanskrit]] in 1953 from [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai]]. He completed an M.D. in [[Pedagogy]] in 1955 from [[Stanford University]]. He served as a principal of Bazar Gate High School, Mumbai from 1957 to 1960.&lt;!---1978&lt;ref name="AGSI"/&gt;---&gt; 

He served as a member of the educational committee and The Editorial Board of the Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, [[Pune]], from 1965 to 1977. Later, he served as [[treasurer]] of the Bombay Association of Hades and Secondary School, as vice-president in 1969, and as president in 1970. He was a  member of the [[University of Bombay]] senate from 1969 to 1975. From 1974 to 1978, he served as a member of the Board of Studies in Gujarati at [[SNDT Women's University]].&lt;ref name="dalal"&gt;{{cite book|title=|last=|first=|date=23 August 2003|publisher=Image Publication Pvt.

== Works ==
''Aakash'', his first collection of poems, was published in 1972, followed by ''Vamal Na Van'' (1976) and ''Monta Collage'' (1979; posthumous). ''Vamal Na Van'' set a new trend in experimental Gujarati poems. The central emotion in his poems is pathos, depicted with rural [[milieu]] and colloquial style. In his non-metrical poems, he used rhythmic diction.&lt;ref name="Lal1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Lal|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4486|accessdate=5 September 2017|year=1992|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-260-1221-3|page=4486}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Joshi wrote 114 poems: 57 [[geet (song)|geet]]s, 38 non-metrical poems, 14 [[ghazal]]s and 5 metrical poems.

In 1973 he published the translation of ''Understanding Poetry'', a work by British writer [[James Reeves (writer)|James Reeves]], titling it ''Kavitani Gatagam,'' in Gujarati poetry journal ''Kavita''. He translated poems from various languages into Gujarati, most of which were published in ''Kavita'', ''Sanskruti'' and ''Kavyavishwa''. Two of his most famous translations are ''Marathi Kavita - Gres'' (1978) and ''Suryaghatikayantra'' (1981, posthumous). His poetry reviews were published in ''Ekantni Sabha'' (1978; posthumous). ''Dharo Ke Ek Sanje Aapne Malya'', a volume of his complete poetry edited by Suresh Dalal, was published in 1998.&lt;ref name="dalal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AGSI" /&gt;

== Recognition ==
He was awarded the [[Uma-Snehrashmi Prize]] (1976-1977) and [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] (1979) for his book ''Vamal Na Van''. He also received the Mahakavi Nhanalal Prize in 1977 for the same book.&lt;ref name="GSP" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2011">'''John Boson''' (1655–1730) was a writer in the [[Cornish language]]. The son of [[Nicholas Boson]], he was born in [[Paul, Cornwall]]. He taught Cornish to [[William Gwavas]]. His works in Cornish include an epitaph for the language scholar [[John Keigwin]], and the "Pilchard Curing Rhyme".&lt;ref&gt;John Boson.

The only known surviving lapidary inscription in the Cornish language (to Arthur Hutchens, died 1709), is also his work, and can be found in [[Paul Parish Church|Paul Church]] where John Boson, his father, and their relative [[Thomas Boson]] are also buried.

His work is collected, along with that of Nicholas and [[Thomas Boson]], in [[Oliver Padel]]'s ''The Cornish Writings of the Boson Family'' (1975).

'''Laying the keel''' or '''laying down''' is the formal recognition of the start of a [[shipbuilding|ship's construction]]. It is often marked with a ceremony attended by dignitaries from the shipbuilding company and the ultimate owners of the ship.

Keel laying is one of the four specially-celebrated events in the life of a ship; the others are [[Ship naming and launching|launching]], [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]], and [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioning]].

In earlier times, the event recognized as the keel laying was the initial placement of the central timber making up the backbone of a vessel, called the [[keel]]. As steel ships replaced wooden ones, the central timber gave way to a central steel beam. Modern ships are now largely built in a series of pre-fabricated, complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel. The event recognized as the keel laying is the first joining of modular components, or the lowering of the first module into place in the building dock. It is now often called "keel authentication", and is the ceremonial beginning of the ship's life, although modules may have been started months before that stage of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.navsea.navy.mil/teamships/Shipbuilding/default.aspx | title = Shipbuilding 101 | accessdate = 2013-06-06 | author = NAVSEA – Naval Sea Systems Command | authorlink = Naval Sea Systems Command | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140319090538/http://www.navsea.navy.mil/teamships/Shipbuilding/default.aspx | archivedate = 2014-03-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mynavyleague.org/commissionings/ShipbuildingMilestones.php |title=Ship Building Milestones |accessdate=2013-06-05 |website=[[Navy League of the United States]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://navaltoday.com/2012/06/08/australia-austal-hosts-keel-laying-ceremony-for-first-vessel-of-cape-class-patrol-boat-program/ |title=Australia: Austal Holds Keel-Laying Ceremony... |website=NavalToday.com |date=8 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
Keel-related traditions from the times of wooden ships are said to bring luck to the ship during construction and to the captain and crew during her later life. They include placing a newly minted coin under the keel and constructing the ship over it, having the youngest apprentice place the coin, and when the ship is finished, presenting the owners with the oak block on which the keel is laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pus-werften-gmbh.de/Public_Relations/Public_Infos/Keel_laying_ceremony_for_two_Ro_Ro_special_ships_for_DFDS_A_S?lang=en |title=Keel laying ceremony for two Ro-Ro special ships for DFDS A/S |website=P+S WERFTEN Gmbh |date=9 Aug 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022214815/http://www.pus-werften-gmbh.de/Public_Relations/Public_Infos/Keel_laying_ceremony_for_two_Ro_Ro_special_ships_for_DFDS_A_S?lang=en |archivedate=October 22, 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanshippingco.com/news.cfm?path=334,348,354&amp;id=3-932 |title=Aker Philadelphia Shipyard Holds Ceremonial Keel Laying |website=American Shipping Company |date=7 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014203539/http://www.americanshippingco.com/news.cfm?path=334%2C348%2C354&amp;id=3-932 |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of the placement of coins derives from the [[Mast Stepping|mast stepping]] custom of placing coins under the mast and is believed to date back to [[Ancient Greece]] or [[Ancient Rome]] and were intended to "[[Charon's obol|pay the ferryman]]" to convey the souls of the dead across the [[Styx|River Styx]] should the ship sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://navylive.dodlive.mil/2013/01/25/mast-stepping-a-mariners-tradition/|title=Mast Stepping: A Mariner's Tradition {{!}} Navy Live|last=Lenzini|first=Heidi|date=January 25, 2013|website=|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Navy traditions==
The first milestone in the history of a ship is the generally simple ceremony that marks the laying of the keel. Invitations to the ceremony are issued by [[shipyard]] officials, and the ceremony is conducted by them. The builder may be the commander of a naval shipyard or the president of a private company. The ship's prospective name, without the "USS", is mentioned in the invitation, if known; otherwise her type and number are given, ''e.g.,'' DD 2217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Office of the Chief of Naval Operations |title=OPNAVINST 1710.7A – Social Usage and Protocol Handbook |date=15 Jun 2001 |location=Washington, DC |page=9-1 |url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/Directives/01000%20Military%20Personnel%20Support/01-700%20Morale,%20Community%20and%20Religious%20Services/1710.7A.pdf |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Searight''' (born '''Arthur Kenneth Searight''') (15 November 1883&lt;ref name=hyam&gt;{{citation |title=Understanding the British Empire |last=Hyam |first=Ronald |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-13290-8 |pages=440–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;–28 February 1957) was the creator of the [[international auxiliary language]] [[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]. His book ''Sona; an auxiliary neutral language'' outlines the language's grammar and vocabulary. Encounters with Searight also influenced English author [[E.M. Forster]]'s world-view, particularly with regard to soldiers.&lt;ref name=hyam /&gt;&lt;ref name=tambling&gt;{{citation |title=E. M. Forster: Contemporary Critical Essays |last=Tambling |first=Jeremy |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=1995 |isbn=0-312-12359-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searight was born in Kensington, England in 1883. He attended [[Charterhouse School]] (a boarding school) for his childhood and teenage years. In 1904 he received a commission into the Queen's Own Western Kent Regiment, and was stationed for several years in India. It was here that he befriended English author [[E.M. Forster]] (''A Passage to India'') and [[Cambridge]] don [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson|G.L. Dickinson]]. His regiment was later reassigned to Iraq, and then to Egypt. Searight also enjoyed leave time around the Mediterranean Sea—especially in Italy.

It was during this extensive travel that Searight developed his interest in linguistics and his familiarity with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern languages and cultures. At one point in his military career he was classified as an interpreter competent in "Arabic, Baluchi, Persian and Pushtu."&lt;ref name=hyam /&gt;

Searight retired to Rome in 1926. In 1934 he contacted [[Charles Kay Ogden]] to discuss publishing the Sona book. Ogden was the creator of a modified version of English known as "[[Basic English]]", which consisted of a reduced vocabulary (only 850 words) and simplified grammar. Ogden was also the editor of the Psyche Miniatures series at Cambridge University, and he approved and published the Sona book, as well as writing an introduction for it.

Searight was gay.&lt;ref name=aldrich&gt;{{citation |title=Colonialism and Homosexuality |last=Aldrich |first=Robert |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-19616-7 |pages=279–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some reason to believe that Searight was the model for the hero of Forster's novel ''[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]''.&lt;ref name=hyam /&gt;

Searight was also the author of six unpublished volumes of erotica, five of which were destroyed by a later owner in a moment of panic.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Timothy D'Arch "Enumerating The Enfer", The Times Literary Supplement, 29 May 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth survives: a 600-page manuscript work called the ''Paidikion''. It was made up of homoerotic stories, a detailed listing of his sexual conquests — the "Paidiology"— and a 137-page verse autobiography entitled "The Furnace".

Ogden originally received the ''Paidikion'', but it was later retrieved from a used bookstore for half a [[Crown (British coin)|crown]]. Excerpts were published in the ''International Journal of Greek Love'' in 1966. The original manuscript is now kept in the Human Sexuality Collection at Cornell University (Rare Books Division, 7745 Bd. Ms. 1).

Searight died in 1957.

The '''Klingon language''' (''&lt;code&gt;tlhIngan Hol&lt;/code&gt;'', {{IPA-tlh|ˈt͡ɬɪ.ŋɑn xol|pron}}, in ''&lt;code&gt;pIqaD&lt;/code&gt;'' &lt;span style="font-family:pIqaD, Constructium, Unifont CSUR, Klingon pIqaD HaSta, Code2000, Horta;"&gt;{{PUA|&amp;#xF8E4;&amp;#xF8D7;&amp;#xF8DC;&amp;#xF8D0;&amp;#xF8DB; &amp;#xF8D6;&amp;#xF8DD;&amp;#xF8D9;}}&lt;/span&gt;), sometimes called '''Klingonese''', is the [[constructed language]] spoken by the fictional [[Klingon]]s in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe.

Described in the 1985 book ''[[The Klingon Dictionary]]'' by [[Marc Okrand]] and deliberately designed to sound "alien", it has a number of [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] uncommon features. The language's basic sound, along with a few words, was first devised by actor [[James Doohan]] ("[[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]]") and producer [[Jon Povill]] for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. That film marked the first time the language had been heard on screen. In all previous appearances, Klingons spoke in English, even to each other. Klingon was subsequently developed by Okrand into a full-fledged language.

Klingon is sometimes referred to as ''Klingonese'' (most notably in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]", where it was actually pronounced by a Klingon character as "Klingonee" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|ŋ|ɡ|ɒ|n|i}}) but, among the Klingon-speaking community, this is often understood to refer to another Klingon language called Klingonaase that was introduced in [[John M. Ford]]'s 1984 ''Star Trek'' novel ''[[The Final Reflection]],'' and appears in other ''Star Trek'' novels by Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mwMF_PhtgAC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=%22fed-standard+klingonaase+is+pronounced%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Cr3KjY0EN&amp;sig=qsXZD2c2zftfsWKX5OyqieHAsC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwju08nO9uveAhXuYN8KHULZDiYQ6AEwAXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fed-standard%20klingonaase%20is%20pronounced%22&amp;f=false |title=The Final Reflection |first=John M. |last=Ford |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=9780671038533 |pages=138-139 |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play ''[[A Klingon Christmas Carol]]'' is the first production that is primarily in Klingon (only the narrator speaks English). The opera ''[[’u’|&lt;code&gt;’u’&lt;/code&gt;]]'' is entirely in Klingon.

A small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Its vocabulary, heavily centered on ''Star Trek''-Klingon concepts such as [[Klingon starships|spacecraft]] or [[List of weapons in Star Trek|warfare]], can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==History==
Although mentioned in the original ''Star Trek'' series episode "[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]", the Klingon language first appeared on-screen in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' ([[1979 in film|1979]]). According to the actor who spoke the lines, [[Mark Lenard]], James Doohan recorded the lines he had written on a tape, and Lenard transcribed the recorded lines in a way he found useful in learning them.&lt;ref name="whirlingwords"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okrand |first1=Mark |last2=Adams |first2=Michael |last3=Hendriks-Hermans |first3=Judith |last4=Kroon |first4=Sjaak |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Adams |title=From Elvish to Klingon: Exploring Invented Languages |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=December 1, 2011 |pages=111–134 |chapter=Wild and Whirling Words: The Invention and Use of Klingon |isbn=978-0-192-80709-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' ([[1984 in film|1984]]), director [[Leonard Nimoy]] and writer-producer [[Harve Bennett]] wanted the Klingons to speak a structured language instead of random [[gibberish]], and so commissioned a full language, based on the phrases Doohan had originated, from Marc Okrand, who had earlier constructed four lines of [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] dialogue for ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''.&lt;ref name="whirlingwords" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okrent"&gt;{{cite book |first=Arika |last=Okrent |author-link=Arika Okrent |title=In the Land of Invented Languages |publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau |year=2009 |isbn=9780385527880}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=266-267}}

Okrand enlarged the lexicon and developed a grammar based on Doohan's original dozen words. The language appeared intermittently in later films featuring the original cast (for example, in ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'' ([[1989 in film|1989]]) and in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' ([[1991 in film|1991]]), where [[translation]] difficulties served as a [[plot device]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (Special Edition) DVD-special feature, text commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two "non-canon" dialects of Klingon are hinted at in the novelization of ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'', as [[Saavik]] speaks in Klingon to the only Klingon officer aboard Cpt. Kruge's starship after his death, as the survivors of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|''Enterprise'']]'s self-destruction transport up from the crumbling Genesis Planet to the Klingon ship. The surviving officer, [[List of Star Trek characters (G–M)#M|Maltz]], states that he speaks the ''Rumaiy'' dialect, while Saavik is speaking to him in the ''Kumburan'' dialect of Klingon, per Maltz's spoken reply to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Star Trek III: The Search for Spock |last=McIntyre |first=Vonda |year=1984 |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=0-671-49500-3 |page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1987)—in which one of the main characters, [[Worf]], was a Klingon—and successors, the language and various cultural aspects for the fictional species were expanded. In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[A Matter of Honor]]", several members of a Klingon ship's crew speak a language that is not translated for the benefit of the viewer (even Commander Riker, enjoying the benefits of a [[universal translator]], is unable to understand) until one Klingon orders the others to "speak their [i.e., human] language".&lt;ref name="MatterOfHonor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chakoteya.net/NextGen/134.htm |title=A Matter of Honor |website=Chakoteya.net |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of non-Klingon characters were later depicted in ''Star Trek'' as having learned to speak Klingon, notably [[Jean-Luc Picard]] and [[Jadzia Dax]].&lt;ref name="MatterOfHonor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Jadzia_Dax#Klingons |title=Jadzia Dax: Klingons |website=Memory Alpha |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Hobbyists around the world have studied the Klingon language. Six Klingon translations of works of world literature have been published: &lt;cite&gt;''[[GhIlghameS|&lt;code&gt;ghIlghameS&lt;/code&gt;]]''&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;cite&gt;''the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''&lt;/cite&gt;), ''[[The Klingon Hamlet|&lt;code&gt;Hamlet&lt;/code&gt;]]'' (&lt;cite&gt;''[[Hamlet]]''&lt;/cite&gt;), &lt;cite&gt;''&lt;code&gt;paghmo’ tIn mIS&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/cite&gt; (&lt;cite&gt;''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''&lt;/cite&gt;), ''&lt;code&gt;pIn’a’ qan paQDI’norgh&lt;/code&gt;'' (''[[Tao Te Ching]]''), ''&lt;code&gt;’ISqu’&lt;/code&gt;'' (''[[the Art of War]]'') and ''&lt;code&gt;ta’puq mach&lt;/code&gt;'' (''[[the Little Prince]]''). The Shakespearean choices were inspired by a remark from High Chancellor [[List of Star Trek characters (G–M)#G|Gorkon]] in ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', who said, "You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon." In the bonus material on the DVD, screenwriter [[Nicholas Meyer]] and actor [[William Shatner]] both explain that this was an allusion to the German myth that Shakespeare was in fact German.

The [[Klingon Language Institute]] exists to promote the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tech2.nytimes.com/mem/technology/techreview.html?res=9A0CEFD8163BF934A35753C1A9629C8B63&amp;fta=y |author=Lisa Napoli |title=Online Diary: tlhIngan maH! |date=October 7, 2004 |work=New York Times}}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBS Television Studios]] owns the [[copyright]] on the official [[The Klingon Dictionary|dictionary]] and other [[Star Trek canon|canonical]] descriptions of the language. While constructed languages ("conlangs") are viewed as creations with copyright protection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adelman |first=Michael |date=Spring 2014 |title=Constructed Languages and Copyright: A Brief History and Proposal for Divorce |url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v27/27HarvJLTech543.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology |volume=27 |number=2 |pages=543-562 |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; natural languages are not protected, excluding dictionaries and/or other works created with them. Mizuki Miyashita and Laura Moll note, "Copyrights on dictionaries are unusual because the entries in the dictionary are not copyrightable as the words themselves are facts, and facts can not be copyrighted. However, the formatting, example sentences, and instructions for dictionary use are created by the author, so they are copyrightable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jar/RIL_9.html |title=Enhancing Language Material Availability Using Computers |first1=Mizuki |last1=Miyashita |first2=Laura A. |last2=Moll |publisher=Jan.ucc.nau.edu |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Okrand had studied some [[indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Languages of Asia|Southeast Asian languages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2009/05/theres_no_klingon_word_for_hello.html |title=There's No Klingon Word for Hello |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate magazine]] |date=May 7, 2009 |first=Arika |last=Okrent |access-date=November 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An attribution to Okrand may be found in the museum displays at the [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]], California State Historic Park, which includes a short mention of the local [[Mutsun]] native people whom Okrand studied for his thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; and phonological and grammatical features of these languages "worked their way into Klingon, but for the most part, not by design."&lt;ref name="whirlingwords"/&gt; Okrand himself has stated that a design principle of the Klingon language was dissimilarity to existing natural languages in general, and English in particular. He therefore avoided patterns that are [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] common and deliberately chose features that occur relatively infrequently in human languages. This includes above all the highly asymmetric consonant inventory and the basic [[word order]].&lt;ref&gt;Okrent 2009, pp.270-271&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speakers ==
A small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. [[Arika Okrent]] guessed in her book ''In the Land of Invented Languages'' that there might be 20–30 fluent speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arika |last=Okrent |title=In the Land of Invented Languages |location=New York |publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau |year=2010 |page=273 |quote=But what about speakers in the sense of people who can carry on a spontaneous live conversation in Klingon? (...) I would say, oh, twenty or so. Maybe thirty.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its vocabulary, heavily centered on ''Star Trek''–Klingon concepts such as [[Klingon starships|spacecraft]] or [[List of weapons in Star Trek|warfare]], can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use. For instance, while words for ''transporter ionizer unit'' (''&lt;code&gt;jolvoy’&lt;/code&gt;'') or ''bridge'' (of a ship) (''&lt;code&gt;meH&lt;/code&gt;'') have been known since close to the language's inception, the word for ''bridge'' in the sense of a crossing over water (''&lt;code&gt;QI&lt;/code&gt;'') was unknown until August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kli.org/tlhIngan-Hol/2012/August/msg00112.html |title=tlhIngan-Hol Archive: Mon Aug 13 15:25:35 2012 |publisher=Kli.org |date=August 13, 2012 |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, mundane conversations are possible among skilled speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthlings-movie.com/ |title=Earthlings: Ugly Bags of Mostly Water |publisher=Mostly Water LLC |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615082547/http://www.earthlings-movie.com/ |archive-date=June 15, 2011 |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Klingon speaker, [[d'Armond Speers]], raised his son Alec to speak Klingon as a first language, whilst the boy's mother communicated with him in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dean |first=Eddie |url=https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/13011269/klingon-as-a-second-language |title=Klingon as a Second Language |newspaper=Washington City Paper |date=August 9, 1996 |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alec rarely responded to his father in Klingon, although when he did, his pronunciation was "excellent". After Alec's fifth birthday, Speers reported that his son eventually stopped responding to him when spoken to in Klingon as he clearly did not enjoy it, so Speers switched to English.&lt;ref name="Fry's"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Babel |date=September 25, 2011 |series=Fry's Planet Word |network=[[BBC]] TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/1999/08/babble-on-revisited/ |title=Babble On Revisited |publisher=Wired.com |issue=7.08 |date=August 1, 1999 |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a report surfaced that [[Multnomah County, Oregon]] was hiring Klingon translators for its mental health program in case patients came into a psychiatric hospital speaking nothing but Klingon.&lt;ref name=Klingonsnopes&gt;{{cite web |title=Klingon Interpreter |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/klingon-interpreter/ |website=Snopes.com |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most circulations of the report seemingly implied that this was a problem that health officials faced before; however, the original report indicated that this was just a precaution for a hypothetical and that said translator would only be paid on an as needed basis.&lt;ref name=Klingonsnopes/&gt; After the report was misinterpreted, the County issued another release noting that releasing the original report was a "mistake".&lt;ref name=Klingonsnopes/&gt;

In May 2009, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], in collaboration with [[Ultralingua]] Inc., a developer of electronic dictionary applications, announced the release of a suite of electronic Klingon language software for most computer platforms including a dictionary, a phrasebook, and an audio learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ultralingua engaged by Simon &amp; Schuster for launch of Star Trek-related iPhone Apps |date=May 9, 2009 |url=https://www.ultralingua.com/sites/ultralingua.com/files/pdfs/PR.Klingon-5.9.09.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[Eurotalk]] released the "Learn Klingon" course in its ''Talk Now!'' series. The language is displayed in both Latin and pIqaD fonts, making this the first language course written in pIqaD and approved by CBS and [[Marc Okrand]]. It was translated by Jonathan Brown and Okrand and uses the &lt;code&gt;Hol-pIqaD&lt;/code&gt; [[TrueType]] font.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Canon==
An important concept to spoken and written Klingon is [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]]. Only words and grammatical forms introduced by Marc Okrand are considered canonical Klingon by the KLI and most Klingonists. However, as the growing number of speakers employ different strategies to express themselves, it is often unclear as to what level of [[neologism]] is permissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/trek/yensw/PDF/thesis.pdf |title=Klingon as Linguistic Capital |first=Yens |last=Wahlgren |date=June 2000 |format=PDF |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New vocabulary has been collected in a list maintained by the KLI until 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin |first=Will |date=December 15, 2005 |url=https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/new-klingon-words/ |title=New Klingon Words (not in the original lexicon) |work=[[Klingon Language Institute|KLI]] |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since then been followed up by Klingon expert Lieven Litaer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Litaer |first=Lieven |date=August 20, 2013 |url=http://www.qephom.de/e/newwords.html |title=New canonical Klingon words |work=[[qepHom]] |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal history===
Within the fictional universe of ''Star Trek'', Klingon is derived from the original language spoken by the messianic figure [[Kahless the Unforgettable]], who united the Klingon home-world of &lt;code&gt;Qo’noS&lt;/code&gt; under one empire more than 1500 years ago.&lt;ref name="GalacticTraveller" /&gt; Many dialects exist, but the standardized dialect of prestige is almost invariably that of the sitting emperor.

Klingon has been developed with a [[phonology]] that, while based on human [[natural language]]s, is intended to sound [[Alien language|alien]] to human ears. When initially developed, Paramount Pictures (owners of the ''Star Trek'' [[media franchise|franchise]]) wanted the Klingon language to be guttural and harsh and Okrand wanted it to be unusual, so he selected [[articulatory phonetics|sounds]] that combined in ways not generally found in other languages. The effect is mainly achieved by the use of a number of [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] consonants in the language's inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5Did-eVQDc&amp;t=5m46s |title=Marc Okrand on Klingon |date=May 2, 2012 |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klingon has twenty-one consonants and five vowels. Klingon is normally written in a variant of the [[Latin alphabet]]. Klingon's orthography is [[case-sensitive]], that is [[Capital letter|upper]] and [[lower case]] letters are not interchangeable (uppercase letters mostly represent sounds different from those expected by English speakers), however, with the exception of Q/q there are no [[Minimal pair]]s between case. In other words, while "tlhingan hol" is incorrect, the meaning (Klingon language) is the same as "tlhIngan Hol", but "Qat" (be popular) is not the same as "qat" (accompany) . In the discussion below, standard Klingon orthography appears in ''{{angle bracket|angle brackets}}'', and the [[phoneme|phonemic transcription]] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is written between ''/slashes/''.

===Consonants===
The inventory of consonants in Klingon is spread over a number of [[place of articulation|places of articulation]]. In spite of this, the inventory has many gaps: Klingon has no [[velar consonant|velar plosives]], and only one [[sibilant consonant|sibilant fricative]]. Deliberately, this arrangement is very different from that of most human languages. The combination of an aspirated [[voiceless alveolar plosive]] {{IPA|/tʰ/}} and a [[voiced retroflex plosive]] {{IPA|/ɖ/}} is particularly unusual.

There are a few dialectal pronunciation differences&lt;ref name="GalacticTraveller"&gt;{{cite book |last=Okrand |first=Marc |title=Klingon for the Galactic Traveller |year=1997 |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0671009953 |pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (it is not known if the aforementioned non-canon ''Kumburan'' or ''Rumaiy'' dialects of ''&lt;code&gt;tlhIngan Hol&lt;/code&gt;'' hinted at in the [[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock|third ''Trek'' movie's]] novelization might differ):

* In the Krotmag dialect {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɖ/}} are realized as nasal stops {{IPAblink|m}} and {{IPAblink|ɳ}}
* In the Tak'ev dialect {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɖ/}} are pre-nasalized oral stops {{IPA|[mb]}} and {{IPA|[ɳɖ]}}
In the Morskan dialect:
*{{IPAslink|t͡ɬ}} is a central affricate {{IPAblink|t͡s}}
*{{IPA|/x/}} is realized as glottal {{IPAblink|h}} syllable-initially and deleted syllable-finally
*{{IPAslink|q͡χ}} is realized as a velar fricative {{IPAblink|x}}

===Vowels===
In contrast to its consonants, Klingon's inventory of vowels is simple, and similar to those of many human languages, such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. There are five vowels spaced more or less evenly around the vowel space, with two back rounded vowels, one back unrounded vowel, and two front or near-front unrounded vowels. The vowel inventory is asymmetrical in that the back rounded vowels are tense and the front vowels are lax.

The two front vowels, {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;}} and {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;}}, represent sounds that are found in [[English language|English]], but are more open and lax than a typical English speaker might assume when reading Klingon text written in the Latin alphabet, thus causing the consonants of a word to be more prominent. This enhances the sense that Klingon is a clipped and harsh-sounding language.

; [[Vowel]]s
:{{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;}}{{spaced ndash}}{{IPAslink|ɑ}}{{spaced ndash}}[[open back unrounded vowel]] (in English ''spa'')
:{{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;}}{{spaced ndash}}{{IPAslink|ɛ}}{{spaced ndash}}[[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] (in English ''bed'')
:{{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;}}{{spaced ndash}}{{IPAslink|ɪ}}{{spaced ndash}}[[near-close near-front unrounded vowel]] (in English ''bit'')
:{{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;}}{{spaced ndash}}{{IPAslink|o}}{{spaced ndash}}[[close-mid back rounded vowel]] (in [[French language|French]] ''eau'')
:{{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;}}{{spaced ndash}}{{IPAslink|u}}{{spaced ndash}}[[close back rounded vowel]] (in Spanish ''tu'')

[[Diphthong]]s can be analyzed phonetically as the combination of the five vowels plus one of the two [[semivowel]]s {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} (represented by {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;}} and {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;}}, respectively). Thus, the combinations {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;ay&lt;/code&gt;}}, {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;ey&lt;/code&gt;}}, {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;Iy&lt;/code&gt;}}, {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;oy&lt;/code&gt;}}, {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;uy&lt;/code&gt;}}, {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;aw&lt;/code&gt;}}, {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;ew&lt;/code&gt;}} and {{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;Iw&lt;/code&gt;}} are possible. There are no words in the Klingon language that contain *{{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;ow&lt;/code&gt;}} or *{{angle bracket|&lt;code&gt;uw&lt;/code&gt;}}.

===Syllable structure===
Klingon follows a strict [[syllable]] structure. A syllable must start with a consonant (which includes the glottal stop) followed by one vowel. In prefixes and other rare syllables, this is enough. More commonly, this consonant-vowel pair is followed by one consonant or one of three biconsonantal codas: /-'''''&lt;code&gt;w’&lt;/code&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;-'''&lt;code&gt;y’&lt;/code&gt;'''&amp;nbsp;-'''&lt;code&gt;rgh&lt;/code&gt;'''''/. Thus, ''&lt;code&gt;ta&lt;/code&gt;'' "record", ''&lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt;'' "poison" and ''&lt;code&gt;targh&lt;/code&gt;'' "targ" (a type of animal) are all legal syllable forms, but *''&lt;code&gt;tarD&lt;/code&gt;'' and *''&lt;code&gt;ar&lt;/code&gt;'' are not. Despite this, one suffix takes the shape vowel+consonant: the endearment suffix &lt;code&gt;-'''''oy'''''&lt;/code&gt;.

===Stress===
In [[verb]]s, the stressed syllable is usually the verbal stem itself, as opposed to a prefix or any suffixes, except when a suffix ending with &lt;code&gt;{{angle bracket|’}}&lt;/code&gt; is separated from the verb by at least one other suffix, in which case the suffix ending in &lt;code&gt;{{angle bracket|’}}&lt;/code&gt; is also stressed. In addition, stress may shift to a suffix that is meant to be emphasized.

In [[noun]]s, the final syllable of the stem (the noun itself, excluding any affixes) is stressed. If any syllables ending in &lt;code&gt;{{angle bracket|’}}&lt;/code&gt; are present, the stress shifts to those syllables.

The stress in other words seems to be variable, but this is not a serious issue because most of these words are only one syllable in length. There are some words which should fall under the rules above, but do not, although using the standard rules would still be acceptable.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Klingon grammar}}
Klingon is an [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] language, using mainly affixes in order to alter the function or meaning of words. Some nouns have inherently plural forms, such as ''&lt;code&gt;jengva’&lt;/code&gt;'' "plate" (vs. &lt;code&gt;''ngop''&lt;/code&gt; "plates"), but most nouns require a suffix to express plurality explicitly. Depending on the type of noun (body part, being capable of using language, or neither) the suffix changes. For beings capable of using language, the suffix is ''&lt;code&gt;-pu’&lt;/code&gt;,'' as in ''&lt;code&gt;tlhInganpu’&lt;/code&gt;,'' meaning "[[Klingon]]s," or ''&lt;code&gt;jaghpu’&lt;/code&gt;,'' meaning "enemies". For body parts, the plural suffix is ''&lt;code&gt;-Du’&lt;/code&gt;,'' as in ''&lt;code&gt;mInDu’&lt;/code&gt;,'' "eyes". For items that are neither body parts nor capable of speech, the suffix is ''&lt;code&gt;-mey&lt;/code&gt;,'' such as in ''&lt;code&gt;Hovmey&lt;/code&gt;'' ("stars"), or ''&lt;code&gt;targhmey&lt;/code&gt;'' ("targs") for a Klingon animal somewhat resembling a boar. (However, a plural suffix is never obligatory. To say "The stars are beautiful", ''&lt;code&gt;’IH Hovmey&lt;/code&gt;'' and ''&lt;code&gt;’IH Hov&lt;/code&gt;'' are equally grammatical, although the second can also mean "The star is beautiful".)

The words ''&lt;code&gt;loD&lt;/code&gt;'' and ''&lt;code&gt;be’&lt;/code&gt;'', which on their own mean "man" and "woman" respectively, can be used in compound words to refer to the referent's sex. For example, from ''&lt;code&gt;puq&lt;/code&gt;'' ("child") this process derives ''&lt;code&gt;puqloD&lt;/code&gt;'' ("son") and ''&lt;code&gt;puqbe’&lt;/code&gt;'' ("daughter").

Klingon [[noun]]s take suffixes to indicate [[grammatical number]]. There are three [[noun class]]es, two levels of [[deixis]], and a possession and syntactic function. In all, twenty-nine noun suffixes from five classes may be employed: ''&lt;code&gt;jupoypu’na’wI’vaD&lt;/code&gt;'' "for my beloved true friends". A word may carry no more than one suffix from each class, and the classes have a specific order of appearance.

[[Verb]]s in Klingon take a prefix indicating the number and person of the subject and object, whereas suffixes are taken from nine ordered classes and a special suffix class called rovers. Each of the four known rovers has a unique rule controlling its position among the suffixes in the verb. Verbs are marked for [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], certainty, predisposition and volition, dynamic, [[causative]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], [[negation]], and [[honorific]]. The Klingon verb has two moods: [[Grammatical mood|indicative]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]].

The most common [[word order]] in Klingon is [[object–verb–subject]], and, in most cases, the word order is the exact reverse of English for an equivalent sentence:
 [[File:Klingon sentence.svg|upright=2.72|frameless]]
 '''''&lt;code&gt;DaH  mojaq-mey-vam  DI-vuS-nIS-be’  ’e’  vI-Har&lt;/code&gt;'''''
 now suffix&lt;small&gt;-PL-DEM  1PL.A.3PL.P-&lt;/small&gt;limit-need&lt;small&gt;-NEG&lt;/small&gt; that &lt;small&gt;1SG.A.3SG.P-&lt;/small&gt;believe
 "I believe that we do not need to limit these suffixes now."

(Hyphens are used in the above only to illustrate the use of affixes. Hyphens are not used in Klingon.)

&lt;span id="Clipped_Klingon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;An important aspect of Klingon grammar is its "ungrammaticality". As with for example [[Japanese language|Japanese]], shortening of communicative statements is common, and is called "Clipped Klingon" (''&lt;code&gt;tlhIngan Hol poD&lt;/code&gt;'' or, more simply, ''&lt;code&gt;Hol poD&lt;/code&gt;'') and Ritualized Speech{{Clarify|date=January 2014}}. Clipped Klingon is especially useful in situations where speed is a decisive factor. Grammar is abbreviated, and sentence parts deemed to be superfluous are dropped. Intentional ungrammaticality is widespread, and it takes many forms. It is exemplified by the practice of ''&lt;code&gt;pabHa’&lt;/code&gt;'', which Marc Okrand translates as "to misfollow the rules" or "to follow the rules wrongly".&lt;ref name="GalacticTraveller" /&gt;

==Writing systems==
[[File:Qapla'.svg|thumb|left|&lt;code&gt;Qapla’&lt;/code&gt; (success)]]
{{Main|Klingon writing systems}}

When written in the Latin alphabet, Klingon is unusual in being [[case-sensitive]], with some letters written in capitals and others in lowercase. In one contrast, ''&lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;'' and ''&lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;'', there is an actual case-sensitive pair representing two different consonants. Capitals are generally reserved for uvular or retroflex consonants pronounced further back in the mouth or throat than is normal for the corresponding English sounds, as with ''&lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;'', ''&lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;'', and ''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;''. However, ''&lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;'', pronounced like the {{angle brackets|ch}} in German "ach" or Scottish "loch", is further forward in the throat than English /h/. One phoneme, the vowel ''I'' (as in ''i''), is written capital to look more like the IPA symbol for the sound /ɪ/, and can pose problems when writing Klingon in sans-serif fonts such as [[Arial]], as it looks almost the same as the consonant ''l'' (as in ''L'').

This has led some Klingon enthusiasts to write it lowercase like the other vowels ("i") to prevent confusion, but this use is non-canonical. Instead, a serif font that clearly distinguishes "&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;" and "&lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;", such as [[Courier (font)|Courier]] or [[Courier New]], has traditionally been employed for writing Klingon in the Latin alphabet. In any case, it can be disambiguated through context, as &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; never occurs next to another vowel, unlike &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;. The apostrophe, denoting the [[glottal stop]], is considered a letter, not a punctuation mark.
: '''&lt;code&gt;a b ch D e gh H I j l m n ng o p q Q r S t tlh u v w y ’&lt;/code&gt;'''

Klingon is often written in ([[in-universe]], "transliterated to") the [[Latin alphabet]] as used above, but on the television series, the Klingons use their own alien writing system. In ''The Klingon Dictionary'', this alphabet is named as ''&lt;code&gt;pIqaD&lt;/code&gt;'', but no information is given about it. When Klingon symbols are used in ''Star Trek'' productions, they are merely decorative graphic elements, designed to emulate real [[writing]] and create an appropriate atmosphere. Enthusiasts have settled on the name ''&lt;code&gt;pIqaD&lt;/code&gt;'' for this writing system.

The Astra Image Corporation designed the symbols currently used to "write" Klingon for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', although these symbols are often incorrectly attributed to [[Michael Okuda]].&lt;ref&gt;Symbols attributed to Okuda: the Klingon Language Institute's ''Klingon FAQ'' (edited by [[d'Armond Speers]]), [https://web.archive.org/web/20041012093544/http://higbee.cots.net/~holtej/klingon/faq.htm#2.13 question 2.13] by Will Martin (August 18, 1994). Symbols ''incorrectly'' attributed to Okuda: KLI founder Lawrence M. Schoen's [http://www.kli.org/pdf/Orthography.pdf "On Orthography" (PDF)]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208232839/http://www.kli.org/pdf/Orthography.pdf |date=December 8, 2006 }}, citing J. Lee's "An Interview with Michael Okuda" in the KLI's journal ''HolQed'' 1.1 (March 1992), p. 11. Symbols actually designed by Astra Image Corporation: Michael Everson's [[#note-2|Proposal...&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt; They based the letters on the [[Klingon starships|Klingon battlecruiser]] hull markings (three letters) first created by [[Matt Jefferies]] and on [[Tibetan script|Tibetan writing]] because the script has sharp letter forms—used as a testament to the Klingons' love for knives and blades.

For [[April Fools' Day]] in 2013, [[Nokia]] and typography company [[Dalton Maag]] claimed to have used "communication devices to far-flung star systems"&lt;ref name="Pure Klingon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brandbook.nokia.com/blog/view/item80143/ |publisher=Nokia |title=Pure Klingon |date=April 1, 2013 |access-date=November 23, 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406025926/http://brandbook.nokia.com/blog/view/item80143/ |archive-date=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assist them in localizing the [[Nokia Pure]] font to the Klingon writing system. Though the explanation was of course humorous in nature, as part of the [[practical joke]] a series of real fonts based upon the most commonly used ''&lt;code&gt;pIqaD&lt;/code&gt;'' character mapping were in fact developed, and have been made available for free download.&lt;ref name="Pure Klingon"/&gt;

==Vocabulary==
A design principle of the Klingon language is the great degree of lexical-cultural correlation in the vocabulary. For example, there are several words meaning "to fight" or "to clash against," each having a different degree of intensity. There is an abundance of words relating to warfare and weaponry and also a great variety of curses (cursing is considered a fine art in Klingon culture). This helps lend a particular character to the language.

There are many in-jokes built into the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kli.org/wiki/Puns_in_the_Vocabulary_of_tlhIngan_Hol |title=Puns in the Vocabulary of tlhIngan Hol |access-date=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word for "pair" is &lt;code&gt;chang’eng&lt;/code&gt;, a reference to the original "[[Siamese twins]]" [[Chang and Eng Bunker|Chang and Eng]]; a [[guitar]] is a &lt;code&gt;leSpal&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. [[Les Paul]]);&lt;ref name="Okrent" /&gt; the word for "torture" is &lt;code&gt;joy&lt;/code&gt;; "[[hangover]]" is &lt;code&gt;’uH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=Okrent/&gt;, and the word for "fish" is ''[[Ghoti|&lt;code&gt;ghotI’&lt;/code&gt;]]''.&lt;ref name="Okrent" /&gt;

Sources for the vocabulary include English (albeit heavily disguised), and also [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: &lt;code&gt;Sa’Hut&lt;/code&gt; for "buttocks" (from [[wikt:תּחת|תּחת]] ''tuches'' spelled backwards),&lt;ref name="Okrent" /&gt; and &lt;code&gt;’oy’&lt;/code&gt; for "ache, pain, sore" (cf. ''[[oy vey]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Okrand |first=Marc |author-link=Marc Okrand |title=The Klingon Dictionary |year=1992 |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |isbn=0-671-74559-X |edition=2nd: i.e., with addendum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many English words do not have direct translations into Klingon. To express "hello", the nearest equivalent is &lt;code&gt;nuqneH&lt;/code&gt;, meaning "What do you want?",&lt;ref name="Okrent"/&gt; with "goodbye" translated as &lt;code&gt;Qapla'&lt;/code&gt;, "Success!".

'''Lenticular book'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explainthatstuff.com/lenticularprinting.html Lenticular printing], Chris Woodford, December 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is created with the help of [[lenticular printing]] technology. This special type of printing gives rise to books, the text is accompanied by pictures with 3D graphics. Pictures of lenticular book arouse the illusion of depth or transition depending on your perspective. Lenticular book is also called stereoscopy or 3D book. The first worldwide 3D lenticular printed book with the story is Lentibook Pirate Girl.

== Lenticular printing technology ==

Lenticular printing technology and [[stereoscopy]] is a complicated method of producing imagery that allows spatial visual perception. There are different types of lenticular printing, the technology has evolved from simpler to more complex methods. Initially, it was a combination of two alternating images. With this basic application lenticular printing can be found, for example, child rulers with varying images depending on the inclination of rulers and angle of view. Gradually the technology has been better and better  and allows the creation of images with stereoscopic 3D effects that are used such as posters, billboards or postcards. This advanced technological process stereoscopic 3D effect is used in the production of lenticular book.

== The current trend lenticular book ==

Currently lenticular book develops as a modern version of the classic children's book, which offers a varied, entertaining and inspiring imagery that develops a child's imagination. With emerging technology is evolving quality lenticular images in the book, which are still better and more varied. This makes it possible to use 3D book seizure of the child, but also as a teaching tool that motivates and leads to reading and concentration.

== Production of images with 3D effect ==

Production of images with the 3D effect is very demanding in terms of complexity of technological processes and in terms of time and money. Print of image size 5.9 × 8.7&amp;nbsp;cm takes about three and a half minutes and the price varies between 119 and 298 [[CZK]] for one frame of this size. The whole production process involves a complex preparation of documents, which leads to animation files in special 3D programs, intensive preparation for printing and using powerful and expensive printers. Lenticular technology has considerable manufacturing tradition in the Czech Republic. The aforementioned lenticular book Lentibook Pirate Girl or if Pirátka Kačenka is also Czech product.

{{Semantics}}
In [[generative linguistics]], a '''lexis''' or [[lexicon]] is the complete set of all possible words in a language ([[vocabulary]]). In this sense, ''child'', ''children'', ''child's'' and ''children's'' are four different words in the English lexicon.
In [[Systemic functional linguistics|systemic-functional linguistics]], a '''lexis''' or '''lexical item''' is the way one calls a particular thing or a type of phenomenon. Since a lexis from a systemic-functional perspective is a way of calling, it can be realised by multiple grammatical words such as "The White House", "New York City" or "heart attack". Moreover, since a lexis is a way of calling, different words such as ''child'', ''children'', ''child's'' and ''children's'' may realise the same lexical item.

==Lexicon==
In short, the [[lexicon]] is:

* Formulaic: it relies on partially fixed expressions and highly probable word combinations
* [[Idiomatic]]: it follows conventions and patterns for usage
* [[Metaphoric]]: concepts such as ''time'' and ''money'', ''business'' and ''sex'', ''systems'' and ''water'' all share a large portion of the same vocabulary
* [[Grammatical]]: it uses rules based on sampling of the Lexicon
* Register-specific: it uses the same word differently and/or less frequently in different contexts

A major area of study, [[psycholinguistics]] and [[neurolinguistics]], involves the question of how words are retrieved from the mental lexicon in online language processing and production. For example, the [[cohort model]] seeks to describe lexical retrieval in terms of segment-by-segment activation of competing lexical entries.&lt;ref&gt;Altmann, Gerry T.M. (1997). "Words, and how we (eventually) find them." ''The Ascent of Babel: An Exploration of Language, Mind, and Understanding''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 65–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="packard"&gt;[[Jerome Packard|Packard, Jerome L]] (2000). "Chinese words and the lexicon". ''The Morphology of Chinese: A Linguistic and Cognitive Approach''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 284–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulaic language==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
{{Main article|Formulaic speech}}
In recent years, the compilation of [[corpus linguistics|language databases]] using real samples from speech and writing has enabled researchers to take a fresh look at the composition of languages. Among other things, statistical research methods offer reliable insight into the ways in which words interact. The most interesting findings have taken place in the dichotomy between language use (how language is used) and language usage (how language could be used).

Language use shows which occurrences of words and their partners are most probable. The major finding of this research is that language users rely to a very high extent on ready-made language "[[lexical chunk]]s", which can be easily combined to form sentences. This eliminates the need for the speaker to analyse each sentence grammatically, yet deals with a situation effectively. Typical examples include "I see what you mean" or "Could you please hand me the..." or "Recent research shows that..."

Language usage, on the other hand, is what takes place when the ready-made chunks do not fulfill the speaker's immediate needs; in other words, a new sentence is about to be formed and must be analyzed for correctness. Grammar rules have been internalised by native speakers, allowing them to determine the viability of new sentences. Language usage might be defined as a fall-back position when all other options have been exhausted.

==Context and co-text==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
When analyzing the structure of language statistically, a useful place to start is with high frequency context words, or so-called [[Key Word in Context]] (KWICs). After millions of samples of spoken and written language have been stored in a database, these KWICs can be sorted and analyzed for their co-text, or words which commonly co-occur with them. Valuable principles with which KWICs can be analyzed include:

* [[Collocation]]: words and their co-occurrences (examples include "fulfill needs" and "fall-back position")
* [[Semantic prosody]]: the connotation words carry ("pay attention" can be neutral or remonstrative, as when a teacher says to a pupil: "Pay attention!" 
* [[Colligation]]: the grammar that words use (while "I hope that suits you" sounds natural, "I hope that you are suited by that" does not).
* [[Register (sociolinguistics)|Register]]: the text style in which a word is used ("President vows to support allies" is most likely found in news headlines, whereas "vows" in speech most likely refer to "marriages"; in writing, the verb "vow" is most likely used as "promise").&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewis, M |title=Implementing the Lexical Approach |publisher=Language Teaching Publications, Hove, England |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once data has been collected, it can be sorted to determine the probability of co-occurrences. One common and well-known way is with a [[Agreement (linguistics)|concordance]]: the KWIC is centered and shown with dozens of examples of it in use, as with the example for "possibility" below.

===Concordance for ''possibility''===

          living must be made. The possibility that a young adult will be

 has been devoted to exploring the possibility that so-called ancient peoples&lt;/pre&gt;

Once such a concordance has been created, the co-occurrences of other words with the KWIC can be analyzed. This is done by means of a [[t-score]]. If we take for example the word "stranger" (comparative adjective and noun), a t-score analysis will provide us with information such as word frequency in the corpus: words such as "no" and "to" are not surprisingly very frequent; a word such as "controversy" much less. It then calculates the occurrences of that word together with the KWIC ("[[Frequency distribution#Joint frequency distributions|joint frequency]]") to determine if that combination is unusually common, in other words, if the word combination occurs significantly more often than would be expected by its frequency alone. If so, the collocation is considered strong, and is worth paying closer attention to.

In this example, "no stranger to" is a very frequent collocation; so are words such as "mysterious", "handsome", and "dark". This comes as no surprise. More interesting, however, is "no stranger to controversy". Perhaps the most interesting example, though, is the idiomatic "perfect stranger". Such a word combination could not be predicted on its own, as it does not mean "a stranger who is perfect" as we should expect. Its unusually high frequency shows that the two words collocate strongly and as an expression are highly idiomatic.

The study of [[corpus linguistics]] provides us with many insights into the real nature of language, as shown above. In essence, the lexicon seems to be built on the premise that language use is best approached as an [[assembly process]], whereby the brain links together ready-made chunks. Intuitively this makes sense: it is a natural short-cut to alleviate the burden of having to "re-invent the wheel" every time we speak. Additionally, using well-known expressions conveys loads of information rapidly, as the listener does not need to break down an utterance into its constituent parts. In ''[[Words and Rules]]'', Steven Pinker shows this process at work with regular and irregular verbs: we collect the former, which provide us with rules we can apply to unknown words (for example, the "‑ed" ending for past tense verbs allows us to decline the neologism "to google" into "googled"). Other patterns, the irregular verbs, we store separately as unique items to be memorized.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, S. |title=Words and Rules, the Ingredients of Language and life |publisher=Basic Books |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphor as an organizational principle for lexis==
Another method of effective language storage in the Lexicon includes the use of metaphor as a storage principle. ("Storage" and "files" are good examples of how human memory and computer memory have been linked to the same vocabulary; this was not always the case). [[George Lakoff]]'s work is usually cited as the cornerstone to studies of metaphor in the language.&lt;ref name=Lakoff&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lakoff, G  |author2=Johnson, M |title=Metaphors we live by |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is quite common: "time is money". We can save, spend and waste both time and money. Another interesting example comes from business and sex: businesses penetrate the market, attract customers, and discuss "relationship management". Business is also war: launch an ad campaign, gain a foothold (already a climbing metaphor in military usage) in the market, suffer losses. Systems, on the other hand, are water: a flood of information, overflowing with people, flow of traffic. The NOA {{clarify|date=March 2014}} theory of Lexicon acquisition argues that the metaphoric sorting filter helps to simplify language storage and avoid overload.

==Grammar==
Computer research has revealed that grammar, in the sense of its ability to create entirely new language, is avoided as far as possible. Biber and his team working at the [[University of Arizona]] on the Cobuild GSWE noted an unusually high frequency of word bundles that, on their own, lack meaning. But a sample of one or two quickly suggests their function: they can be inserted as grammatical glue without any prior analysis of form. Even a cursory observation of examples reveals how commonplace they are in all forms of language use, yet we are hardly aware of their existence. Research suggests that language is heavily peppered with such bundles in all registers; two examples include "do you want me to", commonly found in speech, or "there was no significant" found in academic registers. Put together in speech, they can create comprehensible sentences, such as "I'm not sure" + "if they're" + "they're going" to form "I'm not sure if they're going". Such a sentence eases the burden on the Lexicon as it requires no grammatical analysis whatsoever.&lt;ref name=Biber&gt;{{cite book |author=Biber, D et al., M|title=Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English |publisher=Longman |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Register==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
British linguist [[Michael Halliday|Michael K. Halliday]] proposes a useful dichotomy of [[Spoken language|spoken]] and [[written language]] which actually entails a shift in paradigm: while linguistic theory posits the superiority of spoken language over written language (as the former is the origin, comes naturally, and thus precedes the written language), or the written over the spoken (for the same reasons: the written language being the highest form of rudimentary speech), Halliday states they are two entirely different entities.

He claims that speech is grammatically complex while writing is lexically dense.&lt;ref name=Halliday&gt;{{cite book |author=Halliday, M. A. K. |chapter=Spoken and Written Modes of Meaning |editor1=Graddol, D. |editor2=Boyd-Barret, O. |title=Media Texts: Authors and Readers |publisher=Clevedon, Multilingual Matters and Open University |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a sentence such as "a cousin of mine, the one about whom I was talking the other day—the one who lives in Houston, not the one in Dallas—called me up yesterday to tell me the very same story about Mary, who..." is most likely to be found in conversation, not as a newspaper headline. "Prime Minister vows conciliation", on the other hand, would be a typical news headline. One is more communicative (spoken), the other is more a recording tool (written).

Halliday's work suggests something radically different: language behaves in [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]. Biber et al. working on the LGSWE worked with four (these are not exhaustive, merely exemplary): [[conversation]], [[literature]], [[news]], [[Academic writing|academic]]. These four registers clearly highlight distinctions within language use which would not be clear through a "grammatical" approach. Not surprisingly, each register favors the use of different words and structures: whereas news headline stories, for example, are grammatically simple, conversational anecdotes are full of lexical repetition. The lexis of the news, however, can be quite dense, just as the grammar of speech can be incredibly complicated.

Sometimes a '''metaphor''' is used to designate the '''language''' of other countries. These expressions refer to national literature heroes, which build the basis of a culture, a history and a nation.

'''Manjeshwar Govinda Pai''' (23 March 1883 – 6 September 1963), also known as '''Rastrakavi Govinda Pai''', was a [[Kannada]] poet. He was awarded the first Rashtrakavi title by the Madras Government (Kasaragod district was part of South Kanara district of Madras Presidency prior to the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|linguistic reorganisation of States]] on 1 November 1956&lt;ref&gt;[http://kasargod.nic.in/ Kasaragod District&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). Rashtrakavi M. Govinda Pai was the one who put [[Manjeshwar]]am ( Kerala) on the literary map of [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Venkat Madhurao Inamdar: "Govinda Pai"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
M. Govinda Pai was born on 23 March 1883 in a [[Konkani]] [[Goud Saraswat Brahmin]] family at his maternal grandfather's house in Manjeshwar.&lt;ref name="BhatBhat1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Thirumaleshwara Bhat|author2=Neerkaje Thirumaleshwara Bhat|title=Govind Pai|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgvHhDqmJw8C|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-540-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2017}} He was the first son of [[Mangalore]] Sahukaar Thimmappa Pai and Devaki Amma. Govinda Pai went to school in Mangalore. For college education, Pai went to Madras ([[Chennai]]). Due to the sudden death of his father, he had to return.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Career==
Govinda Pai was also a prolific prose writer. His earliest composition in prose was ''Srikrishna Charita'' (1909) which makes for remarkable reading. [[Govinda Pai]] narrated the story of Christ's crucifixion in his work ''Golgotha'' (1931). The next three [[panegyrics]] published by him; Vaishakhi, Prabhasa and Dehali, narrated the last days of the Buddha, God Krishna and Gandhi respectively; were a result of the huge success of Golgotha.&lt;ref name="vaisakhi"&gt;Das (1995), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; His best works written in blank verse, viz., ''Golgotha'' (''The last days of Christ'', published in 1937), ''Vaisakhi '' (''The last days of Buddha'', published in 1946) and ''Hebberalu'' (''The Thumb'', the story of Ekalavya retold, published in 1946) have won a lasting place in the gallery of the greatest poets of Kannada literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kasargod.nic.in/profile/personalities.htm Kasargod – Eminent Personalities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gommata Jinastuti'' was his first published work. He introduced the sonnet form into Kannada.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Hebberalu dramatises the story of Drona and Ekalavya, characters from the epic Mahabharata.&lt;ref name="bliss"&gt;Murthy (1992), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Govinda Pai also enriched Kannada learning with his historical studies and research. He was an authority on the chronology and history of Tulunad. His works also testify to his universal outlook as well as to his deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Awards and legacy==
In 1949, the then Madras Government conferred on him the [[National poet|Rashtrakavi]] award. He was the president of Kannada Sahitya Sammelana at Bombay in 1951.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

On his 125th birth anniversary, a national award was instituted in his name and his old house at Manjeshwar is mooted to be a national monument.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In [[Udupi]] near his native place, the Govind Pai Research Institute is established near MGM College of Dr. T.M.A Pai Foundation of Manipal institutions. Other centres in the vicinity are Yakshagana &amp; Janapada Samshodhana Kendra, Kanakadasa Peetha and Tulu lexicon project.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Govind Pai was also acknowledged by the [[government of Kerala]]. The Govind Pai Memorial College is a part of [[Kannur University]] in Manjeswar is a testimonial for this.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Image:M Govinda Pai Regional Research Centre Udupi 003.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|M Govinda Pai Regional Research Centre Udupi]]

Govind Pai attended the Intermediate Course at Government College, Mangalore. It was here that he had [[Panje Mangesh Rao]] as one of his teachers. Panje was another pioneer of the Modern Kannada literary renaissance. Govind Pai had once asked Panje for the text of two songs which Panje used to recite. Panje used to borrow literary journals from Govind Pai, who, even as a lad of 13, had developed a taste for books and had started subscribing to literary journals.&lt;ref name="BhatBhat1993"/&gt;

On the occasion of Govind Pai's 125th birthday celebration at Manjeshwar, the foundation stone for the 'Gilivindu Project' was laid. The Union government and state governments of Kerala and Karnataka jointly took the initiative to build a memorial by planning a project called 'Gilivindu' at an estimated cost of Rs 20&amp;nbsp;million, which will consist of an open amphitheater, venue for staging plays, art exhibitions, Yakshagana, library section, preservation of manuscripts, research, comparative studies, archives, guest house for scholars etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Foundation Stone Laid for 'Gilivindu Project' at Manjeshwar|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=44943&amp;n_tit=Kasargod%3A+Foundation+Stone+Laid+for+%91Gilivindu+Project%92+at+Manjeshwar/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) foundation would meet the expenses to renovate the Govinda Pai memorial building into a museum, library and an auditorium. The initiative was part of the ‘Gulivindu’ project, launched by the Kerala and Karnataka governments, to develop the poet’s ancestral house here into a national level centre of literature, culture, and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poet's house to get an upgrade|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poets-house-to-get-an-upgrade/article4844988.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Govind Pai today exists for us in the form of his poems, plays essays and such other literary and non-literary works, his life was so full of events and his personality so impressive and his accomplishments were so various that they have been recorded by many writers who were captivated by them and these records also recreate his life for us. Govind pai's circle of friends and readers was so large that in the commemoration volume brought out in Kundapur in the year 1965 no fewer than 70 writers, all eminent and didstinguished writers in their own merit, sketched the remarkable qualities of the genius that Govind pai was. Govind pai's rich personality, reflected in his works, gets further focus in these reminiscences.&lt;ref name="BhatBhat1993"/&gt;

Poetic composition in Kannada was largely conventional around the turn of the century. On the prescription of all poets invariably used to maintain the initial rhyme in versification. Govind Pai too adhered to this practice in the early stages of his career. His first poem "Suvasini" was published in the journal of the same name The first poems to be published in "Swadeshabhimani" were "Subhadra Vilapa" and "Kaliya Mardana". These poems had the initial rhyme. These rhymed poems were published in the journal Swadeshabhimani from 1903 to 1910.

But slowly Govind Pai began to ask whether initial rhyme was so essential to poetry. Sanskrit poetry and English poetry did not have this element but that did not detract from their merit. Once Govind Pai made bold to ask Panje Mangesh Rao about his opinion on giving up rhyme. He seemed to imply that writing without rhyme meant a lack of poetic skill. Govind Pai was not satisfied with the response. But he still hesitated to deviate from the trodden path. Some poems which he wrote without rhyme he destroyed. But when he was in Baroda in 1911 he finally made up his mind to renounce rhyme. But today Govind Pai's route of deviation has become the royal path.&lt;ref name="BhatBhat1993"/&gt;

'''Main-Franconian''' ({{lang-de|Mainfränkisch}}) is group of [[Upper German]] dialects being part of the [[East Franconian German|East Franconian]] group. The name is derived from the river [[Main (river)|Main]] which meets the river [[Rhine]] near [[Frankfurt]] after having crossed the former [[West Germany]] from East to West. The dialect is estimated by Ethnologue as 40% intelligible with [[Standard German]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue" /&gt;

==Language area==
Main-Franconian dialects are spoken in a large stripe along the river Main. Although part of the general continuum of dialects from [[Scandinavia]] to the [[Alps]], there are pretty sharp borders for many Main-Franconian dialects. In the North and Northeast, these follow [[Salzbogen]] and [[Rennsteig]] in the [[Thuringian Forest]], while others in the East and South coincide with the late medieval borders of the [[Archdiocese of Bamberg]] and the [[Bishopric of Würzburg]].

Dialects of the Main-Franconian group are spoken mainly in:

[[Malayalam]] is one of the [[Dravidian languages]] and as such has an [[Agglutinative languages|agglutinative]] grammar. The word order is generally [[subject–object–verb]], although other orders are often employed for reasons such as emphasis. [[Noun]]s are inflected for [[Grammatical case|case]] and [[Grammatical number|number]], whilst [[verb]]s are conjugated for [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Causative|causativity]] (and also in archaic language for [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]], number and [[Grammatical polarity|polarity]]).  Being the linguistic successor of the [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] [[Manipravalam]], Malayalam grammar is based on Sanskrit too.

==Nouns==
The [[declension]]al paradigms for some common nouns and pronouns are given below. As Malayalam is an agglutinative language, it is difficult to delineate the cases strictly and determine how many there are, although seven or eight is the generally accepted number. [[Alveolar plosive]]s and [[Alveolar nasal|nasals]] (although the modern [[Malayalam script]] does not distinguish the latter from the [[dental nasal]]) are marked with a [[macron below]], following the convention of the [[National Library at Kolkata romanization]].

===Personal pronouns===
[[Vocative case|Vocative]] forms are given in parentheses after the [[nominative]], as the only pronominal vocatives that are used are the third person ones, which only occur in compounds.

== Sandhi (സന്ധി)==
There are basically two genres of Sandhi used in Malayalam - one group unique to Malayalam, and other one common with Sanskrit.  Thus, we have the "Malayala Sandhi" and "Samskrita Sandhi".

=== Sandhi unique to Malayalam ===
There are basically four Sandhi types unique to Malayalam - the "lōpa sandhi", "dvitva sandhi", "āgama sandhi" and "ādēśa sandhi".

==== Lōpa sandhi or "Rule of loss" ====
The Lopa sandhi occurs when the varna at the end of a word is lost when it merges with another word.  In most cases, the varna is the "samvr̥tōkāram". (the "closed u sound")

Example : atŭ + illa = atilla.
കണ്ടു ഇല്ല = കണ്ടില്ല,അത് ആയതു= അതായത്

==== Dvitva Sandhi or "Rule of doubling" ====
In Malayalam, germination is more in tense consonants and less in lax consonants. When two words combine in which the first is the qualifier and the qualified, the tense consonants initial to the second word germinates.

Example : pōyi + paraññu = pōyipparaññu
പോയി + പറഞ്ഞു = പോയിപ്പറഞ്ഞു

==== Āgama sandhi or "Rule of arrival" ====
When two vowels undergo Sandhi, a consonant ("y" or "v") arrives extra to avoid the pronunciation difficulty.

Example : vazhi + ampalam = vazhi'''y'''ampalam.
വഴി + അമ്പലം = വഴിയമ്പലം

==== Ādēśa Sandhi or "Rule of substitution" ====
In this Sandhi, one letter is substituted by another during concatenation.

Example : viṇ + talam = viṇṭalam
വിൺ + തലം = വിണ്ടലം  (t replaced by ṭ)

This sandhi is also includes Sanskrit Sandhi forms like vi + '''s'''amam = vi'''ṣ'''amam.

=== Sandhi common with Sanskrit ===
These Sandhi rules are basically inherited from Sanskrit, and are used in concatenation of Sanskrit vocabulary which form more than 80% of Malayalam.  The rules like savarṇadīrgha sandhi, yaṇ sandhi, guṇa sandhi, vr̥ddhi sandhi and visarga sandhis are used without changes.

== Samāsam (സമാസം)==
All the Sanskrit samāsa rules are adapted to Malayalam compounds.  In Malayalam, the tatpurusha compounds are classified according to the vibhakti they are based on, during compounding. The "alaṅkāraṁ" is also used to classify tatpurusha compounds.There are 4 type of samasam-1)aavyayi bhavan 2) thalpurusha 3) dvandan 4) bahuvrihi

== Vr̥ttaṁ (വൃത്തം)==
The vr̥ttaṁ consists of metres of Malayalam prosody.  Like Sandhi, there are specific vr̥ttaṁs unique to Malayalam apart from the metres common with Sanskrit.  As in case of Sandhi, the Malayalam vrittams are also named in Sanskrit.

== Alaṅkāram (അലങ്കാരം)==
Alaṅkāraṁ or "ornamentation" is also based on Sanskritic grammarian classification.  It consists of the different [[Figures of Speech|figures of speech]] used in Malayalam poetry.  Being successor to Sanskrit and Manipravalam, most of Sanskrit alankaras are used in Malayalam.  Thus, the common figures of speech in poems are rūpakaṁ, utprēkṣā, upamā etc.

=== Words adopted from Sanskrit ===
When words are adopted from Sanskrit, their endings are usually changed to conform to Malayalam norms:

==== Nouns ====
1. Masculine [[Sanskrit]] nouns with a [[Word stem]] ending in a short "a" take the ending "an" in the nominative singular. For example, [[Krishna|Kr̥ṣṇa]] -&gt; Kr̥ṣṇan. The final "n" is dropped before masculine surnames, honorifics, or titles ending in "an" and beginning with a consonant other than "n" – e.g. Krishna Menon, Krishna Kaniyaan etc., but Krishnan Ezhutthachan. Surnames ending with "ar" or "aḷ" (where these are plural forms of "an" denoting respect) are treated similarly – Krishna Pothuval, Krishna Chakyar, but Krishnan Nair, Krishnan Nambiar, as are Sanskrit surnames such "Varma(n)", "Sharma(n)", or "Gupta(n)" (rare) – e.g. Krishna Varma, Krishna Sharman.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} If a name is a compound, only the last element undergoes this transformation – e.g. Kr̥ṣṇa + dēva = Kr̥ṣṇadēvan, not Kr̥ṣṇandēvan.

2. Feminine words ending in a long "ā" or "ī" are changed so that they now end in a short "a" or "i", for example [[Sita|Sītā]] -&gt; Sīta and [[Lakshmi|Lakṣmī]] -&gt; Lakṣmi. However, the long vowel still appears in compound words, such as Sītādēvi orLakṣmīdēvi. The long ī is generally reserved for the [[vocative case|vocative]] forms of these names, although in Sanskrit the vocative actually takes a short "i". There are also a small number of nominative "ī" endings that have not been shortened – a prominent example being the word "strī" "woman".

3. Nouns that have a stem in -an and which end with a long "ā" in the masculine nominative singular have a "vŭ" added to them, for example[[Brahmā]] (stem Brahman) -&gt; Brahmāvŭ. When the same nouns are declined in the neuter and take a short "a" ending in Sanskrit, Malayalam adds an additional "m", e.g. Brahma (neuter nominative singular of [[Brahman]]) becomes Brahmam. This is again omitted when forming compounds.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

4. Words whose roots end in -an but whose nominative singular ending is -a – for example, the Sanskrit root of "[[Karma]]" is actually "Karman" –are also changed. The original root is ignored and "Karma" (the form in Malayalam being "Karmam" because it ends in a short "a") is taken as the basic form of the noun when declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

5. Sanskrit words describing things or animals rather than people with a stem in short "a" end with an "m" Malayalam. For example, [[Ramayana|Rāmāyaṇa]] -&gt; Rāmāyaṇam. In most cases, this is actually the same as the Sanskrit ending, which is also "m" (or allophonically anusvara due to Sandhi) in the neuter nominative. However, "things and animals" and "people" are not always differentiated based on whether or not they are sentient beings – for example [[Narasimha]] becomes Narasiṃham and not Narasiṃhan, whereas [[Ananta Shesha|Ananta]] becomes Anantan even though both are sentient. This does not strictly correspond to the Sanskrit neuter gender, as both "Narasiṃha" and "Ananta" are masculine nouns in the original Sanskrit.

6. Nouns with short vowel stems other than "a", such as "[[Vishnu|Viṣṇu]]", "[[Prajapati|Prajāpati]]" etc. are declined with the Sanskrit stem acting as the Malayalam nominative singular (the Sanskrit nominative singular is formed by adding a visarga, e.g. Viṣṇuḥ) {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

7. The original Sanskrit vocative is often used in formal or poetic Malayalam, e.g. "Harē" (for [[Hari]]) or "Prabhō" (for "Prabhu" – "lord"). This is restricted to certain contexts – mainly when addressing deities or other exalted individuals, so a normal man named Hari would usually be addressed using a Malayalam vocative such as "Harī". The Sanskrit genitive is also occasionally found in Malayalam poetry, especially the personal pronouns "mama" (my/ mine) and "tava" (thy/ thine). Other cases are less common and generally restricted to the realm of Maṇipravāḷam. 

8. Along with these [[tatsama]] borrowings, there are also many [[tadbhava]] words in common use. These were borrowed into Malayalam before it became distinct from Tamil. As the language did not then accommodate Sanskrit phonology as it now does, words were changed to conform to the Old Tamil phonological system. For example: Kr̥ṣṇa -&gt; Kaṇṇan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Malayapuram Singaravelu''' (18 February 1860 – 11 February 1946), also known as '''M. Singaravelu''' and '''Singaravelar''', was a pioneer in more than one field in [[India]]. In 1918, he founded the first trade union in India. On 1 May 1923 he organised the first ever celebration of May Day in the country. Singaravelar was a major leader of the [[Indian independence movement]], initially under the leadership of [[Gandhi]], but later, joining the budding communist movement. In 1925, he became one of the founding fathers of the [[Communist Party of India]]; and chaired its inaugural convention in [[Kanpur]]. Though the [[British Raj|British Government]] arrested him along with other leaders on charges of conspiring to wage war against [[the Crown]], he was set free, soon after, on account of his failing health.
Singaravelar was also a path-breaking social reformer who in his early life took to [[Buddhism]], seeing it as a weapon against the evil of [[untouchability]], which was particularly severe in the 19th-century India. He was also in the forefront of [[Self respect movement]], in the [[Madras Presidency]] that fought for equal rights for [[backward castes]]. Though in his advanced years, he withdrew from active politics, Singaravelar remained a staunch advocate of the causes he had pioneered till his death at the age of 85.

==Early life==
Singaravelar was born in a Fishermen family, the third son of Venkatachalam and Valliammai in [[Madras]] (now called [[Chennai]]).&lt;ref name= Singaravelu&gt;[http://www.singaravelar.com/Biography.htm Vasantha Kumaran, P. ''Singaravelar Godfather of Indian Labour''.] Chennai: Poornimaa Publication,&lt;/ref&gt; He matriculated in 1881 and then, from [[Madras Christian College]], he passed F.A. (First examination in Arts) in 1884. Singaravelar took his bachelor's degree from the [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]] under the [[Madras University]]. He joined the [[Dr. Ambedkar Government Law College, Chennai|Madras Law College]] and got his [[B.L.]] degree in 1907.&lt;ref name= Singaravelu/&gt; Thereafter Singaravelar practised law at the [[Madras High Court]].

In 1889, Singaravelar married Angammal.&lt;ref name= Singaravelu/&gt; Their only daughter was Kamala. Seetha, his grand-niece, married [[Philip Spratt]] in 1939. Singaravelar was successful as a lawyer; within a short period, he earned enough wealth to acquire estates in Madras town and suburbs.&lt;ref name= Singaravelu/&gt;

===Singaravelar and Maha Bodhi Society===
Around this time,Singaravelar had shown growing willingness to combat social evils such as [[untouchability]]. The leading voice of the oppressed classes at the end of the 19th century was [[Iyothee Thass]](also referred to as Pandit C. Ayodhya Dasa and Iyothi Thass) (1845–1914). He was born into a fisherman family(most backward caste) and had concluded that rationalist ideas of Buddhism could be used as a weapon against untouchability. He and other oppressed class people from Tamil Nadu decided thence forth to call themselves Buddhist, and live accordingly. In 1890 he started Sakya Buddhist Society and later in 1900, South Indian Buddhist Association in Madras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.payer.de/neobuddhismus/neobud0801.htm Materialien zum Neobuddhismus (Materials on Neobuddhism] Accessed on 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Iyothee Thass, Singaravelar also became growingly open to Buddhist ideas.

[[Anagarika Dharmapala]], the [[Ceylon]]ese Buddhist missionary founded the Maha Bodhi society for revival of Buddhism in 1891. Iyothee Thass and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Col. Olcott]] of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]] in [[Madras]], wanted to convene a meeting on Dharmapala's arrival in Madras. The meeting that took place on 8 August 1898 was held at Royapettah house of Singaravelar. Later on 28 September the Madras branch of the Maha Bodhi Society was inaugurated in the presence of a large gathering.
At this meeting a resolution was moved by Singaravelar to form, in Madras, the first branch of the Maha Bodhi Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/09/17/fea05.asp. Jayawardane, Lakshman Pioneer of Buddhist Revival Movement in South India.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed on 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Much later, in 1923, when Singaravelar issued the manifesto of his newly formed Party Labour and Kishan Party of Hindusthan, he signed it as 'M. Singaravelu (''Indian communist'') President, Madras Maha Bodhi Society'.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singaravelar and early labor movement==
In the history of working class movement in India, Madras came to occupy an important place when, within six months of the [[Russian Revolution]], Singaravelar, on 27 April 1918, formed the first trade union in India, called the Madras Labor Union of the British-owned Buckingham &amp; Carnatic Mills.&lt;ref&gt;Murugesan 1975, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Chettiiar became its first president. Singaravelar and other activists of the period, like [[Thiru Vi Ka]] ([[Telugu language|Tamil]] for 'Mr. V. K.' – standing for Mr. V. Kalyanasundaram) organised more unions such as M.S.M. Workers Union, Electricity Workers Union, Tramway Workers Union, Petroleum Employees Union, Printing Workers Union, Aluminium Workers Union, Railway Employees Union, [[Coimbatore]] Weavers Union and [[Madurai]] Weavers Union.

From their inception trade unions in Madras were drawn into long, and often bloody, confrontations with the management. According to the noted economist [[Amiya Kumar Bagchi]],&lt;blockquote&gt; Madras had led the trade union movement with the organisation of workers into Madras Labour Union, but the movement could not flourish in a region with abundant labour, slow industrial growth and employees who were determined not to make any concession to labour organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UZZcTYzHBtgC |last=Bagchi |first= Amiya Kumar |title=Private Investment in India, 1900–1939 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |ISBN=0415190126 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buckingham &amp; Carnatic Mills workers' strike is a case in point. The management of the Mills did not even concede workers right to combine. The union was banned by the British authorities. A flash point occurred when a British manager threatened workers with a gun, which was snatched by workers and started firing back. The police came and opened fire killing two young workers.

Singaravelar, Thiru Vi Ka, and other leaders called for a strike on 21 June 1921. The management retaliated by instigating a [[caste]] war through recruitment of workers from 'low' castes to fill the strikers' vacancies. The strike turned into a caste war between two warring groups. On 29 August 1921, police firing near the Mills' premises in [[Perambur]], near Madras, killed seven people. When their funeral procession was taken out some miscreants threw stones, leading to another round of caste violence. Two more firings – on 19 September and 15 October 1921 followed. After six months, the strike came to an end, failing to meet any of its objectives.&lt;ref name= Singaravelu /&gt; From then Singaravelar started seeking political backing for the working class movement.

Aluminium workers in Madras struck work in July 1922. Singaravelar speaking in Tamil Nadu Congress Committee meeating in September 1922 said that the [[Indian National Congress]] should take up the cause of labour.&lt;ref&gt;Murugesan 1975, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Later he led a strike of workers of Addisons press. in December 1922 he was in the forefront of Madras Tramways workers strike.Singaravelar also presided over the strike of 30 August 1924 by the scavengers of Madras Corporation.

===Singaravelar's contact with émigré communists===
Singaravelar attracted the attention of the émigré Communist Party of India, which was founded by [[M. N. Roy]], [[Shaukat Usmani]] and others in [[Tashkent]] on 17 October 1920. Describing the formation of earliest communist groups in India, [[S. A. Dange]] is quoted as below: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Tashkent Party (ie. CPI) and the Executive Committee of the [[Communist International]] tried to build contacts independently and through me with communist group in Calcutta led by [[Muzaffar Ahmed (politician)|Muzaffar Ahmed]] and the group in Madras led by Singaravelu Chettiar.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Abani Mukherji]], a close associate of M.N. Roy, smuggled himself to India from Moscow via [[Berlin]] in December 1922 and surreptitiously met local communist leaders. After meeting Dange at the [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] session of the Congress in December 1922, and meeting [[Bengal]] communist groups, Mukherji moved to Madras and met Singaravelar. Mukherji helped him with his efforts to form Hindustan Labour Kishan Party and also to draw up its manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier Singaravelar had met Dange at the Gaya session of the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Murugesan 1975, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singaravelar and the Congress==
When [[Gandhi]] launched [[non-cooperation movement]] starting from September 1920 to February 1922 Singaravelar accepted Gandhi's leadership and became one of the influential leaders of the Presidency Congress Party. He set fire to his lawyer's gown at a public meeting in May 1921 as symbolic of boycotting the British courts. In May 1921, he wrote a letter to Mahatma Gandhi explaining his action, "I have given up my profession as a lawyer today. I shall follow you as you strive for the people of this country."

An important event of the period was the visit of [[Prince of Wales]] and his consort to India. When they came to Madras, Singaravelar organised the boycott of the delegation through an unprecedented ''hartal'' or complete shutdown of shops and establishments of the town. The shutdown was complete, but there were instances of compulsion.

Gandhi in an article in ''Young India'', dated 9 February 1922 criticized the hartal and Singaravelar for not imbibing the true spirit of non-cooperation movement. He quoted a letter from one of his disciples, Dr. Rajan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just two days ago, Mr. Singaravelu Chettiar, president Madras District
Congress Council, held a public meeting on the Madras beach. The first
resolution congratulated the citizens of Madras on their successful hartal and
the second resolution condemned the excesses committed that day.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wired to Mr. Singaravelu not to have this ugly meeting but
evidently no notice seems to have been taken of it&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL026.PDF'' The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' Volume. 26: 24 January 1922 – 12 November 1923 p. 132.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gandhi's comment on the passage was,&lt;blockquote&gt;The confession, therefore, that Dr. Rajan has made is an
invigorating process. It strengthens him and the cause for which he
stands. Non-co-operation is a vicious and corrupt doctrine, truly an
"ugly" word, if it does not mean down-right self-purification.
Stubborn and implacable resistance against internal corruption is
enough resistance against the Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL026.PDF'' The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' Volume. 26: 24 January 1922 – 12 November 1923 p. 134.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Singaravelar in Gaya congress convention===
When the Indian National Congress met in Gaya, in 1922,Singaravelar participated, seeing himself as a representative of workers. He spoke in favour of labour legislation and felt that the labour movement in India must be a part of the congress movement. M. N. Roy praised him for calling himself a communist,in ''Vanguard'' dated 1 March 1923 &lt;blockquote&gt;That Singaravelu participated in the Gaya Congress Meeting in which people with different ideas took part will be considered a historic event. When many leaders were afraid that their honour and respect as important leaders will be lost and young men were afraid of the steps that the government would take, this sixty-year-old grey-haired elder called him a communist". It is impossible not to praise him.&lt;ref&gt;Murugesan 1975, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The theme of his speech was that "it is necessary approach the workers personally and make Trade Unions a part of the Congress." Following his speech, the Gaya meeting adopted the Labor Resolution that said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the opinion of this conference that all Indian Labourers should be united. To safeguard their rights and prevent their exploitation and for equal distribution of wealth among all, the various labour and kisan unions should be unified and for this purpose, a committee of six&lt;ref&gt;Including Singaravelu Chettiar.&lt;/ref&gt; has been constituted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The first May Day in India===
On 1 May 1923, Singaravelar founded the [[Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan|Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan]](a party of workers and peasants) in [[Madras]]. The foundation ceremony was purposefully kept on the May Day; and for the first time in India, under the auspices of the newly formed party,&lt;ref&gt;Murugesan 1975, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; the day was observed as [[International Workers' Day]]. On that occasion, again for the first time the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] was used in India.&lt;ref name="rao1"&gt;M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''. [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Singaravelar made arrangements to celebrate the May Day in two places in the One meeting was held at the beach opposite to the [[Madras High Court]]; the other was held at the [[Triplicane]] beach. [[The Hindu]] newspaper, published from Madras reported, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Labour Kisan party has introduced May Day celebrations in Chennai. Comrade Singaravelar presided over the meeting. A resolution was passed stating that the government should declare May Day as a holiday. The president of the party explained the non-violent principles of the party. There was a request for financial aid. It was emphasised that workers of the world must unite to achieve independence.&lt;ref&gt;Murugesan 1975, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan===
Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan was a part of a larger, but not inter-connected, moves by various Indian communist groups to find a mass-based political platform. Dange, for instance, wrote to M. N. Roy of the émigré Communist Party of India and a leader of the [[Comintern]], regarding his desire to start a Socialist Labour Party of India. In reply, Roy explained the relation between émigré Communist Party of India and 'mass party of revolutionary nationalist struggle',and further said that "each of the Indian "centres" produced a separate scheme and it was some time before they could agree to combine." Roy was probably referring to Singaravelar's proposal to start a similar party. Same year Dange wrote in his journal ''Socialist'' that all his activities were now a part of the Labour Kishan Party of Hindusthan and he asked for opening up of its branches everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Murugesan 1975, p.90-91&lt;/ref&gt;

Singaravelar announced that it would join the Indian National Congress and would strive to function as the labour and farmer wing of that party. Labour Kishan Party was a precursor to Workers and Peasants Party of 1925 that would function within the Congress, as a left wing platform for the same. In the manifesto of the party Singaravelar described Congress 'our chief political organ, appear to define "nation" by referring to propertied class.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1923 Singaravelar started a fortnightly journal called ''The Labour Kisan Gazette''. Singaravelar also started the Tamil Weekly ''Thozhilalar'' in which he wrote about the working class movements spreading in various parts of the world during the early part of the 1920s.

In 1925, Singaravelar was elected as a member of the [[Chennai|Madras Corporation]]. On Singaravelar's initiative first ever [[Mid-day Meal Scheme|mid-day meal scheme]] was introduced in Madras for providing cooked meals to children in corporation schools.

==Formation of Communist Party of India==
In the Gaya congress session of 1922, the president of the session, [[C. R. Das]] moved a resolution for 'Council-Entry programme,' that is, 'Non-Cooperation from within the Councils.' He however met with vehement opposition from the Mahatma and the 'no-changers'. [[C. Rajagopalachari]] led the Council-Entry opposition. The resolution lost. M. N. Roy wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been proved at Gaya, if proof were still needed, that the National. struggle can be led, neither by the reactionary petty-bourgeoisie acting through the orthodox “No-Changers” under the divine guidance of St. Rajagopal, nor by the radical intellectuals desirous of harking back to the folds of Constitutionalism, under the guise of loyalty to the memory of Tilak. Between these two centripetal forces, Bengal's “Sentimental Tommy”(C.R. Das) croaked. Before he could wreck the Councils, the Councils wrecked him.

What is to be done? A new party must be organised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/roy/1923/02/15.htm Roy, M. N. ''On the Gaya Congress.] Marxist Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Early communists like Dange, Singaravelar, M. N. Roy's associate, Abani Mukherji, a deportee from [[Fiji]] and a lawyer [[Manilal Doctor]] were present at the Gaya session and saw Gandhi's support to the 'no-changers.' Efforts to form a unified platform intensified.

On 29 January 1923, Dange wrote to Singaravelar that, &lt;blockquote&gt;You perhaps know that Roy wants to hold a conference of Indian Communists in [[Berlin]]. I think it is a mad venture Indians to go hunting Communism in European Conference, whatever has to be done must be done in India.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cawnpore Bolshevik Conspiracy case===
In January 1924 the Government of India compiled a brief on activities of communists in India. The Government Counsel recommended prosecution against the first eight in the list, namely, M. N. Roy, Muzaffar Ahmed, [[Shaukat Usmani]] Gulam Hussain, S. A. Dange, Singaravelu, Ramcharan Lal Sharma and Nalini Gupta. But no recommendations were made against S. D. Hussain, M. P. T. Velayudham (an associate of Singaravelar), Sampurnand, Manilal Doctor and Satya Bhakta.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; The report was submitted to the [[Governor General]] and on further legal scrutiny some lacunae were found. The scope of the case was revised to bring in a conspiracy angle: that the Third [[Communist International]] had appointed Roy as its agent and had instructed him to establish a communist party with the help of Shaukat Usmani, S. A. Dange, Singaravelu, Gulam Hussain and Muzaffar Ahmed.

As the charges were getting framed Dange and Singaravelar were arrested under Regulation III of 1918 that allowed detention without trial in August 1923. Subsequently, Muzaffar Ahmed (Calcutta), Shaukat Usmani (Kanpur) and Gulam Hussain (Lahore) were arrested. On 20 December 1923 Nalini Gupta was also arrested under the same regulation. Roy evaded arrest since he was abroad. Ramcharan Lal Sharma was not arrested because he had migrated to the French territory of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]] due to police harassment.

On 17 March 1924 cases were framed against the accused in what was called the [[Cawnpore]] (now spelt [[Kanpur]]) Bolshevik Conspiracy case. The specific charge was that they as communists were seeking "to deprive the King Emperor of his sovereignty of British India, by complete separation of India from imperialistic Britain by a violent revolution." Out of the six accused in custody only four—S. A. Dange, Shaukat Usmani, Muzaffar Ahmed and Nalini Gupta—were produced. Singaravelar, now 64, was confined to bed due to illness. He was later released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.54-55&lt;/ref&gt; Gulam Hussain was pardoned after he confessed that he had received money in Kabul.&lt;ref name="Ralhan, O.P."&gt;Ralhan, O.P. (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Political Parties'' New Delhi: Anmol Publications p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The case attracted interest of the people towards Comintern plan to bring about violent revolution in India. Communist trials had taken place in India, in frontier towns like [[Peshawar]] where Russian trained [[muhajir people|muhajir]] communists were put on trial. "But no case had attracted public gaze like the Kanpur case. Pages of newspapers daily splashed sensational communist plans and people for the first time learned such a large scale about communism and its doctrines and the aims of the Communist International in India.&lt;ref name="Ralhan, O.P."/&gt;" Names of accused like S.A. Dange, Muzaffar Ahmed, Shaukat Usmani and Singaravelu Chettiar came to be recognised across the country.

===First communist conference===
In 1924, shortly after the Kanpur Conspiracy Case, Satyabhakta, a Congress worker in the [[United Provinces of British India|United Provinces]] had decided to organise a 'legal' Communist Party, that is, a party that would not attract treasonable charges such as in the Kanpur case. Initially no significant notice was taken of Satyabhakta's venture, but when Nalini Gupta was released from the jail (July 1925) and later when Muzaffar Ahmed was released in September on grounds of poor health, their interest fell on Satyabhakta's party for organizational work—in the absence of any other structure.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; Satyabhakta then announced a communist conference in DeMarxistcember 1925, at Kanpur, to be concurrently held with Indian National Congress convention. His idea was to demarcate himself from the existing communist groups. N. N. Roy was skeptical when he wrote in the October 1925 issue of his magazine,''Masses of India'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;It is premature to say that what shape this 'Communist Party' will ultimately assume and how far it is going to be Communist in Programme and actions.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conference was held on 25–26 December 1925. Singaravelu Chettiar was elected to preside over the session. The meeting adopted a resolution for the formation of the Communist Party of India.&lt;ref&gt;The two major Indian communist parties, namely, Communist Party Of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India ()(CPI(M)) maintain different views on exactly when the Communist Party of India was founded. The date maintained as the foundation day by the CPI is 26 December 1925. But according to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the party was founded in Tashkent, USSR on 17 October 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; Accoriding to the Constitution, the object of the Party was, to quote, &lt;blockquote&gt;establishment of workers' and peasants' republic based on socialisation of means of production and distribution, by the liberation of India from British imperialist domination.&lt;ref&gt;Ralhan 1997, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The British Government's extreme hostility towards communists, made them to decide not to openly function as a communist party; instead, they chose a more open and non-federated platform, under the name the Workers and Peasants Parties.

==Singaravelar and railway employees' strike==
Employees of various railway systems in India, the North-Western Railway, Bengal Nagpur Railway, and The East Indian Railway went on to strike demanding better working conditions and for better treatment by the management.Singaravelar went on a tour to north India to extend his support to the striking railway employees. In February 1927 he reached [[Bhopal]] and met the striking workers. In [[Howrah]] and [[Bengal]] 30,000 workers were on strike. Singaravelar along with a group of workers from Madras State also took part in the strike.

===South Indian Railway Strike===
After returning from his North Indian tour Singaravelar was drawn into another railway employees' strike. In 1927, the workers of the South Indian Railways were resisting measures by the management to retrench them through a fresh assessment of their skills. Also the management had decided relocating employees working in different railway workshops to one near [[Tiruchirapalli]](Trichy). The workers demanded the withdrawal of both these measures. When the management refused to accede to their demands, the workers went on strike from 19 July 1928. All the railway employees, irrespective of their seniority, joined the strike. from 21 July 1928 the trains were stilled.

The strike eventually failed. Singaravelar along with a prominent leader of the strike, Sakkarai Chettiar, and a number of employees were arrested.Singaravelar was sentenced the ten years imprisonment, which was reduced to 18 months on appeal.

==Singaravelar and the self-respect movement==
[[File:Singaravelu Statue in Puducherry.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The statue of Singaravelu Chettiar, on the side of a busy street in [[Puducherry]].]]

Singaravelar felt that [[E.V. Ramasami Naicker]]'s [[self-respect movement]] (that advocated for upliftment of low castes and opposing upper castes) and the communist movement should work together to save the Tamil labour forces from the clutches of both religious and economic exploiters. This appealed to Naicker and he published Singaravelar's contributions in his magazine,''Kudiyarasu''. In 1931, Naicker undertook a journey to Soviet Russia and other European countries. On his return, he invited Singaravelar to Erode for discussions. Naicker convened a meeting of the movement at his residence on 28–29 December 1932, and drew out what was called the Erode Plan. Naicker had taken a decision to support pro-British [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] and to oppose the Indian National Congress in the elections that followed. Unlike Congress, the Justice Party had agreed to implement a policy of appointments to government jobs in proportion to caste ratios, as demanded by the leaders of the self-respect movement.

Significance of Singaravelar's association with the self-respect movement is brought out by [[Karthigesu Sivathamby]], a prominent Tamil scholar from [[Sri Lanka]] who has closely studied the social movements in Madras province,

&lt;blockquote&gt;By this time the rationalist movement, through its association with the world socialist movement, was becoming more scientific. It was not merely rationalism in the Ingersolian sense. It was becoming more and more scientific... promotion of socialism, and so on. And this is seen in the immediate tie-up of M. Singaravelu Chettiar and Periyar

'''Edward "Ned" Maddrell''' (1877 – 27 December&lt;!--some sources say 24, but 27 December is given by what appear to be more reliable sources..needs solid verification, though--&gt; 1974) was a [[fishing|fisherman]] from the [[Isle of Man]] who, at the time of his death, was the last surviving [[first language|native speaker]] of the [[Manx language]].

==Life==
Following the death of [[Sage Kinvig]] ({{circa|1870}}–1962), Maddrell was the only remaining person who could claim to have spoken Manx Gaelic from childhood (according to one source, Maddrell had some knowledge of English before he learned Manx, and learned Manx from his great-aunt),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaelg.iofm.net/ARTICLE/Broderick/maddrell.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040919025035/http://www.gaelg.iofm.net/ARTICLE/Broderick/maddrell.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2004 |title=Language Decline and Language Revival in the Isle of Man |work=Ned Maddrell Memorial Lecture |date=28 November 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although at the time some other people spoke it as a second language, having learned it later in life.

Maddrell recorded some of his speech for the sake of [[linguistics|linguistic]] preservation; for example, in 1948 he recorded the following about fishing (in Manx, with the English translation):

:''Dooyrt "Ballooilley" rish'':
::"Ballooilley" said to him:
:''"Vel ny partanyn snaue, Joe?"''
::"Are the crabs crawling, Joe?"
:''"Cha nel monney, cha nel monney," dooyrt Joe. "T'ad feer ghoan."''
::"Not much, not much," said Joe. "They're very scarce."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gaelg/goo/samples.htm Manx Language Samples (with audio):] "Are the Crabs Crawling?"&lt;/ref&gt;

A newspaper article about the decline of Manx from about 1960 (Maddrell's age was given as 82) mentions and quotes him, since at the time he was, along with Kinvig, one of only two native speakers:

{{quote|Ned Maddrell, who went to sea at 13, found he was able to keep his Manx "alive" by talking to [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]-speaking sailors on British ships. He was brought up in the remote village of [[Cregneash]], where "unless you had the Manx you were a deaf and dumb man and no good to anybody."

This was not the case in the towns. "Nobody there wanted to talk Manx, even those who had it well. They were ashamed, like. 'It will never earn a penny for you,' they said." Ned is a sprightly old man, a trifle deaf but very proud of his role as one of the last native speakers. "They have tape recordings of me telling legends and stories in Manx," he said, "in Ireland and in [[United States|America]] and in places you never heard of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9309&amp;L=GAELIC-L&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=943 |title=The Death of Manx from newspaper clipping 1950s |date=2 September 1993 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |first1=Stephen |last1=Miller |newsgroup=GAELIC-L }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maddrell appears to have enjoyed his minor celebrity status, and was very willing to teach younger language revivalists such as Leslie Quirk and [[Brian Stowell]]. When Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] visited the island he called upon Ned personally. De Valera had been angered some years before at the inaction of the [[British government|British]] and Manx governments over the demise of the language, and had sent over a team from the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] with a sound recording van to preserve what was left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Wooden Crate which preserved the Manx Language|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/isleofman/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8483000/8483578.stm|accessdate=19 February 2014|publisher=BBC|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manx language has undergone a revival after his death, partly thanks to the support that Ned Maddrell gave to younger learners of the language towards the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/116440298 ''What is the Significance of Ned Maddrell?''] by [[Brian Stowell]] RBV, produce by [[Culture Vannin]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this that he can no longer be referred to as "the last native speaker," as a growing number of people on the Isle of Man today grow up with Manx. Today he is remembered by an annual lecture on Celtic language survival hosted by [[Culture Vannin]] and [[Manx Gaelic Society|Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manx.net/tv/mt-tv/watch/81293/ned-maddrell-lecture ''Ned Maddrell Lecture 2016''] from Manx.net (accessed 21 December 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opéra bouffe''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔpeʁa buf}}, plural: ''opéras bouffes'') is a genre of late 19th-century [[France|French]] operetta, closely associated with [[Jacques Offenbach]], who produced many of them at the [[Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens]] that gave its name to the form.

Opéras bouffes are known for elements of comedy, satire, parody and farce. The most famous examples are ''[[La belle Hélène]]'', ''[[Barbe-bleue (opera)|Barbe-bleue]]'' (''Bluebeard''), ''[[La Vie parisienne (operetta)|La Vie parisienne]]'', ''[[La Périchole]]'' and ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]]''.

A speaker of Silbo Gomero is sometimes referred to in Spanish as a ''silbador'' ('whistler'). Silbo Gomero is a transposition of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] from speech to whistling. This oral [[phoneme]]-whistled phoneme substitution emulates Spanish [[phonology]] through a reduced set of whistled [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==History==

[[File:La Gomera 1.jpg|thumb|left|The narrow valleys of [[La Gomera]].]]
Little is known of the original [[Guanche language]] or the languages of the Canaries, but it is assumed that their phonological system must have been simple enough to allow an efficient whistled language.&lt;ref&gt;Busnel, Classe, pp 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; Used by the island's original inhabitants, the [[Guanches]], the whistled language existed before the arrival of Spanish settlers and was also spoken on [[el Hierro]], [[Tenerife]], and [[Gran Canaria]]. Silbo was adapted to Spanish during the Spanish settlement in the 16th century and was widely spoken throughout the period into the following 17th century.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Online"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2354935/The-language-entirely-WHISTLES-believe-used-Canary-Islands.html|title=The language made up entirely of WHISTLES|publisher=[[Daily Mail Online]]|date=14 July 2013|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Silbo barely remained on el Hierro, where it had flourished at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Busnel, Classe, p 8"&gt;Busnel, Classe, p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the language declined in the 1950s, one factor being the economic decline, which forced many speakers to move away to seek better jobs to cope financially.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Online"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20953138|title=Silbo Gomero: A whistling language revived|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological developments such as the [[telephone]] played a part in reducing the practicality and utility of the language. The language's earlier survival had been due to its role in overcoming distance and terrain, in addition to the ease with which it is learned by native speakers.&lt;ref name="Busnel, Classe, p 8"/&gt; Most significantly, in the period from the 1960s to 1980s, many people had turned away from [[agriculture]] and so many [[middle class]] families did not want their children to speak the language as it was negatively associated with the rural [[peasants]].

In the late 1990s, [[language revitalization]] efforts began and initiatives from within the community started. By 1999, the revitalization of Silbo Gomero was furthered by [[education policies]] and other legislative measures. It now has official protection as an example of [[intangible cultural heritage]].

==Speakers==
Many people in La Gomera speak Silbo Gomero, but their expression of the language deviates in minor ways which show the different origins of the speaker. As reported in a 2009 [[UNESCO]] report, all the people living in La Gomera understand the language, but only those born before 1950 and the younger generations who attended school since 1999 can speak the language.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00172 |title= Whistled language of the island of La Gomera (Canary Islands), the Silbo Gomero |publisher= Fourth Session of the Intergovernmental Committee 2009 (4.COM)|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those born before 1950 were taught the language by their elders in their homes, and those who have attended or are attending school since 1999 were taught the language formally in school. Those born between 1950 and 1980 understand the language but are unable to speak it, as the language was hardly used and negatively viewed during their time of [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

==Revitalization==
When this medium of communication was endangered  in the late 20th century, [[Language revitalization|revitalization]] efforts were generated at both community level and governmental level. A combination of initiatives from the La Gomeran community and policies implemented by the authorities saw Silbo Gomero being revitalized and maintained as a cultural asset. These revitalization efforts were well-documented by UNESCO as part of the proceedings for the selection of the 2009 [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

===Community initiatives===
In a bid to preserve Silbo Gomero for the island’s youth, expert whistlers sought to obtain authorization, which enabled them to teach the language on a free and voluntary basis at a dedicated centre. This initiative by the senior islanders garnered encouraging responses, with parent-teacher associations extending it to all schools. The first of many revitalization measures was thus adopted at the [[grassroots]] level, not by public or private entities, which reflected the language attitude of locals towards Silbo Gomero. Education policies which were implemented later were inspired as such - revitalization began at the grassroots and escalated to the highest government bodies.

===Government policies===
On 26 June 1997,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; the Parliament of the Canary Islands approved a motion calling on the government to include Silbo Gomero as part of school curriculum. Silbo Gomero then became a mandatory subject in primary and secondary education, as of  July 1999. The provincial government was supportive in its implementation of education policy and also the establishment of a formalized Silbo Gomero curriculum through the publication of ''El Silbo Gomero, Materiales didácticos'' (Educational Materials on the Silbo Gomero).

In addition to the compulsory learning of Silbo Gomero at the primary and secondary level, an Island School of Silbo Gomero was established for post-secondary students who wish to continue to train in Silbo Gomero until they become accredited professional instructors. Students of the Island School work to become capable of teaching Silbo Gomero to not only their fellow citizens, but also tourists who visit La Gomera. This facilitates the sustainability of the revitalization and also works towards language maintenance.

Thereafter, the Ministry of Education, Universities, Culture and Sport of the Canary Islands developed a staff training plan in order to ensure that the elderly expert whistlers can be replaced in the near future by qualified professional teachers with relevant diplomas. This comprised training courses on proficiency in and teaching of Silbo Gomero. The training plan was launched in 2007, with the participation of 18 teachers.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;

Besides the implementation of education policies, the authorities also sought to strengthen the corpus of Silbo Gomero by developing a project to digitize all recorded audio material. Local, national and worldwide distribution of documentaries on Silbo Gomero were also made. The government also raised the status of Silbo Gomero by selecting the whistled language of La Gomera via the National Historical Heritage Council to represent Spain in the nominations for inclusion on the 2009 Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

===Cultural heritage===
Members of the Gomeran community treasure Silbo Gomero  as part of the island’s identity and use the whistled language in traditional rituals and festivities on the island. One of these includes "bajadas", which are processions dedicated to the Virgin or the patron saints of the community. 
On 15 March 1999,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; Silbo Gomero was declared as part of the historical ethnographic heritage of the Canary Islands.  The annual celebration of “School Encounters with Silbo Gomero” was also inaugurated in La Gomera. In 2005, the monument to Silbo Gomero was inducted in [[Garajonay National Park]].

===Tourism===
[[File:Demostración de silbo gomero, La Gomera, España, 2012-12-14, DD 01.jpg|thumb|x200px|right|Silbo Gomero demonstration at a restaurant in La Gomera.]] Silbo Gomero is not only used between Gomerans; visitors to the island have the opportunity to be exposed to the whistled language too, in restaurants which provide whistling demonstrations for tourists. Minister of Tourism of La Gomera, Fernando Mendez, asserted that whistling is essential to the tourism industry of La Gomera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20953138|title=Silbo Gomero: A whistling language revived|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
{{Listen |filename=Silbo.ogg|left|title=A dialogue in Silbo Gomero}}

According to different studies, the Silbo Gomero Language has between 2&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; and 4&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meyer_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trujillo_Ortiz_2005"/&gt; vowels and between 4&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; and 10&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Annie" /&gt; consonants.
The language is a whistled form of a dialect of Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Busnel, Classe, p54 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Silbo replaces each vowel or consonant with a whistling sound. Whistles are distinguished according to pitch and continuity. As with other whistled forms of non-tonal languages, Silbo works by retaining approximately the articulation of ordinary speech, so "the timbre variations of speech appear in the guise of pitch variations" (Busnel and Classe: v).

Silbo Gomero is a complex language to learn, with its whistling techniques requiring physical precision, and a strength of the body parts used in mechanism of the language, that can only be acquired with practice. Silbo Gomero uses the tongue, lips and hands of the users, differing greatly from conventional language, which uses the mouth cavity to blend and contrast several acoustic frequencies. The whistling mechanism, in contrast, is limited to only emitting a single basic pitch between 1,000 and 3,000 hertz.
The physical precision comes in the skill of the whistler being able to vary the frequencies at different speeds and to start and stop the production of the sound waves. 
This technique is handed down within La Gomera’s community, with unchanged teaching methods that date back to the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;
The same pitch can represent many sounds, so it has much fewer phonemes than Spanish. This means that communication in Silbo can be ambiguous at times. Context and appropriate choice of words are thus important for effective communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Vowels===
The vowels of Silbo Gomero are described roughly as sustained lines of high and low frequency that are distinct from each other. 
{| border="1" class="wikitable"
|+ Vowels

| High frequency
| {{IPA|/i/}}
| {{IPA|/i/ and /e/}}
|-
| Low frequency
| {{IPA|/a/}}
| {{IPA|/a/, /o/, /u/}}
|-
|}
The high frequency /i/ vowel represents the {{IPA|/i/, /e/}} vowels of the spoken language being whistled, while the low frequency whistle of the dark /a/ vowel represents the vowels {{IPA|/a/, /o/, /u/}}. It is said that it is not possible to produce any vowels with intermediary frequencies as the whistling mechanism does not have the same functions that the vocal mechanism possess.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt; 
The theory that Silbo Gomero has only two vowels was theorised by [[Ramón Trujillo]] of the [[University of La Laguna]] in his published book "''EL SILBO GOMERO análisis lingüístico''" in 1978. His work, containing almost a hundred spectrograms, concludes in a theory that there are only two vowels and four consonants in the Silbo Gomero language.&lt;ref name="Trujillo"&gt;{{Cite journal

However, in a more recent study, the work of Julien Meyer (2005 - in French only (pg 100), 2008) gives a statistical analysis of the vowels of Silbo showing that there are 4 vowels statistically distinguished in production and that they are also perceived so.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=J.|year=2005 |title=Description typologique et intelligibilité des langues sifflées: approche linguistique et bioacoustique |place=Ph.D thesis.

Also in 2005, Annie Rialland of the [[University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle]] published an acoustic and phonological analysis of Silbo based on new materials, showing that, not only gliding tones, but also intensity modulation plays a role in distinguishing different whistled sounds.&lt;ref name="Annie"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rialland, A. | title=Phonological and phonetic aspects of whistled languages | journal=[[Phonology (journal)|Phonology]] | volume=22 | issue=2 | year=2005 | pages=237–271 | doi=10.1017/S0952675705000552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trujillo's 2005 collaboration with Gomeran whistler Isidro Ortiz and others ("''EL SILBO GOMERO Materiales didácticos''" - q.v. pdf link below) revises his earlier assertions to state that 4 vowels are indeed perceived (q.v. pg 63 ref. cit.),&lt;ref name="Trujillo_Ortiz_2005"&gt;{{Cite journal

|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes in detail the areas of divergence between his empirical data and Classe’s phonetic hypotheses. Despite Trujillo's 2005 work acknowledging the existence of 4 vowels, his 2006 bilingual work ("''El Silbo Gomero. Nuevo estudio fonológico''") inexplicably reiterates his 1978 two-vowel theory. Trujillo's 2006 work directly addresses many of Rialland's conclusions, but it seems that at the time of that writing he was unaware of Meyer's work.

Meyer suggests that there are 4 vowel classes of {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/u, o/}}. However Meyer goes on to say that there are 5 perceived vowels with significant overlap. 
Rialland (2005) and Trujillo (1978) both agree that the [[harmonic]] of the whistle matches the second [[formant]] of the spoken vowels. Spoken {{IPA|/a/}}'s F2 and whistled {{IPA|/a/}}'s H1 match in their frequency (1480&amp;nbsp;Hz). However, there is a disconnect in harmonics and formants near the frequency basement. Spoken speech has a wide range of F2 frequencies (790&amp;nbsp;Hz to 2300&amp;nbsp;Hz), whistles are limited to between 1200&amp;nbsp;Hz and 2400&amp;nbsp;Hz. Vowels are therefore shifted upwards at the lower end (maintaining 1480&amp;nbsp;Hz as {{IPA|/a/}}) increasing confusion between {{IPA|/o/}} (spoken F2  freq 890&amp;nbsp;Hz, whistled &lt;1300&amp;nbsp;Hz) and {{IPA|/u/}} (spoken freq 790&amp;nbsp;Hz, Whistled &lt;&lt;1300&amp;nbsp;Hz). In whistling the frequency basement must be raised to the minimum whistle harmonic of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz reducing frequency spacing in the vowels, which increases misidentification in the lower vowels.

===Consonants===
Consonants in Silbo Gomero are modifications of the vowel-based “melody line” or “vocal line”. They may be rising or falling or can also be modified by being broken, continuous or occlusive. The four main consonants in the now largely debunked and disproven 1978 analysis were wrongly listed as follows:&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

{| border="2" class="wikitable"
|+ Consonants

|-

| {{IPA|/g/, /b/, /m/, /j/ and /h/}}
|-
| broken low pitch
| {{angbr|k}}
| {{IPA|/k/ and /p/}}
|}
The documentation on the official Silbo Gomero page on the UNESCO website is in line with Trujillo’s 1978 study. Trujillo (1978) suggested that the consonants are either rises or dips in the "melody line" which can be broken or continuous.
Further investigation by Meyer and by Rialland suggest that vowels are stripped to their inherent class of sound which is communicated in the whistle in these ways: voice ({{IPA|/k/}} vs {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) is transmitted by the whistled feature [-[[continuant|continuity]]]. A silent pause in the whistle communicates [+[[voice (phonetics)|voice]]] ({{IPA|/ɡ/}}), while a [+continuous] consonant gives the quality [-voice] ({{IPA|/k/}}). Placement of the consonant ([[dental consonant|dental]], [[palatal consonant|palatal]], [[fricative]]) is transmitted in whistle by the loci, the sharpness or speed, of the formant transitions between vowels. Consonant classes are simplified into four classes. Extra high loci (near vertical formant loci) denotes [[affricates]] and stridents, rising loci denotes [[alveolar]], medial (loci just above the vowel formant) denotes [[palatal]], and falling (low loci) denotes [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]], [[Labial consonant|labial]], and [[fricative]]. This gives 8 whistled consonants, but including tone gradual decay (with intensity falling off) as a feature on continuous and interrupted sounds gives 10 consonants. In these situations gradual decay is given [+voice], and continuous is given [+[[liquid consonant|liquid]]].&lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Annie" /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;chart requested?&lt;/sub&gt;

The representation of /s/ is actually treated as a broken high pitch when whistled in Silbo. However, in the spoken language, /s/ is a continuous high pitch consonant. There are two reasons for this anomaly. Firstly, in functional terms, the /s/ consonant is high in frequency, thus being extremely useful. Secondly, as the continuous high-pitched consonant of Silbo already represents many other consonants of the spoken language (/l/, /ʎ/, /n/, /ɲ/, /ɾ/, /r/, /d/ and /ʝ/), it would be very confusing to add on to the extensive list. Thus, as the broken high-pitched consonant does not fully represent /t͡ʃ/ and /t/, it can be used to represent the frequently used /s/ consonant.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

===Cognitive features===
Studies have shown that Silbo Gomero speakers process the whistled register in the same way as the standard spoken language. Studies carried out by Manuel Carreiras of the [[University of La Laguna]] and David Corina of the [[University of Washington]] published research on Silbo in 2004 and 2005. Their study involved two participant groups of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers. One group of Spanish speakers “spoke” Silbo, while the other group did not. Results obtained from monitoring the participants' brain activity by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] have shown that while non-speakers of Silbo merely processed Silbo as whistling, speakers of Silbo processed the whistling sounds in the same linguistic centers of the brain that processed Spanish sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carreiras M, Lopez J, Rivero F, Corina D | title=Linguistic perception: neural processing of a whistled language | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=433 | issue=7021 | year=2005 | pages=31–32 | pmid=15635400 | doi=10.1038/433031a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
Film maker and photographer Francesca Phillips wrote and directed a [[documentary]] on the usage of Silbo Gomero in La Gomera titled “Written in the Wind” (2009) and this 26min film won Best Short Documentary in [[Anthropology]] at The World Mountain Documentary Festival held in [[Qinghai]], [[China]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.francescaphillips.com/film/written-in-the-wind/|title=The Francesca Phillips Written in the Wind|publisher=Francesca Phillips|date=2010|accessdate=15 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020163558/http://www.francescaphillips.com/film/written-in-the-wind/|archivedate=20 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French singer Féloche dedicated a song to this traditional singing called Silbo.

There are other examples of transposition of an oral natural language into a pitch string. When quickly spoken, [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] vowels are [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilated]] and consonants [[elision|elided]], so the linguistic information is carried by the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] system, which can therefore be transposed into [[talking drum]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4783">'''Telecom Transformation ('''or '''IP Transformation''') is the evolution of the telecommunications industry from a capital-intensive, technology-focused model to a user-centric service-delivery model. The reasons for this transformation vary in different parts of the world, but some concerns are common to most [[Telecom Service Provider]]s. Drivers for transformation include threats such as competitive pressures and the disruptive business models of players in other technologies affect the traditional business of the service providers. (''E.g. As this page is written, the traditional voice-service business of [[PSTN]] Service Providers are facing threats from the disruptive business models of [[Internet]] based service providers such as [[Google]] and [[Skype]] when they already were battling to fend off new competitors such as [[Multi-Service operator]]s.'')

In order to maintain their market, the service providers are introducing new attractive services to the end-users, which require modifications to their current infrastructure (aka ''legacy'' infrastructure) into what is typically termed as a ''Next-Generation'' infrastructure. The process of converting or modifying the network elements, end-user services and business-processes of the service provider to achieve the competitive advantages offered by the newer technologies is known as ''Transformation''. This transformation is enabled by Internet Protocol (IP)-based technology. The introduction of the new infrastructure, services and business-processes may or may not be accompanied by the dismantling of the legacy setup.

In cases where service providers are looking to reduce operating expenses in addition to creating new end-user services, elimination of the legacy network becomes a requirement. In these transformation scenarios, carriers replace aging legacy network elements and systems in favor of more efficient technologies. These types of transformation programs may require carriers to transition subscribers and commercial services from the legacy to the new networks.

== Transformation Sub-processes ==
The telecom transformation process is a combination of the following three sub-processes.
* Telecom Network Transformation
* End-user Service Transformation
* IT Systems Transformation

While these are the three main categories of network and systems change within the carrier environment, there are additional fundamental changes that service providers will undertake to adapt their business and organization to a new operating model.

== Telecom Network Transformation ==
The Network Transformation sub-process refers to the activities adding new elements in the [[Core Network]], [[Backbone  network]] and [[Access network]]. The typical activities include the following:
* Network planning and design
* Equipment/vendor selection 
* Verification of equipment through lab-demos, simulations and interoperability testing
* Devising and using network configuration data transfer mechanisms &amp; tools
* Migration planning and implementation
* Network Deployment
* Cut-over plans along with fall-back/roll-back plans

== End-user Services Transformation ==
This sub-process is aimed at ensuring that the services offered in the legacy network and availed by the end-users continue to be available during the transition phase and up to a planned future. This sub-process is also concerned with introduction of new end-user services into the next-generation network. Typical activities include:
* Identifying mechanisms to ''glue'' legacy services to the new network
* Designing and developing network abstraction layers for implementing new service applications
* Developing proof-of-concept to validate new services in labs
* Developing and executing migration services to transition subscribers from legacy to the new network

== IT Systems Transformation ==
This refers to the sub-process that is involved in aligning the [[Operations Support System]] and [[Business Support System]] infrastructure with the transformed network. The typical set of activities that characterize this sub-process include:
* Streamlining Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing processes
* Rationalizing existing applications to merge, consolidate or retire systems
* Designing and implementing end-to-end solution

'''Teochew''' ({{cjkv|c=潮州話 or 潮汕話|p=Cháozhōuhuà or Cháoshànhuà}}, '''Chaozhou''' dialect: Diê⁵ziu¹ uê⁷; [[Shantou dialect]]: Dio⁵ziu¹ uê⁷) is a [[Southern Min]] dialect spoken mainly by the [[Teochew people]] in the [[Chaoshan]] region of eastern [[Guangdong]] and by their diaspora around the world. It is sometimes referred to as ''Chiuchow'', its [[Cantonese]] name, due to the strong influence of that language over the traditionally Teochew-speaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/39085.htm baike.baidu.com/view/39085.htm] Accessed 2015-06-01&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[Hokkien]], as it shares some cognates and have a highly similar phonology with it though limited mutual intelligibility exists in terms of pronunciation and vocabulary between them.

Teochew preserves many [[Old Chinese]] pronunciations and vocabulary that have been lost in some of the other modern [[varieties of Chinese]]. As such, many linguists{{Who|date=July 2011}} consider Teochew one of the most conservative Chinese dialects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o-Fiq1Ct4OIC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=chaozhou+most+conservative+chinese+dialect&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=46i04sDbEs&amp;sig=FnAJ_uvFIi-R0e4NDORH4g4wK3g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIqu_J04nMAhUKqh4KHYnuBkIQ6AEIWzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=chaozhou%20most%20conservative%20chinese%20dialect&amp;f=false Nominalization in Asian Languages: Diachronic and typological perspectives, p. 11], Yap, FoongHa; Grunow-Hårsta, Karen; Wrona, Janick  (ed.) John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Teochew is a variety the [[Southern Min]], which in turn constitutes a part of [[Min Chinese]], one of the seven major language groups of [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese]]. As with other [[varieties of Chinese]], it is not [[mutually intelligible]] with Mandarin, Cantonese, Shanghainese and other Chinese varieties. However, it has limited intelligibility with the Hokkien dialects, such as those of [[Amoy dialect | Amoy]], [[Quanzhou dialect|Quanzhou]], [[Zhangzhou dialect| Zhangzhou]] and [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]]. Even within the Teochew dialects, there is substantial variation in [[phonology]] between different regions of Chaoshan and between different Teochew communities overseas.

The Chaoshan dialects in China be roughly divided into three sub-groups defined by physically proximate areas:

# Chaozhou sub-group (Standard Teochew)({{lang|zh-Hant|潮州片}}): including [[Chaozhou]], [[Shantou]], [[Jieyang]], [[Chenghai]], [[Nan'ao County]] and [[Raoping]];
# Chaopu sub-group ({{lang|zh-Hant|潮普片}}): including [[Chaoyang, Liaoning|Chaoyang]], [[Puning]] and [[Huilai]];
# Hailufeng sub-group ({{lang|zh-Hant|海陸豐片}}): including [[Shanwei]], [[Lufeng, Shanwei|Lufeng]] and [[Haifeng]]

==History and geography==
[[Image:Kelenteng Tua Pek Kong.JPG|thumb|A Teochew Cek temple in [[Ketapang (Kalimantan)|Ketapang, West Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]] on the island of [[Borneo]]]]
The Chaoshan region, which includes the twin cities of [[Chaozhou]] and [[Shantou]], is where the standard variant of Teochew (Chaoshan dialact) is spoken. Parts of the [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka-speaking]] regions of [[Jiexi County]], [[Dabu County]] and [[Fengshun]], also contain pocket communities of Teochew speakers.

As Chaoshan was one of the major sources of Chinese emigration to [[Southeast Asia]] during the 18th to 20th centuries, a considerable [[Overseas Chinese]] community in that region is Teochew-speaking. In particular, the Teochew people settled in significant numbers in [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], where they form the largest Chinese sub-language group. Teochew-speakers form a minority among Chinese communities in [[Vietnam]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] (especially in the states of [[Johor]] and [[Selangor]]) and [[Indonesia]] (especially in [[West Kalimantan]] on [[Borneo]]). Waves of migration from Chaoshan to [[Hong Kong]], especially after the communist victory of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, has also resulted in the formation of a community there, although most descendants now primarily speak Cantonese and English.

Teochew speakers are also found among overseas Chinese communities in [[Japan]] and the Western world (notably in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Italy]]), a result of both direct emigration from Chaoshan to these nations and secondary emigration from Southeast Asia.

In Singapore, Teochew remains the ancestral language of many [[Chinese Singaporean]]s, with the Teochews making up second largest Chinese group in Singapore, after the [[Hoklo (ethnic group)|Hokkiens]]. Despite this many Teochew, particularly the younger generations are [[language shift|shifting]] towards [[Singaporean English|English]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] as their main spoken language. This is due to the Singapore government's stringent bilingual policy that promotes English as the official language of education, government and commerce and [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|promotes Mandarin]] at the expense of other Chinese varieties. Some Teochews assimilated with the larger Hokkien community and speak [[Singaporean Hokkien|Hokkien]] rather than Teochew due to Hokkien's prominent role as a lingua franca  previously among the Singaporean Chinese community and the similarities between the two varieties. 

In Thailand, particularly in the Bangkok, Teochew is still spoken among older ethnic Chinese Thai citizens; however, the younger generation tends to learn Standard Mandarin and/or Standard Cantonese as a second or third language after [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[English language|English]].

Teochew was never widely spoken among Chinese communities in Japan and South Korea, since most of the Teochew people who migrated to these countries are secondary immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Most of them are second-generation people from Hong Kong and Taiwan who speak Cantonese, Hokkien and Mandarin, as well as Korean and Japanese, leaving Teochew to be spoken mostly by elders.

==Relationship with Hokkien==
Teochew is a variety of [[Southern Min]] and is one of the more well known [[Min Chinese]] varieties, together with [[Hokkien]], which is spoken in southern Fujian, and the and Fuzhou dialect, a dialect of [[Eastern Min]], spoken in Fujian's capital, Fuzhou.  It has high phonetic similarity to Hokkien but has low lexical similarity. Although Teochew shares some cognates with Hokkien, there are pronounced differences in most vowels with some consonant and tone shifts. Some of its vocabulary and phrases are distinct from Hokkien.

Most Teochew do not speak Hokkien and the majority see themselves as a distinct group, but due to their similarity most can [[mutual intelligibility|understand]] Hokkien to a degree and may treat it as a variation of their own tongue. There are a minority of Teochew who speak Hokkien as their mother tongue, most of whom have close contact or relatives in neighbouring southern Fujian. These Hokkien speaking Teochew people are more likely to treat Teochew simply as accented form of Hokkien. These people usually have a strong sense of Hokkien identity and due to cultural similarities, easily integrate into Hokkien culture. 

==Languages in contact==
This refers to Chaozhou, the variant of Southern Min (Min Nan) spoken in China.

===Mandarin===
Chaozhou children are introduced to Standard Chinese as early as in kindergarten; however, Chaozhou remains the primary medium of instruction. In the early years of primary education, Mandarin becomes the sole language of instruction, although students typically continue to talk to one another in Chaozhou. Mandarin is widely understood, however minimally, by most younger Chaozhou speakers, but the elderly usually do not speak Mandarin since teaching was done in the local vernacular in the past.

====Chaozhou accent in Mandarin====
{{Original research|date=January 2009}}
Native Chaozhou speakers find the neutral tone in Mandarin hardest to master. Chaozhou has lost the [[alveolar nasal]] ending {{IPA|[-n]}} and so the people often replace the sound in Mandarin with the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[-ŋ]}}. None of the southern Min dialects have a [[front rounded vowel]], therefore a typical Chaozhou accent supplants the unrounded counterpart {{IPA|[i]}} for {{IPA|[y]}}. Chaozhou, like its ancient ancestor, lacks labio-dentals; people therefore substitute {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[hu]}} for {{IPA|[f]}} when they speak Mandarin. Chaozhou does not have any of the retroflex consonants in the northern dialects, so they pronounce {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{IPA|[tsʰ]}}, {{IPA|[s]}}, and {{IPA|[z]}} instead of {{IPA|[tʂ]}}, {{IPA|[tʂʰ]}}, {{IPA|[ʂ]}} and {{IPA|[ʐ]}}.{{OR|date=June 2015}}

===Hakka===
Since Chao'an, Raoping and Jieyang border the Hakka-speaking region in the north, some people in these regions speak Hakka, though they can usually speak Chaozhou as well. Chaozhou people have historically had a great deal of contact with the Hakka people, but Hakka has had little, if any, influence on Chaozhou. Similarly, in Dabu and Fengshun, where the Chaozhou- and Hakka-speaking regions meet, Chaozhou is also spoken although Hakka remains the primary form of Chinese spoken there.

===Cantonese===
Because of the strong influence of Hong Kong soap operas, Guangdong provincial television programs and [[Cantopop|Cantonese pop songs]], many young [[Chaoshan]] peoples can understand quite a lot of Cantonese even if they cannot speak it in certain degrees of fluency.

===Other languages===
In the mountainous area of Fenghuang ({{zh|t=鳳凰山|s=凤凰山|labels=no}}), the [[She language]], an endangered [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien language]], is spoken by the [[She people]], who are an [[List of ethnic groups in China#Nationalities|officially recognised non-Han ethnic minority]]. They predominantly speak Hakka and Teochew; only about 1,000 She still speak their eponymous language.

==Phonetics and phonology==

===Consonants===
Teochew, like other Southern Min varieties, is one of the few modern Sinitic languages which have [[Phonation#Voicing|voiced]] [[obstruent]]s (stops, fricatives and affricates); however, unlike [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] and [[Xiang Chinese]], the Teochew voiced [[Stop consonant|stops]] and [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] did not evolve from [[Middle Chinese]] voiced obstruents, but from [[nasal consonant|nasals]]. The voiced stops {{IPA|[b]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and also {{IPA|[l]}} are voicelessly [[prenasalized consonant|prenasalised]] {{IPA|[ᵐ̥b]}}, {{IPA|[ᵑ̊ɡ]}}, {{IPA|[ⁿ̥ɺ]}}, respectively. They are in complementary distribution with the tenuis stops {{IPA|[p t k]}}, occurring before nasal vowels and nasal codas, whereas the tenuis stops occur before oral vowels and stop codas. The voiced affricate {{IPA link|dz}}, initial in such words as 字 (dzi˩), 二 (dzi˧˥), 然 (dziaŋ˥), 若 (dziak˦) loses its affricate property with some younger speakers abroad, and is relaxed to [z].

Southern Min dialects and varieties are typified by a lack of [[labiodental consonant|labiodentals]], as illustrated below:

=== Syllable ===

[[Syllable]]s in Teochew contain an onset consonant, a medial glide, a nucleus, usually in the form of a [[vowel]], but can also be occupied by a [[syllabic consonant]] like [ŋ], and a final [[consonant]]. All the elements of the syllable except for the nucleus are optional, which means a vowel or a syllabic consonant alone can stand as a fully-fledged syllable.

==== Onsets ====

All the consonants except for the glottal stop ʔ shown in the consonants chart above can act as the onset of a syllable; however, the onset position is not obligatorily occupied.

==== Finals ====
Teochew finals consist maximally of a medial, nucleus and coda. The medial can be i or u, the nucleus can be a monophthong or diphthong, and the coda can be a nasal or a stop. A syllable must consist minimally of a vowel nucleus or syllabic nasal.

===Tones===

====Citation tones====

Teochew, like other Chinese varieties, is a [[tonal language]]. It has six&lt;!--it has 8 聲, but only 6 tones. A final consonant does not count as a "tone" in English-language linguistics; 'tone' and '聲' are not synonymous.--&gt; [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] (reduced to two in stopped syllables) and extensive [[tone sandhi]].

As with sandhi in other Min Nan dialects, the checked tones interchange. The ''yang'' tones all become low. Sandhi is not accounted for in the description below.

==Grammar==
{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}
The [[grammar]] of Teochew is similar to other [[Min Chinese|Min languages]], as well as some southern [[varieties of Chinese]], especially with [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] and [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. The sequence '[[subject–verb–object]]' is typical, like [[Standard Mandarin]], although the '[[subject–object–verb]]' form is also possible using particles.

=== Morphology ===

==== Pronouns ====

===== Personal pronouns =====

The personal pronouns in Teochew, like in other Chinese varieties, do not show case marking, therefore {{lang|zh-Hant|我}} {{IPA|[ua]}} means both ''I'' and ''me'' and {{lang|zh-Hant|伊人}} {{IPA|[iŋ]}} means ''they'' and ''them''. The southern Min dialects, like some northern dialects, have a distinction between an [[clusivity|inclusive]] and [[clusivity|exclusive]] we, meaning that when the addressee is being included, the inclusive pronoun {{lang|zh-Hant|俺}} {{IPA|[naŋ]}} would be used, otherwise {{lang|zh-Hant|阮}} {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. No other southern Chinese variety has this distinction.

===== Possessive pronouns =====

Teochew does not distinguish the possessive pronouns from the possessive adjectives. As a general rule, the possessive pronouns or adjectives are formed by adding the [[genitive]] or possessive marker {{lang|zh-Hant|個}} [kai5] to their respective personal pronouns, as summarised below:

Note: (T): Traditional characters; (S): Simplified characters.

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding {{lang|zh-Hant|第}} {{IPA|[tõĩ˧˥]}} in front of a cardinal number.

===== Voice =====

In Teochew passive construction, the [[agent (grammar)|agent]] [[phrase]] ''by somebody'' always has to be present, and is introduced by either {{lang|zh-Hant|乞}} {{IPA|[kʰoiʔ˦]}} (some speakers use {{IPA|[kʰəʔ]}} or {{IPA|[kʰiəʔ]}} instead) or {{lang|zh-Hant|分}} {{IPA|[puŋ˧]}}, even though it is in fact a zero or indefinite agent as in:

: {{lang|zh-Hant|伊'''分人'''刣掉。}}
:: {{IPA|[i˧ '''puŋ˧''' '''naŋ˥''' tʰai˥ tiou˩]}}
:: ''S/he was killed (by someone).''

While in Mandarin one can have the agent introducer {{zh|t=被|p=bèi|labels=no}} or {{zh|t=給|p=gěi|labels=no}} alone without the agent itself, it is '''not''' grammatical to say

: ''*'' {{lang|zh-Hant|個杯'''分'''敲掉。}}
:: {{IPA|[kai˥ pue˧ puŋ˧ kʰa˧ tiou˩]}}
:: ''The cup was broken.''
:: cf. Mandarin {{zh|t=杯子給打破了|p=bēizi gěi dǎ pòle|labels=no}})

Instead, we have to say:

: {{lang|zh-Hant|個杯分人敲掉。}}
:: {{IPA|[kai˥ pue˧ puŋ˧ naŋ˥ kʰa˧ tiou˩]}}
:: ''The cup was broken.''

Even though this {{lang|zh-Hant|人}} {{IPA|[naŋ˥]}} is unknown.

Note also that the agent phrase {{lang|zh-Hant|分人}} {{IPA|[puŋ˧ naŋ˥]}} always comes '''immediately''' after the subject, not at the end of the sentence or between the [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] and the past [[participle]] like in some European languages (e.g. [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]])

==== Comparison ====

=====Comparative construction with two or more nouns =====

Teochew uses the construction "X ADJ {{lang|zh-Hant|過}} {{IPA|[kue˨˩˧]}} Y", which is believed to have evolved from the [[Old Chinese]] "X ADJ {{lang|zh-Hant|于}} (yú) Y" structure{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} to express the idea of comparison:

: {{lang|zh-Hant|伊雅過汝。}}
:: {{IPA|[i˧ ŋia˥˨ kue˨˩˧ lɨ˥˨]}}
:: ''She is more beautiful than you.''

Cantonese uses the same construction:

: {{lang|zh-Hant|佢靚過你。}}
:: ''Keoi5 leng3 gwo3 nei5.''
:: ''She is more beautiful than you.''

However, due to modern influences from Mandarin, the Mandarin structure "X {{lang|zh-Hant|比}} Y ADJ" has also gained popularity over the years. Therefore, the same sentence can be re-structured and becomes:

: {{lang|zh-Hant|伊比汝雅。}}
:: {{IPA|[i˩ pi˥˨ lɨ˥˨ ŋia˥˨]}}
:: ''She is more beautiful than you.''
:: cf. Mandarin {{zh|t=她比你漂亮|p=tā bǐ nǐ piàoliang|labels=no}}

=====Comparative construction with only one noun =====

It must be noted that the {{lang|zh-Hant|過}}- or {{lang|zh-Hant|比}}-construction must involve two or more nouns to be compared; an ill-formed sentence will be yielded when only one is being mentioned:

: ''*'' {{lang|zh-Hant|伊雅過}} (?)

Teochew is different from English, where the second noun being compared can be left out ("Tatyana is more beautiful ''(than Lisa)''". In cases like this, the {{lang|zh-Hant|夭}}-construction must be used instead:

: {{lang|zh-Hant|伊夭雅。}}
:: [i1 iou6 ŋia2]
:: ''She is more beautiful.''

The same holds true for Mandarin and Cantonese in that another structure needs to be used when only one of the nouns being compared is mentioned. Note also that Teochew and Mandarin both use a pre-modifier (before the adjective) while Cantonese uses a post-modifier (after the adjective).
* Mandarin
: {{lang|zh-Hant|她'''比較'''漂亮}}
:: ''tā bǐjiào piàoliang''
* Cantonese
: {{lang|zh-Hant|佢靚'''啲'''}}
:: ''keoi5 leng3 di1''

There are two words which are intrinsically comparative in meaning, i.e. {{lang|zh-Hant|贏}} [ĩã5] "better" and {{lang|zh-Hant|輸}} [su1] "worse". They can be used alone or in conjunction with the {{lang|zh-Hant|過}}-structure:

: {{lang|zh-Hant|只領裙輸(過)許領。}}
:: [tsi2 nĩã2 kuŋ5 su1 kue3 hɨ2 nĩã2]
:: ''This skirt is not as good as that one.''

: {{lang|zh-Hant|我內個電腦贏伊個好多。}}
:: [ua2 lai6 kai7 tiaŋ6 nau2 ĩã5 i1 kai7 hoʔ2 tsoi7]
:: ''My computer (at home) is ''far'' better than his.''

Note the use of the adverbial {{lang|zh-Hant|好多}} [hoʔ2 tsoi7] at the end of the sentence to express a higher degree.

=====Equal construction =====

In Teochew, the idea of equality is expressed with the word {{lang|zh-Hant|平}} [pẽ5] or {{lang|zh-Hant|平樣}} [pẽ5 ĩõ7]:

: {{lang|zh-Hant|只本書佮許本平重。}}
:: [tsi2 puŋ2 tsɨ1 kaʔ4 hɨ2 puŋ2 pẽ5 taŋ6]
:: ''This book is as heavy as that one.''

: {{lang|zh-Hant|伊兩人平平樣。}}
:: [i1 no6 naŋ5 pẽ5 pẽ5 ĩõ7]
:: ''They are the same. (They look the same./They're as good as each other./They're as bad as each other.)''
:: Lit. The two people are the same same way.

=====Superlative construction =====

To express the superlative, Teochew uses the adverb {{lang|zh-Hant|上}} [siaŋ5] or {{lang|zh-Hant|上頂}} [siaŋ5 teŋ2]. However, it should be noted that {{lang|zh-Hant|上頂}} is usually used with a complimentary connotation.

: {{lang|zh-Hant|只間物上頂好食。}}
:: [tsi2 kõĩ1 mueʔ8 siaŋ5 teŋ2 ho2 tsiaʔ8]
:: ''This (restaurant) is (absolutely) the most delicious.''

: {{lang|zh-Hant|伊人對我上好。}}
:: [i1 naŋ5 tui3 ua2 siaŋ5 ho2]
:: ''They treat me best.''
:: Lit. The people treat me very well.

==Vocabulary==
The vocabulary of Teochew shares a lot of similarities with Cantonese because of their continuous contact with each other.{{ambiguous|date=June 2012}} Like Cantonese, Teochew has a great deal of [[syllable|monosyllabic]] words.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However, ever since the standardisation of [[Modern Standard Chinese]], Teochew has absorbed a lot of Putonghua vocabulary, which is predominantly polysyllabic. Also, Teochew varieties in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] have also borrowed extensively from [[Malay language|Malay]].

===Archaic vocabulary===
Teochew and other Southern Min varieties, such as [[Hokkien]], preserve a good deal of Old Chinese vocabulary,  such as {{linktext|目}} [mak] ''eye'' ({{zh|s=眼睛|p=yǎnjīng}}, Hokkien: 目 ''ba̍k''), {{linktext|灱}} [ta] ''dry'' ({{zh|s=乾|p=gān}}, Hokkien: 焦 ''ta''), and {{linktext|囥}} [kʰəŋ] ''hide'' (cf. {{zh|s=藏|p=cáng}}; Hokkien: 囥 ''khǹg'').

== Romanisation ==
{{mainarticle|Peng'im}}
Teochew was romanised by the Provincial Education Department of [[Guangdong]] in 1960 to aid linguistic studies and the publication of dictionaries, although [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] can also be used because Christian missionaries invented it for the transcription of varieties of Southern Min.

=== Initials ===
'''Initial''' consonants of Teochew, are represented in the Guangdong Romanization system as: B, BH, C, D, G, GH, H, K, L, M, N, NG, P, R, S, T, and Z.

''Examples'':
* B {{IPA|[p]}} - bag (北 north)
* Bh {{IPA|[b]}}- bhê (馬 horse)
* C {{IPA|[tsʰ]}} - cên (青 green), cǔi (嘴 mouth), ciên (槍 gun)
* D {{IPA|[t]}} - diê (潮 tide)
* G {{IPA|[k]}} - giê (橋 bridge)
* GH {{IPA|[g]}} - gho (鵝 goose)
* H {{IPA|[h]}} - hung (雲 cloud)
* K {{IPA|[kʰ]}} - ke (去 to go)
* L {{IPA|[l]}} - lag (六 six)
* M {{IPA|[m]}} - mêng (明 bright)
* N {{IPA|[n]}} - nang (人 person)
* NG {{IPA|[ŋ]}} - ngou (五 five)
* P {{IPA|[pʰ]}} - peng (平 peace)
* R {{IPA|[(d)z]}} - riêg/ruah (熱 hot)
* S {{IPA|[s]}} - sên (生 to be born)
* T {{IPA|[tʰ]}} - tin (天 sky)
* Z {{IPA|[ts]}} - ziu (州 region/state)

'''Venezuelan Sign language''' or '''VSL''' (''Lengua de señas venezolana'' or ''LSV'') is the national [[deaf sign language]] of [[Venezuela]]. The term, "Venezuelan Sign Language," began to be used in the 1930s. It is widely used, and Venezuela has a national bilingual education program for VSL and Spanish, though the language used by adults differs from that of the classroom. There is a large VSL dictionary published by the ''Federación Venezolana de Sordos''. VSL has been used in schools since 1937.

==Origin==
The first known references to a Deaf community which used a sign language in Venezuela date from the 1930s. In 1935 the first school for children with hearing difficulties, the ''Instituto Venezolano de Ciegos y Sordomudos'' (Venezuelan Blind and Deaf Institute), was founded in [[Caracas]]. That school served as the cradle for a small community of signers, who created a sign language out of many signs which the children had used at home. A few years later the administration of the institute decided to separate the instruction of blind and deaf students and created the ''Escuela Taller de Sordomudos'' (Workshop School for the [[Prelingual deafness|Prelingually Deaf]]). This school hired hearing teachers trained in [[Spain]], who knew [[Spanish Sign language]]. The mingling of the system developed by the students and the language used by the teachers seems to be the origin of what is today VSL. 

In 1950, the first generation of alumni of the schools founded the ''Asociación de Sordomudos de Caracas'' (Deaf Association of Caracas), under the direction of José Arquero Urbano, an immigrant who had been a leader of the Deaf community in [[Madrid]]. The influence of the signs brought by Arquero further transformed VSL, according to recollections collected from people involved in that period of the Association. Because of this many Venezuelan Deaf people assume that Arquero was the creator of VSL.

==Legal status==
In 1999 after intensive lobbying by the Deaf associations of Venezuela, the [[1999 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela|constituent assembly]] included two references to LSV in the [[Constitution of Venezuela|current constitution of Venezuela]]. Article 81 recognizes the right of Deaf people to communicate through LSV and Article 101 establishes that Deaf people have the right to be informed in their language through public and private television.

LSV, nevertheless, retains a lower legal status than the language officially recognized by the constitution. Article 9 grants the status of an "[[official language]]" to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (throughout the nation) and to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] languages (in the ancestral territories). LSV does not receive such recognition. The constitution only recognizes the right to use LSV.

==LSV studies==
Studies on LSV indicate that the language has the same structural elements described in other sign languages, such as, the use of directional signs, the use of signs with [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], changes in the form of the sign to indicate [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], and a strong pragmatical dependence in defining [[argument]] roles. In addition, as a result of studies on the grammar of LSV, there has also been research into the [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]] and [[ethnolinguistics]] of the Deaf community in the country.

==Number of LSV users==

Included among the users of LSV are both the Deaf who use the language as their principal means of communication and hearing people who have a range of fluency in LSV.

The number of users is unknown. There are 1.2 million deaf in Venezuela, but most lost their hearing late in life. There were over 3000 deaf children in the national public school system in 2004, and around 9000 members of Deaf associations; with around 0.2% of children typically born deaf, there are an estimated congenitally 15,000 deaf people in Venezuela. However, it is not known how many of them speak VSL.
