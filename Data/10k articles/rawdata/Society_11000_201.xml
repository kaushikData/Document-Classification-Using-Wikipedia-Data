'''Alak''' is a language spoken by some 4,000 people in southern [[Laos]], especially in the Provinces of [[Salavan Province|Salavan]] and [[Sekong Province|Sekong]] (where the [[Alak people]] make up over a fifth of the population).  It is closely related to the language spoken by the [[Bahnar people|Bahnars]] of Vietnam. It includes two dialects, Alak proper and Harak.&lt;ref&gt;Theraphan L.

'''All About Us: Living and Growing''' is a British [[Sex and Relationships Education]] series for 5–13 year olds published by [[Channel 4]] on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]]. The series is often referred to by its short name of ''Living and Growing''. It covers the differences between a boy and a girl, [[Puberty]], how babies are made and how babies are born. The programmes were put into units 1, 2, 3 and 4.

In the first three units the programme includes gently introducing sex education to younger children, through puberty and birth, to media images, same-sex relationships and teenage pregnancy. The fourth unit covers puberty and body image in more detail with a focus on maintaining a healthy mind and body

Unit 1 - Age 5-7
Differences | How did I get here? | Growing up

Unit 2 - Age 7-9
Changes | How babies are made | How babies are born

Unit 3 - Age 9-11
Girl talk | Boy talk | Let's talk about sex

Unit 4 - Age 11-13
Puberty | Body image | Making the right choices

As of July 7, 2012, the DVDs were removed from the Channel 4 product catalogue as a result of the Government’s announcement that the PSHE curriculum is under review. The Alternative version, featuring the first three units, was released in 2013 as the review had not taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative version listing|url=https://shop.channel4learning.com/?page=shop&amp;pid=26651|website=Channel 4 Shop|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Alternative version Girl Talk and Boy Talk were moved to Unit 2 which now focuses mainly on puberty. How babies are made and How babies are born took their place in Unit 3 and the Let's talk about sex episode was dropped.

==Controversy==

The program has come under scrutiny by parents because of its graphic depictions of sexual intercourse and foreplay in Unit 2, in which, among other scenes, it "shows a naked cartoon couple pillow fighting before having sexual intercourse in several positions, as a narrator describes sex and its physical changes as "fun and very exciting".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kathleen (2011-07-08) [http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/graphic-sex-ed-program-for-kids-to-stay-in-compulsory-science-classes-uk-of Graphic sex-ed program for kids can stay in compulsory science classes: UK official], ''Lifesitenews.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Alternative version removed some of more explicit content concerns have still been expressed and it has been noted that the worksheets remain unchanged and the original DVDs were not recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative version review|url=https://www.spuc.org.uk/campaigns/safeatschool/livingandgrowingalternative|website=Society for the Protection of Unborn Children|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1957, the American Society of African Culture (AMSAC) was officially founded by five African American intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;The founders were political scientist and civil rights activist John A. Davis, historian and social scientist Horace Mann Bond (1904-1972), professor of French and future American ambassador Will Mercer Cook (1903-1987), philosopher William T. Fontaine (1909-1968) and James Ivy, editor of the NAACP's ''Crisis''.&lt;/ref&gt; During its heyday in the early 1960s, AMSAC had around four hundred members. One of the main goals of the organisation was to expose African Americans to their African heritage. This aim was pursued through organising exhibitions, lectures, music performances, and conferences in the United States (primarily New York) and Africa (occasionally). AMSAC sponsored a two-day [[festival]] in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] in December 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=African-American Cultural Exchange|journal=Ebony|date=March 1962|volume=17|issue=5|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1967, AMSAC's membership sharply declined after it was named as one of the organisations that was funded by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Cooke, ‘More Organisations Find They Are On CIA's Fund List, ''The Guardian'', 18 February 1967, p. 9; Neil Sheehan, ‘5 New Groups Tied To C.I.A.

The '''Apinajé''' (otherwise known as Apinayé, Afotigé, Aogé, Apinagé, Otogé, Oupinagee, Pinagé, Pinaré, Uhitische, Utinsche, and Western Timbira) are an [[indigenous people of Brazil]] called [[Gê peoples|Gê]], living in the state of [[Tocantins]], Eastern Central Brazil.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==History==
Before the 20th century, there used to be three main Apinajé groups known as the Rõrkojoire, the Cocojoire, and the Krĩjobreire, each with their own land and political division, which totaled more than half of the current territory.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cunha de Oliveria |first=Christiane |date=2005 |publisher=University of Oregon |title= The language of the Apinajé people of Central Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the three distinct Apinajé groups have been living together, though São José is controlled by the Krĩjobreire, and Mariazinha has Cocojoire leadership.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; During the first quarter of the nineteenth century the Apinajé had a successful economic growth fueled by extensive cattle farming and the extraction of babaù palm oil which brought an increase in migration. In the late 20th century, immigrants encroached on Apinajé lands. Their lands divided when highways such as the [[Belém-Brasilia Highway]] and the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]]. Part of their lands separated by the Trans-Amazonian Highway was taken from them and the tribe is working to regain it.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; The land rights of the Apinajé have been recognized by the federal government of Brazil in the 1988 Constitution.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt;

===Contact===
The Apinajé indigenous population has had contacts with the Jesuits, military bands and explorers, which is similar to the experiences of other indigenous groups. Between 1633 and 1658, the Jesuits journeyed up the Tocantins River in order to “[persuade] the Indians to ‘descend’ the river to the villages of Pará”.&lt;ref name="Povos"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/apinaye|title=History|author=Maria Elisa Ladeira and Gilberto Azanha|website=Povos Indígenas No Brasil|publisher=Instituto Socioambiental}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ushered in the potential of further encounters. On one of his expeditions, Captain-General D. Luiz Mascarenhas was confronted by “war-like” people, the Apinajé, in 1740.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Another confrontation between the Portuguese settlers and the Apinajé occurred in 1774 when Antônio Luiz Tavares Lisboa and his band of explorers were traveling by way of the Tocantins River.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; These early contacts did not greatly disrupt the lifestyle of the Apinajé people. It was not until the 19th century that the indigenous group would suffer from colonization. This was due to the shrinking of their territory and population reduction in the face of settlement establishment by the Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Da Matta (1982) believes that the Apinajé were saved from extinction mainly due to the fact that the area they were situated in did not have true economic value.&lt;ref name="Da Matta"/&gt;

===Conflict===
During the initial colonization period, the Apinajé had been recorded as being hostile to European expeditions. This prompted the construction of the military post of Alcobaça in 1780.&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt; However, it was soon abandoned due to the successful raids of the Apinajé. This only prompted further fortifications. In 1791 “another military post was founded on the Arapary river” and the same occurred in 1797 with the construction of the post of São João das Duas Barras.&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt; Regardless of previous conflicts, the Apinajé participated in the War for Independence of 1823 after sending “250 warriors to join the troops of José Dias de Mattos”.&lt;ref name="Da Matta"&gt;{{cite book |last=Da Matta |first=Roberto |date=1982 |publisher=Harvard University Press |title= A Divided World: Apinayé social structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent area of conflict was during the construction of the Trans-Amazon highway in 1985, which was supposed to be built over indigenous land. With the support of Krahô, Xerente, Xavante, and Kayapó warriors, the Apinajé had their lands recognized by the Brazilian state and the route of the highway was altered to avoid passing through this indigenous territory.&lt;ref name="Povos"/&gt;

===First Schools===
Schools existed in the area of the Apinajé as early as the early 19th century,&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; however it is unclear if their purpose was for the indigenous group or the general settler population. The first instructional materials for the Apinajé language were organized by the missionaries of the Summer Institute for Linguistics, in this particular case, Missionary Patricia Ham.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; Governmental support for indigenous schools was established as part of the 1988 Constitution.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The current school system of the Apinajé shows that children start to learn in their native language up to the 4th grade, when Portuguese is introduced.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; The schools are run by the Apinajé community, with some teaching staff that comprises non-indigenous instructors and assistants.&lt;ref name="Oliveira"/&gt; These schools further support the hypothesis that transmission rates are high; children are monolingual until they reach an age when they can start learning another language, leading to the majority of the population as being bilingual. It seems like the [[Apinayé language]] is still an important part of the culture of the group, and therefore has the ability to continue thriving.

==Economic development==
Apinajé woman farm subsistence gardens, while men fell trees and plant rice. Common crops include bananas, beans, broad beans, papayas, peanuts, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, watermelons, and yams. Apinajé families raise cattle, pigs, and chickens. Hunting and fishing supplement domestic foods. In the past, [[babaçu]] nuts were sold for cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/apinaje/65 "Apinayé: Productive Activities."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723173557/http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/apinaje/65 |date=July 23, 2011 }} ''Povos Indígenas no Brasil.'' (retrieved 25 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language Family==
The [[Jê]] family is the largest language family in the [[Macro-Jê]] stock. It contains eight languages, some of which have many dialects within them. The languages of this family are concentrated mostly in “the savanna regions of Brazil from the southern parts of the states of [[Pará]] and [[Maranhão]] south to [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]”.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Moore| first=Denny| title=Brazil: language situation| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of languages and linguistics 2| date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many other languages in the [[Macro-Jê]] stock have become extinct, because their East coast location meant for the first contact with Europeans, which, as written above, was violent and detrimental to many indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

==Language==
Apinajé people speak the [[Apinayé language]], a [[Macro-Jê language]]. It is spoken in thirteen villages by the majority of the tribe. Some Apinajé people also speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=apn "Apinayé."] ''Ethnologue.'' (retrieved 25 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
A descriptive grammar of this language exists, written by researcher Christiane Cunha de Oliveira in her dissertation “The Language of the Apinajé People of Central Brazil”. Oliveira provides an extensive description and analysis of the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Apinayé. Other linguists have also contributed to the descriptive grammar of the language, including Callow’s 1962 paper discussing word order; Burgess and Ham’s phonological analysis including topics like consonant to vowel ratio, tone, and inventories of the different sounds of the language; and Callow’s 1962 analysis of nominal categories and Ham et al.’s 1979 analysis of verbal categories.&lt;ref name="WALS Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_api|title=Language Apinayé|last=Dryer|first=Matthew S.|last2=Haspelmath|first2=Martin|website=WALS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedagogical grammars have been created for use in a bilingual classroom setting, with the intention of teaching both national culture and indigenous culture to young students.&lt;ref name="Sousa et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magalhães de Sousa|first=Rosineide |last2=Alves de Almeida|first2=Severina|last3=Mendonça Lyra|first3=Jairo Roberto|last4= Guimarães Sousa|first4= Jane |last5=Dos Santos|first5= Elizeu José|date=2017|title=Apinajé Intercultural Bilingual School: For an Education Beyond the Ethnic Frontier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sousa et al.’s “Apinajé Intercultural Bilingual School: For an Education Beyond the Ethnic Frontier” discusses this process in depth, and examines the value of having an Apinajé pedagogical grammar in the classroom. There is an intrinsic link between language and culture, and learning the Apinayé language helps children build a stronger connection with both their indigenous culture and the national culture of Brazil.&lt;ref name="Sousa et al."/&gt; It also is perhaps part of the reason that this language currently holds the status of “developing” on the EGID scale as mentioned above, as transmission of a language to children of the culture is vital to its survival.&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Twentieth edition|last=Lewis|first=Paul|last2=Simons|first2=Gary F.|last3=Fennig|first3=Charles D.|date=2017|publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation Projects===
In the Acknowledgements section of “The Language of the Apinajé People of Central Brazil”, Oliveira thanks the Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) for assistance with the documentation needed for the research. Therefore, the Apinayé language has been part of a small documentation project, to provide the research necessary for this dissertation and descriptive grammar. Otherwise, documentation projects for this language are unavailable.

===Ethnography===
The most recent ethnographic study done on the Apinajé people is from 2017, where the education system is analyzed (Sousa et al.). The most prominent ethnography of the Apinayé language and people is Oliveira’s thesis dissertation (2005). This was preceded by Da Matta’s work (1982) which explores Apinajé customs and traditions. Curt Niumendajú was a German anthropologist and ethnologist who wrote The Apinayé (1939). The book is based on the social structure of the indigenous group, though it also includes minimal information regarding the linguistic formation of the Apinayé language.

The '''Arabian''' or '''Arab horse''' ({{lang-ar|الحصان العربي}} {{IPA-ar| ħisˤaːn ʕarabiː|}}, [[DIN 31635|DMG]] ''ḥiṣān ʿarabī'') is a [[horse breed|breed]] of [[horse]] that originated on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. With a distinctive head shape and high tail carriage, the Arabian is one of the most easily recognizable horse breeds in the world. It is also one of the oldest breeds, with [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of horses in the [[Middle East]] that resemble modern Arabians dating back 4,500&amp;nbsp;years. Throughout history, Arabian horses have spread around the world by both war and trade, used to improve other breeds by adding speed, refinement, endurance, and strong bone. Today, Arabian bloodlines are found in almost every modern breed of riding horse.

The Arabian developed in a [[desert]] climate and was prized by the nomadic [[Bedouin]] people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. [[Selective breeding]] for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and [[war horse|war]]. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.

The Arabian is a versatile breed. Arabians dominate the discipline of [[endurance riding]], and compete today in many other fields of [[equestrianism|equestrian]] sport. They are one of the top ten most popular [[list of horse breeds|horse breeds]] in the world. They are now found worldwide, including the United States and Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, continental Europe, South America (especially Brazil), and their land of origin, the Middle East.

==Breed characteristics==
[[File:Gatsby.jpg|thumb|left|A purebred Arabian stallion, showing dished profile, arched neck, level croup and high-carried tail |alt=A light gray horse moving at a trot through an arena with all four feet off the ground. The tail is carried high and the neck is arched.]]
{{See also|Horse anatomy}}

Arabian horses have refined, wedge-shaped heads, a broad forehead, large eyes, large nostrils, and small muzzles. Most display a distinctive concave, or "dished" profile. Many Arabians also have a slight forehead bulge between their eyes, called the ''jibbah'' by the [[Bedouin]], that adds additional sinus capacity, believed to have helped the Arabian horse in its native dry desert climate.&lt;ref name="Upton21"&gt;Upton, ''Arabians'' pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer89&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 89–92&lt;/ref&gt; Another breed characteristic is an arched neck with a large, well-set windpipe set on a refined, clean [[Horse anatomy|throatlatch]]. This structure of the [[Horse anatomy|poll]] and throatlatch was called the ''mitbah'' or ''mitbeh'' by the Bedouin. In the ideal Arabian it is long, allowing flexibility in the [[bridle]] and room for the windpipe.&lt;ref name=Archer89/&gt;

Other distinctive features are a relatively long, level [[Rump (animal)|croup]], or top of the hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid bone and standard correct [[equine conformation]].&lt;ref name="USEF AR-102"/&gt; Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder.&lt;ref name=Parkinson157&gt;Edwards, Gladys Brown (January 1989). "How I Would 'Build' an Arabian Stallion". ''Arabian Horse World''. p. 542. ''Reprinted in'' Parkinson, pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as [[reining]], while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as [[endurance riding]] or [[horse racing]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofler, ''Flight Without Wings'', pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Most have a compact body with a short back.&lt;ref name=Archer89/&gt; Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good [[hoof]] walls. They are especially noted for their endurance,&lt;ref name=Athletes&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arabianhorses.org/home/faq/AskExpert6.asp |title= Arabians are beautiful, but are they good athletes? - The Versatile Arabian |accessdate= May 28, 2008 |author= Arabian Horse Association |work= AHA Website |publisher= Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612004529/http://www.arabianhorses.org/home/faq/AskExpert6.asp |archivedate= June 12, 2008 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GBE73p245&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', pp. 245–246&lt;/ref&gt; and the superiority of the breed in [[Endurance riding]] competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]]-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ahsa.asn.au/endurance.htm |title=Arabians In Endurance |accessdate=May 31, 2008 |author= Arabian Horse Society of Australia |work= AHSA Website |publisher=Arabian Horse Society of Australia |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430023657/http://ahsa.asn.au/endurance.htm |archivedate = April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skeletal analysis===
[[File:Arabian horse skeleton.jpg|thumb|Mounted skeleton of an Arabian horse, showing underlying structure of breed characteristics including short back, high-set tail, distinction between level croup and well-angulated hip. This specimen also has only 5 lumbar vertebrae. |alt=A defleshed skeleton of a horse put together in a standing position.]]
Some Arabians, though not all, have 5 [[lumbar]] [[vertebrae]] instead of the usual 6, and 17 pairs of [[rib]]s rather than 18.&lt;ref name=GBE73p27&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; A quality Arabian has both a relatively horizontal croup and a properly angled [[pelvis]] as well as good croup length and depth to the hip (determined by the length of the pelvis), that allows agility and impulsion.&lt;ref name=Parkinson157/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofler, ''Flight Without Wings'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A misconception confuses the topline of the croup with the angle of the "hip" (the pelvis or [[ilium (bone)|ilium]]), leading some to assert that Arabians have a flat pelvis angle and cannot use their hindquarters properly. However, the croup is formed by the [[sacrum|sacral]] vertebrae. The hip angle is determined by the attachment of the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] to the spine, the structure and length of the [[femur]], and other aspects of hindquarter anatomy, which is not correlated to the topline of the sacrum. Thus, the Arabian has [[equine conformation|conformation]] typical of other horse breeds built for speed and distance, such as the [[Thoroughbred]], where the angle of the ilium is more oblique than that of the croup.&lt;ref&gt;Typically the hip angle is about 35 degrees, while the croup is about 25 degrees&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edwards Anatomy chapter 6"&gt;Edwards, "Chapter 6: The Croup", ''Anatomy and Conformation of the Horse'', pp. 83–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parkinson121&gt;Edwards, Gladys Brown. "An Illustrated Guide to Arabian Horse Conformation." ''Arabian Horse World Quarterly'', Spring, 1998, p. 86. ''Reprinted in'' Parkinson, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the hip angle is not necessarily correlated to the topline of the croup. Horses bred to gallop need a good length of croup and good length of hip for proper attachment of muscles, and so unlike angle, length of hip and croup do go together as a rule.&lt;ref name="Edwards Anatomy chapter 6"/&gt;

===Size===
The breed standard stated by the [[United States Equestrian Federation]], describes Arabians as standing between {{hands|14.1|to|15.1}} tall, "with the occasional individual over or under."&lt;ref name="USEF AR-102"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usef.org/documents/ruleBook/2008/05-AR.pdf |title=Chapter AR: Arabian, Half-Arabian and Anglo-Arabian Division Rule Book, Rule AR-102 |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |author=United States Equestrian Federation |work=2008 Rule book |publisher=United States Equestrian Federation |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303212448/http://www.usef.org/documents/ruleBook/2008/05-AR.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all Arabians, regardless of height, are classified as "horses", even though {{hands|14.2}} is the traditional cutoff height between a [[horse]] and a [[pony]].&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, ''Types and Breeds of Farm Animals'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; A common myth is that Arabians are not strong because they are relatively small and refined. However, the Arabian horse is noted for a greater density of bone than other breeds, short [[horse anatomy|cannons]], sound feet, and a broad, short back,&lt;ref name=Archer89/&gt; all of which give the breed physical strength comparable to many taller animals.&lt;ref name=Ens96/&gt; Thus, even a smaller Arabian can carry a heavy rider. For tasks where the sheer weight of the horse matters, such as farm work done by a [[draft horse]],&lt;ref name=Ens84&gt;Ensminger, ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; any lighter-weight horse is at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name=Ens84/&gt; However, for most purposes, the Arabian is a strong and hardy light horse breed able to carry any type of rider in most [[equestrianism|equestrian]] pursuits.&lt;ref name=Ens96&gt;Ensminger, ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperament===
[[File:Trottingarabiancolttwo.jpg|thumb|upright|Arabians are noted for both intelligence and a spirited disposition |alt=A dark horse moving towards the camera with head held high and legs striding forward.]]

On the other hand, the Arabian is also classified as a "hot-blooded" breed, a category that includes other refined, spirited horses bred for speed, such as the [[Akhal-Teke]], the [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], and the [[Thoroughbred]]. Like other hot-bloods, Arabians' sensitivity and intelligence enable quick learning and greater communication with their riders; however, their intelligence also allows them to learn bad habits as quickly as good ones,&lt;ref&gt;Pavord, ''Handling and Understanding the Horse'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and they do not tolerate inept or abusive training practices.&lt;ref name=Rashid&gt;Rashid, ''A Good Horse Is Never a Bad Color'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim that it is more difficult to train a "hot-blooded" horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.horses-and-horse-information.com/articles/horses-hotbloods.shtml |title=Hot-blooded Horses: What are the hotblood breeds? | publisher= American Horse Rider &amp; Horses and Horse Information|at=(example of information claiming hot-blooded horses are hard to manage)|year=2007|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most Arabians have a natural tendency to cooperate with humans, when treated badly, like any horse, they can become excessively nervous or anxious, but seldom become vicious unless seriously spoiled or subjected to extreme abuse.&lt;ref name=Rashid/&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, romantic myths are sometimes told about Arabian horses that give them near-divine characteristics.&lt;ref name=GBE73p28&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colors===
{{Main|Equine coat color|Equine coat color genetics}}
The Arabian Horse Association registers [[purebred]] horses with the coat colors [[bay (horse)|bay]], [[gray (horse)|gray]], [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], [[black (horse)|black]], and [[roan (horse)|roan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianhorses.org/registration/Markings/Index.asp |title=How Do I...

Black skin provided protection from the intense desert sun.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, ''The Arabian Horse'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LaMirage body07.jpg|thumb|left|A gray Arabian; note white hair coat but black skin|alt=A horse with a white hair coat and dark skin showing around the nose, eyes and genitalia.]]

====Gray and white====
Although many Arabians appear to have a "white" hair coat, they are not genetically "white". This color is usually created by the natural action of the [[gray (horse)|gray]] [[gene]], and virtually all white-looking Arabians are actually grays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianhorses.org/registration/Markings/Color.asp |title=What Color Is My Horse? |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |author=Arabian Horse Association |work=Purebred Registration |publisher=Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514145158/http://www.arabianhorses.org/registration/markings/Color.asp |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A specialized colorization seen in some older gray Arabians is the so-called "bloody-shoulder", which is a particular type of [[Gray (horse)#The "flea-bitten" gray|"flea-bitten" gray]] with localized aggregations of pigment on the shoulder.&lt;ref name=LegUp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabianhorses.org/youth/docs/LegUp_Eval.pdf |title=Leg Up |publisher=Arabian Horse Association |format=PDF |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917132119/http://arabianhorses.org/youth/docs/LegUp_Eval.pdf |archivedate=September 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UptonWeb33&gt;{{cite book |author=Upton, Peter |title=The Classic Arabian |publisher=Arab Horse Society |page=33|year=1987|oclc=21241803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a very few Arabians registered as "white" having a white coat, pink skin and dark eyes from birth. These animals are believed to manifest a new form of [[dominant white]], a result of a [[nonsense mutation]] in DNA tracing to a single stallion foaled in 1996.&lt;ref name=haase2007&gt;{{cite journal |title=Allelic Heterogeneity at the Equine KIT Locus in Dominant White (W) Horses |year=2007 |vauthors=Haase B, Brooks SA, Schlumbaum A, Azor PJ, Bailey E |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=3|issue=11|pages= e195| doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030195 |pmid=17997609 |pmc=2065884|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This horse was originally thought to be a sabino, but actually was found to have a new form of dominant white mutation, now labeled W3.&lt;ref name=haase2007/&gt; It is possible that white mutations have occurred in Arabians in the past or that mutations other than W3 exist but have not been verified by genetic testing.&lt;ref name=Patterns/&gt;

====Sabino====
{{Main|Sabino horse}}
One spotting pattern, [[sabino horse|sabino]], does exist in purebred Arabians. Sabino coloring is characterized by white [[horse markings|markings]] such as "high white" above the knees and [[hock (zoology)|hocks]], irregular spotting on the legs, belly and face, white markings that extend beyond the eyes or under the chin and jaw, and sometimes lacy or roaned edges.&lt;ref name=Sabino1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php |title= Horse Coat Color Tests |accessdate=January 11, 2008 |author= UC Davis |work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher=University of California - Davis| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080117184933/http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php| archivedate= January 17, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genetic mechanism that produces sabino patterning in Arabians is undetermined, and more than one gene may be involved.&lt;ref name=Patterns/&gt; Studies at the [[University of California, Davis]] indicate that Arabians do not appear to carry the [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominant gene]] "SB1" or ''sabino 1'', that often produces bold spotting and some completely [[white (horse)|white]] horses in other breeds. The inheritance patterns observed in sabino-like Arabians also do not follow the same mode of inheritance as ''sabino 1''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalgenetics.us/Sabino1.htm |title=Sabino 1 |publisher = Animal Genetics Incorporated |accessdate=August 30, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091010182106/http://www.animalgenetics.us/Sabino1.htm| archivedate= October 10, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php |title= Introduction to Coat Color Genetics |accessdate=January 11, 2008 |author= UC Davis |work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher=University of California - Davis| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080120014506/http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php| archivedate= January 20, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rabicano or roan?====
{{Main|Rabicano}}
There are very few Arabians registered as [[roan (horse)|roan]], and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of [[rabicano]] genetics.&lt;ref name=Spon69/&gt; Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored.&lt;ref name=Spon69/&gt; Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently lighten with age, while a gray does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.horse-genetics.com/roan-horses.html |title= Roan Horses |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |author= Horse Genetics |work= The Horse Genetics Web Site |publisher=Horse Genetics| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195905/http://www.horse-genetics.com/roan-horses.html| archivedate= May 11, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCDavisColorGenetics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php |publisher=University of California Davis Veterinary Genetics Lab |title= Introduction to Coat Color Genetics|accessdate=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colors that do not exist in purebreds====
Purebred Arabians never carry [[dilution gene]]s.&lt;ref name=Color98&gt;Beaver, ''Horse color'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, purebreds cannot be colors such as [[dun gene|dun]], [[cream gene|cremello]], [[palomino]] or [[buckskin (color)|buckskin]].&lt;ref name=Gower30&gt;Gower, ''Horse Color Explained'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in [[Ancient Egypt]] suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity.&lt;ref name=GBE73p5&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[purebred]] Arabians today do not carry genes for [[pinto horse|pinto]] or [[Leopard complex]] ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for [[sabino horse|sabino]].
[[File:National Show Horse.jpg|thumb|A [[tobiano]] patterned [[National Show Horse]], a type of partbred Arabian|alt=A horse with brown and white spots being ridden by a woman in a dark suit at a horse show]] Spotting or excess white was believed by many breeders to be a mark of impurity until [[DNA]] testing for verification of parentage became standard.

To produce horses with some Arabian characteristics but coat colors not found in purebreds, they have to be [[crossbred]] with other breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ahsa.asn.au/pdfs/DerivativeStandard.pdf |title= The Arabian Derivative Horse |accessdate= June 30, 2008 |author= Arabian Horse Society of Australia |work= Derivative Standard 2004 |publisher= Arabian Horse Society of Australia |format= PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080722072522/http://www.ahsa.asn.au/pdfs/DerivativeStandard.pdf |archivedate= July 22, 2008 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the purebred Arabian produces a limited range of potential colors, they do not appear to carry any color-based lethal disorders such as the [[overo|frame overo]] gene ("O") that can produce [[lethal white syndrome]] (LWS). Because purebred Arabians cannot produce LWS [[foal]]s, Arabian mares were used as a non-affected population in some of the studies seeking the gene that caused the condition in other breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.com/breed/lethalwhites01.html |author=Walker, Dawn |title=Lethal Whites: A Light at the End of the Tunnel |work=Paint Horse Journal |date=February 1997 |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212025916/http://www.apha.com/breed/lethalwhites01.html |archivedate=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, partbred Arabian offspring can, in some cases, carry these genes if the non-Arabian parent was a carrier.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, "xc overo/lethal white", ''Compendium'', pp. 945–950&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic disorders===
There are six known genetic disorders in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia of the affected animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three are thought to be [[autosomal]] [[dominance relationship|recessive]] conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not sex-linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance.&lt;ref name="Caution"&gt;Goodwin-Campiglio, ''et al.'' "Caution and Knowledge", pp. 100–105&lt;/ref&gt; Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other [[list of horse breeds|breeds]], including the [[American Quarter Horse]], [[American Paint Horse]], [[American Saddlebred]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Miniature horse]], and [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]].&lt;ref name="Caution"/&gt;

Genetic diseases that can occur in purebred Arabians, or in partbreds with Arabian ancestry in both parents, are the following:
* [[Severe combined immunodeficiency (non-human)|Severe Combined Immunodeficiency]] (SCID). Recessive disorder, fatal when [[homozygous]], carriers ([[heterozygous|heterozygotes]]) show no signs. Similar to the "[[Severe combined immunodeficiency|bubble boy]]" condition in humans, an affected foal is born with a complete lack of an immune system, and thus generally dies of an opportunistic infection, usually before the age of three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uky.edu/Ag/Horsemap/hgpdiseases.html| title=Applications of Genome Study - Simple Hereditary Diseases| publisher=Horse Genome Project|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[DNA test]] that can detect healthy horses who are carriers of the gene causing SCID, thus testing and careful, planned matings can now eliminate the possibility of an affected [[foal]] ever being born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vetgen.com/equine-scid-service.html |title= SCID |accessdate=May 29, 2008 |author=VetGen |work= List of Services |publisher=VetGen| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080524034741/http://www.vetgen.com/equine-scid-service.html| archivedate= May 24, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lavender Foal Syndrome]] (LFS), also called Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, carriers show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals are born with a coat color dilution that lightens the tips of the coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arabians-international.com/LFS.html |title= Lavender Foal Syndrome Fact Sheet |accessdate=May 29, 2008 |author= Bird, Helen |work= James A Baker Institute for Animal Health |publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanelli"&gt;Fanelli, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2042-3292.2005.tb00386.x/abstract "Coat Color Dilution Lethal"], ''Equine Veterinary Education'', pp. 260–263&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.&lt;ref name="OPVGL"&gt;[http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=11671&amp;articleID=3268 "Bierman, A., 4 November 2009, Lavender Foal Syndrome - Genetic test developed in South Africa"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001110023/http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=11671&amp;articleID=3268 |date=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cerebellar abiotrophy]] (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, homozygous horses are affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, but at some stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related to the death of the [[purkinje cell]]s in the [[cerebellum]]. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=12746&amp;nID=17&amp;src=RA | author= Johnson, Robert S.|title=Test Allows Arabian Breeders to Scan for Inherited Neurologic Disorder|work= The Horse online edition |publisher=Blood-Horse Publications|date=September 23, 2008|accessdate= October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after [[euthanasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/genomic/cerebellar/ |title= Cerebellar Abiotrophy |accessdate=May 29, 2008|author= UC Davis |work= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher=University of California - Davis| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080620012443/http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/genomic/cerebellar/| archivedate= June 20, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Occipital Atlanto-Axial Malformation (OAAM). This is a condition where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and at the base of the skull are fused or malformed. Symptoms range from mild incoordination to the paralysis of both front and rear legs. Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse, in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks. This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1&amp;nbsp;month of age, and a radiograph can diagnose the condition. There is no genetic test for OAAM, and the hereditary component of this condition is not well researched at present.&lt;ref name=OAAM&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3750063 |author=Watson, A.G|author2=Mayhew, I.G. |title=Familial congenital occipitoatlantoaxial malformation (OAAM) in the Arabian horse|journal=Spine|pages=334–339|date=May 1986|issue=4|doi=10.1097/00007632-198605000-00007|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Equine juvenile [[epilepsy]], or Juvenile Idiopathic Epilepsy, sometimes referred to as "benign" epilepsy, is not usually fatal. Foals appear normal between epileptic [[seizure]]s, and seizures usually stop occurring between 12 and 18&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="Fanelli"/&gt; Affected foals may show signs of epilepsy anywhere from two days to six months from birth.&lt;ref name="Aleman"&gt;Equus Staff, "Good news about recovery from foal epilepsy", ''Equus''&lt;/ref&gt; Seizures can be treated with traditional anti-seizure medications, which may reduce their severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&amp;A=2276 |title= Lavender Foal Syndrome |accessdate=November 24, 2006 |author=Judd, Bob |work= Texas Vet News |publisher=Veterinary Information Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the condition has been studied since 1985 at the [[University of California, Davis]], the genetic mode of inheritance is unclear, though the cases studied were all of one general bloodline group.&lt;ref name="Aleman"/&gt; Recent research updates suggest that a [[dominance relationship|dominant mode of inheritance]] is involved in transmission of this trait.&lt;ref name=Aleman2&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1939-1676.2006.tb00764.x | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120715377/abstract| author= Aleman, Monica |title= Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy in Egyptian Arabian foals: 22 cases (1988-2005) | pmid=17186863 |journal= Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine | volume=20 | issue=6 | page=1443| date=November–December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One researcher hypothesized that epilepsy may be linked in some fashion to Lavender Foal Syndrome due to the fact that it occurs in similar bloodlines and some horses have produced foals with both conditions.&lt;ref name="Fanelli"/&gt;
*Guttural Pouch Tympany (GPT) occurs in horses ranging from birth to 1 year of age and is more common in fillies than in colts.

==Legends==
[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros 003.jpg|thumb|An Arabian horse in the desert. [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], c. 1810|alt=An unfinished painting of a saddled gray horse in profile moving away from something as if frightened.]]
Arabian horses are the topic of many myths and legends. One origin story tells how [[Muhammad]] chose his foundation mares by a test of their courage and loyalty. While there are several variants on the tale, a common version states that after a long journey through the desert, Muhammad turned his herd of horses loose to race to an oasis for a desperately needed drink of water. Before the herd reached the water, Muhammad called for the horses to return to him. Only five mares responded. Because they faithfully returned to their master, though desperate with thirst, these mares became his favorites and were called ''[[Al Khamsa]],'' meaning, ''the five.'' These mares became the legendary founders of the five "strains" of the Arabian horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alkhamsa.org/site/legends.html |title= Al Khamsa The Five |accessdate=May 29, 2008 |author= Al Khamsa |work= History and Legends |publisher=Al Khamsa, Inc. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418081554/http://www.alkhamsa.org/site/legends.html |archivedate = April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer92&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Al Khamsa'' are generally considered fictional horses of legend,&lt;ref name="Upton12"&gt;Upton, ''Arabians,'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; some breeders today claim the modern Bedouin Arabian actually descended from these mares.&lt;ref&gt;Schofler, ''Flight Without Wings'', pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Another origin tale claims that King [[Solomon]] was given a pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the [[Queen of Sheba]].&lt;ref name="Upton12"/&gt; A different version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib ("Gift to the Rider"), to the Banu [[Azd]] people when they came to pay tribute to the king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.&lt;ref name="Chamberlin"&gt;Chamberlin, ''Horse'', pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another creation myth puts the origin of the Arabian in the time of [[Ishmael]], the son of [[Abraham]].&lt;ref name=Archer2&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In this story, the Angel [[Gabriel|Jibril]] (also known as [[Gabriel]]) descended from Heaven and awakened Ishmael with a "wind-spout" that whirled toward him. The Angel then commanded the thundercloud to stop scattering dust and rain, and so it gathered itself into a prancing, handsome creature - a horse - that seemed to swallow up the ground. Hence, the Bedouins bestowed the title "Drinker of the Wind" to the first Arabian horse.&lt;ref&gt;Raswan, ''The Raswan Index and Handbook for Arabian Breeders'', Section: "The Kuhaylat", p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a [[Bedouin]] story states that [[Allah]] created the Arabian horse from the south wind&lt;!-- new source only says south -- storing other version "from the four winds; spirit from the North, strength from the South, speed from the East, and intelligence from the West"--&gt; and exclaimed, "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I establish thee as one of the Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://naturalhorseplanet.com/features/the-arabian.html |title= The Arabian: a treasure of nature to be preserved |accessdate= December 8, 2011 |author= Beck, Andy |work= Natural Horse Planet |publisher= Planet Equitopia SARL |at= credited as Ancient Bedouin Legend per "Byford, et al.

Condense." Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a ''kamayt''-colored animal (a [[bay (horse)|bay]] or burnt [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]]) and said: "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation."&lt;ref&gt;Sumi, ''Description in Classical Arabic Poetry'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Arabians are one of the oldest human-developed horse breeds in the world.&lt;ref name=GBE73p28/&gt; The [[progenitor]] stock, the [[Oriental horse|Oriental subtype]] or "Proto-Arabian" was believed to be a horse with ''oriental'' characteristics similar to the modern Arabian. Horses with these features appeared in rock paintings and inscriptions in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] dating back 3500 years.&lt;ref name=SaudiEmbassy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/MagSpring97/horse.htm |title=Preserving the Arabian Horse in its Ancestral Land |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |author=Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia |work=Spring 2007 Publication |publisher=Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804104227/http://www.saudiembassy.net/Publications/MagSpring97/horse.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient history]] throughout the [[Ancient Near East]], horses with refined heads and high-carried tails were depicted in artwork, particularly that of [[Ancient Egypt]] in the 16th century BC.&lt;ref name="GBE73p2"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars of the Arabian horse once theorized that the Arabian came from a separate subspecies of horse,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; known as ''equus caballus pumpelli''.&lt;ref name="Bennett4ff"/&gt; Other scholars, including Gladys Brown Edwards, a noted Arabian researcher, believe that the "dry" oriental horses of the desert, from which the modern Arabian developed, were more likely ''[[Equus ferus caballus]]'' with specific [[landrace]] characteristics based on the environments in which they lived, rather than being a separate subspecies.&lt;ref name="GBE73p27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett4ff"/&gt; Horses with similar, though not identical, physical characteristics include the [[Marwari horse]] of India, the [[Barb (horse)|Barb]] of North Africa, the [[Akhal-Teke]] of western Asia and the now-extinct [[Turkoman Horse]].&lt;ref name="Bennett4ff"/&gt; Recent genetic studies of [[mtDNA|mitochondrial DNA]] in Arabian horses of Polish and American breeding suggest that the modern breed has heterogeneous origins with ten [[haplogroups]].  The modern concept of breed purity in the modern population cannot be traced beyond 200 years.&lt;ref name="Głażewska"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Głażewska|first1=Iwona|title=Speculations on the origin of the Arabian horse breed|journal=Livestock Science|date=1 April 2010|volume=129|issue=1–3|pages=49–55 |doi=10.1016/j.livsci.2009.12.009 |language=English|issn=1871-1413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different theories about where the ancestors of the Arabian originally lived. Most evidence suggests the proto-Arabian came from the area along the northern edge of the [[Fertile Crescent]].&lt;ref name="Bennett4ff"&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors,'' pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis suggests the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula, in modern-day [[Yemen]], where three now-dry riverbeds indicate good natural pastures existed long ago, perhaps as far back as the [[Ice Age]].&lt;ref name="GBE73p6"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', pp.6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMH&gt;

The proto-Arabian horse may have been [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] by the people of the [[Arabian peninsula]] known today as the [[Bedouin]], some time after they learned to use the [[camel]], approximately 4,000–5,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, [http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1999/5/camelservicesurvival.cfm "Camels: Of Service and Survival"], ''Zoogoer''&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that this development occurred in the [[Nejd]] plateau in central Arabia.&lt;ref name=SaudiEmbassy/&gt; Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of [[Islam]], theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the [[Persian people|Persians]] to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.frankhopkins.com/mustangsA.html |title= Introduction - Part 2: The Origin and Relationships of the Mustang, Barb, and Arabian Horse |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |author= Bennett, Deb |work= The Spanish Mustang |publisher=The Horse of the Americas Registry |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080506052940/http://www.frankhopkins.com/mustangsA.html |archivedate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE.&lt;ref name=HarriganP/&gt;

Regardless of origin, climate and culture ultimately created the Arabian. The desert environment required a domesticated horse to cooperate with humans to survive; humans were the only providers of food and water in certain areas, and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive (most horses can only live about 72&amp;nbsp;hours without water). Where there was no pasture or water, the Bedouin fed their horses [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] and camel's milk.&lt;ref name="GBE73p24"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food, and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night. Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool, and the animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare.&lt;ref name=Archer3&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bedouin way of life depended on camels and horses: Arabians were bred to be [[horses in warfare|war horses]] with speed, endurance, soundness, and intelligence.&lt;ref name=Archer3/&gt;&lt;ref name="Expert4"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arabianhorses.org/home/faq/AskExpert4.asp |title= Arabian Type, Color and Conformation |accessdate= May 28, 2008 |author= Arabian Horse Association |work= FAQ |publisher= Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612161108/http://www.arabianhorses.org/home/faq/AskExpert4.asp |archivedate= June 12, 2008 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many raids required stealth, mares were preferred over stallions as they were quieter, and therefore would not give away the position of the fighters.&lt;ref name=Archer3/&gt; A good disposition was also critical; prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators.&lt;ref&gt;Schofler, [http://www.usef.org/pressbox/images/magazine/pdf/9f17eb24658b529f7516f2d820dceb3b.pdf "Daughters of the Desert"], ''Equestrian Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; Though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor, the Bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features.&lt;ref name="Expert4"/&gt;

===Strains and pedigrees===
For centuries, the Bedouin tracked the ancestry of each horse through an [[oral tradition]]. Horses of the purest blood were known as ''Asil'' and crossbreeding with non-''Asil'' horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin did not believe in [[gelding]] male horses, and considered [[stallion (horse)|stallions]] too intractable to be good war horses, thus they kept very few [[colt (horse)|colts]], selling most, and culling those of poor quality.&lt;ref name="GBE73pp24–26"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', pp. 24–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the Bedouin developed several sub-types or ''strains'' of Arabian horse, each with unique characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alkhamsa.org/education/education/the-bedouin-horse.html|title=The Horse of the Bedouin|work=The Bedouin Horse|publisher=Al Khamsa Organization|accessdate=November 21, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119191913/http://alkhamsa.org/education/education/the-bedouin-horse.html|archivedate=November 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and traced through the maternal line only.&lt;ref name=Perfection104&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' pp. 104&amp;ndash;105&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Arabian Horse Association]], the five primary strains were known as the Keheilan, Seglawi, Abeyan, Hamdani and Hadban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_history_bedouin.asp |title=Horse of the Desert Bedouin |accessdate=April 25, 2006 |author=Arabian Horse Association |work=Arabian Horse History &amp; Heritage |publisher=Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422024720/http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_history_bedouin.asp |archivedate=April 22, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Raswan]], a promoter and writer about Arabian horses from the middle of the 20th century, held the belief that there were only three strains, Kehilan, Seglawi and Muniqi. Raswan felt that these strains represented body "types" of the breed, with the Kehilan being "masculine", the Seglawi being "feminine" and the Muniqi being "speedy".&lt;ref&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; There were also lesser strains, sub-strains, and regional variations in strain names.&lt;ref name=Forbis274&gt;Forbis ''Classic Arabian Horse'' pp. 274–289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alkhamsa.org/education/education/the-bedouin-horse/asil.html |title=The Bedouin Concept of Asil |work=The Bedouin Horse |publisher=Al Khamsa Organization |accessdate=November 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119192335/http://alkhamsa.org/education/education/the-bedouin-horse/asil.html |archivedate=November 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, many Arabian horses were not only ''Asil'', of pure blood, but also bred to be pure in strain, with crossbreeding between strains discouraged, though not forbidden, by some tribes. Purity of bloodline was very important to the Bedouin, and they also believed in [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], believing if a mare was ever bred to a stallion of "impure" blood, the mare herself and all future offspring would be "contaminated" by the stallion and hence no longer ''Asil.''&lt;ref name="GBE73p22"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

This complex web of bloodline and strain was an integral part of Bedouin culture; they not only knew the pedigrees and history of their best war mares in detail, but also carefully tracked the breeding of their camels, [[Saluki]] dogs, and their own family or tribal history.&lt;ref name="WAHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waho.org/History.html |title=Is Purity the Issue? |accessdate=March 12, 2015 |authors=World Arabian Horse Organization (WAHO) |work=WAHO Publication Number 21, January 1998 |publisher=World Arabian Horse Organization |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705105054/http://www.waho.org/Purityissue.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, written records began to be kept; the first written pedigrees in the Middle East that specifically used the term "Arabian" date to 1330 AD.&lt;ref name="Pyramid Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pyramidarabians.com/news/articles/arabianmystique.html |title=Egyptian Arabians: The Mystique Unfolded |accessdate=May 10, 2006 |author=Lewis, Barbara S. |work=Arabians |publisher=Pyramid Arabians |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508005004/http://www.pyramidarabians.com/news/articles/arabianmystique.html |archivedate=May 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As important as strain was to the Bedouin, modern studies of [[mitochondrial DNA]] suggest that Arabian horses alive today with records stating descent from a given strain may not actually share a common maternal ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Bowling, "A pedigree-based study of mitochondrial d-loop DNA sequence variation among Arabian horses", ''Animal Genetics'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic development==
[[File:Hittite Chariot.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hittites|Hittite]] chariot (drawing of an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] relief)|alt=A line drawing of a two-wheeled chariot drawn by two horses, with three men in the chariot. One of the men is holding a shield.]]

===Role in the ancient world===
Fiery [[war horse]]s with dished faces and high-carried tails were popular artistic subjects in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], often depicted pulling chariots in war or for hunting. Horses with oriental characteristics appear in later artwork as far north as that of [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Roman Empire]]. While this type of horse was not called an "Arabian" in the [[Ancient Near East]] until later, (the word "Arabia" or "Arabaya" first appeared in writing in [[Ancient Persia]], c. 500 BC)&lt;ref name="GBE73p16"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; these proto-Arabians shared many characteristics with the modern Arabian, including speed, endurance, and refinement. For example, a horse skeleton unearthed in the [[Sinai]] peninsula, dated to 1700 BC and probably brought by the [[Hyksos]] invaders, is considered the earliest physical evidence of the horse in [[Ancient Egypt]]. This horse had a wedge-shaped head, large eye sockets and small muzzle, all characteristics of the Arabian horse.&lt;ref name="Upton10"&gt;Upton, ''Arabians,'' p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Islamic history===
Following the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] in AD 622 (also sometimes spelled Hegira), the Arabian horse spread across the known world of the time, and became recognized as a distinct, named breed.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors,'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; It played a significant role in the [[History of the Middle East]] and of Islam. By 630, Muslim influence expanded across the Middle East and North Africa, by 711 [[Muslim conquests|Muslim warriors]] had reached Spain, and they controlled most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by 720. Their war horses were of various oriental types, including both Arabians and the [[Barb (horse)|Barb]] horse of North Africa.&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198602/the.arabian.horse-at.war.htm |title=The Arabian Horse: At War |publisher=Saudi Aramco World |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabian horses also spread to the rest of the world via the [[Ottoman Empire]], which rose in 1299. Though it never fully dominated the heart of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], this [[Turkish people|Turkish]] empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade, diplomacy and war.&lt;ref name=Greely26/&gt; The Ottomans encouraged formation of private [[stud farm]]s in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses,&lt;ref name=Derry106&gt;Derry, ''Horse and Society'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; and Ottoman nobles, such as [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] also collected pure, desert-bred Arabian horses.&lt;ref name=Greely26/&gt;

El Naseri, or [[Al-Nasir Muhammad]], [[Sultan of Egypt]] (1290–1342) imported and bred numerous Arabians in Egypt. A stud farm record was made of his purchases describing many of the horses as well as their abilities, and was deposited in his library, becoming a source for later study.&lt;ref name=Greely26&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer6&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Ottomans, Arabian horses were often sold, traded, or given as [[diplomatic gift]]s to Europeans and, later, to Americans.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;

===Egypt===
Historically, Egyptian breeders imported horses bred in the deserts of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Arabian peninsula]] as the source of their [[foundation bloodstock]].&lt;ref name="Wentworth178"&gt;Wentworth, ''The Authentic Arabian Horse'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that the [[Ottoman Empire]] dominated Egypt, the political elites of the region still recognized the need for quality bloodstock for both war and for [[horse racing]], and some continued to return to the deserts to obtain pure-blooded Arabians. One of the most famous was [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], also known as Muhammad Ali Pasha, who established an extensive stud farm in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="GBE73p268"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greely27&gt;Greely ''Arabian Exodus'' pp. 27–33&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, some of his stock was bred on by [[Abbas I of Egypt]], also known as Abbas Pasha. However, after Abbas Pasha was assassinated in 1854, his heir, El Hami Pasha, sold most of his horses, often for crossbreeding, and gave away many others as diplomatic gifts.&lt;ref name="GBE73p268"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greely27/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wentworth191"&gt;Wentworth, ''The Authentic Arabian Horse'', pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; A remnant of the herd was obtained by [[Ali Pasha Sherif]], who then went back to the desert to bring in new bloodstock. At its peak, the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif had over 400 purebred Arabians.&lt;ref name=Greely27/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jobbins, "Straight Down the Line", ''Al-Ahram Weekly Online''&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, an epidemic of [[African horse sickness]] in the 1870s that killed thousands of horses throughout Egypt decimated much of his herd, wiping out several irreplaceable bloodlines.&lt;ref name=Greely27/&gt; Late in his life, he sold several horses to Wilfred and [[Lady Anne Blunt]], who exported them to [[Crabbet Arabian Stud|Crabbet Park Stud]] in England. After his death, Lady Anne was also able to gather many remaining horses at her [[Sheykh Obeyd]] stud.&lt;ref name=Greely41&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carle Vernet Mameluck en Attaque.jpg|left|thumb|"Mameluck en Attaque" 18th-century painting by Carle Vernet|alt=A mounted man on a dark horse attacking a line of mounted men]]

Meanwhile, the passion brought by the Blunts to saving the pure horse of the desert helped Egyptian horse breeders to convince their government of the need to preserve the best of their own remaining pure Arabian bloodstock that descended from the horses collected over the previous century by Muhammad Ali Pasha, Abbas Pasha and Ali Pasha Sherif.&lt;ref name=EgyptianBloodlines&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_egyptian.asp |title=Egyptian Arabians |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |author=Lewis, Barbara |work=Arabian Horse - Bloodlines |publisher=Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706133604/http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_egyptian.asp |archivedate=July 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[Egypt]] formed the Royal Agricultural Society (RAS) in 1908,&lt;ref name=Greely137&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; which is known today as the Egyptian Agricultural Organization (EAO).&lt;ref name=Greely149&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;
RAS representatives traveled to England during the 1920s and purchased eighteen descendants of the original Blunt exports from [[Lady Wentworth]] at Crabbet Park, and returned these bloodlines to Egypt in order to restore bloodlines had been lost.&lt;ref name=Greely137/&gt; Other than several horses purchased by [[Henry Babson]] for importation to the United States in the 1930s,&lt;ref name=Greely139&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; and one other small group exported to the USA in 1947, relatively few Egyptian-bred Arabian horses were exported until the overthrow of [[King Farouk I]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=Derry123&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the private stud farms of the princes were then confiscated and the animals taken over by the EAO.&lt;ref name=Greely149/&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, as oil development brought more foreign investors to Egypt, some of whom were horse fanciers, Arabians were exported to Germany and to the United States, as well as to the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=AHARussian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;Carpenter ''Arabian Legends'' p. 102-111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--partial cite, need cross-check--&gt; Today, the designation "Straight Egyptian" or "Egyptian Arabian" is popular with some Arabian breeders, and the modern Egyptian-bred Arabian is an [[outcrossing|outcross]] used to add refinement in some breeding programs.&lt;ref name=EgyptianBloodlines/&gt;

==Arrival in Europe==
Probably the earliest horses with Arabian bloodlines to enter Europe came indirectly, through Spain and France.&lt;!--need to note if due to Muslim occupation of Spain--&gt; Others would have arrived with returning [[Crusades|Crusader]]s&lt;ref name=Greely26/&gt;—beginning in 1095, European armies invaded [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and many [[knight]]s returned home with Arabian horses as spoils of war. Later, as knights and the heavy, armored [[horses in warfare|war horse]]s who carried them became obsolete, Arabian horses and their descendants were used to develop faster, agile [[light cavalry]] horses that were used in warfare into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;

Another major infusion of Arabian horses into Europe occurred when the [[Ottoman Turks]] sent 300,000 horsemen into Hungary in 1522, many of whom were mounted on pure-blooded Arabians, captured during raids into Arabia. By 1529, the Ottomans reached [[Vienna]], where they were stopped by the Polish and Hungarian armies, who captured these horses from the defeated Ottoman [[cavalry]]. Some of these animals provided [[foundation bloodstock]] for the major studs of eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Harrigan"&gt;Harrigan, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/717/feature.htm "The Polish Quest For Arabian Horses"], ''Saudi Aramco World''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Derry107&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish and Russian breeding programs===
With the rise of light cavalry, the stamina and agility of horses with Arabian blood gave an enormous military advantage to any army who possessed them. As a result, many European monarchs began to support large breeding establishments that crossed Arabians on local stock, one example being [[Knyszyn]]a, the [[Stud farm#State stud farms|royal stud]] of Polish king [[Zygmunt II August]], and another the Imperial Russian Stud of [[Peter the Great]].&lt;ref name="Harrigan"/&gt;&lt;!--look for source on origin dates for Knyszyna, apparently founded in the 1560s--&gt;

European horse breeders also obtained Arabian stock directly from the desert or via trade with the Ottomans. In Russia, [[Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov|Count Alexey Orlov]] obtained many Arabians, including [[Smetanka]], an Arabian stallion who became a foundation sire of the [[Orlov trotter]].&lt;ref name="Russian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horses.ru/arabian/hist_main.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000530204151/http://www.horses.ru/arabian/hist_main.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 30, 2000 |title=History of the Russian Arabian |accessdate=May 9, 2006 |author=Troika |work=Russian Arabians |publisher=Mekka Consulting }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greely178&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Orlov then provided Arabian horses to [[Catherine the Great]], who in 1772 owned 12 pure Arabian stallions and 10 mares.&lt;ref name="Russian"/&gt; By 1889 two members of the Russian nobility, [[Count Stroganov]] and Prince [[Nikolai Borisovich Shcherbatov]], established Arabian [[stud farm]]s to meet the continued need to breed Arabians as a source of pure bloodstock.&lt;ref name=AHARussian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_russian.asp |title=Russian Arabians |accessdate=June 30, 2008 |author=Himes, Cheryl |work=Arabian Horse - Bloodlines |publisher=Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712200309/http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_russian.asp |archivedate=July 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russian"/&gt;

In Poland, notable imports from Arabia included those of Prince Hieronymous [[Sanguszko]] (1743–1812), who founded the Slawuta stud.&lt;ref name=Greely172&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perfection107/&gt; Poland's first state-run Arabian stud farm, [[Janów Podlaski]], was established by the decree of [[Alexander I of Russia]] in 1817,&lt;ref name=Janowhistory&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.janow.arabians.pl/en/history/stud.php |title= History of the Stud |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |author= Krzysztalowicz, Andrzej |work= Janów Podlaski Website |publisher=Janów Podlaski Stud.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1850, the great stud farms of Poland were well-established, including Antoniny, owned by the Polish Count [[Potocki]] (who had married into the Sanguszko family); later notable as the farm that produced the stallion [[Skowronek (horse)|Skowronek]].&lt;ref name=Perfection107&gt;Derry, ''Bred for Perfection'', pp. 107&amp;ndash;108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer56&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central and western Europe===
[[File:Eustachy Erazm Sanguszko.jpg|thumb|upright|Several noble families of Poland became major breeders of Arabian horses. [[Eustachy Erazm Sanguszko]], painted by [[Juliusz Kossak]].]]
The 18th century marked the establishment of most of the great Arabian studs of Europe, dedicated to preserving "pure" Arabian bloodstock. The [[Prussia]]ns set up a royal stud in 1732, originally intended to provide horses for the royal stables, and other studs were established to breed animals for other uses, including mounts for the Prussian army. The foundation of these breeding programs was the crossing of Arabians on native horses; by 1873 some English observers felt that the Prussian calvalry mounts were superior in endurance to those of the British, and credited Arabian bloodlines for this superiority.&lt;ref&gt;Derry, ''Horses in Society'', pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt;

Other state studs included the Babolna Stud of Hungary, set up in 1789,&lt;ref name=Greely162&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; and the Weil stud in Germany (now Weil-Marbach or the [[Marbach stud]]), founded in 1817 by King [[William I of Württemberg]].&lt;ref name=Greely155&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; King [[James I of England]] imported the first Arabian stallion, the [[Markham Arabian]], to England in 1616.&lt;ref name=Derry31&gt;Derry, ''Horses in Society'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Arabians were also introduced into European race horse breeding, especially in England via the [[Darley Arabian]], [[Byerly Turk]], and [[Godolphin Arabian]], the three foundation stallions of the modern [[Thoroughbred]] breed, who were each brought to England during the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Archer104&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 104–109&lt;/ref&gt; Other monarchs obtained Arabian horses, often as personal mounts. One of the most famous Arabian stallions in Europe was [[Marengo (horse)|Marengo]], the [[horses in warfare|war horse]] ridden by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name=NatArmyMuseum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/changingTheWorld/page2-1.shtml |title=Changing the World 1784–1904: Key Objects |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |work=National Army Museum Exhibitions: Changing the World 1784–1904 |publisher=National Army Museum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206035951/http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/changingTheWorld/page2-1.shtml |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-19th century, the need for Arabian blood to improve the breeding stock for light cavalry horses in Europe resulted in more excursions to the Middle East. [[Queen Isabel II]] of Spain sent representatives to the desert to purchase Arabian horses and by 1847 had established a stud book; her successor, [[King Alfonso XII]] imported additional bloodstock from other European nations. By 1893, the state military stud farm, [[Yeguada Militar]] was established in [[Córdoba, Spain]] for breeding both Arabian and [[Iberian horse]]s. The military remained heavily involved in the importation and breeding of Arabians in Spain well into the early 20th century, and the Yeguada Militar is still in existence today.&lt;ref name="Campiglio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_spanish.asp |title= Spanish Arabians |accessdate= October 2, 2007 |author= Campiglio, Elizabeth G. |work= Arabian Horse - Bloodlines |publisher= Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071114005302/http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_spanish.asp |archivedate= November 14, 2007 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also marked a phase of considerable travel to the [[Middle East]] by European civilians and minor nobility, and in the process, some travelers noticed that the Arabian horse as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare, [[inbreeding]] and other problems that were reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate.&lt;ref name="GBE73p23"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, the most farsighted began in earnest to collect the finest Arabian horses they could find in order to preserve the blood of the pure desert horse for future generations. The most famous example was [[Lady Anne Blunt]], the daughter of [[Ada Lovelace]] and granddaughter of [[Lord Byron]].&lt;ref name="Wentworth70"&gt;Wentworth, ''The Authentic Arabian Horse'', p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Crabbet Arabian Stud}}
Perhaps the most famous of all Arabian breeding operations founded in Europe was the [[Crabbet Arabian Stud|Crabbet Park Stud]] of England, founded 1878.&lt;ref name=Archer11&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 11–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_crabbet.asp |title=Crabbet Arabians |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |author=Arabian Horse Association |work=Arabian Horse - Bloodlines |publisher=Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612234105/http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_crabbet.asp |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1877, [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] and [[Lady Anne Blunt]] made repeated journeys to the Middle East, including visits to the stud of [[Ali Pasha Sherif]] in [[Egypt]] and to [[Bedouin]] tribes in the [[Najd|Nejd]], bringing the best Arabians they could find to England. Lady Anne also purchased and maintained the [[Sheykh Obeyd]] stud farm in [[Egypt]], near [[Cairo]]. Upon Lady Anne's death in 1917, the Blunts' daughter, [[Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth|Judith, Lady Wentworth]], inherited the Wentworth title and Lady Anne's portion of the estate, and obtained the remainder of the Crabbet Stud following a protracted legal battle with her father.&lt;ref name="Wentworth79"&gt;Wentworth, ''The Authentic Arabian Horse'', pp. 79–82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Exodus54&gt;Greely ''Arabian Exodus'' p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Wentworth expanded the stud, added new bloodstock, and exported Arabian horses worldwide. Upon her death in 1957, the stud passed to her manager, Cecil Covey, who ran Crabbet until 1971, when a motorway was cut through the property, forcing the sale of the land and dispersal of the horses.&lt;ref name=Archer201&gt;Archer ''et al.'', ''The Crabbet Arabian Stud: Its History and Influence'', pp. 201-202&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Crabbet, the [[Hanstead Stud]] of [[Annie Henrietta Yule|Lady Yule]] also produced horses of worldwide significance.&lt;ref name="Cadran2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cadranell|first=R.J.|title=Hanstead Horses |journal=Arabian Visions|date=March–April 1997|url=http://cmkarabians.com/2006/07/05/hanstead-horses/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th-century Europe===
In the early 20th century, the military was involved in the breeding of Arabian horses throughout Europe, particularly in Poland, Spain, Germany, and Russia; private breeders also developed a number of breeding programs.&lt;ref name=SchulzPoland&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schulz, Carol M. |title=Arabian Horse Breeding Around the World: Poland|journal=Arabian Visions |date=March–April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NeubauerGerm&gt;{{cite journal |author=Newbauer, Carol D. |title=Arabian Horse Breeding Around the World: Germany|journal=Arabian Visions |date=March–April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SchulzSpain&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schulz, Carol M. |title=Arabian Horse Breeding Around the World: Spain|journal=Arabian Visions |date=March–April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cadranell&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cadranell, R.J. |title=Arabian Horse Breeding Around the World: Russia|journal=Arabian Visions |date=March–April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant among the private [[horse breeding|breeders]] in continental Europe was Spain's Cristóbal Colón de Aguilera, XV [[Duchy of Veragua|Duque de Veragua]], a direct descendant of [[Christopher Columbus]], who founded the Veragua Stud in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Campiglio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greely198&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern warfare and its impact on European studs===
Between World War I, the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, many historic European stud farms were lost; in Poland, the Antoniny and Slawuta Studs were wiped out except for five mares.&lt;ref name=Greely176&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among the survivors was the Janów Podlaski Stud. The Russian Revolution, combined with the effects of World War I, destroyed most of the breeding programs in Russia, but by 1921, the Soviet government reestablished an Arabian program, the [[Tersk Stud]], on the site of the former Stroganov estate,&lt;ref name=AHARussian/&gt;&lt;ref name=AHARussian/&gt; which included &lt;!--French also-source?--&gt;Polish bloodstock as well as some importations from the Crabbet Stud in England.&lt;ref name=Greely182&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', pp. 182–184&lt;/ref&gt; The programs that survived the war re-established their breeding operations and some added to their studs with new imports of desert-bred Arabian horses from the Middle East. Not all European studs recovered. The Weil stud of Germany, founded by [[King Wilhelm I]], went into considerable decline; by the time the Weil herd was transferred to the [[Marbach stud|Marbach State Stud]] in 1932, only 17 purebred Arabians remained.&lt;ref name=Greely155/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.landwirtschaft-bw.info/servlet/PB/menu/1196171_l1/index1154079742120.html |title= History of the Stud |accessdate=October 2, 2007 |author= Cowell, Christine |work= Haupt- und Landgestüt Marbach website |publisher=Haupt- und Landgestüt Marbach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish Civil War]] and World War II also had a devastating impact on horse breeding throughout Europe. The Veragua stud was destroyed, and its records lost, with the only survivors being the broodmares and the younger horses, who were rescued by [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name=Greely199&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perfection143/&gt; [[Crabbet Arabian Stud|Crabbet Park]], [[Tersk Stud|Tersk]], and Janów Podlaski survived. Both the Soviet Union and the United States obtained valuable Arabian bloodlines as spoils of war, which they used to strengthen their breeding programs. The Soviets had taken steps to protect their breeding stock at [[Tersk Stud]], and by utilizing horses captured in Poland they were able to re-establish their breeding program soon after the end of World War II. The Americans brought Arabian horses captured in Europe to the United States, mostly to the Pomona [[U.S. Army Remount Service|U.S. Army Remount]] station, the former [[W. K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Center|W.K. Kellogg Ranch]] in California.&lt;ref name="Upton72"&gt;Upton, ''Arabians'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

In the postwar era, Poland,&lt;ref name=Perfection117&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' pp. 117&amp;ndash;118&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref name=Perfection143&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' pp. 143&amp;ndash;144&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany developed or re-established many well-respected Arabian stud farms.&lt;ref name=Perfection126&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' pp. 126&amp;ndash;127&lt;/ref&gt; The studs of Poland in particular were decimated by both the [[Nazi]]s and the Soviets, but were able to reclaim some of their breeding stock and became particularly world-renowned for their quality Arabian horses, tested rigorously by racing and other performance standards.&lt;ref name=Archer58&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 58–61&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs.&lt;ref name=Greely185&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the Cold War===
While only a few Arabians were exported from behind the [[Iron Curtain]] during the [[Cold War]], those who did come to the west caught the eye of breeders worldwide. Improved international relations between eastern Europe and the west led to major imports of Polish and Russian-bred Arabian horses to western Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=Derry120&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' pp. 120–126&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, greater political stability in Egypt, and the rise of the [[European Union]] all increased international trade in Arabian horses. Organizations such as the [[World Arabian Horse Association]] (WAHO) created consistent standards for transferring the registration of Arabian horses between different nations. Today, Arabian horses are traded all over the world.&lt;ref name=Derry139&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' pp. 139–155&lt;/ref&gt;

==In America==
The first horses on the American mainland since the end of the [[Ice Age]] arrived with the Spanish [[Conquistadors]]. [[Hernán Cortés]] brought 16 horses of [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]], [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], and Arabian ancestry to Mexico in 1519. Others followed, such as [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]], who brought 250 horses of similar breeding to America in 1540.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198602/the.arabian.horse-in.america.htm "The Arabian Horse in America"], ''Saudi Aramco World''&lt;/ref&gt; More horses followed with each new arrival of Conquistadors, [[missionary|missionaries]], and settlers. Many horses escaped or were stolen, becoming the foundation stock of the American [[Mustang (horse)|Mustang]].&lt;ref name=Forbis15&gt;Forbis ''Classic Arabian Horse'' p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patten24&gt;Patten ''Light Horse Breeds'' p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early imports===
Colonists from England also brought horses of Arabian breeding to the eastern seaboard. One example was Nathaniel Harrison, who imported a horse of Arabian, Barb and Turkish ancestry to America in 1747.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

One of [[George Washington]]'s primary mounts during the [[American Revolutionary War]] was a gray half-Arabian horse named [[Blueskin (horse)|Blueskin]], sired by the stallion "Ranger", also known as "Lindsay's Arabian", said to have been obtained from the Sultan of [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=Hur&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hur|first1=Ben|title=Washington’s Best Saddle Horse|url=http://cmkarabians.com/2006/07/05/washingtons-best-saddle-horse/|website=Western Horseman|accessdate=December 20, 2014|issue=Jan/Feb 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/faq/govern.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions: Military/Government |accessdate= November 21, 2006 |author= University of Virginia |work= The Papers of George Washington |publisher= University of Virginia |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061213152658/http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/project/faq/govern.html |archivedate= December 13, 2006 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Presidents are linked to ownership of Arabian horses; in 1840, President [[Martin Van Buren]] received two Arabians from the Sultan of [[Oman]],&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; and in 1877, President [[Ulysses S.

A. Keene Richard was the first American known to have specifically bred Arabian horses. He traveled to the desert in 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock, which he crossed on [[Thoroughbreds]], and also bred purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, his horses were lost during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and have no known purebred Arabian descendants today.&lt;ref name="GBE73p29"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Another major U.S. political figure, [[William H.

Leopard is the only stallion imported prior to 1888 who left known purebred descendants in America.&lt;ref name=Archer72&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 Randolph Huntington imported the desert-bred Arabian mare *Naomi, and bred her to Leopard, producing Leopard's only purebred Arabian son, Anazeh, who sired eight purebred Arabian foals, four of whom still appear in pedigrees today.&lt;ref name="GBE73p30"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of purebred breeding in America===
[[File:Syrian man with Arabian horse 1893.jpg|thumb|Exhibitor from [[Syria]] holding an Arabian horse at the Hamidie Society exhibition, [[World's Columbian Exposition]], 1893.|alt=A black-and-white photograph of a man holding an unsaddled light gray horse]]

In 1908, the Arabian Horse Registry of America was established, recording 71 animals,&lt;ref name="North America"/&gt; and by 1994, the number had reached half a million. Today there are more Arabians registered in North America than in the rest of the world put together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arabdatasource.com/FactDisplay.asp?id=4 |title= Country Stats |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |author= Arabian Horse Association |work= Arabian Horse Statistics |publisher=Arabian Horse Association| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080614061207/http://www.arabdatasource.com/FactDisplay.asp?id=4| archivedate= June 14, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the registry date to 1893, when the Hamidie Society sponsored an exhibit of Arabian horses from what today is [[Syria]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World Fair]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="North America"/&gt; This exhibition raised considerable interest in Arabian horses. Records are unclear if 40 or 45 horses were imported for the exposition, but seven died in a fire shortly after arrival. The 28 horses that remained at the end of the exhibition stayed in America and were sold at auction when the Hamidie Society went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="CraverAHW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ambararabians.davenporthorses.org/ambararabians.com//articles/WhiteCityI.shtml|title=Horses of the White City|last=Craver|first=Charles|last2=Craver, Jeanne|date=September 1989|work=Arabian Horse World|pages=178–191, 209–211|accessdate=February 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112150441/http://ambararabians.davenporthorses.org/ambararabians.com/articles/WhiteCityI.shtml|archivedate=January 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These horses caught the interest of American breeders,&lt;ref name="North America"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Derry137&gt;Derry, ''Horses in Society'', pp. 137–139&lt;/ref&gt; including Peter Bradley of the Hingham Stock Farm, who purchased some Hamidie horses at the auction, and [[Homer Davenport]], another admirer of the Hamidie imports.&lt;ref name="CraverAHW"/&gt;

Major Arabian importations to the United States included those of Davenport and Bradley, who teamed up to purchase several stallions and mares directly from the Bedouin in 1906.&lt;ref name=Derry137/&gt; Spencer Borden of the Interlachen Stud made several importations between 1898 and 1911;&lt;ref name="North America"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer73&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Robinson Brown|W.R. Brown]] of the Maynesboro Stud, interested in the Arabian as a cavalry mount, imported many Arabians over a period of years, starting in 1918.&lt;ref name="North America"/&gt; Another wave of imports came in the 1920s and 30s when breeders such as [[Will Keith Kellogg|W.K. Kellogg]], [[Henry Babson]], Roger Selby, James Draper, and others imported Arabian bloodstock from Crabbet Park Stud in England, as well as from Poland, Spain and Egypt.&lt;ref name="North America"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer74&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 73–76&lt;/ref&gt; The breeding of Arabians was fostered by the [[U. S. Army Remount Service]], which stood purebred stallions at public stud for a reduced rate.&lt;ref name=Derry236&gt;Derry, ''Horses in Society'', p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Arabians, mostly of Polish breeding, were captured from [[Nazi Germany]] and imported to the U.S.A. following World War II.&lt;ref name="GBE73p111"&gt;Edwards, ''The Arabian'', pp. 111–114&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, two deaths in England led to more sales to the United States: first from Crabbet Stud on the demise of Lady Wentworth,&lt;ref name=Greely79&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and then from Hanstead with the passing of Gladys Yule.&lt;ref name=Cadran2/&gt; As the tensions of the [[Cold War]] eased, more Arabians were imported to America from Poland and [[Egypt]], and in the late 1970s, as political issues surrounding import regulations and the recognition of stud books were resolved, many Arabian horses were imported from Spain and Russia.&lt;ref name="WAHO"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archer78&gt;Archer, ''Arabian Horse'', pp. 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Australia==
[[File:Hector.jpg|thumb|left|The Arabian stallion Hector, or "Old Hector" was an early import to Australia whose bloodlines are still found today in the [[pedigree chart|pedigree]]s of some Australian Thoroughbreds.|alt=Painting of a red colored horse with black mane and tail prancing]]

===Early imports===
Arabian horses were introduced to Australia in the earliest days of European Settlement. Early imports included both purebred Arabians and light Spanish "[[jennet]]s" from [[Andalusia]], many Arabians also came from India. Based on records describing stallions "of Arabic and Persian blood", the first Arabian horses were probably imported to Australia in several groups between 1788 and 1802.&lt;ref name="Upton74"&gt;Upton, ''Arabians,'' pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; About 1803, a merchant named Robert Campbell imported a bay Arabian stallion, Hector, from India;&lt;ref name="Upton74"/&gt; Hector was said to have been owned by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], who later became known as the [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref name=Barrie&gt;Barrie, ''The Australian Bloodhorse'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804 two additional Arabians, also from India, arrived in [[Tasmania]] one of whom, White William, sired the first purebred Arabian foal born in Australia, a stallion named Derwent.&lt;ref name="Upton74"/&gt;

Throughout the 19th century, many more Arabians came to Australia, though most were used to produce [[crossbred]] horses and left no recorded [[purebred]] descendants.&lt;ref name="Upton74"/&gt; The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt|Wilfred]] and [[Lady Anne Blunt]]'s [[Crabbet Arabian Stud]] in England.&lt;ref name=Greely121&gt;Greely, ''Arabian Exodus'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses and some of them became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for [[Thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]]s).&lt;ref name=Barrie/&gt; The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I.&lt;ref name=Greely121/&gt; They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the [[Australian Pony]], the [[Waler]] and the [[Australian Stock Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, [http://www.arabianlines.com/online_mag/apr2006/april%20edition%202006.htm "A Condensed History of the Arabian Horse Society of Australia"], ''Arabian Lines''&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 20th and 21st centuries===
In the early 20th century, more Arabian horses, mostly of Crabbet bloodlines, arrived in Australia. The first Arabians of Polish breeding arrived in 1966, and Egyptian lines were first imported in 1970. Arabian horses from the rest of the world followed, and today the Australian Arabian horse registry is the second largest in the world, next to that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ahsa.asn.au/member_statistics.htm |title= Member Statistics |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |author=Arabian Horse Society of Australia |work=Arabian Horse Society of Australia Web Site |publisher=Arabian Horse Society of Australia |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080522055242/http://www.ahsa.asn.au/member_statistics.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabian horses today are found all over the world. They are no longer classified by Bedouin strain, but are informally classified by the nation of origin of famed horses in a given pedigree. Popular types of Arabians are labeled "Polish", "Spanish", "Crabbet", "Russian", "Egyptian", and "Domestic" (describing horses whose ancestors were imported to the United States prior to 1944, including those from programs such as [[W.K. Kellogg|Kellogg]], [[Homer Davenport|Davenport]], [[William Robinson Brown|Maynesboro]], [[Henry Babson|Babson]], Dickenson and Selby). In the USA, a specific mixture of Crabbet, Maynesboro and Kellogg bloodlines has acquired the copyrighted designation "CMK."&lt;ref name="Bloodlines"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_overview.asp |title= Introduction |accessdate= May 29, 2008 |author= Arabian Horse Association |work= Arabian Horse Bloodlines |publisher= Arabian Horse Association |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612164127/http://www.arabianhorses.org/education/education_bloodlines_overview.asp |archivedate= June 12, 2008 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each set of bloodlines has its own devoted followers, with the virtues of each hotly debated. Most debates are between those who value the Arabian most for its refined beauty and those who value the horse for its stamina and athleticism; there are also a number of breeders who specialize in [[preservation breeding]] of various bloodlines. Controversies exist over the relative "purity" of certain animals; breeders argue about the genetic "purity" of various pedigrees, discussing whether some horses descend from "impure" animals that cannot be traced to the desert Bedouin.&lt;ref name=Perfection139&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' pp. 139&amp;ndash;155&lt;/ref&gt; The major factions are as follows:

*The Arabian Horse Association (AHA) states, "The origin of the purebred Arabian horse was the Arabian desert, and all Arabians ultimately trace their lineage to this source." In essence, all horses accepted for registration in the United States are deemed to be "purebred" Arabians by AHA.&lt;ref name="Bloodlines"/&gt;
*The [[World Arabian Horse Association]] (WAHO) has the broadest definition of a purebred Arabian. WAHO states, "A Purebred Arabian horse is one which appears in any purebred Arabian Stud Book or Register listed by WAHO as acceptable." By this definition, over 95% of the known purebred Arabian horses in the world are registered in stud books acceptable to WAHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waho.org/Definition.html |title=Arabian Horse Definition 2007 |accessdate=May 29, 2008 |author=World Arabian Horse Organization |work=WAHO Website |publisher=World Arabian Horse Organization |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509084911/http://www.waho.org/Definition.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WAHO also researched the purity question in general, and its findings are on its web site, describing both the research and the political issues surrounding Arabian horse bloodlines, particularly in America.&lt;ref name="WAHO"/&gt;
*At the other end of the spectrum, organizations focused on bloodlines that are the most meticulously documented to desert sources have the most restrictive definitions.

Today, people cross Arabians with other breeds to add refinement, endurance, agility and beauty.

There is intense debate over the role the Arabian played in the development of other light horse breeds. Before DNA-based research developed, one hypothesis, based on body types and conformation, suggested the light, "dry", [[oriental horse]] adapted to the desert climate had developed prior to domestication;&lt;ref name="Bennett7"&gt;Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt; DNA studies of multiple horse breeds now suggest that while domesticated horses arose from multiple mare lines, there is very little variability in the [[Y-chromosome]] between breeds.&lt;ref name="Lindgren2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lindgren | first = Gabriella | first2 = Niclas |last2=Backström |first3=June |last3=Swinburne |first4=Linda |last4=Hellborg |first5=Annika |last5=Einarsson |first6=Kaj |last6=Sandberg |first7=Gus |last7=Cothran |first8=Carles |last8=Vilà |first9=Matthew |last9=Binns |first10=Hans |last10=Ellegren | year =2004 |title = Limited number of patrilines in horse domestication | journal = [[Nature Genetics]] | volume = 36 |pages=335–336 | doi = 10.1038/ng1326 | pmid = 15034578 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[domestication of the horse]], due to the location of the Middle East as a crossroads of the ancient world, and relatively near the earliest locations of domestication,&lt;ref&gt;Matossian ''Shaping World History'' p. 43 See also: {{cite news |title=Horsey-aeology, Binary Black Holes, Tracking Red Tides, Fish Re-evolution, Walk Like a Man, Fact or Fiction |url=http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2009/03/07/horsey-aeology-binary-black-holes-tracking-red-tides-fish-re-evolution-walk-like-a-man-fact-or-ficti/|work=Quirks and Quarks Podcast with Bob Macdonald |publisher= [[CBC Radio]] |date=March 7, 2009|accessdate=September 19, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100915112430/http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2009/03/07/horsey-aeology-binary-black-holes-tracking-red-tides-fish-re-evolution-walk-like-a-man-fact-or-ficti/| archivedate= September 15, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; oriental horses spread throughout Europe and Asia both in ancient and modern times. There is little doubt that humans crossed "oriental" blood on that of other types to create light riding horses; the only actual questions are at what point the "oriental" prototype could be called an "Arabian", how much Arabian blood was mixed with local animals, and at what point in history.&lt;ref name=GBE73p16/&gt;&lt;ref name="wentworth177"&gt;Wentworth, ''The Authentic Arabian Horse'', pp. 177–182&lt;/ref&gt;

For some breeds, such as the [[Thoroughbred]], Arabian influence of specific animals is documented in written stud books.&lt;ref name=Derry155&gt;Derry ''Bred for Perfection'' p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; For older breeds, dating the influx of Arabian ancestry is more difficult. For example, while outside cultures, and the horses they brought with them, influenced the predecessor to the [[Iberian horse]] in both the time of [[Ancient Rome]] and again with the [[Islamic]] invasions of the 8th century, it is difficult to trace precise details of the journeys taken by waves of conquerors and their horses as they traveled from the Middle East to North Africa and across Gibraltar to southern Europe. [[Mitochondrial DNA]] studies of modern [[Andalusian horse]]s of the [[Iberian peninsula]] and [[Barb (horse)|Barb]] horses of North Africa present convincing evidence that both breeds crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and influenced one another.&lt;ref&gt;Royo, [http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/96/6/663 "The Origins of Iberian Horses Assessed via Mitochondrial DNA"], ''Journal of Heredity'', pp. 663–669&lt;/ref&gt; Though these studies did not compare Andalusian and Barb [[mtDNA]] to that of Arabian horses, there is evidence that horses resembling Arabians, whether before or after the breed was called an "Arabian", were part of this genetic mix. Arabians and Barbs, though probably related to one another, are quite different in appearance,&lt;ref name="Wentworth36"&gt;Wentworth, ''The Authentic Arabian Horse'', pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; and horses of both Arabian and Barb type were present in the [[Muslim]] armies that occupied Europe.&lt;ref name="Campiglio"/&gt; There is also historical documentation that Islamic invaders raised Arabian horses in Spain prior to the [[Reconquista]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557573/Spain |title= Spain |accessdate=January 8, 2007 |author= Encyclopædia Britannica |work= Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish also documented imports of Arabian horses in 1847, 1884 and 1885 that were used to improve existing Spanish stock and revive declining equine populations.&lt;ref name="Campiglio"/&gt;

==Uses==
Arabians are versatile horses that compete in many [[equestrianism|equestrian]] fields, including [[horse racing]], the [[horse show]] disciplines of [[saddle seat]], [[Western pleasure]], and [[hunt seat]], as well as [[dressage]], [[Cutting (sport)|cutting]], [[reining]], [[endurance riding]], [[show jumping]], [[eventing]], youth events such as [[equitation]], and others. They are used as [[pleasure riding]], [[trail riding]], and working [[ranch]] horses for those who are not interested in competition.&lt;ref name=Versatile&gt;

Arabians are involved in a wide variety of activities, including fairs, movies, parades, circuses and other places where horses are showcased. They have been popular in movies, dating back to the silent film era when [[Rudolph Valentino]] rode the Kellogg Arabian stallion Jadaan in 1926's ''[[Son of the Sheik]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Roeder, [http://www.csupomona.edu/~library/specialcollections/history/jadaan.html "Jadaan, The Sheik, and the Cereal Baron"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011143028/http://www.csupomona.edu/~library/specialcollections/history/jadaan.html |date=October 11, 2012 }}, ''The Cal Poly Scholar'', pp. 99–103&lt;/ref&gt; and have been seen in many other films, including ''[[The Black Stallion (film)|The Black Stallion]]'' featuring the stallion [[Cass Ole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theblackstallion.com/movie_n.html |title= The Movie - The Black Stallion (1979) |accessdate= June 30, 2008 |author= Kael, Pauline |work= Movies |publisher= The Black Stallion, Inc |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080702054414/http://www.theblackstallion.com/movie_n.html |archivedate= July 2, 2008 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Young Black Stallion]]'', which used over 40 Arabians during filming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theblackstallion.com/ybs_about_n.html |title= About the "Young Black Stallion" Movie |accessdate= June 30, 2008 |author= The Black Stallion, Inc |work= Movies |publisher= The Black Stallion, Inc |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704123724/http://www.theblackstallion.com/ybs_about_n.html |archivedate= July 4, 2008 |deadurl= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''[[Hidalgo (film)|Hidalgo]]''&lt;ref&gt;Francaviglia, et al., ''Lights, camera, history'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1959 version of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cyrino, ''Big Screen Rome'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabians are mascots for football teams, performing crowd-pleasing activities on the field and sidelines. One of the horses who serves as [[Traveler (mascot)|"Traveler"]], the mascot for the [[University of Southern California]] [[USC Trojans football|Trojans]], has been a purebred Arabian. "[[Thunder (mascot)|Thunder]]", a [[stage name]] for the purebred Arabian stallion J B Kobask, was mascot for the [[Denver Broncos]] from 1993 until his retirement in 2004, when the Arabian gelding Winter Solstyce took over as "Thunder II".&lt;ref&gt;Train, "Thundering Down the Field", ''Arabian Horse Magazine'', pp. 94–101&lt;/ref&gt; [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona|Cal Poly Pomona's]] [[W.K.

Arabians also are used on [[search and rescue]] teams and occasionally for police work. Some Arabians are used in [[polo]] in the USA and Europe, in the Turkish equestrian sport of Cirit ({{IPA-tr|dʒiˈɾit|pron}}), as well as in [[circus]]es, [[therapeutic horseback riding]] programs, and on [[guest ranch]]es.

The '''Association for Leaders Volunteer Engagement''' ('''AL!VE''') was created in 2007. It is a [[professional association]] for managers of [[volunteering|volunteers]]. It is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organization.

==History==

Following the demise of the [[Association for Volunteer Administration]] (AVA) in 2006, discussions were held during the [[Points of Light]] Conference in Seattle in June 2006 by former AVA members about what kind of new organization might serve the needs of people that work with and support volunteers. Various people at this meeting expressed interest in creating a new professional association, and created a group called the Congress of Volunteer Administration Associations (COVAA) to explore the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationofleadersinvolunteerengagement.org/docs/COVAA_Final_Report.pdf COVAA Final Report], published December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; COVAA launched a web site at www.covaa.org by August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.covaa.org/ |title=COVAA home page |accessdate=2016-08-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831005359/http://www.covaa.org/ |archivedate=2006-08-31 |df= }}, accessed June 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The COVAA organizers held an event in December 2006 in Denver. About 90 people attended, representing local associations of those managing volunteers, commonly called DOVIAs (directors of volunteers in agencies), from cities large and small; state associations of volunteer administrators; affinity groups such as health care settings, volunteer centers, museums, local government, and animal shelters; and networks within national organizations such as volunteer program managers at the [[American Red Cross]] and [[Volunteers of America]]. At the end of three days, a COVAA Steering Committee was elected to continue to seek involvement and input from the widest range of colleagues working with volunteers, and to explore the creation of a permanent new association to serve as a professional network for such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationofleadersinvolunteerengagement.org/docs/COVAA_Final_Report.pdf Congress Highlights], accessed June 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, based on feedback to COVAA organizers and discussions during a town hall meeting at the 2007 National Conference on Volunteering and Service in [[Philadelphia]], the COVAA Steering Committee proposed the launch of a new professional association for people that work with volunteers, and the name of this association to be "ALIVE." It would stand for the "Association of Leaders in Volunteer Engagement." The organizers proposed the following mission ALIVE: "to enhance and sustain the spirit of volunteerism in America by fostering collaboration and networking, promoting professional development, and providing advocacy for leaders in community engagement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationofleadersinvolunteerengagement.org/docs/december-2007-update.htm December 2007 Update], accessed June 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; AL!VE received a grant from the Volunteer Impact Fund to be used as start-up funding. The Founding Board was formed at a facilitated retreat in Denver in February 2009. AL!VE went live with its own web site in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.associationofleadersinvolunteerengagement.org/about_us.php |title=About us |accessdate=2017-04-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127094308/http://www.associationofleadersinvolunteerengagement.org/about_us.php |archivedate=November 27, 2009 }}, accessed June 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

Now abbreviated as AL!VE, the association serves both professionals and volunteers that work in the management of volunteers and volunteer engagement. It advocates for the recognition and appreciation of volunteer management, and works to be a resource for and provide a link to tools, research, and best practices regarding volunteer engagement. The association has published 21 online newsletters that chronicle its activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mms.volunteeralive.org/members/newsletters.php?org_id=ALIV| AL!VE Newsletters], accessed June 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The association also provides a web page of web-based resources regarding the management and support of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volunteeralive.org/website_resources.php AL!VE website resoures], accessed June 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

AL!VE participated in the first national conference for managers of volunteers since the demise of AVA in July 2017, hosted by the Minnesota Association for Volunteer Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mavanetwork.org/content.aspx?|title=2017 National Summit on Volunteer Engagement Leadership |df= }}, accessed May 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/VolunteerALIVE/status/890223369458790400?|title=VolunteerALIVE tweet |df= }}, accessed July 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; As volunteerism expert [[Susan J. Ellis]] noted, "It has been 10 years since we had a national event designed exclusively for people whose work centers on engaging volunteers. At one time we relied on what was the Association for Volunteer Administration (AVA) for such an annual gathering, but when AVA died, so did the conference... This is do-or-die time for AL!VE, the Association of Leaders in Volunteer Engagement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energizeinc.com/hot-topics/2017/august|title=Three Great Days: Reflections after the Summit on Volunteer Engagement Leadership |publisher=Energize |df= }}, accessed August 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Family Association''' ('''AFA''') is a conservative political organisation with the stated aim of "supporting and strengthening traditional [[family values]]". It was founded in 1980 by the [[National Civic Council (NCC)|National Civic Council]]'s then president, [[B. A. Santamaria]], to "promote the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society".

==Beliefs==
According to its stated objectives, the AFA aims "to cultivate within society an appreciation that the integrity and wellbeing of the family is essential to the stability, morale, security and prosperity of the Australian nation". It defines a family as being "composed of father, mother and children". It also lobbies on issues related to its central purpose, such as the definition of [[marriage]], [[abortion]], media standards and [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|classification]], [[cloning]], [[pornography]] and illicit [[drug]] use.

==Objectives==
The objectives for which the Australian Family Association is established are:

# to cultivate within society an appreciation that the integrity and well being of the family is essential to the stability, morale, security and prosperity of the Australian nation.
# to analyze laws and policies for their effect on the family and to formulate and promote corrective measures as necessary.
# by means of conferences, seminars and the active involvement of individuals and groups, to create public awareness of the fundamental importance of the family unit.
# to facilitate research and act as a resource centre for the effective pursuit of the Association's objectives.
# to promote and encourage the development of services to assist families in difficulties.
# to do all such things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objectives.

==Founder and patrons==
The AFA was founded by [[B. A. Santamaria]]. Current and former patrons of the organisation include [[Kim Edward Beazley|Kim Beazley, sr.]], Rupert Goodman, Major-General [[William James (soldier)|W. B. "Digger" James]], Major-General [[Michael Jeffery]], Sir [[Peter Lawler (public servant)|Peter Lawler]], Dame [[Elisabeth Murdoch (philanthropist)|Elisabeth Murdoch]] and [[Jerzy Zubrzycki]].

==Controversy and criticism==
[[Ross Fitzgerald]] criticised the AFA in 2008 for protesting against a film they had not viewed, and also criticised the [[Australian Classification Review Board]] for letting the protest influence them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Australian]] |title=Howard's moral cleansers past their use-by date |first=Ross |last=Fitzgerald |authorlink=Ross Fitzgerald |page=6 |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=9 December 2016 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/moral-cleansers-past-their-use-by-date/story-e6frg6qf-1111115258791 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161209112718/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/moral-cleansers-past-their-use-by-date/news-story/52c1c72e00787bbfb949977df7fd58d1 |archivedate=9 December 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an anti [[same-sex marriage]] rally the AFA co-organised in 2011, guest speakers stated gay marriage should be "laughed at and ridiculed" and incorrectly associated gay marriage with paedophilia. Mental health psychologist Paul Martin said such comments would be psychologically damaging to young gay people, stating "the last thing they need to hear are these kinds of offensive comments from people who purport to represent 'family values'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/gay-marriage-ridicule-damages-youths-20110816-1ivrb.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161209112950/http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news-national/gay-marriage-ridicule-damages-youths-20110816-1ivrb.html |archivedate=9 December 2016 |title=Gay marriage ridicule 'damages youths' |author= |date=16 August 2011 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher= |accessdate=9 December 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bad Girrls Studios''' was a popular [[Boston]] [[Art gallery|gallery]] and performance space from 1996 to 2000, located at 209 Green Street in Jamaica Plain. Founded by [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] student Jessica Brand, the [[artist-run]] studio hosted numerous events until it closed due to pressure from the [[Boston Licensing Commission]] and lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/03/04/no_alternative/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=No alternative | first=Geoff | last=Edgers | date=March 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=98915 The Harvard Crimson :: Arts :: The Field Guide: Art in Boston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://users.rcn.com/kyp/dog.html Putting Shakespeare's Dog to Sleep&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad Girrls Studios supported [[female]] artists in particular, and art that pushed boundaries of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], the largest of which was a 1998 exhibit "Naughty Girrls Nite @ Bad Girrls Studios", produced by studio member Rebecca Goldberg, which drew over 50 women artists and performers from [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New England]].

Several of the studio members were also co-founders or members of the [[Art School Cheerleaders]]. This performance art group, which began at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]], used Cheerleading as a medium for satirical commentary about art and the art world, and to advocate for arts funding.

The artist-run gallery was partially inspired by another important [[performance art]] space in Boston during that time, [[Mobius Artists Group]], that brought cutting-edge performance artists to Boston through an international exchange program. Mobius had been founded by another member of the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] community, instructor Marilyn Arsem. 

Bad Girrls Studios operated under the slogan "Art is Not A Luxury."

The '''Bara''' people are a [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|Malagasy ethnic group]] living in the southern part of the central [[plateau]]s of [[Madagascar]], in the [[Toliara Province]], concentrated around their historic capital at [[Ihosy]].  The Bara are the largest of the island's [[zebu]]-herding peoples and have historically lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle, although an increasing proportion are practicing agriculture. Bara society is highly [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and [[endogamy]] and [[polygamy]] are practiced among some Bara tribes.  Young men practice [[cattle rustling]] to prove their manhood before marriage, and the ''kilalaky'' musical and dance tradition associated with cattle rustlers has gained popularity across the island.

Historically the Bara were organized into numerous affiliated kingdoms ruled by nobles of the Zafimanely line. They were largely united under a single king in the late 18th century before again dissolving into competing kingdoms. Over the 19th century, Bara participation in slave and cattle trading and raids into neighboring territories saw their wealth and power increase despite the group's fragmented political organization.  This economic power enabled the Bara to maintain independence from the expanding authority of the [[Kingdom of Imerina]] and resist French authority for nearly a decade following colonization in 1896. Andre Resampa, a powerful political leader in the transition to independence for Madagascar in 1960, hailed from the Bara ethnic group.  There were an estimated 520,000 Bara in Madagascar in 2000 constituting roughly three percent of the population, and they remain the island's predominant zebu herders and traders.

==Ethnic identity==
[[File:Ethnic groups of Madagascar Map.png|thumb|left|upright||Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups]]
The name ''Bara'' is of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] origin and means "those of the interior".{{sfn|Ottino|1998|p=636}}  Along with [[Sakalava]], Bara are one of the two Malagasy ethnic groups of clear [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] descent. They live principally in the southern part of the central [[plateau]]s of [[Madagascar]], in the [[Toliara Province]], especially in the [[Ihosy]]-[[Betroka]] area.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=25}} They numbered an estimated 520,000 in 2000.{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=158}}

==History==
The history of the Bara begins along the [[Ihosy River]] in the Arindrano region of southwest Madagascar, near [[Toliara]]. Little is known about the earliest period in Bara identity formation, beyond that it coincided with the formation of the Maroserana dynasty of the [[Sakalava people]]{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=433}} and that certain Bara nobles had Maroserana origins.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=422}} This early kingship-based social structure is believed to have had weak or nonexistent rules of succession. Around 1640 a noble of the [[Mahafaly]] people invaded Bara territory and installed his family as rulers under the dynastic name Zafimanely. This was an imposition to which many Bara were unwilling to submit, leading them to simply migrate internally to new territory. Zafimanely power became more firmly established after the death of the Mahafaly nobleman in 1653, but competition and ambition led these newcomers to engage in an ongoing struggle for power until around 1680, greatly disrupting life in Bara territory (Ibara). A major driver of this instability was the absence of a tribute system, leading Zafimanely nobles to engage in cattle raiding and issuing costly fines to law breakers that sparked internal and external tensions alike.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=433}}

Around 1800 there emerged a Zafimanely king called Raikitroka who put in place new regulations that greatly eased these tensions and ushered in a reign of relative tranquility and harmony.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=433}} After Raikitroka's death, the ruling line fractured into multiple kingdoms and principalities; by 1895 the Bara were organized into at least three major kingdoms, two mid-sized ones and more than 24 minor kingdoms. This shift was linked not to economic causes—the Bara as a whole grew richer from international trade and the raiding of Imerina in the late 19th century—but rather because of the gradual dispersal of the growing Bara population into the relatively underpopulated plains of the west and south and subsequently growing distance of the scattered population from the traditional center of Bara power. Although Queen [[Ranavalona I]] successfully established a Merina military installation at [[Ihosy]],{{sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=7}} the 19th century military conquests of the [[Kingdom of Imerina]] never succeeded in entirely subjugating the Bara.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Working from their base at Ihosy, the Merina garrison attempted to exert some degree of influence over the Bara by providing support to stronger Bara kings over their challengers in an effort to maintain friendly alliances with powerful leaders capable of exerting the control over the territory that the Merina could not.{{sfn|Ellis|2014|p=39}} Despite the dispersed nature of Bara power, by the end of the 19th century the Zafimanely constellation of ruling nobles ranked alongside that of the Sakalava and Merina as the most powerful political forces on the island.{{sfn|Ellis|2014|p=38}}

The Zafimanely Kingdom was dissolved after the island was [[French Madagascar|colonized by the French]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The king of one of the most prominent Bara kingdoms, a leader named Ramieba, was arrested by the French for leading Bara participation in the [[Menalamba rebellion]] against French rule in 1897. This consequently soured Bara perception of the French, who otherwise might have been welcomed as conquerors of the widely resented Merina sovereigns.{{sfn|Ellis|2014|p=135}} After the French conquered Madagascar they attempted with great difficulty to impose administrative authority in Bara territory,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; with frequent Bara insurrections between June 1897 and the general southern uprising of 1904–05.{{sfn|Ellis|2014|p=136}}

Bara politician Andre Resampa became a leading figure in the establishment of the [[Social Democratic Party of Madagascar and the Comoros|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) in the run-up to national independence in 1960. When PSD figurehead [[Philibert Tsiranana]] was elected Madagascar's first president on 1 May 1959, Resampa became the party's Secretary General; in this role, he spearheaded the revival of the traditional body of local government, the ''fokonolona'', and led a successful effort to dramatically increase party membership.{{sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=108}}

Bara society is structured into numerous loosely affiliated groups based on common ancestors. These were clustered into five main tribes. The three largest and most powerful were the Bara-Be, Bara-Imamono and Bara-Ianstsantsa, who lived alongside the smaller Vinda and Antivondro.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=433}} They live a semi-nomadic lifestyle that revolves around herding [[zebu]]&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; and are the largest and most important of the Malagasy pastoralist groups.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=433}} The capital of the Bara was located in [[Ihosy]].{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=204}} Community life was traditionally organized around a rigid set of rules and norms, but these have loosened since the early 20th century as growing population pressures have forced emigration and dispersal of the Bara away from their historic homeland.{{sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=264}} Like elsewhere in Madagascar, Bara society was historically stratified into three classes: nobles, commoners and slaves.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

Communities remain strongly [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], and [[polygamy]] is commonly practiced.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=25}} [[Endogamy]] is also practiced among some Bara tribes.{{sfn|Ottino|1998|p=575}} The male head of the family often has a dual role as the spiritual leader of the household.{{sfn|Michel|1957|p=59}} Traditionally, inheritance rights strongly favored males; daughters were restricted from inheriting anything other than movable property.{{sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=329}} Gender roles were strictly defined. Men prepared the soil of the rice fields, purchased or hunted for food, gathered firewood, built the family home and furniture, and engaged in discussion and debate about public affairs. Women were responsible for growing crops for sale or family consumption, weeding the rice fields, harvesting and processing the rice, gathering water, lighting the hearth fire and preparing daily meals, and weaving.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|pp=155-156}} As recently as the late 19th century, women were forbidden from eating until after the men had finished, and could not look at them while they ate.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=157}}  At birth, a village ''ombiasy'' (seer) was typically consulted to determine whether the child was destined for a fortunate or unhappy fate. If the latter, an exorcism was practiced whereby the infant would be slid down a chute into a body of water where his mother would retrieve him, and if it was deemed that the evil destiny was too strong for the exorcism rite to overcome it, the Bara infant would be left on an anthill to die.{{sfn|Vig|2001|p=123}}

===Religious affiliation===
While some Baras are Christians, most retain their traditional religious beliefs.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=25}} Tamarind trees were traditionally considered sacred and are found planted near many Bara villages, where residents will leave offerings like woven mats, locks of hair, shells and other items when offering prayers or after their requests are fulfilled. The indigenous ''bontona'' tree was also considered sacred and villagers would tie charms to the branches when offering prayers.{{sfn|Vig|2001|p=109}} Each village also had a ''hazomanga'', a wooden pillar considered the most sacred site of worship, which served as the public altar for group prayer and offerings.{{sfn|Michel|1957|p=60}} This pillar was typically 20 to 30 feet high and a sachet containing sacred herbs, sand and wood chips was hung from the top.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=92}} Bara men traditionally conduct the rites associated with honoring the ancestors, while women conduct rites associated with fertility and the forces of nature.{{sfn|Ottino|1998|p=541}} An exception is childbirth, during which the mother is secluded for a period of four days; men watch over the birthing process and conduct associated rites.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=167}}

==Culture==
Agreements were traditionally formalized through a blood pact (''fatidra'').{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=25}} The Bara live in rectangular earthen houses that are colored red by the high iron content of the soil. In the winter, space beneath the eaves is used for hanging and sun-drying maize to be stored, sold or planted the following year.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=201}}

Demonstrating courage is fundamental to masculinity in Bara culture. Historically, kings were required to lead the advance in combat, placing themselves in danger first; the others were not allowed to protect him or come to his aid unless he was injured or exhausted.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=114}} [[Cattle raiding]] is a major feature of Bara culture. Traditionally a rite of passage for young men to prove their worth and courage to a prospective wife's family and the larger community, the practice is currently outlawed but remains widespread throughout the southwest and south-central Bara territories.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=25}} Young men could not expect to marry respectably without first having successfully stolen at least one or two cattle in a raid.{{sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p= 377}} Today, cattle rustlers (''dahalo'') are increasingly armed bandits stealing cattle for wealth rather than social prestige.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=195}} Zebu wrestling is a sport practiced by Bara communities and involves Zebu being penned into an arena and whipped into frustration. Once the zebu is angry, players sneak up behind the Zebu and jump onto its hump, attempting to 'ride' as long as possible without being injured by the beast. It is seen as a rite of passage for young boys.

The Bara have a rich oral storytelling tradition. Their myths and stories are distinguished by an especially stark and terse use of language. The comparatively simple structure and symbolism that predominates in Bara storytelling is used by some linguists and anthropologists as a starting point for analyzing the evolution and variation of oral storytelling traditions on the island.{{sfn|Haring|2007|p=26}}  The dance traditions and sculpted artwork of the Bara are well known across the island. Their wooden statues are unique in having long eyelashes made from real hair.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=25}}

Traditionally, Bara women would weave local cotton to make clothing for themselves and their family members. Cotton continues to be hand picked, ginned and woven using a high-whorl drop spindle. Raw cotton yarn is typically dipped in a softening solution before weaving; prior to softening, the yarn is called ''fole velo'' ("living yarn") and is believed to be imbued with magical powers; ''ombiasy'' (village wisemen) may tie this yarn around the wrist for protection or wrap it around the bodies of participants in circumcision ceremonies.{{sfn|Condra|2013|p=456}}  Less commonly, clothing was made of silk (''landy'') produced by the local silkworm that fed off indigenous tapia trees growing in the Isalo area. Although this silk was more coarse and uneven than that produced by the [[Merina people|Merina]] or [[Betsileo people]], throughout the island it was the most prized type of silk because of its durability.{{sfn|Condra|2013|p=457}} In the far eastern part of Bara territory, clothing was most commonly made from beaten bark cloth or mats of ''harefo'' (''Eleocharis plantagines''). Women wore tube dresses made of two to three mats stitched together and tied at the shoulder or belted at the waist, often in combination with a bandeau style top of woven ''mahampy'' reeds. Men wore beaten bark cloth loincloths with jackets or tunics formed from stitched woven mats; older men's clothing included sleeves.{{sfn|Condra|2013|p=456}} The wearing of charms is common among the Bara, as elsewhere in Madagascar; charms called ''tsimokotra'' were historically crafted from the bones of lemurs' feet to relieve fatigue.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=217}}

===Fady===
As elsewhere in Madagascar, social life among the Bara is strongly guided by ''fady'', ancestral taboos that often vary by class, by village, or even by family. In some Bara villages, it is forbidden to carry a load alone; at least two people must carry it together.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=205}} A common prohibition throughout Bara communities forbids serving food or drink to someone with the utensils, plates or cups that were used to serve another.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=332}} It is also fady to step over someone seated or lying on the ground, lift or carry an item over another person's head or body,{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=333}} brush another person with one's ''[[lamba (garment)|lamba]]'', or sit on or lean against another's bed.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=33}}

Numerous fady surround the Bara nobles. Among the Zafimanely royal clan, for example, it is forbidden to ever kill a relative, even as punishment for a serious crime.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=150}} Historically it was taboo to speak to the wives of chiefs or enter their houses, and there were specific locations restricted to everyone but them for gathering firewood and collecting water.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=99}} A particularly strong taboo forbade speaking the name of a chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were required to use, and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation;{{sfn|Gennep|1904|pp=111-112}} anyone who spoke the forbidden words would harshly punished or in some instances executed.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=340}}

===Funeral rites===
[[File:Tombeau Bara.jpg|thumb|Bara burial site, [[Isalo]] national park]]
The Bara entomb the dead in natural mountain caves, particularly in [[Isalo National Park]], an area they consider sacred; they have buried their dead in the caves here for centuries.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=206}}  Where such natural formations are not available, the Bara build tombs covered in stones at a site away from the village.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=66}} Mourners visit the bereaved in a special building called the "house of many tears" where the women engage in ritual wailing and expression of sorrow.{{sfn|Scheff|1979|p=122}} The bereaved family members cut their hair to express [[mourning]]. Among many Bara, wives were not buried with their husband and his children, but were rather buried with their father or in a separate site.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=158}}  It is believed that the spirits of the dead linger as ghosts, which historically prompted villages to relocate after a death.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=25}}

Those associated with a recent death are seen as imbued with a kind of contagion for a short period of time. When ''bilo'' or ''salamanga'' healing rituals are being conducted, the ''ombiasy'' may erect a special barrier (''kiady'') in front of the entrance to the house where the ceremony is being held as an indicator that anyone whose family member has recently died (as well as any foreigner or stranger outside the community) is forbidden to enter for concern about breaking the power of the healing spell.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=65}}

===Dance and music===
Dance among the Bara is influenced by the movement of the zebu they have traditionally herded for centuries. The ''karitaky'' dance in particular is a movement inspired by a zebu kicking.{{sfn|Fuhr|2013|p=116}} The most popular contemporary dance, called ''kilalaky'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About Kilalaky |publisher =World Wildlife Federation | url = http://wwf.panda.org/?207626/aboutkilalaky | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is performed in a line and originated among Bara cattle rustlers. The specific style of musical accompaniment, also known as ''kilalaky'', is performed on djembe, [[kabosy]], electric guitar, bass guitar, drum kit and  keyboard. Bagzana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Kilalaky |publisher =Afrisson.com | url = http://www.afrisson.com/Kilalaky-12720.html | year = 2012 | accessdate = 2 May 2015 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tsiliva]] are considered among the most popular performers of ''kilalaky''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tsiliva, pour porter haut l'identité du kilalaka |publisher = Orange Madagascar | url = http://www.orange.mg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=65&amp;id=857&amp;Itemid=1224| year = 2010 | accessdate = 21 April 2013 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most typical musical instrument among the Bara is the ''lokanga'', a fiddle with three strings made of goat gut or vegetable fiber.{{sfn|Fuhr|2013|p=102}}

==Language==
The Bara speak Bara Malagasy, a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] derived from the [[Barito languages]], spoken in southern [[Borneo]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web | title = Bara | year = 2014 |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52506/Bara | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate= 1 September 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Raising and selling herds of zebu is the principal economic activity of the Bara. In recent decades they have increasingly adopted agricultural practices, including the cultivation of rice, cassava, millet and maize.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The rice planting season was traditionally timed around the arrival of a local migrating quail (''coturnix communis''), known locally as ''kibodolo''.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=267}} The Bara and Sakalava were Madagascar's principal international slave traders through the early part of the 19th century.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p= 57}}  Historically the majority of slave raids were conducted in the dry winter months.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=56}}  Beginning in the 1870s, in response to increased cattle demand in South Africa following a series of blights and disease that had decimated local herds, the Bara began exporting their cattle internationally through southern coastal ports including [[Toliara]], Saint Augustin, [[Belo sur Mer|Belo]] and Soalara.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=185}} The development of economic activity independent of the regulation of the [[Kingdom of Imerina]], as well as the arms they received in exchange for cattle,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=230}} enabled the Bara to strengthen their autonomy and resist Merina authority in the later 19th century, even to the extent of launching cattle and slave raids into the heart of Imerina{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=336}} - an activity that increased particularly after 1882.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=178}} The Ankandrarezina Bara also cultivated tapia, a mulberry upon which the indigenous silkworm fed; the silk they produced was both woven locally for cloth{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=31}}  and exported in raw form to Imerina.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=41}}

'''Brazilian Canadians''' or '''Brazo-Canadians''' ({{lang-pt|canadense de extração brasileira}}, {{lang-fr|brésilien-canadien}}) are [[Canadians]] of [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] descent or Brazilians who have immigrated to Canada. The 1991 Canadian census reports 2,520 individuals of wholly Brazilian origin and another 2,325 who describe Brazilian as one of their ethnic origins (Brazilians themselves may be of varied European, African, Middle Eastern, East Asian and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] ethnic origins), giving a total of 4,845. This figure can be taken as an official minimum and corresponds to [[Brazil]]ian consular estimates.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s a large number of younger Brazilians established families in Toronto. The local newspaper ''Abacaxi Times'' estimated that the total number of Brazilians living in Toronto in the 1990s was about 9,000. Probably an equal number of legal immigrants entered [[Ontario]] to that date. The total for Canada was 14,976. When [[refugee]] claimants and [[illegal immigrant]]s are added, the total in Ontario alone may approach 12,000, with a few thousand more in [[Quebec]] and [[British Columbia]]; there are smaller groups scattered across the country. New immigrants have continued to enter the country, but at a much slower pace than in the previous decade.

Like all [[Latin American Canadians]], Brazilian Canadians are legally defined as a [[visible minority]], irrespective of their ancestry or appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/definitions/minority01a# |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718232555/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/definitions/minority01a# |archive-date=18 July 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cause Celeb''''' is the [[debut novel]] of [[Helen Fielding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Elizabeth A.|title='Cause Celeb' Can't Keep Up With Joneses|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hpQ_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5FUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4152,6388169&amp;dq=cause+celeb+fielding&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Mount Airy News|date=March 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; later known for her creation of the character [[Bridget Jones]]. her first novel is about a few years in the life of Rosie Richardson, who decides to go to Africa after she breaks up with her boyfriend, Oliver Marchant, a TV presenter. But after four years working in Nambula, a fictional country in Northern Africa, there is a famine coming and Rosie turns back to Oliver and his famous friends to get the food they desperately need.

==Plot summary==

Rosie Richardson works in [[marketing]] at a [[publisher]], when she starts dating Oliver Merchant, and falls in love with him. Oliver is the host of the TV show called ''SoftFocus'' where they tackle mostly cultural and political topics. Their relationship is formed by his erratic behaviour, like one day telling her he loves her and then not calling for days.

When Rosie has to go to Nambula on a business trip, the poverty and general environment shock her into the realisation that she wants to spend her life doing something meaningful. So she breaks up with Oliver and leaves to go to Nambula and work at a refugee camp, organised by ''Sustain''.

Four years later, she is running the camp and feels attracted to a new doctor, Robert O'Rourke. Unfortunately, rumours about a locust invasion spread and about the shipping of food that will be late.

So Rosie decides that she has to take matters into her own hands. She flies back to England and gets in touch with Oliver and his circle of famous friends to raise funds. After some convincing, the stars and Rosie fly to Nambula for a one-hour fundraising show.
In the meantime, Oliver attempts reuniting with Rosie, who refuses him.

After they handle some catastrophes, the show airs and is a full success. Food is delivered, the stars fly back and Rosie gets together with O'Rourke.

The '''Commission for Communications Regulation''' ('''ComReg''') ({{lang-ga|An Coimisiún um Rialáil Cumarsáide}}) is the general [[communication]]s [[Regulatory agency|regulator]] for [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], covering almost all possible types of communications.

Founded on 1 December 2002, ComReg took over from the '''Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation''' ('''ODTR'''), amongst other bodies. The ODTR was established in 1997 to take over the licensing and regulatory functions of the [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport|Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication]] which related primarily to broadcasting and communications. The first (and only) Director of Telecommunications Regulation was [[Etain Doyle]], who was subsequently appointed Chairperson of ComReg, on its establishment.

Under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA20Y2002.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426172511/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA20Y2002.html |date=April 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|Minister for Communications, Marine, and Natural Resources]] appoints the chairperson and up to two other commissioners of ComReg. Currently the commissioners are Gerry Fahy, Jeremy Godfrey and Kevin O'Brien&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comreg.ie |title=comre.ie |publisher=Comreg.ie |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sectors regulated by ComReg include [[mail|post]], [[telecoms]], [[internet]], [[cable television]], [[terrestrial television]], [[radio]] and [[domain name]] under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 (No. 20 of 2002), S.I. No. 510 of 2002 Communications Regulation Act 2002 (Establishment Day) Order 2002 and other acts. For a full list of legislation underpinning ComReg's responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comreg.ie/about_us/legislation.501.html |title=Legislation - ComReg |publisher=Comreg.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ComReg set prices, allocate frequencies, and issue licenses to those involved in these sectors and provides statistical data, consumer product price comparisons to assist consumers in achieving value for money on a fair basis. In relation to terrestrial television and radio, the commission acts in conjunction with the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]]. After the enactment of the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]] RTÉ and TG4 authorities were disbanded and now come under the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's remit.

ComReg is also tasked with enforcing wireless telegraphy legislation, in particular the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926]], in relation to use of the radio spectrum, which includes actions against [[pirate radio]] stations, distributors of mobile phone repeaters and other unlicensed users of radio spectrum.

In September 2004, ComReg launched their consumer driven website, AskComreg.i.e. Since then it has added ComStat.ie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comstat.ie |title=comstat.ie |publisher=comstat.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide market communications industry statistics to industry and academia and CallCosts.ie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.callcosts.ie |title=callcosts.ie |publisher=callcosts.ie |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides the tariff models of all telecoms products for consumers to compare product prices and make the best choices for themselves.

The '''coronation of the Emperor of Brazil''' was the religious rite of consecration during which the monarchs of the [[Empire of Brazil]] were solemnly blessed, anointed, crowned, invested with the other items of  the [[Imperial Regalia of Brazil|imperial regalia]] and enthroned, according to the usages of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], the Empire's official, established Church. The coronation of the Brazilian monarch confirmed the accession of a new emperor to the throne, and corresponded to similar rites that took place in other Christian monarchies. The two Brazilian emperors, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] underwent the ceremony of [[coronation]], on 1 December 1822 and 18 July 1841, respectively. Those remain the two sole acts of coronation that took place in the South American continent.

==Specific usages==
In Brazil, the rites of coronation generally followed the Roman ritual for the coronation of Kings&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, Eduardo Romero de. O império da lei: ensaio sobre
o cerimonial de sagração de D. Pedro I (1822), p. 140, available at http://www.scielo.br/pdf/tem/v13n26/a08v1326.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, as prescribed by the [[Roman Pontifical]]&lt;ref&gt;The Roman rite for the coronation of a King, contained in the Roman Pontifical (''Pontificale Romanum''), should not be confused with the specific Rite for the coronation of a Holy Roman emperor at the Papal Court, a rite celebrated by the Pope alone and contained in the Roman Ceremonial (''Caerimoniale Romanum''), the book that described the ceremonies that were exclusive to the Roman Pontiff. The coronation of the emperors of Brazil followed the rite for the coronation of a King contained in the ''Pontificale Romanum'', that was the rite of the Roman Church for the coronation of monarchs in general. References to "king" and "kingdom", however, were adapted to "emperor" and "empire".&lt;/ref&gt; according to its edition then in force (promulgated by Pope [[Benedict XIV]]), in its ''ordo'' titled ''De Benedictione et coronatione Regis'',&lt;ref&gt;The text of the Rite of the Roman Pontifical then in use is available at http://www.liturgialatina.org/pontificale/120.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but with a few modifications, such as the natural replacement of references to ''king'' and ''kingdom'' to ''emperor'' and ''empire'', and the bestowal of a few items of regalia not contemplated in the rite of the Roman Pontifical (the delivery of an orb, the investiture with gloves and with a ring, etc.).

While, even after the codification and uniformization of the Roman Rite following the [[Council of Trent]], certain Catholic countries retained permission to continue using their own particular coronation rites (such as the rite of coronation of the Kings of France), the Roman ritual for the coronation of kings, as codified in the Roman Pontifical (first issued under [[Pope Clement VIII]]), became the standard coronation rite for the [[Latin Church]], given that all liturgies included in the Roman Pontifical where prescribed for general use in the entire [[Roman Rite]]. As such, this rite was available for use by the Roman Rite bishops in Brazil and by the Brazilian monarchy, and was naturally adopted, as prescribed by the liturgical laws then in force in the Catholic Church. As with all the liturgical acts of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church at the time, the ceremony of the coronation was conducted entirely in Latin, except for the sermon, that was preached in Portuguese, the local vernacular language.

Brazil never used the rites for the coronation of a sovereign's consort, and therefore the empresses of Brazil were not crowned, including Empress [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]], who was already married to Pedro I at the time of his coronation, but was not crowned alongside her husband. The country also never employed the rite for the coronation of an empress regnant&lt;ref&gt;In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, the rite for the coronation of a queen regnant differs substantially both from the rite for the coronation of a king and also from the rite for the coronation of a queen consort.&lt;/ref&gt;, because the Brazilian monarchy was abolished in 1889 by the military coup d'état that proclaimed Brazil a republic, before Princess Imperial Isabel could succeed her father on the throne.

While other countries allowed the coronation of their monarchs while still minors and under regency, in Brazil the coronation of Emperor Pedro II (who succeeded to the crown while still a minor) only took place after the emperor had been declared of age and had assumed the personal discharge of the imperial authority.

The coronation of both emperors of Brazil took place in the then [[Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro|Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro]], now known as the ''Old Cathedral'', that functioned as the Imperial Chapel.

The coronation of Emperor Pedro I was presided over by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro|Bishop of Rio de Janeiro]], Major Chaplain of the Imperial Chapel, because Brazil's only Metropolitan, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Salvador da Bahia|Archbishop of São Salvador da Bahia]], was unavailable. The coronation of Emperor Pedro II was presided by the then Metropolitan Archbishop of São Salvador da Bahia, Primate of Brazil. All Bishops of Brazil (then few in number) were summoned to attend the ceremonies of coronation. The coronation of Pedro II was attended by six bishops in addition to the Archbishop of Salvador.

==Coronation ritual==
Detailed accounts of the coronations of the two Brazilian emperors exist, such as a very meticulous account of the coronation of emperor Dom Pedro II published by Rio de Janeiro's ''Jornal do Commercio'' newspaper on 20 July 1840 &lt;ref&gt;http://memoria.bn.br/DocReader/DocReader.aspx?bib=364568_03&amp;PagFis=2099&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genealogiafreire.com.br/jeo_coroacao_e_sagracao_de_pedro_ii.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The said account, in full, is also published in the book by Lima, J. I. de Abreu. ''Compêndio da História do Brasil'', volume 2, pp. 176 et seq, available at https://books.google.com.br/books?id=VdhWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA180&amp;lpg=RA2-PA180&amp;dq=Sadoc+sacerdos+...+unxit+Salomonem...+Salomon+autem+sedit+super+thronum+patris+sui,+et+firmatum+est+regnum+ejus+nimis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8KyK6XNmJc&amp;sig=DUqpwMNYHjxQi1jxUpZfTXKBoFo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr1vvq5ezYAhVDG5AKHZXMCuQQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sadoc%20sacerdos%20...%20unxit%20Salomonem...%20Salomon%20autem%20sedit%20super%20thronum%20patris%20sui%2C%20et%20firmatum%20est%20regnum%20ejus%20nimis&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;  and in the works of historians&lt;ref&gt;Shubert, Guilherme. A coroação de D. Pedro I, Rio de Janeiro, Arquivo Nacional, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sousa, Octavio Tarquinio de. Historia dos Fundadores do Império do Brasil, vol. II, p. 448 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source describing the proceedings that were to be observed in the coronation of emperor Dom Pedro I, including the ceremony for the taking of civil oaths (not prescribed in the Roman Pontifical) that were to be sworn at the conclusion of the liturgy, is the document ''Ceremonial of the consecration and coronation of Emperor Pedro I that is to take place in the Imperial Chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel on the 1st day of December of the current year'', that was approved by the imperial government on 20 November 1822 and is contained in a letter addressed by the Minister for the Empire, José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva, to the imperial court's officers of arms. The said ceremonial was published in the volume of Government Decisions of the ''Collection of the Laws of Brazil'' for the year 1822.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.camara.leg.br/atividade-legislativa/legislacao/publicacoes/doimperio/pdf/Legimp-F_34.pdf/Legimp-F_72.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; All those ceremonials and accounts of the festivities are only lacking on the question of the music that was played during the coronation liturgy (e.g. for the entrance and departure processions, etc.)

In the Empire of Brazil era, contemporaries referred to the act of coronation as the ceremony of ''sagração do Imperador'' (''consecration of the emperor''), in a way similar to the French habit of calling the coronation of the French monarch ''le sacre du roi'' (''the king's consecration''), placing emphasis in the act of consecration and anointing over the act of crowning. More formally, the rite was known to contemporaries as the ceremony of ''sagração e coroação'' (consecration and coronation), never ceasing to mention the first aspect.

As required by the Roman Pontifical, the both the 1822 and the 1841 coronations took place on Sundays and, in preparation for the solemnity, the emperor fasted on the preceding Wednesday and also on the preceding Friday and Saturday.

===Entrance into the church===

In the early morning the emperor (in the case of Pedro I, accompanied by the empress), left the [[Paço de São Cristóvão|Imperial Palace of St. Christopher]], the imperial residence, and went by coach, in full state and with a large military ceremonial escort, to the [[Paço Imperial|Imperial Palace at the City]], the formal seat of government, facing the Carmelite Convent and Rio de Janeiro's Cathedral (that also functioned as the Imperial Chapel, and was the site of the coronation). From the City Palace, the emperor and his family, preceded by heralds, kings of arms, ministers of the government and officers of state went to the cathedral in solemn procession.

Emperor Pedro II saluted the members of the diplomatic corps at the City Palace before the start of his coronation procession, and the procession started at 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Emperor Pedro I crossed the short distance between the palace and the cathedral under a canopy borne by four knights. Emperor Pedro II left the church under a similar canopy, but none is mentioned at the entrance. However, for the coronation of Pedro II, a temporary building connecting the palace to the cathedral was built, the coronation balcony, and thus the second Brazilian emperor walked the distance between the city palace and the church in the view of the people, but inside the balcony.

The emperor wore the military uniform of a knight, complete with spurs, and, at the initial stage of the ceremony, the dress included armour and a knight's mantle over it, a knight's sword and a helmet with feathers (that left his face visible).

[[File:Brazilian Imperial Crown2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Imperial Crown of Brazil|Diamantine Crown of Emperor Pedro II]], made for the 1841 coronation.]]
Once in the church, the emperor removed his helmet, and was received near the door by the Bishop of Rio de Janeiro, Major Chaplain of the Imperial Chapel, accompanied by the canons of the cathedral. The bishop sprinkled the emperor with holy water. The emperor then replaced his helmet to walk down the aisle. As part of the entrance procession, officers of state who carried the items of the regalia delivered them to the clergy when arriving at the chancel, and the clergy placed the regalia that would later be delivered to the emperor on top of the Altar table, including the imperial sword, the crown, the gloves, the ring, the orb, the rod of the Hand of Justice and the sceptre.

Having walked down the nave, and before entering the [[chancel]], the emperor turned left, and, removing his helmet once more, entered the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament. There he knelt in prayer, before leaving that chapel, placing his helmet once more and entering the church's chancel. The officiating prelate awaited him in a faldstool before the altar, and the emperor was met at the [[altar rails|chancel rails]] by a group of the assisting bishops, who flanked him. Members of the imperial Family, including the empress consort in the case of Pedro I and other ladies of the imperial court, took their seats the honour boxes in the second floor.

Arriving at the chancel area, the emperor then mounted the imperial throne, while the bishops and other clergy, who until then were in [[choir dress]], were vested (the presiding prelate and his accompanying ministers - assistant priests, deacons, etc. - in vestments proper for pontifical Mass, the other bishops in cope and white mitre), while reciting the prescribed [[vesting prayers]]. The emperor's domestic chaplains who were to assist him at the throne remained in choir dress. The imperial throne was permanently present in the imperial chapel, in the chancel area, under a baldachin complete with drapes, immediately next to the steps leading to the presbytery, in the [[Epistle side|Gospel side]] of the chancel, that is, on the left side from the perspective of someone viewing from the nave. The bishop's cathedral and its baldachin were also in the Gospel side of the chancel, but in the sanctuary, on top of the presbytery steps, very near to the imperial throne, so that the imperial throne and the episcopal cathedra stood next to each other (although the cathedra was in a more elevated position). The throne dais had one step less than the presbytery steps, so that the throne was in an elevated position, but slightly lower than the sanctuary.

When the clergy was ready, the assisting bishops came towards the throne to invite the emperor to appear before the officiating prelate, still sitting in his faldstool at the centre of the altar. The emperor then descended from the throne, and flanked by the assisting bishops, ascended the presbytery steps and, entering the sanctuary, approached the officiating prelate, kissing his hand. Immediately before mounting the presbytery steps and entering the sanctuary, the emperor removed his helmet for the final time, and delivered it to an aide. From this point on, the emperor remained bareheaded, until the moment of his crowning.

===The introductory rites and prayer of solemn blessing===

The coronation rites began with the petition, made by the senior assisting bishop to the officiating prelate, asking him, in the name of the Catholic Church, to perform the coronation. A dialogue followed to confirm the suitability of the person to be crowned. After that, a chair was brought and the emperor sat while the prelate read an admonition to the ''excellent prince'', about the duties of a sovereign. This admonition being concluded, the emperor stood, the chair was carried away, and the emperor knelt before the prelate and then took a solemn oath, known as a ''profession'', according to the form contained in the Roman pontifical. Placing his hand on a Bible that was presented to him, the monarch confirmed the oath with the Latin words ''Sic me Deus adjuvet, et haec sancta Dei Evangelia'', that mean, ''So help me God, and these holy Gospels of God''.

The emperor then remained kneeling facing the altar, while the officiating archbishop or bishop, standing before the kneeling monarch, pronounced in a loud voice the prayer ''Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, creator omnium'' to bless the emperor in preparation for his anointing, which prayer was repeated in a subdued voice by the other assisting bishops, from their places, as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;

Let us pray. 
Almighty and everlasting God, creator of all things, Emperor of Angels, King of kings and Lord of lords, who caused your faithful servant [[Abraham]] to triumph over his enemies, gave many victories to [[Moses]] and [[Joshua]], the leaders of your people, exalted your humble servant [[David]] to the eminence of kingship, enriched [[Solomon]] with the ineffable gifts of wisdom and peace, hear our humble prayers, we entreat, O Lord, and multiply your blessings (''here a sign of the cross was made over the kneeling monarch'') upon this thy servant N., whom in prayerful devotion we elect and will consecrate as emperor; surround him always and everywhere with the strength of your right arm, that he, being firm in the faith like Abraham, endowed with meekness like Moses, armed with courage like Joshua, praiseworthy in humility like David, and distinguished with wisdom like Solomon, may please you in all things and always walk without offense in the way of inviolate justice; defended by the helmet of your protection, covered with your invincible shield and clothed with heavenly armour; may he obtain the happy triumph of victory over the enemies of the Holy Cross of Christ, cause them to fear its power, and bring peace to those who are your soldiers. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, who by the power of His Cross has destroyed hell, overcame the kingdom of the devil, ascended victorious into Heaven, and in whom subsists all power, kingship and victory, He who is the glory of the humble and the life and salvation of the peoples, Who lives and reigns with You in the unity of Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;Oremus. Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, Creator omnium, Imperator Angelorum, Rex regum, et Dominus dominantium, qui Abraham fidelem servum tuum de hostibus triumphare fecisti, Moysi, et Josue populo tuo praelatis multiplicem victoriam tribuisti, humilemque David puerum tuum regni fastigio sublimasti, et Salomonem sapientiae pacisque ineffabili munere ditasti, respice, quaesumus, Domine, ad preces humilitatis nostrae, et super hunc famulum tuum N. quem supplici devotione in Imperatorem elegimus et consecraturi sumus, bene + dictionum tuarum dona multiplica, eumque dexterae tuae potentia semper, et ubique circumda; quatenus praedicti Abrahae fidelitate firmatus, Moysi mansuetudine fretus, Josue fortitudine munitus, David humilitate exaltatus, Salomonis sapientia decoratus, tibi in omnibus complaceat, et per tramitem justitiae inoffenso gressu semper incedat; tuae quoque protectionis galea munitus, et scuto insuperabili jugiter protectus, armisque coelestibus circumdatus, optabilis de hostibus sanctae crucis Christi victoriae triumphum feliciter capiat, terroremque suae potentiae illis inferat, et pacem tibi militantibus laetanter reportet.  Per Christum Dominum nostrum, qui virtute sanctae crucis tartara destruxit, regnoque diaboli superato, ad coelos victor ascendit, in quo potestas omnis, regnique consistit victoria, qui est gloria humilium, et vita salusque populorum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After this prayer was concluded, the emperor stood and went to the Gospel side of the altar (the left hand side from the perspective of those in the nave), where he knelt before a faldstool and prostrated his head on the cushion of the faldstool. The Litany of the Saints was then begun by the choir.

===The Litany of the Saints and the Anointing===

During the Litany of the Saints the presiding prelate also knelt in a faldstool at the centre of the altar, and all those present knelt in their places. The presiding prelate read the litany in a low voice while it was chanted aloud by the choir. After most of the invocations, at the point indicated by the Roman Pontifical, the choir paused, the officiating prelate stood and, with his pastoral staff in his hand, went towards the emperor, and standing before him, he recited aloud two of the invocations of the litany that were specific to the coronation rite: the first asked God ''deign to bless this emperor-elect who is about to be crowned'' (a sign of the cross being made over the emperor at the word "bless"),&lt;ref&gt;Ut hunc electum in Imperatorem coronandum bene + dicere digneris.  R. Te rogamus, audi nos.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second asking God to ''bless and consecrate this emperor-elect who is about to be crowned'' (two additional signs of the cross being made over the emperor at the words "bless" and "consecrate").&lt;ref&gt;Ut hunc electum in Imperatorem coronandum bene + dicere, et conse + crare digneris.  R. Te rogamus, audi nos&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the officiating archbishop or bishop returned to his place and the litany was continued, being chanted by the choir until its conclusion.

After the litany, while all remained kneeling and the emperor remained prostrate, the presiding prelate rose, removed his mitre, and recited the [[Lord's prayer]]: the words ''Pater noster'' were said aloud and the rest of the prayer was recited in silence, until the words ''et ne nos inducas in tentationem'', that were said aloud, prompting the people to respond with the final verse of the prayer: ''sed libera nos a malo''. A series of verses and responses then followed, several of them asking God's protection upon the emperor, his servant. After the last exchange of verse and response, the prelate proclaimed ''oremus'' (''let us pray'') and he, together with the other Bishops present, recited two short prayers, one asking God to grant his heavenly aid to ''this His servant'' (the emperor); the other asking God to inspire and to confirm the actions of His bishops.

At this point the officiating prelate and the other bishops resumed the use of their mitres. The emperor then rose from his prostration, and all other attendants at the coronation who were kneeling then rose as well. Then the emperor, with the help of his peers and ministers removed his collars and sash of orders of chivalry, and other insignia, removed the knight's mantle and armour, and military dress (including, in the case of Pedro II, even the knight's boots and the spurs), and stood finally, in the white trousers of the imperial court dress and a simple white linen shirt that had special openings to permit the anoinings. Meanwhile, the assisting bishops formed a circle around the monarch, shielding him from general view. There the emperor knelt to be anointed by the consecrating prelate, who sat before him at the faldstool at the centre of the altar. In preparation for the anointing, a [[gremiale]] was extended over the consecrating prelate's lap by the altar servers, and the prelate, aided by the servers, removed his episcopal ring, the episcopal glove of the right hand, and then replaced the ring on the fourth finger of his bare right hand.

The presiding archbishop or bishop then dipped his right thumb in the holy oil known as the Oil of Cathecumens, and anointed the emperor in two places, both anointings being made in the form of a cross: first the unction was performed in the emperor's right forearm, between the joint of the elbow and the joint of the fist; then the emperor reclined over the prelate and was anointed in his back, between the shoulders, starting at the base of the neck. For this anointing, silver buttons at the back of the emperor's garment were opened, being closed afterwards. While performing the holy anointing, the celebrating prelate, with a clear voice, addressed the emperor with the formula ''Deus, Dei Filius'',  that was repeated in a low voice by the other bishops, in the following words: &lt;blockquote&gt;
God, the Son of God, Our Lord Jesus Christ, who by the Father was anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, may He himself, by this present infusion of sacred anointing pour upon your head the blessing (''here a sign of the cross was made over the emperor'') of the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit Paraclete]], so that He may penetrate into the innermost recesses of your heart, in order that you receive, by this visible and material oil, invisible gifts, and, finally, having performed the just government of this temporal empire, you may merit to reign eternally with Him who alone is the sinless King of Kings, Who lives and is glorified with God the Father in the unity of God the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;Deus, Dei Filius, Jesus Christus Dominus noster, qui a Patre oleo exsultationis unctus est prae participibus suis, ipse per praesentem sanctae unctionis infusionem, Spiritus Paracliti super caput tuum bene + dictionem infundat, eamdemque usque ad interiora cordis tui penetrare faciat; quatenus hoc visibili et tractabili oleo, dona invisibilia percipere, et temporali imperio justis moderationibus peracto, aeternaliter cum eo regnare merearis, qui solus sine peccato Rex regum vivit, et gloriatur cum Deo Patre in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the anointing and the recitation of the above-mentioned formula (that, with minor changes in wording, featured also in several other rites of consecration of Christian monarchs, such as old rite for the [[coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[coronation of the French monarch|French]], the [[coronation of the British monarch|English]], and the [[coronation of the Hungarian monarch|Hungarian]] royal coronation rites), the gremiale was taken away by the altar servers and the presiding prelate then immediately stood and recited aloud the following prayer to God (the prayer ''Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui Hazael super Syriam''...), that was repeated in a low voice by the other assistant bishops, with the emperor still kneeling, as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us pray. Almighty everlasting God, who made to be anointed as kings, [[Hazael]] over Syria, and [[Jehu]] over Israel by [the hands of] [[Elijah]]; and also David and [[Saul]] by [the hands of] the Prophet [[Samuel]], we beseech You, grant Your blessing to the work of our hands, and to this your servant N., whom we, though unworthy, today anointed as emperor with a sacred unction, bestow the force and efficacy of the said ointment; constitute, O Lord, the principality over his shoulders, that he be a strong, just, faithful, and prudent ruler of this Empire and of Your people: a purger of the infidels, a cultivator of justice, a rewarder of merits and repayer of faults, a defender of Your Holy Church and of the Christian faith, for the honour and praise of Your glorious Name. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, your Son, Who with You lives and reigns in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;Oremus. Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui Hazael super Syriam, et Jehu super Israel per Eliam, David quoque et Saulem per Samuelem prophetam in Reges inungi fecisti, tribue, quaesumus, manibus nostris opem tuae benedictionis, et huic famulo tuo N. quem hodie licet indigni, in Imperatorem sacra unctione delinimus, dignam delibutionis hujus efficaciam et virtutem concede: constitue, Domine, principatum super humerum ejus, ut sit fortis, justus, fidelis, providus, et indefessus imperii hujus, et populi tui gubernator, infidelium expugnator, justitiae cultor, meritorum et demeritorum remunerator, Ecclesiae tuae sanctae, et fidei christianae defensor, ad decus, et laudem tui nominis gloriosi.  Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this prayer, the consecration of the emperor was complete.

From this point onwards, the monarch was never again referred to in liturgical prayers as "emperor elect" but as "emperor". It must be noted, however, that although the Catholic coronation liturgy treated the sovereign as "the elect" on coronation day prior to the moment of his anointing and the associated consecratory prayers, under the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil and its laws an emperor succeeded to the crown and to the imperial title as soon as his predecessor died or abdicated. The consecration and coronation of the monarch, therefore, was a solemn sacramental&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/coronationrites00wooluoft ''coronation Rites''], Reginald Maxwell Woolley, Cambridge, at the University Press, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; intended to bless the sovereign and to confirm his accession to the throne, but the assumption of the imperial dignity did not depend on it.

From the perspective of religion, however, the anointing of the monarch bestowed upon him a sacred character, and the coronation rite placed him in a special position within the Catholic hierarchy. The anointed sovereign became a ''mixta persona'': no longer fully a layman; endowed with some of the status of the clergy, but also not a clergyman, and tasked by the words of the coronation ritual with the mission of being a ''mediator between clergy and people''. Also, the tradition of the Church viewed Christian monarchs not only as civil rulers of Christian nations, but also as defenders of the Church and helpers of the ecclesiastical authority. Furthermore, the task of governing a Christian people was understood a holy one. Thus, the coronation ritual was predicated on the view that the monarch had a sacred function, as was sacred the function of the biblical Israelite kings and of the other leaders of the Israelites mentioned in the prayers of the coronation rite. Although the coronation of a monarch is not a sacrament but a sacramental (unlike the Sacrament of Holy Orders that constitutes deacons, priests and bishops), it is still a solemn religious act of consecration, like the dedication of a new church or of an altar, the blessing of a monk as an abbot to govern a monastery or the consecration of virgins as nuns: by the said act of consecration the monarch was set apart as possessing a sacred character not equal but similar to that of the clergy, and was invested with a kingship that derived from God like the kingship of the ancient kings of Israel.

After the above-mentioned prayer, the anointings were duly purified, and the presiding prelate, removing his episcopal ring, washed his hands. He then resumed the use of the episcopal gloves and replaced the ring in the fourth finger of his right hand over the glove. Meanwhile, the emperor stood to receive the imperial vestments.

===The vesting of the emperor===
The rites of the anointing being concluded, newly consecrated emperor rose to his feet to be clad in the imperial vestments (the same majestic dress that was thereafter used for the opening and closing of the annual sessions of the Imperial Parliament).

The Roman Pontificial provided options for this. The newly anointed monarch could either briefly retire to the church's [[sacristy]] to put on the majestatic vestments, returning to the sacred space of the church when already dressed, or he could be dressed in the sacred space of the church itself. In the coronation of Emperor Pedro I, the first pattern was followed (with the emperor going to the sacristy and then returning to the sacred area of the church via a door in the chancel area of the chapel that connected the chancel to the sacristy), while in the coronation of Pedro II the second pattern was followed.

In either case, the emperor's officers of state attended to him and aided him in putting on the imperial vestments, including, a white robe of state in the form of a deacon's dalmatic, a sash and collar of Orders of Chivalry. As for the monarch's shoes, although Emperor Pedro I continued wearing the metal boots of a knight throughout the entire coronation ceremony, Emperor Pedro II removed his knight’s boots for the anointing, and afterwards, while being dressed in his robes of state, put on white shoes that were part of his majestatic vestments and that  matched his white robe. In the case of the coronation of Pedro II, that was vested in the chancel area of the cathedral, in the sight of all the attendants of the coronation ceremony, the final, most symbolic items of the imperial robes of state (the imperial mantle and the pallium), were delivered to him not by his officers of state but by the officiating archbishop. After the emperor's officers of state had clad him in the other items of the imperial vestments, the archbishop then approached the emperor, and, aided by the emperor's major chamberlain, who brought forward the imperial mantle, the prelate vested the emperor with the imperial mantle (which had a top surface of dark green velvet embroidered with gold, and was of the cloth of gold in the internal surface), and clad the emperor with the pallium over the mantle. The pallium stood over the shoulders in the manner of a [[mozzetta]], and the mantle had a train. In the case of the coronation of Pedro I, however, when he returned from the sacristy he did so already wearing the mantle and pallium.

After the emperor was fully robed, he was led back to his throne. The major chamberlain carried the train of the imperial mantle at this time and in all the following occasions when the emperor had to walk while using the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;The coronation Ceremonial directed the major chamberlain to leave the mantle's train extended on the ground when the emperor was paused, kneeling or standing in place, but to pick up the train and carry it when the emperor needed to walk.&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at the dais of the throne, the emperor stood there on the top of the steps but without sitting on the throne chair, accompanied by two chaplains of his household. A [[prie-dieu]] was placed in front of him, and he knelt under the canopy of the throne to hear Holy Mass, flanked by his domestic chaplains.

===The Mass begins and is celebrated until the gradual===

The celebrating archbishop or bishop, aided by his ministers, then started the celebration of Holy Mass, reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar, and then ascended the altar while the choir sang the introit. The [[Coronation Mass]] took the form of a [[Pontifical High Mass]]. While the celebrating prelate recited the [[Confiteor]] with his ministers, the emperor also recited the Confiteor with his domestic chaplains under the canopy of the throne, as directed by the coronation rite of the Roman Pontifical. The Coronation Mass followed the liturgical propers of the Mass of the day (including the introit antiphon, the reading of the Epistle, the gradual or tract, the reading of the Gospel, the offertory antiphon, the preface and the communion antiphon), but, at the occasions of the collect prayer, the secret prayer, and the prayer after Communion, special prayers for the emperor, prescribed in the coronation rite of the Roman Pontifical, were recited after the normal prayers of the liturgy of the day contained in the Roman Missal. Those special collect, secret and postcommunion prayers for the monarch were the same ones that are prescribed in the Roman Missal for the votive ''Missa pro Rege'' (Mass for the King), with the natural replacement of all mentions of "king" for "emperor".

Because the coronation always took place on a Sunday, as required by the Roman Pontifical, the ''Gloria'' was sung after the ''Kyrie'' (except if the liturgy took place in the penitential liturgical seasons of Lent, Septuagesima or Advent) and the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] was sung after the reading of the Gospel. After the ''Gloria'' and the Collect of the day, the special Collect for the emperor was as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;
We humbly ask, all powerful God, that your servant N., our emperor, who by your mercy received the government of this Empire, may receive also the increase of all virtues, and that through them he may avoid all the monstrous vices, and that he may with grace arrive unto you, who are the way, the truth and life. Through Our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who with You lives and reigns in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;Quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut famulus tuus N. Imperator noster, qui tua miseratione suscepit imperii gubernacula, virtutum etiam omnium percipiat incrementa, quibus decenter ornatus, et vitiorum monstra devitare, et ad te, qui via, veritas et vita es, gratiosus valeat pervenire.  Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The celebration of Mass was then continued until and excluding the 'Alleluia' before the Gospel (or, when there was no Alleluia due to the liturgical season, until and excluding the last verse of tract, or, when appropriate, until and excluding the sequence preceding the Gospel). Therefore, after the reading of the Epistle and the chanting of the Gradual, the normal liturgy of the Mass was interrupted, and the specific ceremonies of the coronation were resumed, so that the delivery of the imperial insignia, including the emperor's actual coronation and enthronement, took place within the celebration of the Eucharist.

===Mass is interrupted: the investiture with the sword===

Once the Eucharistic celebration was paused after the Gradual, the emperor, who until then remained kneeling, reading and listening to the Mass together with his domestic chaplains under the canopy of the throne, stood and descended from the throne dais, and, accompanied by the assistant bishops, entered the presbitery and presented himself once more to the celebrating archbishop or bishop, kissing his hand. Meanwhile, the prelate had descended from the Episcopal cathedra and had sat once more at the faldstool at the centre of the altar. The emperor then knelt before the presiding prelate, to be invested with the imperial sword. The prelate stood to perform this ceremony. A deacon brought the sword from the altar in its scabbard, and presented it to the Minister of War, who removed it from its scabbard and delivered it to the celebrating archbishop or bishop, who took it by the blade and presented it to the emperor, who took it by its base, while the celebrating prelate pronounced the long and very ancient formula for the delivery of the sword, ''Accipe gladium de Altare sumptum per nostras manus...'',&lt;ref&gt;Accipe gladium de altari sumptum per nostras manus, licet indignas, vice tamen, et auctoritate sanctorum Apostolorum consecratas, tibi imperialiter concessum, nostraeque bene + dictionis officio in defensionem sanctae Dei Ecclesiae divinitus ordinatum: et memor esto ejus, de quo Psalmista prophetavit, dicens: Accingere gladio tuo super femur tuum, potentissime: ut in hoc per eumdem vim aequitatis exerceas, molem iniquitatis potenter destruas, et sanctam Dei Ecclesiam, ejusque fideles propugnes, ac protegas; nec minus sub fide falsos, quam christiani nominis hostes exsecreris, ac dispergas: viduas, et pupillos clementer adjuves ac defendas; desolata restaures, restaurata conserves: ulciscaris injusta, confirmes bene disposita; quatenus haec agendo, virtutum triumpho gloriosus, justitiaeque cultor egregius, cum mundi Salvatore sine fine regnare merearis.  Qui cum Deo Patre, et Spiritu Sancto vivit et regnat Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt; in the following words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Receive from our hands that, though unworthy, have yet been consecrated to be in the place and discharge the authority of the holy Apostles, the sword brought from the Altar,  which is given to you as emperor, and which, as ordained by God, is dedicated by our blessing (''here a sign of the Cross was made'') to the defence of the Holy Church of God; and be mindful of what the Psalmist prophetised, saying "Gird yourself with your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty one", that by it you may excercise the force of equity, mightily destroy the growth of iniquity, protect and advance the Holy Church of God and its faithful people; no less than you shall pursue and disperse the false faithful and the enemies of the Christian name; mercifully help and defend widows and orphans, restore those things which have fallen into decay and maintain those things that were restored, avenge injustices and confirm good dispositions; that, in so doing, you may be glorious by the triumph of virtue, and be an eminent cultivator of justice, that you may merit to reign without end with the Saviour of the world, Who lives and reigns with God the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After this formula was recited, the emperor gave the sword back to the officiating archbishop or bishop, who gave it back to the deacon, who gave it back to the Minister of War, who placed it in its scabbard. And then the Minister of War returned the sword, in its scabbard, to the deacon, who returned it to the celebrating prelate, who tied it to the emperor's waist by the left tigh, and after the emperor was thus girded with the sword, the prelate pronounced the formula ''Accingere gladio tuo'', etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Accingere gladio tuo super femur tuum, potentissime; et attende, quod Sancti non in gladio, sed per fidem vicerunt regna.&lt;/ref&gt; in the following words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gird yourself with your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty one, and beware that the Saints conquered kingdoms not through the sword, but by the Faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The emperor then arose, and removed the sword from its scabbard, and made vibrations and motions with it in the air and passed with the blade through his left arm as though cleansing it, and then replaced the sword in the scabbard at his thigh, and knelt once more.

===The crowning of the emperor===
[[File:coronation of dom pedro II.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A painting depiciting a kneeling man being crowned by a mitered bishop, and surrounded by clerics and uniformed courtiers with a crowd of onlookers in the background|The crowning of Emperor Pedro II, 18 July 1841.]]

All the assisting bishops then gathered around the emperor in the form of a circle, while the celebrating archbishop or bishop went to the altar himself to pick up the imperial crown. The emperor, still kneeling, was then reverently crowned by the celebrating prelate, in the Name of the [[Trinity|Most Holy Trinity]], and all the bishops placed their hands on top of the crown,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genealogiafreire.com.br/jeo_coroacao_e_sagracao_de_pedro_ii.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liturgialatina.org/pontificale/120.htm&lt;/ref&gt; while the presiding prelate recited aloud the formula ''Accipe coronam imperii...'' (''Receive the crown of the Empire...'')&lt;ref&gt;This formula was identical to the formula ''Accipe coronam regni...'' (Receive the crown of the Kingdom...) contained in the Roman Pontifical, except for the alteration of all mentions of "kingdom" to mentions of "empire".&lt;/ref&gt;, that was recited also in a subdued voice by the other bishops, and as the names of each of the Three Divine Persons were spoken, signs of the Cross were made over the newly crowned emperor to bless his crowing, as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Receive the Crown of the Empire, that by the hands of us bishops, though unworthy, is imposed upon your head (''at this point the crown was lowered at the head of the monarch by the celebrating archbishop or bishop and he and the other bishops placed their hands upon it''), in the name of the Father (''at this point all prelates made a first sign of the cross over the crowned emperor''), and of the Son (''at this point a second sign of the cross was made''), and of the Holy Spirit (''at this point a third sign of the cross was made''); and know that it signifies the glory of holiness, honour, and righteousness, and do not ignore that by it you become a partaker in our ministry; so that, just as we are in the [[internal forum]] pastors and rectors of souls, so be you in the external forum a sincere worshiper of God and a strenuous defender assisting the Church of Christ against all adversities; and may you show yourself to be a useful trustee and a profitable ruler of the Empire that God has given you and committed to your government by means of our blessing as placeholders of the Apostles and with the aid of all the saints; so that, ornamented with the jewels of the virtues, and crowned with the reward of everlasting happiness, you may have among the glorious athletes a glory without end with our Saviour and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, in whose Name and place you believe to govern, Who lives and rules, one God, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;Accipe coronam imperii, quae, licet ab indignis, Episcoporum tamen manibus capiti tuo imponitur.  In nomine Pa + tris, et Fi + lii, et Spiritus + Sancti, quam sanctitatis gloriam, et honorem, et opus fortitudinis, significare intelligas, et per hanc te participem ministerii nostri non ignores.  Ita ut sicut nos in interioribus pastores, rectoresque animarum intelligimur, ita et tu in exterioribus versus Dei cultor, strenuusque contra omnes adversitates Ecclesiae Christi defensor assistas, regnique tibi a Deo dati, et per officium nostrae benedictionis in vice Apostolorum, omniumque Sanctorum, regimini tuo commissi utilis exsecutor, proficuusque regnator semper appareas; ut inter gloriosos athletas, virtutum gemmis ornatus, et praemio sempiternae felicitatis coronatus cum Redemptore, ac Salvatore nostro Jesu Christo, cujus nomen, vicemque gestare crederis, sine fine glorieris.  Qui vivit, et imperat Deus cum Patre, et Spiritu Sancto in saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the crowning proper, the bishops removed their hands from the crown and the emperor, still kneeling, received the other items of the regalia.

===The delivery of the regalia: gloves, ring, orb, rod of the Hand of Justice and sceptre===
Once the crowning was concluded, the emperor remained kneeling and received several items of Regalia without any form of words being said,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genealogiafreire.com.br/jeo_coroacao_e_sagracao_de_pedro_ii.htm&lt;/ref&gt; because those items of Regalia were not prescribed in the Roman Pontifical. The first of those items were the adorned white gloves for both hands of the emperor, followed by the delivery of the imperial ring. A deacon brought from the Altar to the presiding prelate a silver plate with the emperor's gloves and a case containing the imperial ring. The presiding archbishop or bishop then vested the emperor with the gloves, and immediately thereafter placed the ring in the fourth finger of the emperor's right hand, over the glove. The same deacon then went up to the altar, and brought the [[Globus cruciger|imperial orb]], and presented it to the presiding prelate, who delivered it to the emperor. After holding it for a while, the emperor delivered the orb to his Minister of Foreign Affairs. Afterwards, the same deacon went to the altar and picked up the rod of the Hand of Justice (''main de Justice''), and presented it to the celebrating prelate, who delivered it to the kneeling emperor. The emperor then handed the Rod of the Hand of Justice to his Justice Minister.

After the delivery of those items of regalia, the emperor then received a final insignia, that was foreseen in the Roman Pontifical, and for which, therefore, a form of words of investiture was prescribed: the [[sceptre]]. The same deacon went up the steps of the altar, and brought from the altar table the very large sceptre, and presented it to the celebrating Archbishop or bishop, who delivered it to the emperor, who took it with his right hand. The presiding prelate then recited the formula for the delivery of the sceptre, ''Accipe virgam virtutis'', etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Accipe virgam virtutis, ac veritatis, qua intelligas te obnoxium mulcere pios, terrere reprobos, errantes viam docere, lapsis manum porrigere, disperdere superbos, et revelare humiles; et aperiat tibi ostium Jesus Christus Dominus noster, qui de semetipso ait: Ego sum ostium: per me si quis introierit, salvabitur; qui est clavis David, et sceptrum domus Israel, qui aperit, et nemo claudit; claudit, et nemo aperit.  Sitque tibi ductor, qui educit vinctum de domo carceris, sedentem in tenebris, et umbra mortis: et in omnibus sequi merearis eum, de quo David propheta cecinit: Sedes tua, Deus, in saeculum saeculi: virga directionis, virga regni tui, et imitando ipsum, diligas justitiam, et odio habeas iniquitatem, quia propterea unxit te Deus, Deus tuus, et exemplum illius, quem ante saecula unxerat oleo exsultationis, prae participibus suis, Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum, qui cum eo vivit et regnat Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt; in the following words: &lt;blockquote&gt;

Receive the rod of virtue and truth and understand that with it you must encourage the pious and intimidate the reprobate; guide the straying; lend a hand to the fallen; repress the proud and raise the humble; and may Our Lord Jesus Christ open to you the door, He who said of himself, "I am the Door, whoever enters by me, by me shall be saved," and let Him who is the Key of David and the sceptre of the House of Israel be your helper: He Who opens and no one may shut, Who shuts and no one may open; and let Him be your guide, Who brings the captive out of prison, where he seats in darkness and the shadow of death; that in all things you may imitate Him, of whom the Prophet David said, "Your seat, O God, endures forever; a rod of righteousness is the rod of your kingdom". Imitating Him, may you love justice and hate iniquity. For that purpose God, your God, has anointed you, after the example of Him who before the centuries was anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows, Jesus Christ, Our Lord, Who with Him lives and reigns, God, for ever and ever. Amen.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the delivery of the imperial insignia was complete, the emperor rose to his feet, and, aided by his officers of state, removed the imperial sword, in is scabbard, from his waist. The emperor handed the sword, in its adorned scabbard, to his Minister of War, who thus bore it in its scabbard before the emperor for the remainder of the ceremony.

===The enthronement and the Te Deum===

The Ministers carrying the sword, the orb, and the rod of the Hand of Justice then stood on the side steps next to the emperor's throne. The emperor, with the crown on his head, the sceptre in his right hand, and wearing his full majestatic dress (his pallium, mantle and other robes of State) and also the gloves on both hands and the ring on the fourth finger of his right hand, then proceeded towards his throne, led by all the Bishops. The officiating prelate walked to the emperor's right, and the senior assistant prelate to the emperor's left. Aided by the bishops, the emperor ascended the steps of the throne, and, under the canopy, the emperor was placed at the throne chair by the two highest ranking prelates: the celebrating prelate held the emperor's right arm and the senior assistant prelate his left arm while seating the emperor on the throne. Once the emperor was seated, the prelates removed their hands from his arms. The emperor was thus enthroned. As soon as the monarch had taken his seat upon the throne, the presiding prelate, addressing him, recited the formula of enthronement, ''Sta et retine'', etc.:&lt;ref&gt;Sta,et retine amodo locum tibi a Deo delegatum, per auctoritatem omnipotentis Dei, et per praesentem traditionem nostram, omnium scilicet Episcoporum, ceterorumque Dei servorum; et quanto clerum sacris altaribus propinquiorem perspicis, tanto ei potiorem in locis congruis honorem impendere memineris; quatenus mediator Dei et hominum, te mediatorem cleri et plebis permanere faciat.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stay firm and hold fast to the place delegated to you by God, by the authority of Almighty God, and by this our present transmission, that is to say, of all the bishops and of other servants of God; and when you see the clergy draw near to the holy altar, remember to give them appropriate honour, so that the Mediator between God and humanity may confirm you in this position as the mediator between clergy and people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the enthronement, the presiding prelate and the other bishops went to the altar, and the presiding prelate, ascending the steps of the altar and facing it, removed his mitre and entoned the solemn hymn of praise and thanksgiving ''[[Te Deum laudamus]]'', that was continued by the choir. The officiating prelate read the hymn in silence continuously and quickly while the initial verses were still being chanted by the choir in poliphony. After finishing his quiet reading of the hymn at the altar and while the choir was still singing the same hymn, the presiding prelate left the altar and returned to the emperor's throne, standing at one of the steps of the throne at the emperor's right hand side. There the officiating prelate waited the conclusion of the singing of the Te Deum by the choir. While all the guests and participants of the coronation remained standing, the emperor remained seated in his throne, crowned and holding the sceptre.

Once the singing of the ''Te Deum'' was concluded, the celebrating archbishop or bishop recited a few verses over the emperor, while the clergy and people present recited the responses. The first exchange was: ''V. Let your hand be strengthened and your right hand be exalted''; ''R. Let justice and judgment be the foundations of your throne''.&lt;ref&gt;V. Firmetur manus tua, et exaltetun dextera tua. R. Justitia, et judicium praeparatio sedis tuae.&lt;/ref&gt; Those exchanges being finished, the officiating prelate recited two solemn prayers. During those prayers the emperor stood from the throne chair, and the archbishop remained next to him and to his right, at the steps of the throne, looking towards the Altar. The first of those two prayers was the prayer ''God who gave Moses victory...'' (''Deus qui victrices Moysi...''&lt;ref&gt;Oremus. Deus, qui victrices Moysi manus in oratione firmasti, qui quamvis aetate languesceret, infatigabili sanctitate pugnabat: ut dum Amalech iniquus vincitur, dum profanus nationum populus subjugatur, exterminatis alienigenis, hereditati tuae possessio copiosa serviret, opus manuum tuarum pia nostrae orationis exauditione confirma; habemus et nos apud te, sancte Pater, Dominum salvatorem, qui pro nobis manus suas extendit in cruce, per quem etiam precamur, Altissime, ut tua potentia suffragante, universorum hostium frangatur impietas, populusque tuus, cessante formidine, te solum timere condiscat.  Per eumdem Christum Dominum nostrum&lt;/ref&gt;); and the second was the prayer, ''God, inexplicable author of the world...'' (''Deus, inenarrabilis auctor mundi...''&lt;ref&gt;Oremus. Deus, inenarrabilis auctor mundi, conditor generis humani, confirmator regni, qui ex utero fidelis amici tui Patriarchae nostri Abrahae praeelegisti Regem saeculis profuturum, tu praesentem insignem Imperatorem hunc cum exercitu suo, per intercessionem beatae Mariae semper Virginis, et omnium Sanctorum, uberi bene + dictione locupleta; et in solium imperii firma stabilitate connecte: visita eum, sicut visitasti Moysen in rubo, Josue in praelio, Gedeonem in agro, Samuelem in templo, et illa eum siderea bene + dictione, ac sapientiae tuae rore perfunde, quam beatus David in psalterio et Salomon filius ejus, te remunerante, percepit de coelo.  Sis ei contra acies inimicorum lorica, in adversis galea, in prosperis sapientia, in protectione clypeus sempiternus.  Et praesta, ut gentes illi teneant fidem, proceres sui habeant pacem, diligant charitatem, abstineant se a cupiditate, loquantur justitiam, custodiant veritatem, et ita populus iste sub ejus imperio pullulet, coalitus benedictione aeternitatis, ut semper tripudiantes maneant in pace, ac victores.  Quod ipse praestare dignetur, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt;). While the first prayer was for the whole people, the second prayer was an additional petition of God's blessings specifically for the newly crowned emperor, and while reciting it twice the presiding prelate produced the sign of the cross towards the monarch as an act of benediction. This prayer for the emperor had the following form of words: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Let us pray. God, inexplicable author of the world, creator of the humankind, confirmer of kingdoms, Who from the descendants of Your faithful friend, our Patriarch Abraham, pre-ordained the future King of the centuries to come, may You deign to enrich this illustrious emperor here present, together with his army, with an abundant blessing (''here the sign of the cross was made towards the emperor''), by the intercession of the blessed ever Virgin Mary, and of all the saints, and unite him in firm stability to the imperial throne; visit him, as you visited Moses in the [burning] [[burning bush|bush]], Joshua in battle, [[Gideon]] in the field and Samuel in the Temple; bestow upon him same blessing (''here the sign of the cross was again made towards the emperor'') from on high, and the same infusion with the dew of Your wisdom, that the blessed David, in the Plsalter, and Solomon his son, received from Heaven, by Your concession. May You be for him an armour against the enemy hosts, a helmet in adversity, wisdom in prosperity, a perpetual shield of protection. And grant that the peoples remain faithful unto him; his peers maintain peace; love charity, abstain from greed, speak with justice, guard the truth, and thus may this people under his empire grow, united by the blessing of eternity, so that, always in triumph, they remain in peace, and victorious. This may He vouchsafe to grant, Who with You lives and reigns in unity with the Holy Spirit, forever and ever. Amen.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Coronation Mass resumed: from the Gospel until its conclusion===

Once the said prayers were finished, the celebrating archbishop or bishop left the right hand side of the monarch at the steps of the throne and returned to the altar. The celebration of the Mass was resumed from the point where it had been interrupted after the Gradual, that is to say, with the recitation of the Alleluia, or of the last verse of tract, or of the sequence. A prie-dieu was again placed in front of the throne, so that the emperor could kneel when appropriate, and, while the other sacred ministers were at the altar, the emperor's domestic chaplains again attended to him at the throne. For the reading of the Gospel, the emperor stood and removed the crown, that was delivered to one of his officers of state who stood on the side steps of the throne, bearing the crown on a cushion. At the end of the Gospel reading, the Gospel book was brought to the throne by the reading deacon for the emperor to kiss,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genealogiafreire.com.br/jeo_coroacao_e_sagracao_de_pedro_ii.htm&lt;/ref&gt; a ceremony not prescribed by the Roman Pontifical, but that was customary in solemn Masses in the presence of the emperor. The emperor resumed the use of the crown once the reading of the Gospel was finished and after having kissed the Gospel book. After the Gospel there was no homily (a sermon was preached after the conclusion of the Mass), and the Mass continued as usual in the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine form]], with the recitation of the Nicene Creed followed by the offertory.

At the offertory, after the initial prayers, and after the celebrating prelate had censed the offerings of bread and wine, the cross at the Altar, and the Altar itself, and after he handed the thurible to the deacon and was incensed himself, but before the washing of hands, the normal rite of Mass was again paused for a brief special ceremony in which the emperor presented gifts to the Church: the celebrating prelate went to his cathedra (in the case of the coronation of Pedro I, presided by the Bishop of Rio), or to a faldstool at the altar (in the case of the coronation of Pedro II, presided by the Archbishop of Salvador), and there waited for the emperor, who came from his throne, fully vested as always, and with the crown on his head and the sceptre in his right hand. Kneeling before the celebrating prelate, the emperor received from his officers of state a lit candle encrusted with gold coins, and delivered that candle to the prelate as a gift. The emperor also donated two pieces in the form of bread, one of gold, the other of silver. And after presenting the gifts, the emperor kissed the prelate's hand, rose to his feet, returned to the throne, and the liturgy of the Mass continued, with the celebrating prelate returning to the Altar for the rite of washing of hands.

In the insensations by the deacon that followed the washing of the hands of the celebrant, the emperor was incensed separately from the people, and before them. Once all ceremonies of the offertory were concluded, a special secret prayer was recited for the emperor&lt;ref&gt;Munera, Domine, quaesumus, oblata sanctifica, ut et nobis Unigeniti tui Corpus et Sanguis fiant; et Imperatori nostro ad obtinendam animae corporisque salutem, et ad peragendum injunctum officium, te largiente, usquequaque proficiant.  Per eumdem Dominun nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt; after the day's proper secret.

At the dialogue introducing the Preface, as the bishops removed their skullcaps and stood bareheaded in preparation for the [[Transubstantiation|consecration of the Eucharist]], the emperor removed his crown and delivered it to be held by the same officer of state who bore it during the Gospel reading. The emperor also delivered his sceptre to another aide. The emperor remained without crown or sceptre until the Communion, and resumed their use immediately before the postcommunion prayer. At the ''[[Sanctus]]'' the emperor knelt for the [[Canon of the Mass]] as usual, and remained kneeling at the prie-dieu at the throne dais until the conclusion of the [[Eucharistic Prayer]]. After the [[Roman Canon]], Mass continued normally, with the ''Pater Noster'' and the prayers that followed, the emperor standing or kneeling when appropriate.

For the ceremony of the kiss of peace an ''[[Pax (liturgical object)|instrumentum pacis]]'' was used, and the emperor received the greeting from the senior assistant bishop.

For the reception of Holy Communion, after the celebrating archbishop or bishop had taken communion under the appearances of bread and wine, and after the rites in preparation for the communion of the faithful had taken place, the emperor descended from the throne and went to the altar. There, by special privilege, he ascended the altar steps, and, arriving near to the altar table, he knelt at the altar's highest step to receive Communion. He then kissed the celebrating Prelate's hand, and received the Eucharist, under the species of bread alone (as usual for the lay faithful and even for the clergy other than the celebrant). Though a few other coronation rites contained special privileges allowing for the reception of Communion under both kinds by the monarch on coronation day (such as the rite of coronation of the kings of France), the general coronation rite of the Roman Pontifical did not contemplate this. On the contrary, the rubrics of the Roman Pontifical expressly reiterated that the celebrant should drink the whole of the Eucharist under the appearance of wine, so that the monarch, though allowed to ascend to the altar, received Communion only under the appearance of bread.

Only the celebrating prelate and the emperor received Communion during the Coronation Mass. After receiving Communion and consumming the [[Communion bread|Sacred Host]], and after having said in silence his private devotional prayers customary upon the reception of the Eurcharist, and while the Communion antiphon was still being chanted by the choir, the emperor, still kneeling at the highest step of the Altar, performed ablutions with the chalice, that was then presented to him by the celebrating prelate. The celebrant also performed ablutions, and drank the contents of the chalice.

Returning to the throne, the emperor resumed the use of his crown and sceptre, and rose from the throne chair to hear the prayers after Communion. After the prayer of the day, a special postcommunion prayer was recited for the emperor&lt;ref&gt;Haec, Domine, oblatio salutaris, famulum tuum N. Imperatorem nostrum ab omnibus tueatur adversis; quatenus et ecclesiasticae pacis obtineat tranquillitatem, et post hujus temporis decursum ad aeternam perveniat haereditatem.  Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.  R. Amen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass thereafter continued normally until its conclusion. For the [[Last Gospel]], the emperor again, for the third and last time, removed his crown, and remained uncrowned until the conclusion of the sermon that followed the Mass, the promulgation of indulgences and the imparting of the solemn blessing, as described below, resuming the use of the crown as soon as the blessing was given.

===After the Mass: final rites in the Church===

====The sermon and the solemn final blessing====

Immediately after the Last Gospel, the Mass being finished, a sermon was preached. The emperor, without crown as described above, but holding the sceptre, sat on the throne to hear the sermon. The sermon for the coronation of Pedro I was preached by the friar preacher of the imperial household, and the sermon for the coronation of Pedro II was preached by the abbot general of the Order of St. Benedict in Brazil. The theme of this last sermon was the anointing of Solomon by Zadok the Priest and Nathan the Prophet.

After the sermon, the indulgences granted by the presiding prelate were announced, and the prelate imparted upon all those present the solemn pontifical blessing, according to the form contained in the Roman Pontifical for use in special occasions. The rubrics of this promulgation of indulgences and solemn blessing were contained in the Roman Pontifical under the heading ''Ritus et Formula Absolutionis et Benedictionis Pontificalis post homiliam seu sermonem infra Missae solemnis celebratione''. The rubrics of the coronation rite also specifically called for this blessing to be given at the end of the coronation liturgy.

Once the solemn pontifical blessing was given, the emperor resumed the use of his crown. The said blessing concluded the liturgical acts of the coronation.

After the solemn blessing, in the case of the coronation of Pedro II, the emperor commanded the exit procession to start, and in procession departed the church.

====The civil oaths at the coronation of Pedro I in 1822====

In the case of the 1822 coronation of Emperor Pedro I, however, the liturgy of the coronation proper was followed by oaths that were taken by the emperor and by representatives of the people, still inside the church. Only after those oaths were taken, Emperor Pedro I commanded the exit procession to start and departed the church.

Those oaths taken at the conclusion of Pedro I's coronation were religious in character, because they were made on the Gospels in the presence of the clergy and inside the cathedral where the coronation had taken place, but they were not composed by the Church, and they should not be confused with the oath known as ''the profession'', made by the emperor during the introductory rites of the coronation ceremony. The profession made at the initial stages of the coronation rite is a liturgical oath, and its text is prescribed by the Church in the Roman Pontifical. On the other hand, the oaths taken at the conclusion of Pedro I's coronation were neither liturgical nor prescribed by the Church, being instead oaths instituted by the imperial government, that is, by the civil authority.

[[File:Coroaçao pedro I 001.jpg|thumb|380px|Coronation of Pedro I of Brazil on 1 December 1822: José Clemente Pereira, presiding officer of Rio de Janeiro's city council, takes the oath of allegiance before the newly crowned emperor, who sits on the throne wearing his crown and holding his sceptre. Empress Maria Leopoldina and [[Maria II of Portugal|Princess Maria da Glória]] watch from the honour box at the second floor, opposite the throne. Painting by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]]]]

The two oaths made by Pedro I at his coronation had a different focus, contemplating a different set of promises. The ecclesiastical oath before the prayer of solemn blessing, the litany of the saints and the anointing was a traditional, centuries-old vow that focused on the rights of the Church and on a generic pledge by the monarch to honour and to do good by his nobles and other subjects. The civil oath taken still at the cathedral but immediately after the conclusion of the coronation liturgy was a promise to rule according to law and to abide by the future Constitution that would be adopted for the Empire. Therefore, the two oaths taken by Emperor Pedro I at his coronation complemented each other, as the promises made in the civil oath added to those of the ecclesiastical vow.

No such civil oaths were taken at the conclusion of Pedro II' coronation in 1841, because in 1840 he had already taken, before the Imperial Parliament, the oath prescribed by article 102 of the Empire's Constitution.

Therefore, in the coronation of Pedro II, the sermon and the final blessing were immediately followed by the exit procession and by the emperor's departure from the Church, whereas in the coronation of Pedro I the sermon and the final blessing were followed by the ceremony of the takning of the civil oaths.

This ceremony took place as follows. Aides brought a [[credence table]] to the dais of the throne. This table was placed on top of the steps, in front of the throne but to its right and not at the centre of the dais, with the emperor still sitting on the throne Chair, with the crown on his head and holding his sceptre. The Book of the Gospels was placed on the said table. The Bishop Major Chaplain, who had presided over the coronation, then took the book of the Gospels and brought it to the emperor. The Minister of Justice prompted the emperor to recite the words of the oath: the said minister made a profound reverence to the emperor and read the formula of the emperor's oath, that was repeated by the emperor from his throne Chair. While taking the oath, the seated emperor placed his hand on the Gospel book that was held by the Bishop Major Chaplain. This was followed by acclamations prompted by the [[king of arms]], that were repeated by all those present at the cathedral.

After the said acclamations, the attorneys-general representing the provinces of the empire, the president and members of Rio's city council and the representatives sent by other municipal councils were led from their places to the front of the throne, below the steps. It is worth noting that Pedro I's coronation took place in 1822 just a few months after he declared Brazil's independence from Portugal and was acclaimed as emperor, and before a Parliament could be elected. Therefore, Brazil still lacked a national Legislature, and the members of the council of attorneys-general of the provinces, the members of the capital's municipal council and the representatives of the other municipal councils that sent delegates to attend the coronation acted as the representatives of the people.

The Gospel Book was again placed on the table in front of the throne. The Minister of Justice then read aloud the formula of the collective oath of the provincial attorneys-general, members of Rio's city council and representatives sent by other municipal councils. That oath was promise of allegiance to the newly crowned emperor and his successors and to the laws of the Empire. Immediately thereafter those officers, one by one, bowing to the emperor, ascended the steps of the throne, and, kneeling at the highest step before the above-mentioned table, placed their hands on the Gospel Book and confirmed their acceptance of the oath of allegiance that the Minister had read by saying "''I do so swear''". Each officer then rose and descended from the throne steps.

The texts of the oaths prescribed by the imperial government to be taken by Emperor Pedro I and by the provincial attorneys-general, members of Rio's city council and representatives of other councils were published in a government decision dated 27 November 1822 that is included in the official collection of the Empire's legislation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.camara.leg.br/atividade-legislativa/legislacao/publicacoes/doimperio/pdf/Legimp-F_67.pdf/Legimp-F_75.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The oath taken by Emperor Pedro I was worded in Latin and the oath taken by the officers representing the people was worded in Portuguese.

After all the officers who were required to take the oath of allegiance had done so, Emperor Pedro I commanded the start of the exit procession, and departed from the cathedral.

===Ceremonies and festivities outside the church===

For the exit procession, all participants of the cortège left the cathedral in the same order of their entrance. The emperor, from the moment he descended the throne steps to enter the procession, was flanked by knights who bore a canopy over his head, and he remained under that pall for the duration of the cortège. The emperor's departure from the church was followed by other ceremonies, that in the case of the coronation of Pedro I took place inside the Imperial Palace of the City, and in the case of the coronation of Pedro II took place in the temporary building connecting the church to the palace, and known as coronation balcony.

The first of those ceremonies was an act of homage to the newly crowned emperor by his ecclesiastical and lay subjects: with the emperor still crowned and sitting on a throne (in the throne room of the palace, in the case of Pedro I, or in a hall of the coronation Balcony, in the case of Pedro II), the clergy that took part in the coronation passed by, stopped facing the throne, bowed deeply, from the waist, and chanted, one by one, the Latin formula ''"ad multos annos"'', meaning ''for many years''.

After this act of homage by the clergy, the homage of the lay subjects took place, with a different format that took the form of a ''[[baciamano]]'': Ministers, officers of state and nobles came and passed in front of the throne, performing their act of homage by ascending the steps to the throne, genuflecting and kissing the emperor's hand, before descending the steps of the throne. This act of homage by [[hand-kissing|kissing hands]] as a sign of fidelity and obedience was known in Portuguese as ''beija-mão''.

After those acts of homage were concluded, the emperors presented themselves to the public: Emperor Pedro II approached the front of the coronation Balcony, and Emperor Pedro I went to a palace balcony. With the emperor in full view of the people, wearing his robes, crown and sceptre, heralds sounded trumpets, drums beat, banners were unruffled, and a king of arms proclaimed that the emperor's consecration and coronation was accomplished. As part of this proclamation, the emperor's title was declared in full, and triple acclamations were prompted. After the acclamations, gun salutes followed, amidst other spontaneous popular acclamations.

Leaving the balcony, the emperor then went to a hall where, seating on a throne, he received for a ''baciamano'' other civil servants, senators, members of the Chamber of Deputies and members of the imperial orders, ladies of distinction, etc., and other invited guests. For this reception of people who greeted the emperor after his balcony appearance, he was already divested of the crown, which was placed on a cushion next to the throne. Afterwards, the emperor received in the throne room of the imperial palace of the city delegations (from the city council of Rio de Janeiro, from the Senate, from the Chamber of Deputies, etc.) who came to present their loyal addresses commemorating the coronation.

Later, having removed his robes of state, but wearing gala uniform, the emperor offered a banquet to his guests. Pedro II's coronation Banquet was served in the City Palace at 6 p.m. A dinner for all functionaries of the imperial household was served after the imperial banquet. In the case of the 1841 coronation, from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m., after the coronation banquet was concluded and Emperor Pedro II had retired to his private appartmens at the City Palace, ordinary members of the public who were decently dressed were allowed to visit the adjoining coronation balcony building and to view the [[Crown Jewels]] on display.

Finally, the emperor and his family returned to the Imperial Palace of St. Christopher.

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Angola]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

[[Image:Angola demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of [[Angola]], Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
According to 2014 census data, Angola had a population of 25,789,024 inhabitants in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiangola.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Publicação-Resultados-Definitivos-Censo-Geral-2014_Versão-22032016_DEFINITIVA-18H17.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506013702/http://aiangola.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Publica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Resultados-Definitivos-Censo-Geral-2014_Vers%C3%A3o-22032016_DEFINITIVA-18H17.pdf |date=May 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnically, there are three main groups, each speaking a [[Bantu language]]: the [[Southern Mbundu people|Ovimbundu]] who represent 37% of the population, the [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]] with 25%, and the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] 13%. Other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] and [[Lunda people|Lunda]], the [[Ganguela]] and [[Nyaneka]]-[[Khumbi]] (in both cases classification terms that stand for a variety of small groups), the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], the [[Herero people|Herero]],  the [[Xindonga]] and scattered residual groups of [[San people|San]]. In addition, mixed race (European and African) people amount to about 2%, with a small (1%) population of whites, mainly ethnically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].

As a [[Angola (Portugal)|former overseas territory of Portugal]] until 1975, Angola possesses a Portuguese population of over 200,000, a number that has been growing from 2000 onwards, because of Angola's growing demand for qualified human resources.&lt;ref&gt;In 1974, white Angolans made up a population of 330,000 to 350,000 people in an overall population of 6.3 million Angolans at that time. The only reliable source on these numbers is Gerald Bender &amp; Stanley Yoder, ''Whites in Angola on the Eve of Independence: The Politics of Numbers'', ''Africa Today'', 21 (4) 1974, pp. 23 - 37. Today, many Angolans who are not ethnic Portuguese can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law.

From the 2000s, many Chinese have settled and started up small businesses, while at least as many have come as workers for large enterprises (construction or other). Observers claim that the Chinese community in Angola might include as many as 300,000 persons at the end of 2010, but reliable statistics are not at this stage available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9052011.stm|title=BBC News - Chinese karaoke fans sing Angola's praises|website=news.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974/75, over 25,000 [[Cuba]]n soldiers arrived in Angola to help the MPLA forces at the beginning of the [[Angolan Civil War]]. Once this was over, a massive development cooperation in the field of health and education brought in numerous civil personnel from Cuba. However, only a very small percentage of all these people has remained in Angola, either for personal reasons (intermarriage) or as professionals (e.g., medical doctors).

The largest religious denomination is [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], to which adheres about half the population. Roughly 26% are followers of traditional forms of [[Protestantism]] (Congregationals, Methodists, Baptista, Lutherans, Reformed), but over the last decades there has in addition been a growth of Pentecostal communities and [[African Initiated Church]]es. In 2006, one out of 221 people were [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Blacks from Mali, Nigeria and Senegal are mostly Sunnite Muslims, but do not make up more than 1 - 2% of the population. By now few Angolans retain [[African traditional religion]]s following different ethnic faiths.

==Population==
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Angola}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 4 148 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 46.6%, 50.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 2.5% was 65 years or older

===Health===
{{See also|HIV/AIDS in Angola}}
According to the CIA World Factbook, 2% of adults (aged 15–49) are living with HIV/AIDS (as of 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of contracting disease is very high. There are food and waterborne diseases, bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever; vectorborne diseases, malaria, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness); respiratory disease: meningococcal meningitis, and schistosomiasis, a water contact disease, as of 2005.

===Ethnic groups===
[[File:Angola Ethnic map 1970.svg|thumb|right|300px|Ethnic groups of Angola 1970]]
Roughly 37% of Angolans are [[Ovimbundu]], 25% are [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]], 13% are [[Bakongo]], 2% are [[mestiço]], 1-2% are [[White Africans of European ancestry|white Africans]], and people from other African ethnicities make up 22% of Angola's population.

===Religions===
{{Main article|Religion in Angola}}
Angola is a majority Christian country. Official statistics don't exist, but it is estimated that over 80% belong to a Christian church or community. More than half are [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], the remaining ones comprising members of traditional [[Protestant]] churches as well as of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] communities. Only 1 - 2% are [[Muslim]]s  - generally immigrants from other African countries. Traditional indigenous religions are practized by a very small minority, generally in peripheral rural societies.

===Education===
{{Main article|Education in Angola}}
Literacy is quite low, with 71.1% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese. 82% of males and 60.7% of women are literate as of 2015.

===Languages===
{{Main article|Languages of Angola}}
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of Angola, but [[Bantu language|Bantu]] and other African languages are also widely spoken. In fact, [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu languages|Kimbundu]], [[Umbundu]], [[Chokwe language|Tuchokwe]], [[Ganguela|Nganguela]], and [[Kwanyama dialect|Ukanyama]] have the official status of "national languages". The mastery of Portuguese is widespread; in the cities the overwhelming majority are either fluent in Portuguese or have at least a reasonable working knowledge of this language; an increasing minority are native Portuguese speakers and have a poor, if any, knowledge of an African language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16075">The '''Figure Rating Scale''' (FRS) also known as the '''Stunkard Scale''' is a [[psychometrics|psychometric]] measurement developed in 1983 as a tool to determine [[body image|body]] dissatisfaction in women and  men.&lt;ref&gt;Grogan, S.(2009). Routledge: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This scale has also been developed for measuring adolescent body image. This type of measurement was originally developed and validated to indicate the weight status of relatives of research subjects when other specific measurements or self-reported values were unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;Cardinal, T.M., Karciroti, N., &amp; Lumeng, J.C. (2006). The figure rating scale as an index of weight status of women on videotape. ''Obesity'', ''14''(12), 2132-2135.&lt;/ref&gt; This scale is a visible measure of how an individual perceives his or her own physical appearance. Each figure presents nine male and nine female schematic silhouettes, ranging from extreme thinness to extreme obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Stunkard, A., Sorenson, T., &amp; Schulsinger, F. (1983). Use of Danish adoption register for the study of obesity and thinness. In S. Kety, L.P. Rowland, R.L. Sidman, &amp; S.W. Matthysse (Eds.), ''The genetics of neurological and psychiatric disorders.'' New York: Raven. 115-120. &lt;/ref&gt; For research purposes, participants are asked to self-select the silhouette that best indicates his or her current body size and the silhouette that reflects his or her ideal body size (IBS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112417746/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 International Journal of Eating Disorders]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Reliability and Validity==

Past research has tested the reliability and validity of the figure rating scale. In order to test the strength and reliability of this measurement, researchers assigned six specific instructions to ask of their participants during figure selection. The instructions are as follows: (1) choose your ideal figure; (2) choose the figure that reflects how you think you look; (3) choose the figure that reflects how you feel most of the time; (4) choose the figure that you think is most preferred by men; (5) choose the figure that you think is most preferred by women; and (6) pick the opposite sex figure that you find most attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J.K., &amp; Altabe, M.N. (1991). Psychometric qualities of the figure rating scale. ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'', ''10''(5), 615-619.&lt;/ref&gt; For validity analyses, the figure ratings can be transformed into the three following discrepancy measures: (1) feel minus ideal; (2) think minus ideal; and (3) feel minus think.&lt;ref&gt; Thompson, J.K., &amp; Altabe, M.N. (1991). Psychometric qualities of the figure rating scale. ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'', ''10''(5), 615-619.&lt;/ref&gt; The instructions developed for these measures may be interchanged depending on the specific topic of research or category of observation. Each research study may provide a different set of reliability and validity assessments for the figure rating scale dependent upon the goal and procedures of the study. 

==Trends in Research==

The figure rating scale has been used in several influential studies on body image, body satisfaction, and [[eating disorders]]. Research involving the figure rating scale has related the techniques of this measurement to identify how [[gender]], [[mass media|media]], [[race (human classification)|race]], and [[culture]] have an effect on how sensitive an individual is to his or her own physical appearance. Results may differ dependent upon the variables in question during observation. 

The majority of research involving the figure rating scale focuses on observing body dissatisfaction. This research area also focuses primarily on the effects of gender on body dissatisfaction. In association with the figure rating scale, there has been more research conducted on female body image. Studies of body dissatisfaction have shown that women have a tendency to choose a smaller ideal body size than their current body size.&lt;ref&gt;Cororve Fingeret, M., Gleaves, D., &amp; Pearson, C. (2004). On the Methodology of Body Image Assessment: the use of figural rating scales to evaluate body dissatisfaction and the ideal body standards of women.  ''Body Image'', ''2'', 207-212&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy between the two figure selections indicates body dissatisfaction. A high level of body dissatisfaction can lead to [[anorexia nervosa|eating disorders]] or [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Body dissatisfaction is also influenced by a variety of different factors. 

Other research that involves the figure rating scale indicates that the media is an important factor in body dissatisfaction. &lt;ref&gt; Bissell, K. L. (2004b). What do these messages really mean? Sports media exposure, sports participation, and body image distortion in women between the ages of 18 and 75. ''Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly'', ''81''(1), 108-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Media influences can have an effect on how individuals feel about their own body image. Body types presented in the media can also have an influence on the physical appearance that an individual desires to obtain. Research suggests that women are mostly influenced by media images that promote [[The Thin Ideal]] body type. &lt;ref&gt; Bissell, K., &amp; Rask, A. (2010). Real women on real beauty: Self-discrepancy, internalization of the thin ideal, and perceptions of attractiveness and thinness in Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty. ''International Journal of Advertising'', ''29''(4), 643-668. doi:10.2501/S026504871020138&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, men are mostly influenced by media images that promote a more muscular build. &lt;ref&gt; Leit, R. A., &amp; Pope Jr., H. G. (2001). Cultural expectations of muscularity in men: The evolution of playgirl centerfolds. ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'', ''29''(1), 90-93. &lt;/ref&gt; These influences may cause participants to choose a silhouette on the figure rating scale that represents themselves as the opposite of the desired body type in the media. Additionally, when asked to point to the image of their desired body type, participants may choose a silhouette on the scale that is more similar to attractive body types that are presented in the media. 

The figure rating scale has also been utilized in observations that involved race as a variable. There has been some comparative study that focuses on the body image perceptions among Caucasian, Asian, and African-American college women. Through this observation, African-American women chose larger ideal body sizes from the figures provided in the scale than the Caucasian and Asian women. &lt;ref&gt; Gluck, M. E., &amp; Geliebter, A. (2002). Racial/ethnic differences in body image and eating behaviors. ''Eating behaviors'', ''3''(2), 143-151.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area of body image suggests that each race or ethnicity has its own concept of an ideal body type. Each ideal body type is unique to that race or ethnicity. 

The figure rating scale has also been translated into different languages in order for body image research to be conducted in other countries. For example, researchers have developed a Portuguese version of this scale for body image research in Brazil. &lt;ref&gt; Scagliusi, F. B., Alvarenga, M., Polacow, V. O., Cordás, T. A., de Oliveira Queiroz, G. K., Coelho, D., ... &amp; Lancha, A. H. (2006). Concurrent and discriminant validity of the Stunkard's figure rating scale adapted into Portuguese. ''Appetite'', ''47''(1), 77-82.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of development also allows researchers to be able to compare findings of one culture to another. For example, one comparative study showed the silhouettes in the figure rating scale to college women in Korea and the United States. The women were asked to choose their ideal body type on the scale. After comparing the results, the Korean women were more dissatisfied with their bodies due to the pressures of thinness that exist in that particular culture. &lt;ref&gt; Jung, J., &amp; Forbes, G. (2006). Multidimensional assessment of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in Korean and US college women: A comparative study. ''Sex Roles'', ''55''(1/2), 39-50. doi:10.1007/s11199-006-9058-3&lt;/ref&gt; Another research study used the figure rating scale to observe the differences in actual body size and ideal body size among women born in Australia and Hong Kong in which the Australian women scored higher in body dissatisfaction. &lt;ref&gt; Lake, A. J., &amp; Staiger, P. K. (2000). Effect of Western Culture on Women's Attitudes to Eating and Perceptions of Body Shape. ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'', ''27''(1), 83-89.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Correlated Measurements==

Results from figure observations have been applied to other scales in order to assess for body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. These scales provide more data that can assist researchers in determining the reasons for why an individual will select a particular silhouette on the figure rating scale. 

The [[Eating Disorder Inventory]] (EDI) assess for various aspects of eating disorders. &lt;ref&gt;Garner, D.M., Olmstead, M.A., &amp; Polivy, J. (1983). Development and validation of a multidimensional eating disorder inventory for anorexia nervosa and bulimia. ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'',''2'', 15-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the addition of the subscales from this inventory, researchers are able to indicate how an individual, that may suffer or show symptoms of eating disorders, perceives their physical appearance. 

The Bulimia (B) Scale has also been utilized in research involving the figure rating scale. This scale provides seven item measures that analyze the symptoms of [[bulimia]] such as binging or purging.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, J., &amp; Forbes, G. (2006). Multidimensional assessment of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in Korean and US college women: A comparative study. ''Sex Roles'', ''55''(1/2), 39-50. doi:10.1007/s11199-006-9058-3&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Drive for Thinness (DT) is another scale that has been used in studies with the figure rating scale. This scale consists of seven items that measure the intensity of an individual’s desire to lose weight or fear of gaining weight.&lt;ref&gt; Sands, R. (2000). Reconceptualization of body image and drive for thinness. ''International Journal of Eating Disorders'', ''28''(4), 397-407. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The Body Dissatisfaction (BD) Scale consists of nine items and measures the extent to which individuals are satisfied with specific parts of the body.&lt;ref&gt; Bissell, K. L. (2004). Sports model/sports mind: The relationship between entertainment and sports media exposure, sports participation, and body image distortion in Division 1 female athletes. ''Mass Communication &amp; Society'', ''7''(4), 453-472. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Bissell, K. L., &amp; Zhou, P. (2004). Must-see TV or ESPN: Entertainment and sports media exposure and body-image distortion in college women. ''Journal of Communication'', ''54''(1), 5-21. &lt;/ref&gt;This scale has been used in conjunction with the figure rating scale in order to observe if an individual’s sensitivity to a particular body part results in the individual for choosing the silhouette that they do during observation. 

The Body-Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults (BESAA) has also been used in conjunction with research that involves the figure rating scale. This scale consists of twenty-three statements that measure an individual’s general feelings about his or her physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt; Jung, J., &amp; Forbes, G. (2006). Multidimensional assessment of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in Korean and US college women: A comparative study. ''Sex Roles'', ''55''(1/2), 39-50. doi:10.1007/s11199-006-9058-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied Theoretical Frameworks==

In order to properly use this type of measurement, it is important to understand how researchers have applied theoretical frameworks to analyze results gathered from the use of the figure rating scale. This scale is most associated with theories that are used in body image research. Researchers conducting observations in this area will also utilize theories from areas such as [[psychology]] and [[communications]]. These fields provide theories that allow researchers to understand some of the reasons why an individual will choose a certain silhouette to represent his or her own body type. 

The [[social comparison theory]] has been associated with the figure rating scale. This theory suggests that individuals will compare their own physical appearance to the body images presented in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1954). A theory of social comparison processes. ''Human Relations'', ''7'', 117-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have used this theory in association with the figure rating scale to understand if individuals will change their figure choice after social comparing themselves to other individuals. People may compare themselves to peers, celebrities, or other individuals presented in the media.&lt;ref&gt; Botta, R. A. (2000). The mirror of television: A comparison of black and white adolescents' body image. ''Journal of Communication'', ''50''(3), 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Northup, T. (2012). The role of image body size, race, and familiarity on subsequent evaluations of the self. ''Southwestern Mass Communication Journal'', ''27''(3), 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Self-discrepancy theory]] has also been used in research along with the figure rating scale. This theory has generally been applied to body image research to understand the three domains of the self: the actual self, the ideal self, and the ought self. &lt;ref&gt; Harrison, K., Taylor, L. D., &amp; Marske, A. L. (2006). Women's and men's eating behavior following exposure to ideal-body images and text. ''Communication Research'', ''33''(6), 507-529. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Veale, D., Kinderman, P., Riley, S., &amp; Lambrou, C. (2003). Self-dicrepancy in body dysmorphic disorder. ''British Journal of Clinical Psychology'', ''42'', 157-169. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Bissell, K., &amp; Rask, A. (2010). Real women on real beauty: Self-discrepancy, internalisation of the thin ideal, and perceptions of attractiveness and thinness in Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty. ''International Journal of Advertising'', ''29''(4), 643-668. doi:10.2501/S026504871020138 &lt;/ref&gt; By asking participants to choose images on the scale, the individual may choose a separate silhouette for each domain of the self. These findings can be observed to understand the differences between an individual’s perception of his or her actual body type and ideal body type. 

==Limitations==

Since the scale’s development in 1983, there have been other body image measurements that have been created for research in this area. This action is partly due to the scale being outdated. Although the original development of the figure rating scale has been utilized in a substantial amount of research, there are some limitations to this measurement. The line-drawn silhouettes provided in the scale may not provide a clear presentation of the average human body. As the silhouettes in the scale shift from very thin to very obese, the figures gain more in the middle of the body. While this type of body image may be representative of some individuals, there is a wide range of possible body types that are not represented in the original scale. Some individuals may have broader shoulders or wider hips than in the images provided in the scale; therefore, the participants may have a more difficult time choosing the appropriate figure to represent their physical appearance. Research has also translated this scale into photographic images with real people. &lt;ref&gt;  Swami, V., Salem, N., Furnham, A., &amp; Tovée, M. J. (2008). Initial examination of the validity and reliability of the female Photographic Figure Rating Scale for body image assessment. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', ''44''(8), 1752-1761. &lt;/ref&gt; These three-dimensional images are able to depict a more realistic presentation of different body types.

'''Free love''' is a [[social movement]] that accepts all forms of [[love]]. The Free Love movement's initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. "The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism." Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Principles==
Much of the free love tradition reflects a [[Liberalism|liberal]] philosophy that seeks [[freedom (political)|freedom]] from [[State (polity)|state]] regulation and [[Christian Church|church]] interference in [[personal relationship]]s. According to this concept, the [[free union]]s of [[adult]]s are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure without social or legal restraints. In the [[Victorian era]], this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], anti-repressive sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514004631/http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 |date=14 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to today's stereotype, earlier middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. To this mentality are attributed strongly-defined gender roles, which led to a minority reaction in the form of the free-love movement.&lt;ref name="Spurlock, John C 1988"&gt;Spurlock, John C. Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase ''free love'' is often associated with [[promiscuity]] in the popular imagination, especially in reference to the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and 1970s, historically the free-love movement has not advocated multiple-sexual partners or short-term sexual relationships. Rather, it has argued that sexual relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law.

The term "sex radical" is also used interchangeably with the term "free lover", and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of "free love".{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forced sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.&lt;ref name="Passet, Joanne E 2003"&gt;Passet, Joanne E. Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality. Chicago, IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws of particular concern to free love movements have included those that prevent an unmarried couple from living together, and those that regulate [[:adultery]] and [[:divorce]], as well as [[:age of consent]], [[:birth control]], [[:homosexuality]], [[:abortion]], and sometimes [[:prostitution]]; although not all free-love advocates agree on these issues. The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern—for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize [[spousal rape]] or treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape. &lt;!--the meaning of the preceding sentence is unclear. Does this mean Free Love advocates support of greater individual rights within marriage, or does free love abrogate such rights? Of course it is the former, but the preceding sentence should be rewritten to reflect this more clearly, especially for readers with shorter attention spans or for whom English is not one's first language.--&gt;Free-love movements since the 19th century have also defended the right to publicly discuss sexuality and have battled [[obscenity]] laws.

At the turn of the 20th century, some free-love proponents extended the critique of marriage to argue that marriage as a social institution encourages emotional possessiveness and psychological enslavement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Relationship to feminism===
{{See also|Sex-positive feminism}}
The history of free love is entwined with the history of [[feminism]]. From the late 18th century, leading feminists, such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], have challenged the institution of marriage, and many have advocated its abolition.&lt;ref name="historyguide1"&gt;Kreis, Steven. "Mary Wollstonecraft, 1759–1797". The History Guide. 23 November 2009 &lt;http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/wollstonecraft.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to feminist critique, a married woman was solely a wife and mother, denying her the opportunity to pursue other occupations; sometimes this was legislated, as with bans on married women and mothers being employed as [[teacher]]s. In 1855, free love advocate [[Mary Gove Nichols]] (1810–1884) described marriage as the "annihilation of woman," explaining that women were considered to be men's property in law and public sentiment, making it possible for tyrannical men to deprive their wives of all freedom.&lt;ref name="Gove-NicholsAuto1855"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mary Lyndon, or Revelations of a Life. An Autobiography | volume=|url=https://archive.org/stream/marylyndonorreve00nich#page/166/mode/2up  |last=Nichols | first=Mary S. Gove|authorlink=Talk:Free love#Mary Sargeant Gove Nichols|year=1855| publisher=Stringer &amp; Townsend | location=New York | page=166|accessdate=14 January 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Mary Gove, 1855. ''Mary Lyndon: Revelations of a Life''. New York: Stringer and Townsend; p. 166. Quoted in [http://www.h-net.org/~women/papers/freelove.html Feminism and Free Love]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the law often allowed a husband to beat his wife. Free-love advocates argued that many children were born into unloving marriages out of compulsion, but should instead be the result of choice and affection—yet children born out of wedlock did not have the same rights as children with married parents.&lt;ref name="Silver-Isenstadt2002"&gt;{{cite book | title=Shameless: The Visionary Life of Mary Gove Nichols | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jmGUJudA3bsC&amp;pg=PP21#v=onepage | last=Silver-Isenstadt| first=Jean L | year=2002 | publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press | location=Baltimore, Maryland | page=|isbn=0-8018-6848-3 | accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857, in the ''Social Revolutionist'', Minerva Putnam complained that "in the discussion of free love, no woman has attempted to give her views on the subject" and challenged every woman reader to "rise in the dignity of her nature and declare herself free."&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, ''Grassroots feminists: women, free love, and the power of print'' (1999), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century at least six books endorsed the concept of free love, all of which were written by men. However of the four major free-love periodicals following the U. S. civil war, half had female editors. Mary Gove Nichols was the leading-female advocate and the woman most looked up to in the free-love movement. Her autobiography became the first argument against marriage written from a woman's point of view.&lt;ref name="Spurlock, John 1994"&gt;Spurlock, John. "A Masculine View of Women's Freedom: Free Love in the Nineteenth Century." International Social Science Review 69.3/4 (1994): 34–45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

To proponents of free love, the act of sex was not just about reproduction. Access to [[birth control]] was considered a means to women's independence, and leading birth-control activists also embraced free love. Sexual radicals remained focused on their attempts to uphold a woman's right to control her body and to freely discuss issues such as [[contraception]], marital-sex abuse (emotional and physical), and [[sexual education]]. These people believed that by talking about female sexuality, they would help empower women. To help achieve this goal, such radical thinkers relied on the written word, books, pamphlets, and periodicals, and by these means the movement was sustained for over fifty years, spreading the message of free love all over the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Passet, Joanne E.

==History==

===Early precedents===
[[File:The arrest of Adamites in a public square in Amsterdam. Etch Wellcome V0035701.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Adamites]] were a sect that rejected marriage. Pictured, they are being rounded up for their heretical views.]]
A number of utopian social movements throughout history have shared a vision of free love. The all-male [[Essenes]], who lived in the Middle East from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD apparently shunned sex, marriage, and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Essenes#Contemporary ancient sources]]&lt;/ref&gt; They also renounced wealth, lived communally, and were pacifist&lt;ref&gt;Although they appear to have been involved in a revolt against the Roman occupiers&lt;/ref&gt; vegetarians.  An [[Early Christian]] sect known as the [[Adamites]] existed in North Africa in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th centuries and rejected marriage. They practiced [[nudism]] and believed themselves to be without [[original sin]].

In the 6th century, adherents of [[Mazdakism]] in pre-Muslim [[Persia]] apparently supported a kind of free love in the place of marriage,&lt;ref&gt;Crone, Patricia, ''Kavad's Heresy and Mazdak's Revolt'', in: Iran 29 (1991), S. 21–40&lt;/ref&gt; and like many other free-love movements{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, also favored vegetarianism, [[pacificism]], and [[communalism]]. Some writers have posited a conceptual link between the rejection of [[private property]] and the rejection of marriage as a form of ownership{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. One folk story from the period that contains a mention of a free-love (and nudist) community under the sea is "The Tale of Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman" from ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (c. 8th century).&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Robert, ''Political Thought in The Thousand and One Nights'', in: Marvels &amp; Tales – Volume 18, Number 2, 2004, pp. 246–257. Wayne State University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Kautsky]], writing in 1895, noted that a number of "communistic" movements throughout the Middle Ages also rejected marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kautsky|Kautsky, Karl]] (1895), ''Die Vorläufer des neuen Sozialismus, vol. I: Kommunistische Bewegungen in Mittelalter'', Stuttgart: J.W. Dietz.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical of such movements, the [[Cathar]]s of 10th to 14th century Western Europe freed followers from all moral prohibition and religious obligation, but respected those who lived simply, avoided the taking of human or animal life, and were celibate. Women had an uncommon equality and autonomy, even as religious leaders. The Cathars and similar groups (the [[Waldenses]], Apostle brothers, [[Beghards]] and [[Beguines]], [[Lollards]], and [[Hussites]]) were branded as [[heresy|heretics]] by the Roman Catholic Church and suppressed. Other movements shared their critique of marriage but advocated free sexual relations rather than celibacy, such as the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]], [[Taborite]]s, and [[Picards]].

===Enlightenment thought===
[[File:Visions of the Daughters of Albion copy G plate 01.jpg|thumb|right|237px|upright|Frontispiece to [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'' (1793), which contains Blake's critique of Judeo-Christian values of marriage. Oothoon (centre) and Bromion (left), are chained together, as Bromion has raped Oothoon and she now carries his baby. Theotormon (right) and Oothoon are in love, but Theotormon is unable to act, considering her polluted, and ties himself into knots of indecision.]]
The challenges to traditional morality and religion brought by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the emancipatory politics of the [[French Revolution]] created an environment where ideas such as free love could flourish. A group of [[Political radicalism|radical]] intellectuals in England (sometimes known as the English [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]]), who supported the [[French Revolution]] developed early ideas about [[feminism]] and free love.

Notable among them was the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[William Blake]], who explicitly compared the sexual oppression of marriage to [[slavery]] in works such as ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' (1793). Blake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of [[chastity]] as a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake Poetry Foundation's bio of William Blake]&lt;/ref&gt; At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton &amp; Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws.  Poems such as "Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?" and "Earth's Answer" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem "[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]" he speaks of "the Marriage-Hearse" plagued by "the youthful Harlot's curse", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the "frozen marriage-bed". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:

{{poemquote|
Till she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound
In spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain
Of life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)
}}

Blake believed that humans were "fallen", and that a major impediment to a free love society was corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; He also seems to have thought that marriage should afford the joy of love, but that in reality it often does not,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy.

[[File:Vindication1b.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Title page reads "A VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN: WITH STRICUTRES ON POLITICAL AND MORAL SUBJECTS. BY MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT. PRINTED AT BOSTON, BY PETER EDES FOR THOMAS AND ANDREWS, Faust's Statue, No. 45, Newbury-Street, MDCCXCII."|Title page from ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], an early feminist and proponent of free love.]]
Another member of Blake's circle was the pioneering English feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and her husband and early anarchist, [[William Godwin]]. The ideals of free love found their champion in one of the earliest [[feminism|feminists]]. In her writings, Wollstonecraft challenged the institution of marriage, and advocated its abolition. Her novels criticized the social construction of marriage and its effects on women. In her first novel, ''Mary: A Fiction'' written in 1788, the heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons. She finds love in relationships with another man and a woman. The novel, ''Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman'', never finished but published in 1798, revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an asylum by her husband; Maria finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate. Mary makes it clear that "women had strong [[sexual desire]]s and that it was degrading and immoral to pretend otherwise."&lt;ref name="historyguide1"/&gt;

Wollstonecraft felt that women should not give up freedom and control of their sexuality, and thus didn't marry her partner, [[Gilbert Imlay]], despite the two conceiving and having a child together in the midst of the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]] of the French Revolution. Though the relationship ended badly, due in part to the discovery of Imlay's infidelity, and not least because Imlay abandoned her for good, Wollstonecraft's belief in free love survived. She later developed a relationship with Godwin, who shared her free love ideals, and published on the subject throughout his life. However, the two did decide to marry, just days before her death due to complications at [[parturition]].

In an act understood to support free love, their child, [[Mary Shelley|Mary]], took up with the then still-married English romantic poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] at a young age. Shelley wrote in defence of free love (and vegetarianism) in the prose notes of ''[[Queen Mab]]'' (1813), in his essay ''On Love'' (c. 1815). and in the poem ''[[Epipsychidion]]'' (1821):

{{poemquote|I never was attached to that great sect,
Whose doctrine is, that each one should select
Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend,
And all the rest, though fair and wise, commend
To cold oblivion ...

True love has this, different from gold and clay,
That to divide is not to take away.}}

===Utopian socialism===
Sharing the free-love ideals of the earlier social movements—as well as their feminism, pacifism, and simple communal life—were the [[utopian socialist]] communities of early-nineteenth-century France and Britain, associated with writers and thinkers such as [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Charles Fourier]] in France, and [[Robert Owen]] in England. Fourier, who coined the term ''feminism,'' argued that true freedom could only occur without masters, without the ethos of work, and without suppressing passions: the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that "affirming one's difference" can actually enhance social integration.

[[Robert Owen]] argued that marriage formed one of an "awful trinity" of oppressors to mankind, as well as [[religion]] and private property, and his son [[Robert Dale Owen|Robert Dale]] was a leading proponent of free divorce. The Saint-Simonian feminist [[Pauline Roland]] took a free-love stance against marriage, having four children in the 1830s, all of whom bore her name.

The German composer [[Richard Wagner]] advocated something like free love in several of his works, and began a family with [[Cosima Liszt]], then still married to the conductor [[Hans von Bülow]]. Though apparently scandalous at the time, such liaisons seemed the actions of admired artists who were following the dictates of their own wills, rather than those of social convention, and in this way they were in step with their era's liberal philosophers of the cult of passion, such as Fourier, and their actual or eventual openness can be understood to be a prelude to the freer ways of the twentieth century. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] spoke occasionally in favor of something like free love, but when he proposed marriage to that famous practitioner of it, [[Lou Andreas-Salome]], she berated him for being inconsistent with his philosophy of the free and supramoral Superman, a criticism that Nietzsche seems to have taken seriously, or to have at least been stung by. The relationship between composer [[Frédéric Chopin]] and writer [[George Sand]] can be understood as exemplifying free love in a number of ways. Behavior of this kind by figures in the public eye did much to erode the credibility of conventionalism in relationships, especially when such conventionalism brought actual unhappiness to its practitioners.

===Origins of the movement===
The eminent sociologist [[Herbert Spencer]] argued in his ''Principles of Sociology'' for the implementation of free divorce. Claiming that marriage consists of two components, "union by law" and "union by affection", he argued that with the loss of the latter union, legal union should lose all meaning and dissolve automatically, without the legal requirement for a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RmpMZ7K2L3YC|title="A Revolution in Christian Morals": Lambeth 1930-Resolution #15.

====United States====
[[Image:OneidaCommunityHomeBld.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[Oneida Community]] was a utopian group established in the 1840s, which practiced a form of free love. Postcard of the [[Oneida Community Mansion House]] from 1907.]]
Free love began to coalesce into a movement in the mid to late 19th century. The term was coined by the Christian socialist writer [[John Humphrey Noyes]], although he preferred to use the term '[[Group marriage|complex marriage]]'. Noyes founded the [[Oneida Community]] in 1848, a utopian community that "[rejected] conventional marriage both as a form of legalism from which Christians should be free and as a selfish institution in which men exerted rights of ownership over women". He found scriptural justification: "In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven" (Matt. 22:30).&lt;ref&gt;William Blake before him had made the same connection: "In Eternity they neither marry nor are given in marriage." ([[Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion]], 30.15; E176)&lt;/ref&gt; Noyes also supported [[eugenics]]; and only certain people (including Noyes himself) were allowed to become parents. Another movement was established in [[Berlin Heights, Ohio]].

In 1852, a writer named Marx Edgeworth Lazarus published a tract entitled "Love vs. Marriage pt. 1," in which he portrayed marriage as "incompatible with social harmony and the root cause of mental and physical impairments."  Lazarus intertwined his writings with his religious teachings, a factor that made the Christian community more tolerable to the free love idea.&lt;ref name="Passet, Joanne E 2003"/&gt; Elements of the free-love movement also had links to [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movements, drawing parallels between slavery and "[[sexual slavery]]" (marriage), and forming alliances with black activists.

American feminist [[Victoria Woodhull]] (1838–1927), the first woman to run for presidency in the U.S. in 1872, was also called "the high priestess of free love". In 1871, Woodhull wrote: "Yes, I am a Free Lover. I have an inalienable, constitutional and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or as short a period as I can; to change that love every day if I please, and with that right neither you nor any law you can frame have any right to interfere".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gos.sbc.edu/w/woodhull.html "And the Truth Shall Make You Free"] (November 20, 1871)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victoria Woodhull caricature by Thomas Nast 1872.jpg|thumb|right|Cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] portraying [[Victoria Woodhull]] as an advocate of free love]]

The women's movement, free love and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] were three strongly linked movements at the time, and Woodhull was also a spiritualist leader. Like Noyes, she also supported [[eugenics]]. Fellow social reformer and educator Mary Gove Nichols was happily married (to her second husband), and together they published a newspaper and wrote medical books and articles,&lt;ref name="Gove1842"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lectures to Ladies on Anatomy and Physiology | volume= |url=https://archive.org/stream/lecturestoladies00nichiala#page/n5/mode/2up |last=Gove | first=Mary S. | edition= |year=1842| publisher=Saxton &amp; Peirce | location=Boston | page=|accessdate=13 January 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gove1846"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Lectures to Women on Anatomy and Physiology |title=with an Appendix on Water Cure |url=https://archive.org/stream/lecturestowomen00nichgoog#page/n9/mode/1up  |last=Gove Nichols | first=Mary S. | edition= |year=1846| publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | location=New York | page=|accessdate=13 January 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gove-Nichols1855"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Experience in the Water Cure: A familiar exposition of the Principles and Results of Water Treatment, in the Cure of Acute and Chronic Diseases| title=in Fowlers and Wells' Water-Cure Library: Embracing all the most popular works on the subject|volume=Vol. 2 of 7 |url=https://archive.org/stream/anintroductiont01nichgoog#page/n56/mode/1up | last=Gove Nichols | first=Mary S.| edition= | year=1855 | publisher=Fowlers and Wells | location=New York| page= | accessdate=29 October 2009}} Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt; a novel, and a treatise on marriage, in which they argued the case for free love. Both Woodhull and Nichols eventually repudiated free love.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Publications of the movement in the second half of the 19th century included Nichols' Monthly, ''The Social Revolutionist'', ''[[Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly]]'' (ed. Victoria Woodhull and her sister [[Tennessee Celeste Claflin|Tennessee Claflin]]), ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' (ed. [[Ezra Heywood]]), ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'' (ed. [[Moses Harman]]) and the German-language Detroit newspaper ''Der Arme Teufel'' (ed. Robert Reitzel). Organisations included the New England Free Love League, founded with the assistance of American libertarian [[Benjamin Tucker]] as a spin-off from the New England Labor Reform League (NELRL). A minority of [[freethought|freethinkers]] also supported free love.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkley, Evelyn A. 2000. ''Rational Mothers and Infidel Gentlemen: Gender and American Atheism, 1865–1915.'' (Women and Gender in North American Religions.) Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press. 2000. Pp. xviii, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The most radical free love journal was ''The Social Revolutionist'', published in the 1856–1857, by John Patterson. The first volume consisted of twenty writers, of which only one was a woman.&lt;ref name="Spurlock, John 1994"/&gt;

Sex radicals were not alone in their fight against marriage ideals. Some other nineteenth-century Americans saw this social institution as flawed, but hesitated to abolish it. Groups such as the Shakers, the Oneida Community, and the Latter-day Saints were wary of the social notion of marriage. These organizations and sex radicals believed that true equality would never exist between the sexes as long as the church and the state continued to work together, worsening the problem of subordination of wives to their husbands.&lt;ref name="Passet, Joanne E 2003"/&gt;

Free-love movements continued into the early 20th century in [[bohemianism|bohemian]] circles in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. A group of Villagers lived free-love ideals and promoted them in the political journal ''[[The Masses]]'' and its sister publication ''[[The Little Review]],'' a literary journal. Incorporating influences from the writings of the English thinkers and activists [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[Havelock Ellis]], women such as [[Emma Goldman]] campaigned for a range of sexual freedoms, including homosexuality and access to contraception. Other notable figures among the Greenwich-Village scene who have been associated with free love include [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[Max Eastman]], [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Floyd Dell]], [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]], [[Ida Rauh]], [[Hutchins Hapgood]], [[Neith Boyce]]; a certain extreme was reached by self-proclaimed Satanist [[Anton LaVey]]. [[Dorothy Day]] also wrote passionately in defense of free love, women's rights, and contraception—but later, after converting to Catholicism, she criticized the sexual revolution of the sixties.

The development of the idea of free love in the United States was also significantly impacted by the publisher of ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazine, [[Hugh Hefner]], whose activities and persona over more than a half century popularized the idea of free love to the general public.{{clear}}

====United Kingdom====
[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Havelock Ellis]] was a pioneer [[sexology|sexologist]] and advocate of free love.]]
Free love was a central tenet of the philosophy of the [[Fellowship of the New Life]], founded in 1883, by the Scottish intellectual [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James A.|last=Good|url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/TD.html|title=The Development of Thomas Davidson's Religious and Social Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellowship members included many illustrious intellectuals of the day, who went on to radically challenge accepted Victorian notions of morality and sexuality, including poets [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]], animal rights activist [[Henry Stephens Salt]],&lt;ref&gt;George Hendrick, ''Henry Salt: Humanitarian Reformer and Man of Letters'', University of Illinois Press, pg. 47 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]], feminists [[Edith Ellis|Edith Lees]], [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and [[Annie Besant]] and writers [[H. G. Wells]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Olive Schreiner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Weeks (sociologist)|Jeffrey Weeks]], ''Making Sexual History'', Wiley-Blackwell, pg. 20, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Its objective was "The cultivation of a perfect character in each and all," and believed in the transformation of society through setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow. Many of the Fellowship's members advocated [[pacifism]], [[vegetarianism]] and [[simple living]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Spencer, ''The Heretic's Feast:A History of Vegetarianism'', Fourth Estate, pg. 283 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Carpenter]] was the first activist for the rights of [[homosexual]]s. He became interested in progressive education, especially providing information to young people on the topic of sexual education. For Carpenter, sexual education meant forwarding a clear analysis of the ways in which sex and gender were used to oppress women, contained in Carpenter's radical work ''Love's Coming-of-Age''. In it he argued that a just and equal society must promote the sexual and [[economic freedom]] of women. The main crux of his analysis centred on the negative effects of the institution of marriage. He regarded marriage in England as both enforced celibacy and a form of prostitution.

[[File:Carpenter1875.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Edward Carpenter]] in 1875.]]
He did not believe women would truly be free until a socialist society was established.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} In contrast to many of his contemporaries, however, this led him to conclude that all oppressed workers should support women's emancipation, rather than to subordinate women's rights to male worker's rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He remarked, "... there is no solution except the freedom of woman - which means, of course, the freedom of the masses of the people, men and women, and the ceasing altogether of economic slavery. There is no solution which will not include the redemption of the terms free women and free love to their true and rightful significance. Let every woman whose heart bleeds for the sufferings of her sex, hasten to declare herself and to constitute herself, as far as she possibly can, a free woman."

The best-known British advocate of free love was the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], later Third Earl Russell, who said that he did not believe he really knew a woman until he had made love with her. Russell consistently addressed aspects of free love throughout his voluminous writings, and was not personally content with conventional [[Monogamy]] until extreme old age. His most famous work on the subject was  ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'', published in 1929. The book heavily criticizes the [[Victorian morality|Victorian notions of morality]] regarding sex and marriage. Russell argued that the laws and ideas about sex of his time were a potpourri from various sources, which were no longer valid with the advent of [[contraception]], as the sexual acts are now separated from the conception. He argued that family is most important for the welfare of children, and as such, a man and a woman should be considered bound only after her first pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,787544,00.html "Sex Seer"], in ''Time'', November 4, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;


''Marriage and Morals'' prompted vigorous protests and denunciations against Russell shortly after the book's publication.&lt;ref name=SexEdPioneers&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneers of Sex Education |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/pioneers_of_sex_education.html |author=Haeberle, Erwin J. |year=1983 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=The Continuum Publishing Company |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313020717/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/pioneers_of_sex_education.html |archivedate=13 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, the book cost him his professorial appointment at the [[City College of New York]] due to a court judgment that his opinions made him "morally unfit" to teach.&lt;ref name=Denied&gt;{{cite web|title=Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell |author=Leberstein, Stephen |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065 |publisher=Academe |date=November–December 2001 |accessdate=2008-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004082928/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3860/is_200111/ai_n9008065 |archivedate=4 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to what many people believed, Russell did not advocate an extreme [[libertine]] position. Instead, he felt that sex, although a natural impulse like hunger or thirst, involves more than that, because no one is "satisfied by the bare sexual act". He argued that abstinence enhances the pleasure of sex, which is better when it "has a large psychical element than when it is purely physical".&lt;ref name="Hauerwas"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEKu6SoJR6cC|title=After Christendom?: How the Church Is to Behave If Freedom, Justice, and a Christian Nation Are Bad Ideas|author=Stanley Hauerwas|year=2011|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9781426722011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell noted that for a marriage to work requires that there "be a feeling of complete equality on both sides; there must be no interference with mutual freedom; there must be the most complete physical and mental intimacy; and there must be a certain similarity in regard to standards of value". He argued that it was, in general, impossible to sustain this mutual feeling for an indefinite length of time, and that the only option in such a case was to provide for either the easy availability of [[divorce]], or the social sanction of extra-marital sex.&lt;ref name="Hauerwas"/&gt;

Russell was also a very early advocate of repealing [[sodomy laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|publisher=The Times|title=Homosexual Acts, Call To Reform Law|date=1958-03-07|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
Interest in free love spread to Australia in the late 19th century. The English-born anarchist, [[Chummy Fleming]] founded the [[Melbourne Anarchist Club]] in 1886, which led a debate on the topic of free love, and a couple of years later released an anonymous pamphlet on the subject:  'Free Love—Explained and Defended' (possibly written by [[David Andrade]] or [[Chummy Fleming]]). The view of the Anarchist Club was formed in part as a reaction to the infamous [[Whitechapel murders]] by the notorious [[Jack the Ripper]]; his atrocities were at the time popularly understood by some—at least, by anarchists—to be a violation of the freedom of certain extreme classes of "working women," but by extension of all women.

[[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] libertarian [[Alice Winspear]], the wife of pioneer socialist [[William Robert Winspear]], wrote: "Let us have freedom—freedom for both man and woman—freedom to earn our bread in whatever vocation is best suited to us, and freedom to love where we like, and to live only with those whom we love, and by whom we are loved in return." A couple of decades later, the [[Melbourne]] anarchist feminist poet [[Lesbia Harford]] also championed free love.

====France====
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|right|thumb|130px|[[Émile Armand]]]]
In the bohemian districts of [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]], many were determined to shock the "[[bourgeois]]" sensibilities of the society they grew up in; many, such as the anarchist [[Benoît Broutchoux]], favored free love. At the same time, the [[cross-dressing]] radical activist [[Madeleine Pelletier]] practised celibacy, distributed birth-control devices and information, and performed abortions.

An important propagandist of free love was [[individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]]. He advocated [[naturism]] and [[polyamory]] in what he termed ''la camaraderie amoureuse''.&lt;ref name="armand"&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf "Emile Armand and la camaraderie amourouse – Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy." by Francis Rousin] Retrieved 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote many propagandist articles on this subject such as "De la liberté sexuelle" (1907) where he advocated not only a vague free love but also multiple partners, which he called "plural love".&lt;ref name="armand"/&gt; In the individualist anarchist journal ''L'en dehors'' he and others continued in this way. Armand seized this opportunity to outline his theses supporting revolutionary sexualism and camaraderie amoureuse that differed from the traditional views of the partisans of free love in several respects.

Later Armand submitted that from an individualist perspective nothing was reprehensible about making "love", even if one did not have very strong feelings for one's partner.&lt;ref name="armand"/&gt; "The camaraderie amoureuse thesis", he explained, "entails a free contract of association (that may be annulled without notice, following prior agreement) reached between anarchist individualists of different genders, adhering to the necessary standards of sexual hygiene, with a view toward protecting the other parties to the contract from certain risks of the amorous experience, such as rejection, rupture, exclusivism, possessiveness, unicity, coquetry, whims, indifference, flirtatiousness, disregard for others, and prostitution."&lt;ref name="armand"/&gt; He also published ''Le Combat contre la jalousie et le sexualisme révolutionnaire'' (1926), followed over the years by ''Ce que nous entendons par liberté de l'amour'' (1928), ''La Camaraderie amoureuse ou "chiennerie sexuelle"'' (1930), and, finally, ''La Révolution sexuelle et la camaraderie amoureuse'' (1934), a book of nearly 350 pages comprising most of his writings on sexuality.&lt;ref name="armand"/&gt; In a text from 1937, he mentioned among the individualist objectives the practice of forming [[voluntary association]]s for purely sexual purposes of heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual nature or of a combination thereof.

He also supported the right of individuals to change sex and stated his willingness to rehabilitate forbidden pleasures, non-conformist caresses (he was personally inclined toward voyeurism), as well as sodomy. This led him to allocate more and more space to what he called "the sexual non-conformists", while excluding physical violence.&lt;ref name="armand"/&gt; His militancy also included translating texts from people such as [[Alexandra Kollontai]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] and establishments of free love associations which tried to put into practice ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' through actual sexual experiences.

Free love advocacy groups active during this time included the ''Association d'Études sexologiques'' and the ''Ligue mondiale pour la Réforme sexuelle sur une base scientifique''.&lt;ref name="armand"/&gt;

====Germany====
[[File:Lily Braun.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Lily Braun]]]]

In Germany, from 1891 to 1919, the ''Verband Fortschrittlicher Frauenvereine'' (League of Progressive Women's Associations) called for a boycott of marriage and for the enjoyment of sexuality. Founded by [[Lily Braun]] and [[Minna Cauer]], the league also aimed to organise prostitutes into labor unions, taught contraception, and supported the right to abortion and the abolition of criminal penalties against homosexuality, as well as running child-care programs for single mothers. In 1897, teacher and writer [[Emma Trosse]] published a brochure titled ''Ist freie Liebe Sittenlosigkeit?'' ("Is free love immoral?").

The worldwide [[LGBT movements|homosexual emancipation movement]] also began in Germany in the late 19th century, and many of the thinkers whose work inspired sexual liberation in the 20th century were also from the German-speaking world, such as [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Otto Gross]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], and [[Max Stirner]]'s follower and biographer, [[John Henry Mackay]].

====USSR====
After the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, [[Alexandra Kollontai]] became the most prominent woman in the Soviet administration. Kollontai was also a champion of free love. However, [[Clara Zetkin]] recorded that Lenin opposed free love as "completely un-Marxist, and moreover, anti-social".&lt;ref&gt;Zetkin, Clara, 1934, ''Lenin on the Woman Question,'' New York: International, p.7. Published in ''Reminiscences of Lenin.''&lt;br&gt;A more extensive quote from Lenin follows: "It seems to me that this superabundance of sex theories ... springs from the desire to justify one's own abnormal or excessive sex life before bourgeois morality and to plead for tolerance towards oneself. This veiled respect for bourgeois morality is as repugnant to me as rooting about in all that bears on sex. No matter how rebellious and revolutionary it may be made to appear, it is in the final analysis thoroughly bourgeois. It is, mainly, a hobby of the intellectuals and of the sections nearest to them. There is no place for it in the party, in the class-conscious, fighting proletariat."&lt;/ref&gt; Zetkin also recounted Lenin's denunciation of plans to organise Hamburg's women prostitutes into a "special revolutionary militant section": he saw this as "corrupt and degenerate."

Despite the traditional marital lives of Lenin and most Bolsheviks, they believed that sexual relations were outside the jurisdiction of the state. The Soviet government abolished centuries-old Czarist regulations on personal life, which had prohibited homosexuality and made it difficult for women to obtain divorce permits or to live singly. However, by the end of the 1920s, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] had taken over the Communist Party and begun to implement socially conservative policies. Homosexuality was classified as a mental disorder, and free love was further demonized.

===Recent===
From the late 1940s to the 1960s, the bohemian free-love tradition of Greenwich Village in America was carried on by the [[beat generation]], although differing with their predecessors by being an apparently male-dominated movement. The Beats also produced the first appearance of male homosexual champions of free love in the U.S., with writers such as [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]. Like some of those before, the beats challenged a range of social conventions, and they found inspiration in such aspects of black culture as [[jazz]] music. The Beat movement led on the West Coast to the activities of such groups as the [[Merry Pranksters]] (led, according to [[Grateful Dead]] historian Dennis McNally, not by novelist [[Ken Kesey]], but by hipster and driver [[Neal Cassady]]) and the entire San Francisco pop music scene, in which the implications of sexual bohemianism were advanced in a variety of ways by the [[hippies]].  The study of [[sexology]] continued to gain prominence throughout the era, with the work of researchers [[Alfred Kinsey]] and [[Masters and Johnson]] supporting challenges to traditional values regarding sex and marriage.

With the [[Summer of Love]] in 1967, the eccentricities of this group became a nationally recognized movement.  Despite the developing [[sexual revolution]] and the influence of the Beatniks had in this new [[counterculture]] social rebellion, it has been acknowledged that the [[New Left]] movement was arguably the most prominent advocate of free love during the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/e_freelove.html Emma Goldman:People &amp; Events: Free Love] PBS.org, Accessed April 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Many among the counterculture youth sided with New Left arguments that marriage was a symbol of the traditional capitalist culture which supported war.&lt;ref name=goldstein /&gt;  "[[Make Love Not War]]," a slogan of antiquity renewed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono among others, became a popular slogan in the counterculture movement which denounced both war and capitalism.&lt;ref name=goldstein /&gt;  Images from the pro-socialist [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 uprising]] in France, which occurred as the anti-war protests were escalating throughout the United States, would provide a significant source of morale to the New Left cause as well.&lt;ref name=goldstein /&gt;

[[Second wave feminism]] continued to question traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] teaching on sexuality, while groups like [[Moral Majority]] and the [[Christian right]] opposed change, after ''[[Roe v Wade]]'' greatly increased access to [[abortion]] in the United States.

After the [[Stonewall riots]], [[gay rights]] became an increasingly prominent issue, but by the early 21st century gay activists had shifted their focus to [[same-sex marriage]] rather than free love. [[Divorce]] and [[blended families]] became more common, and young couples increasingly [[cohabitation|chose to live together]] in [[common law marriage]]s or [[domestic partnership]]s rather than marrying in church or formalizing or legalizing marriage through the court system.

'''Gamo''' is the name of the [[Ethiopia]]n ethnic group who speak the [[Gamo-Gofa-Dawro language|Gamo language]]. The name "Gamo" means a lion, which refers to their legacy; along with the [[Goffa people|Goffa]], they gave their names to the former [[Gamo-Gofa]] province of Ethiopia. The 2007 Ethiopian national census reported that 1,107,163 people (or 1.5% of the population) identified themselves as Gamos, of whom 141,233 were urban inhabitants. The [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]] is home to 94.5% of this people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 "Census 2007, Country Level"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114000000/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 |date=November 14, 2010 }}, Table 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gamo contribute much of the fruit including [[banana]], [[mango]], [[apple]] and [[papaya]], to the capital city of [[Ethiopia]], [[Addis Ababa]].

[[File:Kama, The Christian Kaffir Chief (July 1853, X, p.72) - Copy.jpg|thumb|Kama, The Christian Kaffir Chief (July 1853, X, p.72)&lt;ref name="Juvenile1853"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kama, The Christian Kaffir Chief|journal=The Wesleyan Juvenile Offering: A Miscellany of Missionary Information for Young Persons|date=July 1853|volume=X|page=72|url=https://archive.org/details/wesleyanjuvenil19socigoog|accessdate=29 February 2016|publisher=Wesleyan Missionary Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ama '''Gqunukhwebe''' is a sub-group of the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa nation]] that was created under the reign of [[King Tshiwo]] (1670–1702) of [[amaXhosa]] who was a grandfather to [[Gcaleka]] and [[Rharhabe]]. This consisted mostly of the  [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] chiefdoms ('''Gonaqua''', '''Hoengeniqua''', '''Inqua''' and others) that were overrun by western expedition pioneers among Xhosa people and incorporated into the Xhosa nation.

[[Khwane kaLungane]], a trusted counselor and a great warrior of King Tshiwo of amaXhosa, headed this new chiefdom of amaGqunukhwebe. This was the start of the ''Khwane dynasty'', the son of [[Lungane ka-Debe]]. He was succeeded by his descendants as follows: [[Bane ka-Khwane]], [[Tshaka ka-Bane]], [[Chungwa ka-Tshaka]], and then [[Phatho ka-Chungwa]].

Their land spanned from [[Buffalo River (Eastern Cape)|Buffalo]] (Qonce) to [[Zwaartkops]] (Qhagqiwa) rivers, but most of it was lost as a result of the Frontier Wars and was mostly given to colony settlers (west of the [[Great Fish River|Fish River]]) and amaMfengu (between the Fish and [[Keiskamma River|Keiskamma]] rivers) by the colonial government.

After many years of intermarriage, there were no physical differences in these people in terms of their Khoi and Xhosa origins. However, the Gqunukhwebe chiefdom developed new subdivisions. This happened through Chungwa's sons Phatho, or Pato, and Kama that he had with his senior wife, Malishe (daughter of Nqeno of amaMbali chiefdom). They respectively settled along the coast and inland. According to the diary notes of a certain Mr. Hampton who was the Cape Colony surveyor at the time, the main contributor to this rift was the younger brother's (i.e. Kama) conversion to Christianity.

Some writers {{who|date=March 2014}} consider him the one of the first people of royal blood line to convert to Christianity, which contradicted his older bother's wishes that he must take a second wife. Kama later moved away from this tribal pressure with some followers and eventually settled in the area that is today known as [[Middledrift]].

After the terrible "Cattle-killing" and many frontier wars with the colony, Phatho and his followers were weakened and the Cape Colony wrongfully recognised Kama as the Paramount Chief of all amaGqunukhwebe people, also probably due to Kama's religion conversion which made him house friends with the white missionaries.

Today the two amaGqunukhwebe chiefdoms are controlled from two centres, the coastal lineage with headquarters in Tsholomnqa (the ''Phatho house'') and inland in  Middledrift (the ''Kama house''). However, the ordinary people of the tribe still understand that the senior house is from the Phato lineage.

A longtime councilor of Phatho royal family, the late Frank Mathanga from the Tshawe-clan has done excellent work of documenting the successions in the Phatho house.

Chief Phatho married Noxina daughter of Toyise from the Gasela-clan as senior wife and had a son named ''Dilima''. Chief Dilima's senior wife was the daughter of Ndileka (a Chief of imiDushane kaNdlambe tribe) and had a son called Namba.
After succeeding his father, Chief Dilima ka-Phatho picked up his father's spear and took the battle to the colonists. He was later arrested and imprisoned in [[Robben Island]].

Chief Namba ka-Dilima had four sons Khangelanzima, Sofutha, Mkhanya, and Dyosini. Both Khangelanzima and Sofuthe died as young men before they could get married. The next in line to the throne of amaGqunukhwebe was Mkhanya, he had a son called Silimela who was taken away by his mother after she had a strong quarrel with Chief Mkhanya. She never returned their boy and the Chief never bothered to search for his son. Silimela also never bothered to return to his biological father when he came of age.

When Chief Mkhanya ka-Namba died, his younger brother and right-hand man [[Dyosini ka-Namba]] succeeded him. He had two sons, Rhamnwana and Nompempe through his wife Nontozimbi Rhatsha of the Giqwa-clan.

Their elder son [[Rhamncwana ka-Dyosini]] was inaugurated as Chief of amaGqunukhwebe aseLwandle in 1975 under the [[Ciskei]] Bantu Tribal Authority led by L.L.W. Sebe.
During this time his first wife Nokhazi of amaBamba clan had died but already had children together and their eldest son and heir to throne was Ntlanganiso.

Chief Rhamncwana remarried to Nondenze (Nongenile), daughter of Mbutiyakhe ka-Twani from the Qhinebe-clan, and they had two sons Xolani and Gcobani. Nongenile is still acting regent.

The heir to the throne, [[Ntlanganiso ka Rhamncwana Phatho]] married Nondumiso (daughter of Petros Namba of the Tshawe clan from Twecu village) in 1970, and they had a son called Zolani is 1973. This marriage collapsed in 1976 and their son Zolani went to the initiation school at King Xolilizwe's (Gcaleka-Xhosa) place. Zolani returned to his ancestral home in 2008 from Cape Town.

Ntlanganiso then remarried in 1982 to Ntomboxolo (daughter of [[Mxolisi Sandile]] the King of Rharhabe-Xhosa) and they had two daughters, Nolwandle and Nomonde.

According to tradition Zolani ka-Ntlanganiso Phatho is expected to be the next in line to ascend the throne when he's of age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1962">'''Horace DeVaughan''' (died April 8, 1927), of [[Birmingham, Alabama]], was the first prison inmate in [[Alabama]] to be executed by the Alabama [[electric chair]], nicknamed "[[Yellow Mama]]" because it was painted with bright yellow highway paint. DeVaughan was electrocuted on April 8, 1927.

The murder case for which DeVaughan was executed was solved by Birmingham Police Detective Paul Cole, who traced the shells found at the scene, which had a unique marking from a defective shotgun. After he was arrested, DeVaughan confessed to the murders and was sentenced to death.
DeVaughan was put to death at Kilby Prison in an electric chair built for the purpose earlier that year. He prayed to Jesus for hours beforehand, and accepted no food, drink or cigarettes on the night of the execution. In his final statement he expressed that he had been forgiven and had no hard feelings toward anyone, and asked for someone to tell his mother goodbye and that his soul was saved.
DeVaughan underwent three 2,000 volt discharges between 12:31 and 12:42 AM. At the first 40-second jolt his body surged forward, a thin gray smoke flowed from under the electrode over his head, and the odor of burning flesh was apparent. After the second discharge, flames were seen on his leg, but he was still alive. After the third jolt, he was pronounced dead. Twenty were present as witnesses, included Moore's brother, George, who traveled from Coffeyville, Kansas and claimed a piece of DaVaughn's belt as a souvenir of his visit.

'''Ibibio''' (proper) is the native language of the [[Ibibio people]] of [[Akwa Ibom State]], [[Nigeria]], belonging to the [[Ibibio-Efik]] dialect cluster of the [[Cross River languages]]. The name ''Ibibio'' is sometimes used for the entire dialect cluster. In pre-[[Colonial Nigeria|colonial]] times, it was written with [[Nsibidi]] ideograms, similar to [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Anaang language|Anaang]], and [[Ejagham language|Ejagham]]. Ibibio has also had influences on Afro-American diasporic languages such as [[AAVE]] words like [[buckra]], which comes from the Ibibio word [[mbakara]], and in the [[Afro-Cuban]] tradition of [[abakua]].

Due to migration as a result of the [[Cambodian Civil War]], there is a large Khmer diaspora residing in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and France.

==History==
{{main|History of Cambodia}}

According to one Khmer legend attributed by [[George Coedes]] to a tenth century inscription, the Khmer race arose from the union of the [[brahmin]] [[Kambu Swayambhuva]] and the [[apsara]] ("celestial nymph") Mera. Their marriage is said to have given rise to the name Khmer and founded the [[List of monarchs of Cambodia|Varman dynasty]] of ancient Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;''D'après l'épigraphie cambodgienne du X° siècle, les rois des "Kambuja" prétendaient descendre d'un ancêtre mythique éponyme, le sage ermite Kambu, et de la nymphe céleste Mera, dont le nom a pu être forgé d'après l'appellation ethnique "khmèr"'' (George Coedes). [http://www.kh.refer.org/cbodg_ct/kh/culture_kh/hist/chenla.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; See also: ''Indianised States of Southeast Asia'', 1968, p 66, George Coedes.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more popular legend, reenacted to this day in the traditional Khmer wedding ceremony and taught in elementary school, holds that Cambodia was created when an Indian Brahmin priest named Kaundinya (commonly referred to as ''[[Preah Thong and Neang Neak|Preah Thoang]]'') married Princess Soma, a [[Naga people|Naga]] (Khmer: ''neak'') princess. Kaundinya sailed to Southeast Asia following an arrow he saw in a dream. Upon arrival he found an island called ''kok thlok'' and, after conquering Soma's Naga army, he fell in love with her. As a dowry, the father of princess Soma drank the waters around the island, which was revealed to be the top of a mountain, and the land below that was uncovered became Cambodia. Kaundinya and Soma and their descendents became known as the Khmer and are said to have been the rulers of [[Funan]], [[Chenla]] and the [[Khmer Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/faculty/Stark/pdfs/YoffeePages313332.pdf |title= 9 Textualized Places, Pre-Angkorian Khmers and Historicized Archaeology by Miriam T. Stark - Cambodia’s Origins and the Khok Thlok Story |author=Miriam T. Stark  | publisher= University of Hawaii  |date=2006   |accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This myth further explains why the oldest Khmer ''wats'', or temples, were always built on mountaintops, and why today mountains themselves are still revered as holy places.

=== Arrival in Southeast Asia ===
[[File:Khmerlladyinblackandwhite1.jpg|thumb|250px|Upper class Khmer ladies in the 1800s.]]
[[File:Angkor-Vat.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Angkor Wat]] in the 1900s.]]
The Khmers are one of the oldest ethnic groups in the area, having filtered into Southeast Asia around the same time as the [[Mon people|Mon]], who settled further to the west and to whom the Khmer are ancestrally related. Most archaeologists and linguists, and other specialists like [[Sinology|Sinologists]] and crop experts, believe that they arrived no later than 2000 BCE (over four thousand years ago) bringing with them the practice of agriculture and in particular the cultivation of [[rice]]. This region is also one of the first places in the world to use [[Bronze Age|bronze]]. They were the builders of the later [[Khmer Empire]], which dominated Southeast Asia for six centuries beginning in 802, and now form the mainstream of political, cultural, and economic Cambodia.

The Khmers developed the [[Khmer alphabet]], the earliest alphabet still in use in Southeast Asia, which in turn gave birth to the later [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] and [[Lao alphabet]]s. The Khmers are considered by [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[ethnology|ethnologists]] to be indigenous to the contiguous regions of [[Isan]], southern [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] and [[South Vietnam]]. That is to say the Khmer have historically been a lowland people who lived close to one of the tributaries of the [[Mekong River]]. The reason they migrated into Southeast Asia is not well understood, but scholars believe that Austroasiatic speakers were pushed south by invading [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman speakers]] from the north as evident by Austroasiatic vocabulary in Chinese, because of agricultural purposes as evident by their migration routes along major rivers, or a combination of these and other factors.

Like the other early peoples of Southeast Asia such as the [[Pyu]], [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Chams]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]], the Khmer were part of [[Greater India]], adopting Indian religions, sciences, and customs and borrowing from their languages. The first powerful trading kingdom in Southeast Asia, the [[Kingdom of Funan]], was established in southeastern Cambodia and the Mekong Delta in the first century, although extensive archaeological work in [[Angkor Borei District]] near the modern Vietnamese border has unearthed brickworks, canals, cemeteries and graves dating to the fifth century BCE.

The Kingdom of Funan is considered to be the mother of all later Southeast Asian kingdoms. During the Funan period (1st century - sixth century CE) the Khmer also acquired Buddhism, the concept of the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] [[imperial cult]] of the [[devaraja]] and the great temple as a symbolic [[world mountain]]. The rival Khmer [[Chenla Kingdom]] emerged in the fifth century and later conquered the Kingdom of Funan. Chenla was an upland state whose economy was reliant on agriculture whereas Funan was a lowland state with an economy dependent on maritime trade.

These two states, even after conquest by Chenla in the sixth century, were constantly at war with each other and smaller principalities. During the Chenla period (5th-8th century), Cambodians left the world's earliest known [[zero]] in one of their temple inscriptions. Only when [[Jayavarman II|King Jayavarman II]] declared an independent and united Cambodia in 802 was there relative peace between the two lands, upper and lowland Cambodia.

[[Jayavarman II]] (802–830), revived Cambodian power and built the foundation for the Angkorean empire, founding three capitals—[[Indrapura (Khmer)|Indrapura]], [[Hariharalaya]], and [[Mahendraparvata]]—the archeological remains of which reveal much about his times. After winning a long civil war, [[Suryavarman I]] (reigned 1002–1050) turned his forces eastward and subjugated the Mon kingdom of [[Dvaravati]]. Consequently, he ruled over the greater part of present-day Thailand and Laos, as well as the northern half of the Malay Peninsula. This period, during which [[Angkor Wat]] was constructed, is considered the apex of Khmer civilization.

=== Khmer Empire (802–1431) ===
{{See|Khmer Empire}}

The Khmer kingdom became the [[Khmer Empire]] and the great temples of Angkor, considered an archeological treasure replete with detailed stone bas-reliefs showing many aspects of the culture, including some musical instruments, remain as monuments to the culture of the Khmer. After the death of [[Suryavarman II]] (1113–50), Cambodia lapsed into chaos until [[Jayavarman VII]] (1181–1218) ordered the construction of a new city. He was a Buddhist, and for a time, Buddhism became the dominant religion in Cambodia. As a state religion, however, it was adapted to suit the Deva Raja cult, with a Buddha Raja being substituted for the former Shiva Raja or Vishnu Raja.

The rise of the Tai kingdoms of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] (1238) and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (1350) resulted in almost ceaseless wars with the Cambodians and led to the destruction of Angkor in 1431. They are said to have carried off 90,000 prisoners, many of whom were likely dancers and musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Thailand 1969:151, Blanchard 1958:27&lt;/ref&gt; The period following 1432, with the Cambodian people bereft of their treasures, documents, and human culture bearers, was one of precipitous decline.

=== Post Empire (1431-present) ===
[[File:Cambodia ethnic map.svg|thumb|450px|A map of [[ethnic groups in Cambodia]].]]

In 1434, King Ponhea Yat made Phnom Penh his capital, and Angkor was abandoned to the jungle. Due to continued Siamese and Vietnamese aggression, Cambodia appealed to France for protection in 1863 and became a French protectorate in 1864. During the 1880s, along with southern Vietnam and Laos, Cambodia was drawn into the French-controlled Indochinese Union. For nearly a century, the French exploited Cambodia commercially, and demanded power over politics, economics, and social life.

During the second half of the twentieth century, the political situation in Cambodia became chaotic. King Norodom Sihanouk (later, Prince, then again King), proclaimed Cambodia's independence in 1949 (granted in full in 1953) and ruled the country until March 18, 1970, when he was overthrown by General Lon Nol, who established the Khmer Republic. On April 17, 1975, the genocidal [[Khmer Rouge]] led by Saloth Sar, better known by his alias, [[Pol Pot]], came to power and virtually destroyed the Cambodian people, their health, morality, education, physical environment, and culture.

On January 7, 1979, Vietnamese forces ousted the Khmer Rouge. After more than ten years of painfully slow rebuilding, with only meager outside help, the United Nations intervened resulting in the Paris Peace Accord on October 23, 1992 and created conditions for general elections in May 1993, leading to the formation of the current government and the restoration of Prince Sihanouk to power as King in 1993. The Khmer Rouge continued to control portions of western and northern Cambodia until the late 1990s, when they surrendered to government forces in exchange for either amnesty or re-adjustment for positions into the Cambodian government.

In the 21st century, Cambodia's economy has grown faster than that of any other country in Asia except for China and India. Today, post-conflict Cambodia exports over $5 billion worth of clothing, mainly to the United States and the [[European Union]], is one of the top ten exporters of rice in the world, and has seen international tourist arrivals balloon from less than 150,000 in 2000 to over 4.2 million in 2013.

Cambodia is no longer seen as being on the brink of disaster, a reputation it gained in the 1980s and 1990s as guerilla-style warfare was still being waged by the Khmer Rouge until their ceasefire in 1998. Cambodians in the diaspora are returning to their homeland to start businesses, and expatriate Western workers in fields as diverse as architecture, archaeology, philanthropy, banking, hospitality, agriculture, music, diplomacy and garments are increasingly attracted to Cambodia because of its relaxed lifestyle and traditional way of life.

The culture of the ethnic Khmer is fairly homogeneous throughout their geographic range. Regional dialects exist, but are mutually intelligible. The standard is based on the dialect spoken throughout the [[Geography of Cambodia#Central plain|Central Plain]],&lt;ref name="HUFF"&gt;Huffman, Franklin. 1970. ''[http://www.pratyeka.org/csw/hlp-csw.pdf Cambodian System of Writing and Beginning Reader]''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-01314-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; a region encompassed by the northwest and central provinces. The varieties of Khmer spoken in this region are representative of the speech of the majority of the population. A unique and immediately recognizable dialect has developed in Phnom Penh that, due to the city's status as the national capital, has been modestly affected by recent French and Vietnamese influence.

Other dialects are [[Northern Khmer dialect]], called ''Khmer Surin'' by Cambodians, spoken by over a million [[Northern Khmer people|Khmer native to Northeast Thailand]] and [[Khmer Krom]] spoken by the millions of Khmer native to the [[Mekong Delta]] regions of Vietnam adjacent to Cambodia and their descendants abroad. A little-studied dialect known as [[Western Khmer dialect|Western Khmer]], or Cardamom Khmer, is spoken by a small, isolated population in the [[Cardamom Mountains|Cardamom Mountain range]] extending from Cambodia into eastern Central Thailand. Although little studied, it is unique in that it maintains a definite system of [[Register (phonology)|vocal register]] that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer.

The modern Khmer strongly identify their ethnic identity with their religious beliefs and practices, which combine the tenets of Theravada Buddhism with elements of indigenous ancestor-spirit worship, animism and shamanism.&lt;ref name="HARVARD"/&gt; Most Cambodians, whether or not they profess to be Buddhists (or Muslims), believe in a rich supernatural world. Several types of supernatural entities are believed to exist; they make themselves known by means of inexplicable sounds or happenings. Among these phenomena are ''khmaoc'' (ghosts), [[preta|pret]] and ''besach'' (particularly nasty demons, the spirits of people who have died violent, untimely, or unnatural deaths), ''arak'' (evil spirits, usually female), ''neak ta'' (tutelary spirits residing in inanimate objects), ''mneang phteah'' (guardians of the house), ''meba'' (ancestral spirits), and ''[[mrenh kongveal]]'' (elf-like guardians of animals). All spirits must be shown proper respect, and, with the exception of the ''mneang phteah'' and ''mrenh kongveal'', they can cause trouble ranging from mischief to serious life-threatening illnesses.

The majority of the Khmer live in rural villages either as rice farmers or fishermen. Their life revolves around the ''wat'' (temple) and the various Buddhist ceremonies throughout the year. However, if Khmers become ill, they will frequently see a ''kru khmae'' (shaman/healer), whom they believe can diagnose which of the many spirits has caused the illness and recommend a course of action to propitiate the offended spirit, thereby curing the illness.&lt;ref name="MLTCAN"&gt;[http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/ecp/content/cambodians_khmer.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311003416/http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/ecp/content/cambodians_khmer.html |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kru khmae'' also is learned in herb lore and is often sought to prepare various "medicines" and potions or for a [[Yantra tattoo|magical tattoo]], all believed to endow one with special prowess and ward off evil spirits or general bad luck.&lt;ref name="MLTCAN"/&gt; Khmer beliefs also rely heavily on [[Jyotisha|astrology]], a remnant of Hinduism. A fortune teller, called ''hao-ra'' or ''kru tieay'' in Khmer, is often consulted before major events, like choosing a spouse, beginning an important journey or business venture, setting the date for a wedding and determining the proper location for building new structures.

Throughout the year the Khmer celebrate many holidays, most of a religious or spiritual nature, some of which are also observed as [[Public holidays in Cambodia|public holidays]]. The two most important are ''Chol Chnam'' ([[Cambodian New Year]]) and ''[[Pchum Ben]]'' ("Ancestor Day"). The Khmer [[Buddhist calendar]] is divided into 12 months with the traditional new year beginning on the first day of ''khae chaet'', which coincides with the first [[new moon]] of April in the western calendar. The modern celebration has been standardized to coincide with April 13.



[[Culture of Cambodia|Khmer culture]] has influenced [[Culture of Thailand|Thai]] and [[Culture of Laos|Lao]] cultures and vice versa. Many Khmer loanwords are found in [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]], while many Lao and Thai loanwords are found in Khmer. The [[Thai script|Thai]] and [[Lao alphabet|Lao]] alphabets are also derived from the [[Khmer script]].

Since the late 1860s, there have been many organizations that have used the title "Ku Klux Klan" or have split off from KKK groups using different names.

== Reconstruction Era paramilitaries ==
During [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], there were a number of [[white supremacist]] [[Paramilitary|paramilitary groups]] that were organized in order to resist the reconstruction measures. While the Ku Klux Klan was the most famous group, it overlapped in membership and ideology with a number of others. In some cases, they were virtually indistinguishable from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Long, "Ku Klux Kklan", [[Handbook of Texas]] Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/vek02), accessed June 29, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Knights of the White Camelia]]
* [[Ku Klux Klan]]

== 1877–1914 ==
Between the Reconstruction period, known as the Klan's "first era", and the rebirth of the modern movement in 1915, there were a handful of groups that scholars have identified as "bridges" that engaged in similar vigilante activities and introduced Klan-type organizing into areas untouched by Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Newton pp. 605–6&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=March 2014}} In some cases, small towns often had so-called "decency committees" or "[[vigilance committee]]s", who often used vigilante tactics against targets such as criminals, prostitutes, drunkards, and in some instances, [[Black people]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Mexicans]], [[Chinese Americans]], European immigrants, [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Mormons]], and non-Christians, including [[Jews]] and [[Atheism|atheists]]. Sometimes, in fact, their attire or their disguises resembled those worn by the KKK.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== 1915–1944 ==
During the "second era", the KKK movement saw the rise and decline of one of the largest and most influential Klan factions, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Inc. There were a few splinter groups, though, such as the Knights of the Flaming Sword, founded by ousted [[Imperial Wizard]] [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]] and the Independent Klan of America, founded by [[Indiana Klan|Indiana]] [[Grand Dragon]] [[D. C. Stephenson]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton pp. 285, 326&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=March 2014}} The 1930s saw the growth of [[fascist|fascist-leaning]] groups such as the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]] and a revived [[Knights of the White Camelia|Knights of the White Camellia]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton pp. 54, 331&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=March 2014}} It was also during this time period, that, for the first time ever, certain KKK groups began openly seeking working relationships with [[Nazism|pro-Nazi]] and [[Fascism|fascist]] groups, such as the [[German-American Bund]] and the [[Silver Shirts]]. The KKK also openly worked alongside the [[Anti-Saloon League]], in their shared goals of enforcing [[prohibition]]. 

* [[Knights of the KKK]]
* Knights of the White Camelia

== 1944–1954 ==
In the period roughly between the end of World War II and the passage of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] so-called "[[Black Monday]]" ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', a number of small local "associations of Klans" were active, mainly in the Southeastern states.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, Arnold. Epstein, Benjamin R. ''[https://archive.org/details/ReportOnTheKuKluxKlan Report on the Ku Klux Klan ]'' [New York, Anti-defamation League of B'nai B'rith, 1965 pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt; By this time period, the KKK already had links to the [[Christian Identity]] movement.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

*[[Association of Georgia Klans]]

== 1954–1969 ==
During the period of the civil rights movement in the late 1950s and 1960s, the Klan experienced its "third era" which saw the growth of a number of KKK groups that sought to resist [[desegregation]], by both peaceful and violent means.  However, desegregation was not their only targets, other topics of Klan protest and hatred included the [[1960's counterculture]], labor unions, divorce, [[evolutionism]], [[liberalism]], and so-called [[Jewish Bolshevism]].  It was also around this  period that many Klan groups began working with other white supremacist groups like the [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Council]], the [[American Nazi Party]] and the [[National States' Rights Party]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

*[[Silver Dollar Group]]
*[[U.S. Klans]]
*[[United Klans of America]]
*[[White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]]

== 1970s–present ==
The last decades of the 20th century and the first years of the 21st century have been hard for the Klan because the public increasingly found their views unacceptable and law enforcement agencies began to prosecute them with more vigor.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Since this time period, many factions of the Klan began making alliances with [[neo-Nazis]], [[white power skinheads]], and radical followers of the [[militia movement]], in order to boost membership. Many of these modern KKK groups have also been exploiting the controversial issues of [[illegal immigration]], [[affirmative action]], [[Same-sex marriage|gay marriage]], [[abortion]], [[Islamic terrorism]], and [[School prayer|prayer in school]], in order to attract membership.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The '''Lisu people''' ({{lang|my|လီဆူလူမျိုး}}, {{IPA-my|lìsʰù|}}; {{zh|c={{linktext|傈僳|族}}|p=Lìsù zú}}; {{lang-th|[[wikt:ลีสู่|ลีสู่]]}}; [[Lisu language|Lisu]]: {{script|Lisu|ꓡꓲ-ꓢꓴ}} or {{script|Lisu|ꓡꓲꓢꓴ}}) are a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] [[ethnic group]] who inhabit mountainous regions of [[Burma]] (Myanmar), southwest [[China]], [[Thailand]], and the [[India]]n state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

About 730,000 Lisu live in [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]], [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]], [[Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture|Nujiang]], [[Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Diqing]] and [[Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture|Dehong]] prefectures in [[Yunnan Province]] and [[Sichuan Province]], China. The Lisu form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by China. In Burma (Myanmar), the Lisu are recognized as one of 135 ethnic groups and an estimated population of 600,000. Lisu live in northern Myanmar; [[Kachin State]] ([[Putao]], [[Myikyina]], [[Danai]], [[Waimaw]], [[Bhamo]]), Shan state, ([[Momeik]]), ([[Namhsan]], [[Lashio]], [[Hopang]], and [[Kokang]]) and southern [[Shan State]] ([[Namsang]], [[Loilem]], [[Mongton]]) and, Sagaing Division ([[Katha Township|Katha]] and [[Hkamti Township|Khamti]]), [[Mandalay Division]] ([[Mogok]] and [[Pyin Oo Lwin]]). Approximately 55,000 live in [[Thailand]], where they are one of the 6 main [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill tribes]]. They mainly inhabit remote mountainous areas.

The Lisu tribe consists of more than 58 different clans. Each family clan has its own name or surname. The biggest family clans well-known among the tribe clans are Laemae pha (Shue or The Grass), Bya pha (The Bee), Thorne pha, Ngwa Pha (Fish), Naw pha (Thou or Bean), Seu pha (the Woods), Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in the primitive time. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names.&lt;ref&gt;Hill Tribes, Lonely Planet, have a map. This map displays only remote areas.&lt;/ref&gt; Their culture has traits shared with the Yi or Nuosu (Lolo) culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yi people]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lisu tribe depiction, 1900s.jpg|thumb|A Burmese depiction of the Lisu people in the early 1900s]]
Lisu history is passed from one generation to the next in the form of songs. Today, these songs are so long that they can take an entire night to sing.&lt;ref name="Hutheesing 1990"/&gt;

===Origins===
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}
The Lisu are believed to have originated in eastern [[Tibet]] even before present Tibetans arrived in the plateau. Research done by Lisu scholars indicates that they moved to northwestern [[Yunnan]]. They inhabited a region across [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]] and the [[Tengchong]] plain for thousands of years. Lisu, [[Yi people|Yi]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], and [[Akha people|Akha]] are Tibetan–Burman languages, distantly related to Burmese and Tibetan.&lt;ref&gt;Gros 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gros 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matisoff 1986&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Han Chinese]] [[Ming Dynasty]], around 1140–1644 CE the eastern and southern Lisu languages and culture were greatly influenced by the Han culture.&lt;ref name="Dessaint 1972"&gt;Dessaint 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanks &amp; Hanks 2001"&gt;Hanks &amp; Hanks, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiping (Yunnan)|Taiping]] village in [[Yinjiang]], Yunnan, China, was first established by Lu Shi Lisu people about 1,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In the mid-18th century, Lisu peoples in [[Yinjiang]] began moving into [[Momeik]], Burma, a population of southern Lisu moved into [[Mogok]], and southern Shan State, and then in the late 19th century, moved into northern Thailand.&lt;ref name="Hanks &amp; Hanks 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George 1915&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enriquez 1921&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott &amp; Hardiman 1900–1901&lt;/ref&gt; Lisu is one of the three Lolo tribes, the descendants of Yi. Yi (or Nuosu) are still much closer to the Lisu and Myanmar languages. Myat Wai Toe observes that as the saying, “the Headwaters of the Great River, Lisu originates,” where Lisu lived in “Mou-Ku-De”; they were not yet called “Lisu” until 400–200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;မတ္တိုးေ၀၊ ''လီဆူတိုင္းရင္းသားတို႔၏ဘ၀ဓေလ့'' (စာေပဗိမာန္ျပည္သူ႔လက္စြဲစာစဥ္၊ ၂၀၀၈)၊ စာ ၅။&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=WP:NOENG|date=January 2018}}

==The Lisu of India==

Lisu people in India are called "Yobin". In all government records, Lisu are Yobin, and sometimes used alternately. Lisu is one of the minority tribes of Arunachal Pradesh of India. They live mainly in Vijoynagar Circle in 11 villages. Gandhigram (or Shidi in Lisu) is the largest village. Lisus are found in Miao town and Injan village of Kharsang Circle [[Changlang District]]. The Lisu traditionally lived in the Yunnan Province of China and northern Myanmar. There are about 5,000 Lisu people in India.

===Government discovering Lisu===
On 7 May 1961, the 7th Assam Rifles expedition team led by Major Sumer Singh entered the Noa-dihing river valley and reached the largest village in the valley, Shidi (now called Gandhigram). They were accorded a warm reception by the villagers and were further told by the villagers that they were the first party to have visited the area since World War II. The Assam Rifles team assured the villagers that this virgin land was Indian territory and the people would be protected from enemy aggression. Till then the international border was not clearly demarcated. In 1972, the Demarcation of International Border with Burma was done, with the help of Lisu guides having a full knowledge of the region. During demarcation, cement International Border Pillars (IBP) were erected at regular intervals.

Initially, the Indo-Burmese border had been drawn based on surveys conducted under the [[McMahon Line|Topographical Survey of British India]] as early as 1912, following the highest ridge from the [[Hkakabo Razi]] (alt. {{convert|5881|m|abbr=on}}; the highest point in Myanmar) at the junction with the Chinese border in the north, to the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh according to a "combination of ridges, watershed and highest crests".&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during World War II, G.D.L. Millar’s diary recalls the escape of a party of 150 European, Indian and Kachin officials and civilians fleeing the advance of the Japanese in May 1942. They went from Putao (Kachin) to Margherita (Assam) via the Chaukan Pass, and followed the valley of the Noa-dihing river. Millar records that over a hundred miles of the Chaukan Pass, "there was no trace of man" either Lisu or any other tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.528129|title=Forgotten Frontier(1945)|first=|last=Tyson Geoffrey|date=17 August 2018|website=Archive.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border negotiations with China that [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War|led]] to the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], and the intrusion of Chinese troops into the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh, propelled the Government of India to secure its international borders in the [[North-East Frontier Agency|North East region]], defined as per the Topographical Survey of British India. The Assam Rifles Regiments who took control of the border area hired labourers from various tribes, including Lisus, to built the air strip at Vijoynagar. In 1969–70, 200 families were settled in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arunachalgovernor.gov.in/pr/pr030410.htm|title=The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh :: Governor visits remote Vijoynagar|website=Arunachalgovernor.gov.in|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the population was estimated at 5500 including Nepalis and Lisus/Yobin.

===Via Myanmar-Ledo Road===
Some groups of Lisus took the then [[Ledo Road]]. Some of them worked as coal miners under British. (One certificate that originally belonged to one Aphu Lisu is a British coal miner's certificate from 1918, preserved by the Lisu). The certificate bears the mark of the then governor who ruled the region from [[North Lakhimpur|Lakhimpur, Assam]] (it should be noted, however, that the section of Ledo road between Ledo and Shingbwiyang was only opened in 1943. Most of the Lisu who lived in Assam went back to Burma. However, some are still found in the Kharangkhu area of Assam, Kharsang Circle of Arunachal Pradesh. While most have lost their mother tongue, some have preserved the language and culture almost intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://changlang.nic.in/changlang.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-06-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512100140/http://www.changlang.nic.in/changlang.html#people/ |archive-date=2008-05-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contributions to Sino-Tibetan Studies|author=John McCoy, Timothy Light|publisher=BRILL|pages=915–6|year=1986|isbn=90-04-07850-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian/Lisu issues===
In the early 1980s, the Lisu people living in India did not have Indian citizenship as they were considered refugees from Burma ([[Myanmar]]). In 1994, Indian citizenship was granted to them, but not Scheduled Tribe status. This is currently the subject of a claim to the Government.

Except for the arrival of a fleet of jeeps in the late 1970s, the area has been without roads and vehicles for 4 decades. The area is isolated, hence some describing the people as "prisoners of geography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2620/stories/20091009262006400.htm|title=Prisoners of geography|website=Frontline.in|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisu were evicted from their villages in 1964 under the command of A.S. Guarya, the late Governor General of Arunachal Pradesh. He settled Indian ex-servicemen in their villages. Those villages still retain their original names. The Lisu were chased out of their villages down to Gandhigram villages and other areas. These villages suffered from floods and lost much of their rice paddies and had to find new ground.

In fact, [[Namdapha]] was originally declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1972, then a National Park in 1983. The authorities demarcated the southern boundary near Gandhigram village. Since then the Lisus settling in the National Park are considered as "encroachers" as per the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbaindia.org/uploaded/Biodiversityindia/Legal/15.%20Wildlife%20(Protection)%20Act,%201972.pdf|format=PDF|title=THE WILDLIFE (PROTECTION) ACT, 1972 (No. 53 of 1972)|date=9 September 1972|website=Nbaindia.org|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1976 and 1981, a {{convert|157|km|adj=on}} road was made between Miao and Vijoynagar (MV road) by the Public Works Department following the left bank of the Noa-dihing river through [[Namdapha National Park]] but proved difficult to maintain due to extreme rainfall and frequent landslides. It was also felt that a road would further facilitate wildlife poaching and land encroachment in the National Park. Renovation of the MV road was announced in 2010 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Miao-Vijaynagar-road-foundation-laid/articleshow/18599731.cms|title=Miao-Vijaynagar road foundation laid |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The Lisu tribe consists of more than 58 different clans. Each family clan has its own name or surname. The largest families among the tribal clans are Putao Laemae pha (who speak some [[a sub-language of Bai languages|Bai]]), Bya pha (The Bee), Tung pha, Ngua Pha (Fish), Naw pha (some of them are descended from [[Anung or Khingphang]] patriclans), Seu pha (the Woods), Southern Laemae pha or Tsao jia pha (also known as a decedent of Yi tribe people), Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in primitive times. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

After the Ming Dynasty, most Hua Lisu people had become a people that lived in villages high in the mountains or in mountain valleys. However, those who still lived in the Paoshan plains, standing on the side of the [[Qing Dynasty]], fought against the Kingdom of Ming. The Lisu [[knife ladder]] climbing festival was first held as a memorial event of victory over Ming in 1644 CE. The Lisu people adopted their own traditional dance so called "che-ngoh-che" along with the Lisu [[guitar]] which has no bars on the [[fretboard]] from Han Chinese. They also used a musical instrument called [[fulu jewlew]] possibly invented by Yi tribe people. It is a kind of [[flute]] that has about six or seven small [[bamboo]] tubes tied up together to a dried-hollow-[[gourd]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Songs and dances differ according to the occasion. Weddings, homecomings, harvests, and other ceremonial events all have their corresponding music and dances.

Lisu villages are usually built close to water to provide easy access for washing and drinking.&lt;ref name="Dessaint 1972"/&gt;  Their homes are usually built on the ground and have dirt floors and bamboo walls, although an increasing number of the more affluent Lisu are now building houses of wood or even concrete.&lt;ref name="Hutheesing 1990"/&gt;

Lisu subsistence was based on paddy fields, mountain rice, fruit and vegetables.  However, they have typically lived in ecologically fragile regions that do not easily support subsistence. They also faced constant upheaval from both physical and social disasters (earthquakes and landslides; wars and governments). Therefore, they have typically been dependent on trade for survival.  This included work as porters and caravan guards. With the introduction of the [[opium]] poppy as a cash crop in the early 19th century, many Lisu populations were able to achieve economic stability.  This lasted for over 100 years, but opium production has all but disappeared in Thailand and China due to interdiction of production. Very few Lisu ever used opium, or its more common derivative [[heroin]], except for medicinal use by the elders to alleviate the pain of [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;Durrenberger 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lisu practiced [[swidden]] (slash-and-burn) agriculture. In conditions of low population density where land can be fallowed for many years, swiddening is an environmentally sustainable form of [[horticulture]]. Despite decades of swiddening by hill tribes such as the Lisu, northern Thailand had a higher proportion of intact forest than any other part of Thailand. However, with road building by the state, logging (some legal, but mostly illegal) by Thai companies,&lt;ref&gt;Fox 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox et al. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; enclosure of land in national parks, and influx of immigrants from the lowlands, swidden fields can not be fallowed, can not re-grow, and swiddening results in large swathes of deforested mountainsides. Under these conditions, Lisu and other swiddeners have been forced to turn to new methods of agriculture to sustain themselves.&lt;ref&gt;McCaskill and Kempe 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best-known subgroup of the Lisu is the Flowery Lisu in Thailand, due to hill tribe tourism.  Lisu women are notable for their brightly colored dress.  They wear a multi-colored knee-length tunics of red, blue, or green with a wide black belt and blue or black pants. Sleeve shoulders and cuffs are decorated with a dense applique of narrow horizontal bands of blue, red and yellow. Men wear baggy pants, usually in bright colors but normally wear a more Western-type of shirt or top.

Around 2002, as cellular phone signals reached deeper and deeper into the valleys of northern Thailand, the Lisu embraced the technology in unanticipated fashion: the Lisu purchased unlimited calling plans and started to sing and improvise to each other over mobile connections. Lisu people who still adhere to animistic beliefs sing the traditional chants of the story tellers, adding their own improvisations.

The Thai Lisu traditional costume shown here is much different from the main Lisu traditional costume being widely used in Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China and Putao, Danai, Myitkyina, Northern Myanmar.&lt;ref name="Hutheesing 1990"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazing-people.com|title=Amazing People – doco stories &amp; palces|website=Amazing-people.com|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
===Christianity===
{{further information|Lisu Church}}
Beginning in the early 20th century, many Lisu people in India and Burma converted to [[Christianity]]. Missionaries such as [[James O. Fraser]], Allyn Cooke and [[Isobel Kuhn]] and her husband, John, of the [[China Inland Mission]] (now [[OMF International]]), were active with the Lisu of Yunnan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Yunnan Province of China Government Web | work= | url= http://www.eng.yn.gov.cn/yunnanEnglish/145529160029175808/20050623/378813.html|website=Eng.yn.gov.cn | accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the missionaries, James Outram Fraser (1880–1938) was the first missionary to reach the Lisu people in China. Another missionary who evangelized Lisu people in Myanmar was Thara Saw Ba Thaw (1889–1968). It is recorded that James Fraser and Saw Ba Thaw together created the [[Fraser alphabet|Lisu alphabet]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Church of Christ in Myanmar, (75 Jubilee Press, 2008), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many other missionaries who brought Christianity to Lisu people. David Fish researches,

{{quote|There were over a hundred missionaries those who committed their life for spreading the Gospel among the Lisu people. They came from different denominations and mission; China Inland Mission, Disciples of Christ (Church of Christ), Assembly of God, Pentecostal Churches, and so on. The Lisu people accepted those missionaries and their teaching the Gospel so that they converted into Christianity quickly to be followers of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;David Fish, ''The Lisus and Church of Christ in Myanmar,'' (M.A a research paper, Eastern Bible Institute, Hmawbi, Yangon 2005), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, the first missionaries in China and Myanmar were Russell Morse and his wife, Gertrude Erma Howe, whom she became Gertrude Morse after marriage with Russell Morse. The Missionaries of Christian Churches or Church of Christ in Myanmar were Morse families.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Joshua Leme, ''A Church History in Yangon,'' 2012, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In their chronology of mission record, Morse family started their mission in China in 1926 and due to political unrest, they traveled to Burma (Myanmar) and began teaching among Lisu tribe in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Morse, ''Exodus To A Hidden Valley'' (Ohio: William Collins World Press, 1974), 6e.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lisu people's convert to Christianity was relatively fast. It is logged that by the effort of Morse family and missionaries, many Lisu and Rawang converted to Christianity from animism. Before [[World War II]], the Lisu tribes who live in Yunnan, China and Ah-Jhar river valley, Myanmar, were evangelized by missionaries from Tibetan Lisuland Mission and Lisuland Churches of Christ. Many Lisu then converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt; ယိမ္းႏြဲ႕ပါးအဖြဲ႕၊ ''ျပည္ေထာင္စုျမန္မာႏိုင္ငံေတာ္အစိုးရသို႔ တင္တြင္းသည့္ တရုပ္ျမန္မာနုယ္စပ္ေဒ သ စံုစမ္းေရးေကာ္မရွင္၏ အစီရင္ခံစာ၊'' ကခ်င္ျပည္-ပူတာအိုေတာင္တန္းနယ္ (၁၉၉ခုႏွစ္ မွ ၁၉၅၆ ခုႏွစ္ အတြင္း) စာ ၇၀။&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=WP:NOENG|date=January 2018}}

Development done among missionaries for the Lisu included [[education]], [[agriculture]] and [[health care]]. The missionaries created Lisu literature (the written language). With the help of missionaries, the development had occurred for many years. The researcher's father, U Li Ye Jar testified that within 50 years, the development of the Lisu will be at a high speed. Concerning the work of missionaries, David Fish studied,

{{quote|J. Rusell Morse brought many kinds of fruit such as Washington, Orange, Ruby, King-Orange, and Grapefruit. Nowadays, this fruit-raising had spread from Putao to other parts of Myanmar and become an important national asset. He also trained the people the art of carpentry and the construction of buildings. And the Lisu people had also learned the strategy of Church planting from them.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, David 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, the missionaries learned the situation of Lisu culture, so they could rapidly spread Christianity. They used various kind of methods, including teaching [[hymns]], sending medicines and doctors, helping the needy, and providing the funds for domestic missionaries and evangelists. They also helped in developing their agriculture.

The Chinese government's Religious Affairs Bureau has proposed considering Christianity as the official religion of the Lisu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Covell | first = Ralph|date=Spring 2008 | title = To Every Tribe | journal = Christian History &amp; Biography | issue = 98 | pages = 27–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to OMF International estimates, as of 2008, there are now more than 700,000 Christian Lisu in Yunnan, and 450,000 in Burma. Only the Lisu of Thailand have remained unchanged by Christian influences. Christianity is now gradually becoming the dominant religion among the Lisu people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lisu of China | work= OMF International | url= http://www.omf.org/omf/us/peoples_and_places/people_groups/lisu_of_china | accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OMF International (2007), p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animism/shamanism/ancestor worship===
Before Christianity was introduced to Lisu people, they were animists. Archibald Rose points that the religion of the Lisus appears to be a simple form of animism or nat-worship, sacrifices being offered to the spirits of the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Rose and J. Goggin Brown, Lisu (Yawyin), Tribes of the Burma-China Frontier in ''Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'' (No Place: The Baptists Mission Press, 1910), 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Most important rituals are performed by [[shamans]]. The main Lisu festival corresponds to [[Chinese New Year]] and is celebrated with music, feasting and drinking, as are weddings; people wear large amounts of silver jewelry and wear their best clothes at these times as a means of displaying their success in the previous agricultural year. In each traditional village there is a [[sacred grove]] at the top of the village, where the sky spirit or, in China, the Old Grandfather Spirit, are propitiated with [[Sacrificial|offerings]]; each house has an ancestor [[altar]] at the back of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Durrenberger 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (1999), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein-Hutheesing 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{further information|Lisu language}}
Linguistically, the Lisu belong to the [[Yi language|Yi]] or Nuosu branch of the Sino-Tibetan family.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two scripts in use and the Chinese Department of Minorities publishes literature in both. The oldest and most widely used one is the [[Fraser alphabet]] developed about 1920 by [[James O. Fraser]] and the ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] evangelist Ba Thaw. The second script was developed by the Chinese government and is based on [[pinyin]].

Fraser's script for the Lisu language was used to prepare the first published works in Lisu which were a [[catechism]], portions of [[Bible|scripture]], and eventually, with much help from his colleagues, a complete [[New Testament]] in 1936. In 1992, the Chinese government officially recognized the Fraser alphabet as the official script of the Lisu language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Omniglot writing systems &amp; languages of the world | work= Fraser alphabet| url= http://www.omniglot.com/writing/fraser.htm | accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a small portion of Lisu are actually able to read or write the script,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} with most learning to read and write the local language (Chinese, Thai, Burmese) through primary education.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The '''Los Alfaques disaster''' was a road accident and tanker explosion which occurred on 11 July 1978 in [[Alcanar]], near [[Tarragona]], in Spain. The [[tanker truck]] was loaded with 23 tons of highly flammable liquefied [[propylene]]. 217 people (including the driver) were killed and 200 more severely burned.

Most of the victims were vacationers in the Los Alfaques seaside campsite. The campsite is located at km 159 on the [[N-340 road (Spain)|N-340]] [[List of national roads in Spain|national road]], 2&amp;nbsp;km south of the town of [[Sant Carles de la Ràpita]]. It has been renovated since and still exists today.

== Circumstances ==
The truck, consisting of a [[Pegaso]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bomberiles.com/miquelvalls/images/ALFACS1.jpg Photos of the truck at bomberiles.com]. Retrieved on 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[tractor unit]] registered M-7034-C and a [[Fruehauf Corporation|Fruehauf]] [[semi-trailer]] tanker registered M-7981-R, was owned by Cisternas Reunidas S.A. At 10:15 that day, the truck, driven by 50-year-old Francisco Imbernón Villena, arrived at the state-owned Enpetrol [[Oil refinery|refinery]], located at [[La Pobla de Mafumet]], 9&amp;nbsp;km North of Tarragona, to be loaded with propylene for another state-owned company, Paular (now [[Repsol]]), from [[Puertollano]].

At 12:05 the truck left the refinery carrying 23 tons of propylene, nearly 4 tons over the maximum design load of 19.35 tons. The tanker drivers were under instructions to take the smaller N-340 national road instead of the larger [[Autopista AP-7|A-7]] motorway when carrying cargo to Barcelona, in order to avoid the motorway toll.{{Cn|reason=This section of the A7 was not completed until 2005-see wikapedia article Autovía del Mediterráneo. See also Wikapedia article "Accidente del camping de Los Alfaques" which tell the truth about this accident. |date=August 2013}} The N-340 was much narrower and more winding than the [[Autopista AP-7|A-7]], and also carried drivers directly through several densely populated areas.

On a summer day with temperatures from 20–35 °C (68–95 °F), the pressure in the tank would have been {{Convert|1200|–|1700|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.airliquide.com/Encyclopedia.asp?GasID=54 |title= Gas Encyclopedia, Vapor Pressure Graph, Propene |publisher=Air Liquide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident ==
The disaster occurred at ca. 14:35, while the truck was moving past the Los Alfaques campsite after having travelled 102&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://route1963-2.blogspot.com.es/2013/02/la-tragedia-del-camping-de-los-alfaques_21.html|title=EN LA CARRETERA II: LA TRAGEDIA DEL CAMPING DE LOS ALFAQUES. 11 de Julio de 1978. (2ª parte). El camión que sembró la muerte.|first=|last=Route1963|date=21 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver's watch, which was found still attached to the driver's burned wrist, had stopped at 14:36, the time of the explosion.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

There are several different witness reports as to the events directly preceding the blast, all of which are more or less equally plausible. Some reported the tank was already leaking as it approached the site, or sprung a leak with a loud bang while passing the site, and was then stopped by the driver. Others reported the bang being caused by a blown tire which caused the truck to swerve out of control and strike the wall separating the campsite from the roadside, possibly overturning in the process.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In either case, the leaking tanker formed a cloud of gaseous propylene that partially entered the campsite and also drifted on the wind towards a [[discothèque]] to the northeast. The white cloud attracted the attention of campsite patrons, who approached the cloud with curiosity as it continued to spread. As the cloud began to permeate the crowded discothèque, it reached an ignition source and immediately flashed back into the tanker, causing a fire that nearly instantaneously ruptured the weakened tank and ignited the full load of gas.

At that time the campsite to the south was crowded with nearly 1,000 vacationers, mostly German and other foreign tourists, packed tightly in trailers and tents. The blast and fireball (which was estimated at over 1000 °C and left a 65'x5' [19.8 x 1.5 meters]  crater{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}) destroyed everything – cars, trailers and buildings – within a 300-metre radius, gutting over 90% of the main camping area. The discothèque to the northeast, which was later determined to be the likely source of the ignition, was also razed, killing all the staff members inside.

==Victims and emergency response ==
The explosion and fireball instantly killed the driver and other people within the area. A total of 157 people died on site as a result of the initial explosion and the subsequent fires and explosions of cars and gas cylinders used by the tourists. Victims were seen with their hair and clothing aflame running into the sea in an attempt to extinguish the flames.

In the first 45 minutes after the disaster, the wounded were removed in an uncoordinated fashion with the help of other survivors using their own cars and vans. Locals also provided help and took the wounded to the hospitals. Ambulances and other emergency forces gradually arrived. The [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and the armed forces searched the devastated camp for survivors. It took three hours until the last wounded was removed and taken to hospital.

The burning tanker blocked the road, dividing the injured into two groups, one being taken northwards and the other southwards. On the road to the north, the injured received adequate medical care, once they had reached either the hospitals at Amposta or at Tortosa. At this stage, the final destination of 58 severely burned patients was the Francisco Franco Hospital in [[Barcelona]]. 82 severely burned patients were taken south to the La Fe Hospital in [[Valencia]]. In most cases no medical steps of any importance were taken during the journey. Several of the injured developed severe shock on the journey and had no measurable blood pressure on arrival. Many of the patients had burns covering more than 90% of their bodies, and most of them died during the following days. Contributing to the high mortality figure was the inappropriate medical care given en route to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Burn Centre, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden {{doi|10.1016/0305-4179(81)90104-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week following the disaster, the patients from [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] were evacuated to their own countries.

300 people were wounded, some of them severely. 217 people died as a result of the disaster, while the total number of people who died over the following months as a result of their injuries was at least 270. Among them, four were Spaniards, and all the others were foreigners. The official figure for the number of victims is 215.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgatrans.net/temporal/Alfaques.pdf Microsoft Word – Sentencia Alfaques.doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131147/http://www.forgatrans.net/temporal/Alfaques.pdf |date=23 July 2011 }}. (PDF) . Retrieved on 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. Most of them were wearing only swimming suits, and the building where their documents were stored was destroyed in the explosion. There was no DNA test available at that time. As a result of the work done by the forensic teams from the tourists' home countries, all the victims were eventually identified.

Seven of the victims remained unidentified until some time later, and they were interred at the cemetery of [[Tortosa]], Tarragona. The bodies of a French family, consisting of a couple and their two children, were returned to France some years later, after compensation had been settled. The bodies of another family of three originating from [[Colombia]] were never sent home, and they remain the only foreigners to be interred at the cemetery of Tortosa along with local victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariocordoba.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=68682 Diario de Córdoba, 11/07/2003 (in Spanish)]. Diariocordoba.com. Retrieved on 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquiry ==
Following the accident, Cisternas Reunidas accepted responsibility for the disaster, but denied any order or prohibition to the drivers to use the motorway instead of the national road, claiming that it is the driver who chooses which road to take. Later, some workers at the Tarragona plant stated they heard Imbernón heatedly arguing with someone on the phone and demanding money for the motorway toll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://route1963-2.blogspot.com.es/2013/02/la-tragedia-del-camping-de-los-alfaques_21.html|title=EN LA CARRETERA II: LA TRAGEDIA DEL CAMPING DE LOS ALFAQUES. 11 de Julio de 1978. (2ª parte). El camión que sembró la muerte.|first=|last=Route1963|date=21 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Enpetrol initially declined any responsibility, claiming that the delivery of the cargo is on the carrier's responsibility, and they have not received any complaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traficoadr.com/alfaques/alfaques%20(5).htm Article in Spanish]. Traficoadr.com. Retrieved on 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official inquiry identified that the truck had been severely overloaded, and also lacked emergency pressure release valves, which are designed to help prevent a [[Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion|BLEVE]] in case of a fire. However, these valves were no longer mandatory in 1978, although they previously were. The truck was due for an inspection check-over in 1980, and it had passed the previous inspection.

The tank container was manufactured at 13 December 1973 by a workshop from [[Bilbao]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bomberiles.com/miquelvalls/images/ALFACS5.jpg Photos of the tank container at bomberiles.com]. Retrieved on 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and at that time it did not meet the requirements for carrying flammable liquids, since it lacked emergency pressure release valves. Therefore, the tank had been used to carry other substances, some of which were highly corrosive. Tests on the remnants of the steel tank revealed microscopic stress cracks consistent with corrosion caused by previous loads of improperly overpressurized [[anhydrous ammonia]]. Combined with whether the tanker suffered an impact that caused additional structural damage, these factors likely led to the almost instantaneous rupture of the tank when the flames flashed back into the tanker. Even without safety valves, a structurally sound and properly filled tanker should have been able to maintain structural integrity in a fire long enough to at least allow nearby people to escape.

The inquiry also revealed that overloading of tankers was common practice at Enpetrol refineries. The Tarragona facility lacked either a meter to measure the amount of gas dispensed or an automatic shut-off device to prevent overfilling, and consequently most tanks were consistently overloaded. The driver was neither informed of the overloading, nor about the type and class of the cargo, and there was no means for him to check the pressure level of the tank before he departed or to monitor it in transit. He had not attended the [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] training program for drivers of dangerous goods, because the company considered his experience of twenty years as a truck driver to be sufficient. The inquiry also determined that, between 3 January and 7 July that year, 32 tanks left the Tarragona refinery overloaded, with drivers other than Imbernón.

== Aftermath ==
After the tragedy, the transit of populated areas by vehicles carrying dangerous cargo was prohibited in Spain, and would only be driven at night.

In 1982, four employees of ENPETROL and two of Cisternas Reunidas were convicted of [[criminal negligence]], and were sentenced to prison for between one and four years. Later, four of them were released after appealing the Court's decision, and all prison sentences were suspended or reduced. The two companies paid an equivalent of €13.23&amp;nbsp;million (not allowing for inflation){{Citation needed|date = January 2014|reason = How can the amount be converted into euro, which probably didn't exist at the time (year is not stated though), without taking inflation and other parameters into account?}} as compensation to the victims.

== In popular culture ==
The accident is featured in the 2007 German film [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0853063/ Day of Disaster], directed by [[Peter Keglevic]]. However, the film is loosely based on real facts, and contains blunders and factual errors, such as cars or registration plates which could only have appeared years later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0853063/|title=Day of Disaster|date=9 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the driver spending the night before at home with the already (over)loaded tanker parked in front of his house.

== Los Alfaques today ==
Six months after the tragedy, the completely renovated campsite was reopened to tourists. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traficoadr.com/alfaques/alfaques%20(3).htm Article in Spanish]. Traficoadr.com. Retrieved on 11 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The owners of the Los Alfaques campsite have sought relief through Spanish courts under the newly approved "[[Right to Be Forgotten]]" Act passed by Spain in regard to having the disaster land as the top 12 search results on [[Google]], including thumbnail disturbing images of remains and coroner procedures during cleanup of the campground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/02/spain-asks-if-google-search-results-make-your-business-look-bad-can-you-sue.ars|title=Spain asks: If Google search results make your business look bad, can you sue?|last=Anderson|first=Nate|publisher=Ars Technica|date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was dismissed, informing the plaintiffs that they would need to pursue a U.S. lawsuit against Google.

'''Marampudi Joji''' (7 October 1942 – 27 August 2010) was the third [[Archbishop]] of Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eni.ch/highlights/news.shtml?2000/05 Ecumenical news international, 31 May 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_23_36/ai_61635838/pg_3 Malcolm, Theresa, National Catholic Reporter, 7 April 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Bhimavaram]] and died at the Bishop's House, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Bishop-M-Joji-passes-away/articleshow/6448350.cms Bishop M Joji passes away]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and  [[English language|English]] were the languages known to the Archbishop.

==Early years &amp; education==
Joji was educated at the [[Lutheran]] Boarding School in [[Peddapuram]] near [[Samalkot]] which is managed by the [[Priests]] of the [[Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church]] (AELC).

==Ordination &amp; Pastorship==
Joji was ordained as a priest on 14 December 1971&lt;ref name="CathHier"&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bjoli.html Catholic Hierarchy, Archbishop Joji]&lt;/ref&gt; in the diocese of [[Vijayawada]].&lt;ref name="AoH"&gt;Archdiocese of Hyderabad, Ecclesiastical Units 2008, Archbishop's House, 9-1-17/1, Sardar Patel Road, Secunderabad 500 003, Andhra Pradesh, India, pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;  Joji was privileged to have received Blessed [[Mother Teresa]] when she went to [[Vijayawada]] to initiate the work of the [[Missionaries of Charity]].&lt;ref&gt;Photo study from [[The Reverend|Rev.]] [[Dr.]] P. Dass Babu's ''Blessed Mother Teresa of Kolkata'', National Christian Writers Forum, Hyderabad, 2003.  Dass Babu is a ''Telugu Pundit'' and an accomplished Writer / Theologian who earned a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] ([[B. D.]]) degree from the Bishop's College, [[Kolkata]] as well as a Master's degree in communication from a Japanese University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bishopric==
===Diocese of Khammam===
On 21 December 1991, he was appointed as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Khammam|Bishop of Khammam]] and consecrated on 19 March 1992.&lt;ref name="AoH"/&gt; He served until 8 November 1996 when he was transferred to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vijayawada|Diocese of Vijayawada]].

===Diocese of Vijayawada===
Bishop Joji became the Bishop of Vijayawada on 8 November 1996.  However, he took charge of the diocese only on 19 January 1997.&lt;ref name="AoH"/&gt;

==Archbishop of Hyderabad==

On 29 January 2000, he was appointed as the Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hyderabad|Hyderabad]].  He was installed by Archbishop Giorgio Zur in the presence of his predecessor Archbishop [[S. Arulappa]] and of Bishop Joseph S. Thumma on 30 April 2000.&lt;ref name="CathHier"/&gt;

Joji inaugurated the Hyderabad session of the scholarly [[Church History Association of India]] incorporating Church Historians of the [[Pentecostal]], [[Protestant]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]], and [[Catholic]] traditions.

Archbishop Joji was known for his able administration.  He seemed to have headed the Diocese of Vijayawada's Social Service Society before being elevated to the Bishopric of Khammam.

The Archbishop has principally consecrated three Bishops of Andhra Pradesh:

'''Marri''' is one of the strongest Baloch tribes in [[Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]]. The Marri tribe has three major sub-clans; [[Ghazini|Gazeni]], [[Bijarani]] and [[Lohrani]].

==1974 insurgency==

In February 1973, the Pakistani government intercepted an arms shipment from Iraq intended for delivery to Marri tribe militants. President [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] dismissed the Balochistan government and put the province under the central government's rule. The result was that large numbers of Marri tribesmen went to the hills in 1974 for an armed insurgency, and [[Mir Hazar Khan Ramkhani]] formed an organization called the [[Baluch People's Liberation Front]]. It took the Pakistani army four years to bring the situation under control.&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan's Drift Into Extremism: Allah, the Army, and America's War on Terror By Hassan Abbas, Jessica Stern, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7656-1497-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1497-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minor de Jesus Calvo''' is a [[Catholic priest]] and radio personality born in [[Costa Rica]], convicted of fraud and accused of murder in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diarioextra.com/2008/diciembre/05/sucesos01.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427050635/http://www.diarioextra.com/2008/diciembre/05/sucesos01.php |archivedate=2011-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==His works==
Father Minor jumped into the public eye as a charismatic leader in the Catholic Church in Costa Rica, he was able to gather many people in the Paso Ancho church.

===Tv program===
He then got his own TV show, that lasted about 3 minutes, and in which he read a Bible passage and analyzed by applying it to everyday life. This program gave popularity to the father, who soon moved to the radio.

===Radio program===
Radio Maria de Guadalupe was founded with the help of many entrepreneurs, but also monetary contributions collected in donation campaigns organized by the station, through various events, from social, to even people that were made to the radio to deposit their donations.

The station Radio Maria de Guadalupe collected approximately ¢ 1,000,000 (about $2,500 of that time) daily, which is a record in Costa Rican radio, second only to programs (television, radio because no one has these figures) created specifically to raise money, such as Chain Telethon or Mayor.

== Controversy ==
However, criticism from a satirical radio comedy program, called La Patada (The Kick) conducted by a Colombian named [[Parmenio Medina]] (assassinated in 2001), created friction between the two programs, as la patada accused the Radio Maria de Guadalupe of alleged embezzlement, The kick was characterized by a cutting sarcastic humor, and their jokes used to be topics about corruption, [[Association football|football]], politics, and now, "Radio Maria de Guadalupe".

This version was supported by some former employees of the radio, but was denied by the father, despite weighing evidence against him:

* Members of his family and friends made frequent trips to the United States parent company, funded with money from non-clarified
* They did not any give receipts to donors. This prevented making any [[accounting]] clear

The situation worsened when the priest was stopped in his car by police officer of Costa Rica driving on the night in [[La Sabana Metropolitan Park]] (which is not a road crossing zone, and that for the most part, has no lighting at night) accompanied by a [[minor (law)|minor]]. While the father wasn't caught committing a crime, the situation was taken by many as reprehensible, or at least suspect. The father testified that he was teaching the child how to drive.

== Closing Radio Maria de Guadalupe ==

Due to the highly controversial situation, Monsignor [[Román Arrieta Villalobos]] (who would die two years later), the highest Catholic authority in Costa Rica, decided to terminate the operations of the radio. Several groups demonstrated against the closure, as were certain groups of taxi drivers and other followers of the radio. But the decision was taken and held.

Today, the frequency is used by the radio station "La Paz del Dial" and remains of a religious theme.

==The murder of Parmenio ==

On July 7, 2001, [[Parmenio Medina]] was shot dead at the entrance of his home. This crime was perpetrated by [[hired killers]], who fled the scene quickly, police said in a gray Hyundai.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newseum.org/scripts/Journalist/Detail.asp?PhotoID=1532&lt;/ref&gt;

The suspicions relating Calvo to the crime were confirmed when he was arrested on charges of masterminding the crime, along with businessman Omar Chávez.

Parmenio Medina's murder was heavily covered and discussed in Costa Rica. Partly this was because of the direct involvement of a notorious Catholic priest in a country with a heavy Roman Catholic majority. It was also the first murder of a journalist in Costa Rica, and thus a direct challenge to the country's freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parmeniomedina.galeon.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303154705/http://parmeniomedina.galeon.com/ |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some figures of the trial ===
* 9 volumes of court records (one for each suspect)
* 91 cassettes, product of wiretaps
* 145 witnesses (some of which were attempts to coerce, attempt by one or more individuals, to modify a testimony that otherwise would be incriminating to these individuals)
* 803 documents of the Public Ministry (prosecutor of the state court) arguing the criminal case against the accused

On December 18, 2007, father Minor was sentenced to 15 years in prison for fraud in relation to the Catholic station Radio Maria de Guadalupe, but was acquitted of involvement in the murder of Parmenio Medina. Moreover, Omar Chavez was sentenced to 35 years in prison for the murder of Medina and 12 for fraud in relation to Radio Maria de Guadalupe, while another defendant was sentenced to 30 years for murder. In total, the 9 accused, 6 were acquitted and 3 convicted, which had generated much controversy in the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6071">'''ParoleWatch''' was a privately run website started in 1997 that provided public access to data on convicted felons in New York State who were coming up for parole review. The project's aim was to let citizens "communicate their views on would-be parolees to the New York State Parole Board."&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/1997/12/8838|title=Web Watchers Track, Trip Up Parolees|work=Wired|accessdate=2011-01-23|date=December 3, 1997| last=Lindsey| first=Daryl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"ParoleWatch will not be the first such site" with information on potential parolees, ''The New York Times'' reported in April 1997. "For almost a year, the New Jersey State Parole Board has published on the Web a list of inmates eligible for parole. But ParoleWatch might well be the first parole Web site published by a private organization."&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite news|title=New York Group Planning to Use Web Site To Notify Public on Felons' Parole Status|work=The New York Times|date=April 17, 1997|last=Mendels| first=Pamela}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the [[Murder of Polly Klaas|KlaasKids Foundation]], ParoleWatch's founder predicted that "Eventually people in every state will be just a few mouse-clicks away from this kind of data."&lt;ref name="klaaskids"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.klaaskids.org/1998/Winter1998.pdf | title=Keeping America's "Most Unwanted" Behind Bars | accessdate=2011-01-30 | author=Diamond, Joe | date=Winter 1998 | work=Klaas Action Review | publisher=KlaasKids Foundation | pages=3 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216214825/http://klaaskids.org/1998/Winter1998.pdf | archivedate=2010-12-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ParoleWatch was organized by the anti-crime group Take Back New York, and grew out of the group's grass-roots efforts to block the parole of a convicted murderer.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; The [[New York State Department of Correctional Services]] provided the data for ParoleWatch.

''The New York Times'' wrote that the project had "prominent supporters." New York divorce lawyer [[Raoul Felder]] served as chairman of ParoleWatch's advisory board, "which also includes several well-known victims' rights advocates."&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

Felder told ''The Times'' "he backed the project because too often victims receive no notification when offenders are up for parole. 'There is a blank spot in the criminal justice system,' Felder said. 'We put these guys away. They get out and the victims usually have no way of knowing when they get out.' ParoleWatch, he said, 'gives them a fair shot.'&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

According to the ''New York Post'', one effect of ParoleWatch was to turn parole reform into a national issue.&lt;ref name="nyp"&gt;{{cite news | title=Don't Parole Joel | author=New York Post editorial board | date=1997-12-23 | publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In his book ''The Control Revolution: How the Internet is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the World We Know'', [[Andrew L. Shapiro]] said that ParoleWatch "demonstrates much of what is possible when it comes to individuals using interactive technology to transform politics -- and what might go wrong. ... ParoleWatch does a real public service by giving citizens access to data about violent offenders and their release dates." But it prompted "people to 'take action'...based on a very limited view of each case."&lt;ref name="control"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Control Revolution: How the Internet is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the World We Know|last=Shapiro|first=Andrew|year=1999|pages=150–153|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] had voiced similar criticisms when ParoleWatch was launched. In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Take Back New York Executive Director Joe Diamond responded to the ACLU's objections by "conced[ing] that Parolewatch 'is not overly concerned with the prisoner's point of view.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1997/08/6347 |work=Wired | title=Scans: Scarlet Letters from Cyberspace|accessdate=2017-04-28 |date=August 26, 1997 |last=Richtel |first=Matt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106104343/http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1997/08/6347 |archivedate=November 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro wrote that, as a victims' rights organization, ParoleWatch was "fully entitled to express its views on crime and safety" and that law-and-order advocates have always "had the ability to lobby parole boards." In Shapiro's view, however, there was a danger "in ParoleWatch's sophisticated harnessing of new technology. It uses the pinpoint accuracy of a computer database to match citizens in certain neighborhoods with felons who might be released there, and it relies on the Net's interactivity to give folks a free and easy way to voice their opposition -- without having to take time to become well informed, let alone to hear the views of others."

Some of the criticism of ParoleWatch was more tongue-in-cheek. "A better name for the Web site address is www.rotinjail.com," said activist attorney [[Ron Kuby]].&lt;ref name=nydn&gt;{{cite news|last=Fenner|first=Austin|title=Web used to monitor those up for parole|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=February 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polish people  in [[Lebanon]]''' may refer to people born in or residing in [[Lebanon]] of full or partial [[Polish people|Polish]] origin. They are a small group in Lebanon. Almost all of which live in [[Beirut]].

==First contacts with Lebanon==
The first mention of Poles in the areas of modern Lebanon was from the time of the Crusades, which were attended by Polish nobles, as well as numerous pilgrimages to the Holy Land. From this period comes the first recorded pilgrim brother Anselm of Bernardine order that contains a reference to passing through Lebanon. First described the Lebanese lands Prince Nicholas Krzysztof Radziwill in his diary of the journey to Jerusalem, which took place in the years 1582-1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art06.html |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105204239/http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art06.html |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s and 1840s Polish Jesuit missionary Maximilian Stanislaw Ryllo was active in Lebanon. In Ghazir Julius Slovak stopped during his trip to the Middle East in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art06.html |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105204239/http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art06.html |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Crimean War]] Sadyk Pasha formed Cossack cavalry regiment, composed primarily of Poles. In recognition of the regiment was drafted into the Guard and sent to Lebanon in 1865. The first commander of this department was Stefan Gościmiński (Tufan Bey), and his successor Louis Sas Monasterska (Lufti Bey). After 24 years Polish regiment in Lebanon ceased to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art06.html |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105204239/http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art06.html |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 1902-1907 the Pole [[Władysław Czajkowski]] (Muzaffar Pasha) was the governor of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art06.html |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105204239/http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art06.html |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During WW II==
In the years 1943-1946 about 6,000 Poles settled in Lebanon, mostly women and children who, through got out of the Soviet Union via Iran and the Middle East. They joined, a small group of Polish citizens who had  arrived there in the years 1939-1942 and were living in Beirut. Upon arrival the refugees were under the care of Polish Legation, representing the official Polish Government in London, recognized as legitimate by the Lebanese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polonia.wp.pl/title,Polski-cmentarz-w-Bejrucie-odremontowany,wid,12873514,wiadomosc.html|title=Polonia - Najnowsze informacje|author=Grupa Wirtualna Polska|work=wiadomosci.wp.pl|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning the Poles were accepted in the transit camp in Beirut, and then resettled in Ghazirze, Zuk Mikail, Ajaltun, Baladun, Beit-Chabab, Roumie and [[Baabdat]]. It was assumed the school, a small Polish library of about 500 books. There were also hospitals for refugees and the Polish church in Ghazirze. In Bahamdun and Bhannes created Polish spas. From November 1941 Beirut Radio "Levant" broadcast daily programs for the Polish Army in the Middle East, and from February 1942 Polish programs were broadcast twice a day. At the end of the 1940s a Polish cemetery was created by French military units in Beirut, which during the Lebanese Civil War was right next to the "green line" dividing the city and as a result of the bombing was totally destroyed, but was completely renovated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polonia.wp.pl/title,Polski-cmentarz-w-Bejrucie-odremontowany,wid,12873514,wiadomosc.html|title=Polonia - Najnowsze informacje|author=Grupa Wirtualna Polska|work=wiadomosci.wp.pl|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art07.html |accessdate=October 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105190502/http://www.polskiecedry.com/specjalny/art07.html |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern times==
The Poles that were living for many years in Lebanon did not have the ability to contact each other due to ongoing in 1975-1990 civil war. The situation changed only in 1991 with the creation of "Polish Club", transformed in the next year into "Association "Polish Community in Lebanon". The main objective of this organization is to maintain the tradition, culture and mother tongue, as well as the behavior of Polish origin of consciousness in children born in Lebanon. The Polish Association also tries to promote Polish culture among the Lebanese people. In 1992, the association "School of Polish Language and Culture" began operations.  In March 1997, the first issue of the monthly magazine "Polish cedars" was distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,60085,3488743.html|title=Wiadomości - Gazeta.pl|work=gazetapl|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a large role in maintaining contact with their homeland played Polish Military Contingent, which was stationed in Lebanon in the years 1992-2009. An important event in the life of the Polish Lebanese community was the meeting with Pope John Paul II, during his pilgrimage in May 1997. 
During the Israeli-Lebanese conflict in 2006, a portion of Poles, mostly women and children, were temporarily evacuated to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,60085,3488743.html|title=Wiadomości - Gazeta.pl|work=gazetapl|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">'''Psychometrics of racism''' is an emerging field that aims to measure the incidence and impacts of racism on the psychological well-being of people of all races. At present, there are few instruments that attempt to capture the experience of racism in all of its complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=8882844&amp;dopt=Citation The perceived racism scale: a multidimensional assessment of the experience of white racism among African Americans.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-reported inventories==
The Schedule of Racist Events (SRE) is questionnaire for assessing frequency of racial discrimination in lives of [[African American]]s created in 1998 by Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A. Klonoff. SRE is an 18-item self-report inventory, assesses frequency of specific [[racist]] events in past year and in one's entire life, and measures to what extent this [[discrimination]] was stressful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ528856&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;objectId=0900000b8002502e The Schedule of Racist Events: A Measure of Racial Discrimination and a Study of Its Negative Physical and Mental Health Consequences.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[psychometric]] tools for assessing the impacts of racism include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/3/269 Assessing the Stressful Effects of Racism: A Review of Instrumentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological metrics==
In a summary of recent research [[Jules P. Harrell]], Sadiki Hall, and James Taliaferro  describe how a growing body of research has explored the impact of encounters with racism or discrimination on physiological activity. Several of the studies suggest that [[high blood pressure|higher blood pressure]] levels are associated with the tendency not to recall or report occurrences identified as racist and discriminatory. In other words, failing to recognize instances of racism is directly impacted by the blood pressure of the person experiencing the racist event.  Investigators have reported that physiological arousal is associated with laboratory analogues of ethnic discrimination and mistreatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajph.org/cgi/content/abstract/93/2/243 Physiological Responses to Racism and Discrimination: An Assessment of the Evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sept''' is an English word for a division of a family, especially of a [[Scottish clan|Scottish]] or [[List of Irish clans|Irish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henneberry.org/dunn/history.htm Clans and Septs of Ireland], RMK Research.&lt;/ref&gt; The word may derive from the [[Latin]] ''saeptum'', meaning "enclosure" or "fold",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sept |title=sept |accessdate=5 September 2008 |work= |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or via an alteration of "sect".&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Webster's II Dictionaries. (2005.) ''Webster's II New College Dictionary'', 3rd Edition. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. {{ISBN|0-618-39601-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in both Ireland and [[Scotland]], where it may be translated as ''sliocht'', meaning "progeny" or "seed",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GBmV706lfVYC&amp;pg=PA685&amp;lpg=PA685&amp;dq=sliocht+seed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uUk8ZUhuhE&amp;sig=ezaQv6OooZvHWPWTSZl4QYrS1Wo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pb1cT_WZB_GwiQf1y-yfDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sliocht%2Cseed&amp;f=false Woulfe P. (2010.) ''Irish Names and Surnames''. Genealogical Publishing Company.]&lt;/ref&gt; which may indicate the descendants of a person (for example, ''Sliocht Brian Mac Diarmada'', "the descendant of Brian MacDermott").

==Family branches==
''Síol'' is a Gaelic word meaning "progeny" or "seed" that is used in the context of a family or clan with members who bear the same surname and inhabited the same territory,&lt;ref name="Irish Roots"&gt;[http://www.irishroots.org/irishsepts.htm "Septs of Ireland"], Irish Septs Association.&lt;/ref&gt; as a manner of distinguishing one group from another; a family called ''Mac an Bháird'' ([[anglicised]] as "Ward") might be divided into septs such as ''Síol Seán Mac Briain'', ''Síol Conchobhair Óg'', ''Síol Sean Cuinn'', or ''Síol Cú Chonnacht''. Each of these individual septs may further subdivide into more septs, which may sometimes lead to the development of novel surnames and/or the rise of the family such that it may be considered a clan in its own right. Such septs were common in Scotland, where the clan system was well-developed.&lt;ref name="Irish Roots"/&gt;

==Scotland==
In the context of [[Scottish clan]]s, septs are families that followed another family's chief, or part of the extended family and that hold a different surname. These smaller septs would then be part of the chief's larger clan. A sept might follow another chief if two families were linked through marriage, or, if a family lived on the land of a powerful [[laird]], they would follow him whether they were related or not. [[Bond of manrent|Bonds of manrent]] were sometimes used to bind lesser chiefs and his followers to more powerful chiefs. According to the ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'', the [[Martin (name)#Scotland|MacMartins of Letterfinlay]] who were a sept of the [[Clan Cameron]] would have seen themselves as distinct within their own lands, but would have also seen themselves as Camerons if operating elsewhere outside Lochaber.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Lynch, Michael. (2011). ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History''. p. 95. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-19-923482-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonds of manrent and friendship tied obviously non-related kin groups into a wider military, political, and land/food resource sharing clanship.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

Today, sept lists are used by clan societies to recruit new members. Such lists date back to the 19th century, when clan societies and [[tartan]] manufacturers attempted to capitalise on the enthusiasm and interest for all things Scottish. Lists were drawn up that linked as many surnames as possible to a particular clan. In this way, individuals without a "clan name" could connect to a Scottish clan and thus feel "entitled" to its tartan.

One modern member of the [[Lyon Court]]{{Who |date=May 2009}} has described the attribution of such names to particular clans as sometimes being based upon nothing but imagination, and in others cases upon a single recorded instance of a surname.

Also, [[common surnames]], found throughout the [[British Isles]], were linked to particular clans. For example, the surname ''[[Miller (name)|Millar]]'' / ''[[Miller (name)|Miller]]'' was made a sept of [[Clan Macfarlane]], and ''[[Taylor (surname)|Taylor]]'' of [[Clan Cameron]]. Furthermore, [[patronymic]] forms of common [[personal names]] were also linked to particular clans.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell of Airds, Alastair|title=A History of Clan Campbell; Volume 1, From Origins to the Battle of Flodden|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|year=2000|pages=220–221|isbn=1-902930-17-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the false impression that many surnames have one origin and are all related to one another, and that such surnames are historically connected to one particular clan.

==Ireland==

Historically, the term "sept" was not used in Ireland until the 19th century, long after any notion of clanship had been eradicated. The English word "sept" is most accurate in referring to a subgroup within a large clan, particularly when that group has taken up residence outside their clan's original territory (e.g. the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neill]]s, [[Clan Sweeney|MacSweeney]]s, and [[O'Conor|O'Connors]]).

Related [[Irish clans]] often belong to larger groups, dynasties, such as the [[Dál gCais]], [[Uí Néill]], [[Uí Fiachrach]], and [[Hy-Many|Uí Maine]].

Recently, [[Edward MacLysaght]] suggested the English word "sept" be used in place of the word 'clan' with regard to the historical social structure in Ireland, to differentiate it from the centralised Scottish clan system. This would imply that Ireland possessed no formalised clan system, which is not wholly accurate. [[Brehon Law]], the ancient legal system of Ireland clearly defined the clan system in pre-Norman Ireland, with its electoral system limited to the senior sept's members (see [[derbfine]]), which collapsed after the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor Conquest]] in the 16th century. The Irish, when speaking of themselves, employed their term "clan", which means "children"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=clann|url=http://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/clann|website=teanflann.ie|publisher=Foras na Gaeilge|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Irish language|Irish]].

The '''Siemens bribery scandal in Greece''' is a [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[bribery]] [[scandal]] in [[Greece]] over deals between [[Siemens AG]] and Greek government officials during the [[2004 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Athens, Greece]]&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/report-siemens-scandal-may-involve-top-executives/a-2249977|title=Report: Siemens Scandal May Involve Top Executives|publisher=DW|date=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding security systems and purchases by [[OTE]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/01/europe/EU-Greece-Corruption-Siemens.ph|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|date=1 July 2008|title=Greek prosecutor files charges over alleged Siemens corruption scandal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012074516/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/01/europe/EU-Greece-Corruption-Siemens.php|archivedate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no conclusive evidence, the scandal has created a serious change in the attitudes of the Greek public, most notably a dissatisfaction with both main [[political parties in Greece]], [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] and [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) and creating a "hole of authority" leading to a vicious circle of political instability.

It has been claimed that the political outcome of the case may be analogous to that of [[Italy]] 15 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=107953]{{dead link|date=May 2013|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that the bribes may have been up to 100 million Euro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athensnews.gr/athweb/nathens.prnt_article?e=C&amp;f=13273&amp;t=03&amp;m=A21&amp;aa=1]{{dead link|date=May 2013|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bribes were allegedly given in order to win state contracts.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/54917/article/ekathimerini/news/answers-sought-in-siemens-scandal|title=Answers sought in Siemens scandal|date=31 January 2008|newspaper=Kathimerini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been indicated that a few PASOK members acting as individuals may have been involved, although this is simply a claim and nothing has been proven or at least any evidence come to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.greeknewsonline.com/siemens-scandal-causes-political-turbulence/|title=Siemens Scandal Causes Political Turbulence|date=23 June 2008|newspaper=GreekNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Greek [[prosecutor]], after two years of investigations, filed charges on 1 July 2008 for [[money laundering]] and [[bribery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/siemens-hit-by-corruption-charges-in-greece-norway/a-3455188|title=Siemens Hit by Corruption Charges in Greece, Norway|work=DW|date=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that it is certain Siemens divisions that were involved in the transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.people.cn/90001/90777/90853/6461400.html|title=Former Siemens executive sentenced for bribery scandal|newspaper=People's Daily|date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 30 May 2008, a prosecutor's investigation took place at the offices of [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] for donations and grants by Siemens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mignatiou.com/2015/12/o-stournaras-o-kiriakos-ke-to-terastio-politiko-skandalo-tis-siemens/|title=Ο Στουρνάρας, ο Κυριάκος και το τεράστιο πολιτικό σκάνδαλο της Siemens|date=2015-12-23|website=Mignatiou.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the central figure of the scandal, ex-Siemens chief executive in Greece [[Michalis Christoforakos]], left for Germany to avoid arrest, in obscure conditions involving the foreign minister [[Dora Bakogianni]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.news247.gr/politiki/mpakogianni-o-tsipras-petaei-laspi-ston-anemistira-gia-christoforako.6524050.amp.html Μπακογιάννη: ο Τσίπρας πετά λάσπη]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tasos Mantelis]], former Minister for Transport and Communications during the PASOK administration in 1998, admitted in May 2010 to a parliamentary investigation committee that the sum of 200,000 German marks was deposited in 1998 in a Swiss bank account from Siemens during his administration, allegedly for funding his election campaign. A further deposit of 250,000 German marks was made into the same bank account in 2000 which Mantelis claims is from an unknown source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanea.gr/news/greece/article/4576575/?iid=2|title=Χορηγός μου η... Siemens|newspaper=Ta Nea|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2012, the Greek government has signed a settlement with Siemens worth 330 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9502146/Debt-crisis-Greek-government-signs-330m-settlement-with-Siemens.html|title=Debt crisis: Greek government signs €330m settlement with Siemens|date=27 August 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==

The trial of the persons accused of involvement in the scandal was scheduled to begin on February 24, 2017. A total of 64 individuals are accused, both Greek and German nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1174442/ypothesi-siemens-stis-24-febrouariou-arxizei-i-diki|title=Υπόθεση Siemens: Στις 24 Φεβρουαρίου αρχίζει η δίκη|newspaper=Naftemporiki|date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/greece-indicts-13-germans-over-siemens-bribery-scandal/a-18304651|date=9 March 2015|work=DW|title=Greece indicts 13 Germans over Siemens bribery scandal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central figure of the scandal however, ex-Siemens chief executive in Greece [[Michalis Christoforakos]], against whom European arrest warrants are pending,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=564433|title=Courts issue warrants for arrest of Karavelas and Christoforakos|newspaper=To Vima|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/kai-trito-eyropaiko-entalma-syllipsis|title=Και τρίτο ευρωπαϊκό ένταλμα σύλληψης|newspaper=efysn|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; will likely be absent, as Germany refuses his extradition to this day. Initially arrested in Germany in 2009, the accusations against him by German courts have been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/siemens-bribery-scandal-in-greece-ex-boss-could-help-shed-light-on-corruption-a-633198.html|title=Ex-Boss Could Help Shed Light on Corruption|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=29 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=94064|title=Ελεύθερος ο Χριστοφοράκος|newspaper=Eleftherotypia|date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece has been demanding his extradition since 2009, and considers him a fugitive from justice. Christoforakos during his trial in Germany testified to has bribed (2%) both the two political parties, ND and PASOK (through Geitonas, Vartholomeos, partners of [[Kostas Simitis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.documentonews.gr/article/se-tsanta-pilotoy-oi-mizes-apo-ta-mayra-tameia-ths-siemens Οι μίζες της siemens]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Mantelis was found guilty by Greek courts of bribery and money laundering, receiving an eight-year suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2017/07/28/former-greek-minister-guilty-of-receiving-bribe-from-siemens/|date=28 July 2017|newspaper=Greek Reporter|title=Former Greek Minister Guilty of Receiving Bribe from Siemens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, prosecutor Georgios Voulgaris reiterated the warrant to bring Christoforakos (including five German nationals and ex-Siemens top figures) to trial, making it the third time Greek Justice made this demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reporter.gr/Eidhseis/335407-Ypothesh-Siemens-Protash-eisaggelea-%CE%9Da-parapemfthei-se-dikh-o-Christoforakos|title= Υπόθεση Siemens-Πρόταση εισαγγελέα: Να παραπεμφθεί σε δίκη ο Χριστοφοράκος|website=Reporter.gr|date=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegreekobserver.com/politics/article/23271/prosecutor-recommends-trial-ex-head-siemens-greece-ose-contracts-1999/|title= Prosecutor recommends trial for ex head of Siemens in Greece over OSE contracts in 1999|newspaper=Greek Observer|date=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali's father and mother, who were [[cousins]], [[eloped]]; his mother later said: "Mazhar left for the Middle East on [[military service]]. I was very [[pregnant]] by then. We didn’t see each other for two years. Our son Tariq was born while Mazhar was away. By the time he returned, I had joined the [[Communist]] [[Communist Party of Pakistan |Party]]. I had given away my entire trousseau, including the family jewels, to the Party." &lt;ref name="The Friday Times 27 March 2015"/&gt;

===Emerging activism===
Ali first became politically active in his teens, taking part in opposition to the military dictatorship of Pakistan. An uncle who worked in the Pakistani military intelligence&lt;ref name='frontline2013' /&gt; warned his parents that Ali could not be protected.&lt;ref name="jamescampbell"/&gt; His parents therefore decided to get him out of Pakistan and sent him to England to study at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]].&lt;ref name="jamescampbell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/feature_tariqali.shtml |title=Tariq Ali profile |accessdate=26 April 2007 |work=[[BBC Four]] Documentary article |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917223148/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/feature_tariqali.shtml |archivedate=17 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected President of the [[Oxford Union]] in 1965. In 1967 Ali was one of 64 prominent figures, including the Beatles, who signed a petition calling for the legalisation of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1967/07/24/the-beatles-call-for-the-legalisation-of-marijuana/ |title=The Beatles call for the legalisation of marijuana |date=24 July 1967|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's tenure at the Union included a meeting with [[Malcolm X]] in December 1964 during which Malcolm X expressed deep consternation about his own risk of assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ali | first = Tariq | title = Leaving Shabazz | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 69 | publisher = | date = May–June 2011 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/69/tariq-ali-leaving-shabazz | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Encuentros Averroes Córdoba. El paradigma de Córdoba (2011).jpg|thumb|Tariq Ali presenting the Spanish version of ''Conversations with Edward Said'' in Córdoba, Spain, in 2010]]
His public profile began to grow during the [[Vietnam War]], when he engaged in debates against the war with such figures as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Michael Stewart, Baron Stewart of Fulham|Michael Stewart]]. He testified at the [[Russell Tribunal]] over US involvement in Vietnam. As time passed, Ali became increasingly critical of American and Israeli foreign policies. He was also a vigorous opponent of American relations with Pakistan that tended to back [[military dictatorship]]s over democracy. He was one of the marchers on the [[U.S. Embassy, London|American embassy in London]] in 1968 in a demonstration against the [[Vietnam war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/22/vietnamwar|last=Ali|first=Tariq|title=Where has all the rage gone?|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=22 March 2008|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Active in the [[New Left]] of the 1960s, he has long been associated with the ''[[New Left Review]]''. Ali inserted himself into politics through his involvement with ''[[The Black Dwarf (Ali)|The Black Dwarf]]'' newspaper, he joined the [[International Marxist Group]] (IMG) in 1968. He was recruited to the leadership of the IMG and became a member of the International Executive Committee of the (reunified) [[Reunified Fourth International|Fourth International]]. He also befriended influential figures such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/5/29/1968_40_years_later_tariq_ali |title=1968, Forty Years Later: Tariq Ali Looks Back on a Pivotal Year in the Global Struggle for Social Justice |publisher=Democracynow.org |date=29 May 2008

 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 Ali was in [[Camiri]], [[Bolivia]], not far from where [[Che Guevara]] was captured, to observe the trial of [[Régis Debray]]. He was accused of being a Cuban revolutionary by authorities. Ali then said: "If you torture me the whole night and I can speak Spanish in the morning I'll be grateful to you for the rest of my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSe-6XkzZhs |title=From Vietnam To Iraq To Bolivia-Tariq Ali |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period he was an IMG candidate in [[Sheffield Attercliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Attercliffe]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] and was co-author of ''Trotsky for Beginners'', a cartoon book. In 1981, Ali quit the IMG and joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]  to support [[Tony Benn]] in his bid to become deputy leader of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1981/12/ali.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, he published the satire ''[[Redemption (1990 novel)|Redemption]]'', on the inability of the Trotskyists to handle the downfall of the [[Eastern bloc]]. The book contains parodies of many well-known figures in the Trotskyist movement. In 1999 Ali strongly criticised US and UK interventions in the [[Balkans]] in the piece ''Springtime for NATO''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ali | first = Tariq | title = Springtime for NATO | journal =New Left Review| volume = I | issue = 234 | publisher =| date = March–April 1999 | url = http://newleftreview.org/I/234/tariq-ali-springtime-for-nato | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book, ''Clash of Fundamentalisms'', aimed to put the events of the [[September 11 attacks]] in historical perspective. He followed that with ''[[Bush in Babylon]]'', which criticised the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by American president [[George W. Bush]]. The book uses poetry and critical essays in portraying the [[war in Iraq]] as a failure. Ali believes that the new [[Federal government of Iraq|Iraqi government]] will fail.

Ali has remained a critic of modern [[neoliberal]] economics and was present at the 2005 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil, where he was one of 19 to sign the [[Porto Alegre Manifesto]]. He supports the model of [[Bolivarian Revolution]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://versouk.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/oliver-stone-tariq-ali-and-mark-weisbrot-respond-to-ny-times-attack-on-south-of-the-border/ |title=Oliver Stone, Tariq Ali and Mark Weisbrot respond to NY Times attack on South of the Border " Verso UK's Blog |publisher=Versouk.wordpress.com |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been described as "the alleged inspiration" for the [[Rolling Stones]]' song "[[Street Fighting Man]]", recorded in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Hazou, Christopher Hazou, [https://archive.is/20120524150633/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/092707/news2.html "Journalism and jingoism: Ownership and gullibility are two recurring problems for the Western press, says author and activist Tariq Ali"], ''Montreal Mirror''.

Ali has also written in favour of [[Scottish independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/13/scots-undo-union-of-rogues-independence-1707-honour|title=Scots, undo this union of rogues.

During the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]], Ali was one of the few figures on the left to support Britain leaving the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2015/s4473089.htm |title=Lateline - 31/05/2016: Interview: Tariq Ali, British writer and commentator |website=Abc.net.au |date=31 May 2016 |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screenplay==
Tariq Ali's ''The Leopard and The Fox'', first written as a [[BBC]] screenplay in 1985, is about the last days of [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]. Never previously produced because of a censorship controversy, it was finally premiered in New York in October 2007, the day before former Pakistani Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] returned to her home country after eight years in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alteregoproductions.org/blog/2007/07/the_leopard_and_the_fox_our_ne.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820013744/http://www.alteregoproductions.org/blog/2007/07/the_leopard_and_the_fox_our_ne.htm |archivedate=20 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Ali, alongside [[Mark Weisbrot]] wrote the screenplay to the [[Oliver Stone]] documentary ''[[South of the Border (2009 film)|South of the Border]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southoftheborderdoc.com/cast-credits/ |title=Cast &amp; Credits " South of the Border – a film by Oliver Stone |publisher=Southoftheborderdoc.com |date= |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave a favourable account of Hugo Chávez and other left-wing Latin American leaders.  Interviewed in the documentary, Ali explained the role that Bolivian water privatisation and the [[2000 Cochabamba protests]] played in eventually bringing [[Evo Morales]] to power.

==Personal life==
Ali currently lives in [[Highgate]], north London, with his partner Susan Watkins, [[editor]] of the ''[[New Left Review]]''. He has three children: Natasha from a previous relationship, and Chengiz and Aisha with Watkins. Growing up in a secular family that was more culturally Muslim rather than religious, today he describes himself as agnostic. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-hunter-davies-interview-for-you-tariq-ali-the-revolution-is-over-the-sixties-marxist-bogeyman-has-matured-into-a-minor-media-mogul----and-he-has-managed-to-acquire-a-sense-of-humour-1395731.html|title=The Independent interview with Hunter Davies|website=Independent.co.uk|date=22 February 1994|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Arya Marriage Validation Act, 1937''' (Act No. 19 of 1937) is a legislation enacted by the British Government in India during the pre-independence era to recognize inter marriages among [[Arya Samajis]].&lt;ref name="theindianlawyer"&gt;{{cite web |title=ARYA MARRIAGE VALIDATION ACT, 1937 |url=http://theindianlawyer.in/statutesnbareacts/acts/a62.html |website=theindianlawyer.in |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Background ==
Arya Samajis, who formed an appreciable number of Indians, believed that the caste system prevailing in British ruled India was not in consonance with the sacred Shastra and scriptures. British rulers, of course, never tried to interfere with the customary marriage laws prevailing among different sects of the society. However, when people from various sects, who opposed the caste system and fed up with the deteriorating condition of the Hinduism, adopted concept of [[Arya Samaj]] and became Arya Samajis. Marriages took place between the Arya Samajis irrespective of the fact that prior to the marriage both the bride and bridegroom belonged to different caste or sub castes other than Hindu. As such they feared that these marriages could be declared invalid solely on the point that the parties before the marriage belonged to different castes between whom marriage was not permissible as per the custom prevailing at that time. 

In order to address such an issue the Select Committee proposed a legislation which was enacted  in order to validate all such marriages and recognize the marriage between two Arya Samajis as valid.&lt;ref name="legalcrystal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Arya Marriage Validation Act 1937 Complete Act - Citation 133119 - Bare Act {{!}} LegalCrystal |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/act/133119/arya-marriage-validation-act-1937-complete-act |website=www.legalcrystal.com |accessdate=4 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text of Sec.2 of the Act ==
Section 2 of the Act was meant to validate all such marriages between Arya Samajis and this is the only substantial provision of the Act:
{{quote|'''Marriage between Arya Samajis not to be invalid''':- Notwithstanding any provision of Hindu Law, usage or custom to the contrary no marriage contracted whether before or after the commencement of this Act between two persons being at the time of marriage Arya Samajis shall be invalid or shall be deemed ever to have been invalid by reason only of the fact that the parties at any time belonged to different castes or different sub castes of Hindus or that either or both of the parties at any time before the marriage belonged to a religion other than [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="latestlaws"&gt;{{cite web |title=Arya Marriage Validation Act, 1937 |url=https://www.latestlaws.com/bare-acts/central-acts-rules/civil-laws/arya-marriage-validation-act-1937/ |website=Latest laws |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Bohemian Girl''''' is a [[ballad opera]] composed by [[Michael William Balfe]] with a libretto by [[Alfred Bunn]].  The plot is loosely based on a [[Cervantes]] tale, ''La Gitanilla''.

The best-known aria from the piece is "[[I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls]]" in which the main character, Arline, describes her vague memories of her childhood.  It has been recorded by many artists, most famously by [[Dame Joan Sutherland]], and also by the Norwegian soprano [[Sissel Kyrkjebø]] and Irish singer [[Enya]].

==Performance history==
The opera was first produced in [[London]] at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] on 27 November 1843.  The production ran for more than 100 nights and enjoyed many revivals worldwide including: [[New York City]] (25 November 1844), [[Dublin]] (1844) and [[Philadelphia]] (1844).&lt;ref name="Loewenberg"&gt;Loewenberg, columns 832-833.  Loewenberg's listing of a production in Madrid on 9 April 1845 in an Italian translation by R. Paderni is evidently incorrect. No such performance can be traced, and D'Erme (see '''Sources''') demonstrates that Roberto Paderni's Italian version was created for the Trieste production on 12 February 1854.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several versions in different languages  were also staged during Balfe’s lifetime. The [[German language|German]] version, ''Die Zigeunerin'', premiered in [[Vienna]] in 1846, the [[Italian language|Italian]] adaptation and translation, titled ''La zingara'', was originally staged in [[Trieste]] in 1854, and finally a four-act [[French language|French]] version, ''La Bohemienne'', was mounted in [[Rouen]] in 1862, conducted by composer [[Jules Massenet]], then aged only 20, and with the celebrated [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Celestine Galli-Marie]] in the role of the Gypsy Queen. If ''Die Zigeunerin'' enjoyed fairly widespread circulation in the countries of German language or culture, ''La zingara'' was often revived also in English-speaking cities, such as London, Dublin, New York, [[Boston]] and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishandirishworld.com/ "Michael William Balfe" on britishandirishworld.com] with detailed account of Balfe's life and work&lt;/ref&gt; The very successful 1858 run of ''La zingara'' at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London, for which Balfe was rewarded with an extra cheque for fifty [[Pound sterling|pounds]], starred [[Marietta Piccolomini]], [[Marietta Alboni]] and [[Antonio Giuglini]].&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera "remained in the repertories of British touring companies until the 1930s and was revived in 1932 at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]".&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Since World War II, it has been staged by the Belfast Operatic Society at the 1978 [[Waterford]] International Festival of Light Opera, in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulsteractors.com/g/ Actor Emer Gillespie on ulsteractors.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Castleward Opera]], [[Strangford]], in Northern Ireland in 2006 and by [[Opera South (UK)|Opera South]], [[Haslemere]], in England in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operasouth.co.uk/pastshows/200802/index.html Opera South shows on operasouth.co.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202223744/http://www.operasouth.co.uk/pastshows/200802/index.html |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
A [[Poland|Polish]] noble, Thaddeus, in exile in [[Austria]], joins a band of [[Romani people|gypsies]]. He saves Arline, the infant daughter of Count Arnheim, from being killed by a deer. The count, in gratitude, invites him to a banquet, where Thaddeus refuses to toast a statue of the Austrian Emperor, instead splashing it with wine, and escapes from his enraged host with the help of his gypsy friend Devilshoof, who kidnaps Arline.

===Act 2===
Twelve years have elapsed. Arline can only vaguely remember her noble upbringing. She and Thaddeus are sweethearts, but the Gypsy Queen is also in love with him. Arnheim's nephew Florestein falls in love with Arline (not recognising her), but the Queen plants a medallion stolen from Florestein on Arline. Florestein recognises the medallion and has her arrested. She is tried before the Count who recognises the scar left on her arm from the deer attack.

===Act 3===
Arline is at a ball in her father's castle, where she feels [[nostalgic]] for her Romany upbringing and for her true love. Thaddeus breaks into the castle through a window and pleads for her hand. He eventually wins the trust of the count whom he insulted twelve years ago, and the Count gives them his blessing. The Gypsy Queen [[stalking|stalks]] Thaddeus to the castle and tries to break in through the same window to kill Arline with a musket and kidnap Thaddeus. Before she can execute her plan, however, Devilshoof tries to wrest the weapon from her hands and she is accidentally killed in the scuffle.

Aubrey Smith]] plays Devilshoof.

An early sound [[short subject]] version of the opera was filmed in Britain in 1927, starring [[Pauline Johnson (actress)|Pauline Johnson]] as Arline and [[Herbert Langley]] as Thaddeus.

[[The Bohemian Girl (1936 film)|The best-known version]] is undoubtedly the 1936 full-length [[Laurel and Hardy]] film, described in the opening credits as "A Comedy Version of The Bohemian Girl". The characters played by Laurel and Hardy do not appear in the stage opera, nor does Thaddeus appear in the film.

''La gitanilla'' itself has been filmed three times, but never in English.

==Other references==
''The Bohemian Girl'' is mentioned in the short stories "[[Clay (short story)|Clay]]" and "[[Eveline]]" by [[James Joyce]] which are both parts of ''[[Dubliners]]''.  In "Clay", the character Maria sings some lines from "I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls".  The aria is quoted again in Joyce's novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

[[Booth Tarkington]] mentions the opera, though not by name, in ''[[The Two Vanrevels]]'', and quotes a line of the aria "I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls".

The opera is mentioned, and the aria is referred to several times, in the novel ''[[Dragonwyck (novel)|Dragonwyck]]'', by [[Anya Seton]], set in 1844.  The song also appears in the movie version of the book.

[[Willa Cather]] has referenced the work.  One of her short stories, entitled "[[The Bohemian Girl (short story)|The Bohemian Girl]]", incorporates quotes from some of the arias (again including "I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls").  The plot of the story also has some substantial parallels to the original.

The aria "I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls" is sung in the film ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]''.  The aria was played and sung by the character Clementina Cavendish in the 1998 film ''[[The Governess]]''.

==Recordings==
Several recordings exist of "I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls"; one is included on Sutherland's compilation disc ''La Stupenda''.  Sutherland's husband, conductor [[Richard Bonynge]], recorded a complete version of ''The Bohemian Girl'' with Sutherland and Bonynge's protégée, Nova Thomas, singing the title role.  It is one of the only complete recordings of the entire opera and still in print via [http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=170449 ArkivMusic].

'''''The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith''''' is a play by [[Sir Arthur Wing Pinero]]. It was first produced on 13 March 1895 at the [[Garrick Theatre]], with [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] playing the lead role of Agnes Ebbsmith. The theme of the play is social radicalism. The title character is a vehement critic of all social conventions, especially marriage, and an advocate of [[free love]].

==Characters==
*  Agnes Ebbsmith
*  Lucas Cleeve
*  Sybil Cleeve, wife of Lucas
*  Sir Sandford Cleeve, [[Baronet]], brother of Lucas
*  The Duke of St. Olpherts, uncle of Lucas
*  Mrs. Gertrude Thorpe, a young widow, friend of Agnes
*  Rev. Amos Winterfield, bachelor older brother of Gertrude
*  Sir George Brodrick, a prominent [[United Kingdom|British]] physician
*  Dr. Kirke, a British physician in [[Venice]]
*  Fortune, manservant of Lucas
*  Antonio Poppi, servant of Agnes and Lucas
*  Nella, servant of Agnes and Lucas
*  Hephzibah, servant of Gertrude and Amos

==Plot==
Agnes, a 33-year-old widow, is staying in Venice with Lucas, to whom she is ''not'' married, though the servants and her friend Gertrude have assumed so. Lucas was a rising young [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician who abandoned his wife and career for Agnes. They met when she was sent to [[Italy]] to nurse him through a bout of [[malaria]] contracted in [[Rome]]. She had been married unhappily, and after her husband died became a prominent radical lecturer, and then a nurse to earn a living. Lucas was also unhappy in his marriage and they fell in love. Now they (or at least she) envision a future of writing passionate essays against marriage, lecturing and campaigning.

His relatives do not accept his decision. His uncle the Duke comes to Venice to "arrange" matters. He suggests a sham reconciliation between Lucas and his wife, and for Agnes, "The suburban villa, the little garden, a couple of discreet servants—everything à la mode." Agnes sneers at this, of course, but is horrified to discover that Lucas actually considers it. She reluctantly agrees.

Gertrude, though shocked by Agnes' open "immorality", has come to appreciate her philosophy. She now urges Agnes to reject this hypocritical arrangement, and instead to come with her and Amos to their home in [[Yorkshire]]. Amos also appeals to her, urging her to pray for guidance. Agnes agrees to go with them.

Lucas now rejects the Duke's proposal, and the Duke asks Gertrude and Amos to stop interfering.

Sybil Lucas now appears. She confronts Agnes, and—bizarrely—asks her to return to Lucas and get him to return to London. She despises Lucas, but she loved him once, and doesn't want to see him "utterly wasted". Also (though this is unspoken) an apparent reconciliation would relieve her of a great humiliation. This even though ''he'' made ''her'' as miserable as Agnes' husband did her. Agnes breaks down and agrees. But then Gertrude intervenes: this path will corrupt and destroy Agnes.

Sybil now breaks down and repudiates the deal.

Lucas makes a last effort to join with Agnes, and resume their "free love" life, but Agnes has had it; she thought she was a leader, a moral example, who would show the world "how men and woman may live independent and noble lives without rule, guidance or sacrament", but she proved weak and corruptible. And she can't sit in judgment of Sybil any longer; she will go with Amos and Gertrude, and she urges Lucas to learn to pray.

==Themes==
The chief theme in the play is criticism of conventional social institutions, primarily marriage: "the choked-up, seething pit", "the right to destroy years and years of life". Agnes justifies her adulterous "Free Union" arrangement with Lucas by telling of her miserable marriage, and by dismissing Sybil as "the shrew, the termagant he has now fled from..." She upbraids the Duke for his hypocrisy in marrying a wealthy woman to maintain his position while continuing his debauchery with other women. Gertrude confesses that her late husband made her unhappy, and that she was in love with another man (who is also dead). Sybil tells of her unhappiness with Lucas.

Agnes also upbraids the Duke for his life of unearned luxury, while the masses starve and toil.

But in addition, Agnes is hostile to traditional social conventions. She doesn't want to be "pretty", she is offended when Lucas buys her an elegant gown, and she is disgusted when Lucas waxes conventionally poetical about their future life as ''not'' public radicals.

However, the play also, more subtly, attacks the conventions of the radicalism of the time. The "Free Union" between Lucas and Agnes collapses. Even before the Duke proposes the "reconciliation", Lucas has already decided that he and Agnes should not become professional radicals as she had planned. Sybil shows that he is as much to blame for their estrangement as she is. The Duke reveals Lucas as "in morals - an epicure"; that is, a playboy posing as a reformer.

Agnes, in the end, abandons radicalism for at least a while, and turns to religion. Gertrude and Amos are the figures who are not exposed or condemned.

==2014 Revival==

In 2014, London-based production company [[Primavera Productions]] presented the first ever revival of the play at the [[Jermyn Street Theatre]]. Rhiannon Sommers played Agnes Ebbsmith and [[Christopher Ravenscroft]] played the Duke of St Olpherts, with Max Hutchinson as Lucas Cleeve. Abbey Wright directed the revival.

'''The Sex Party''' was a [[political party]] based in [[British Columbia]], Canada. The party was guided by the philosophy of the [[sex-positive movement]]. Among other points, the party advocated for reform of [[sex education]] in schools so that sexual issues are taught more gradually over time and included a more comprehensive coverage of them. They advocated for the repeal of laws that promote [[antisexualism]], such as [[Prostitution and the law|prostitution laws]] and [[Censorship in Canada|censorship]]. They also supported making [[Valentine's Day]] a statutory holiday and renaming [[Victoria Day]] to Eros Day.

The Sex Party was active for nearly eight years, between March 2005 and December 2012 when it de-registered with [[Elections BC]]. Its leader was [[John Ince (politician)|John Ince]], a Vancouver lawyer, author of ''[[The Politics of Lust]]'' and small business owner. He was one of three candidates representing The Sex Party in the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|May 2005 provincial election]] and one of the party's three candidates in the [[British Columbia general election, 2009|2009 provincial election]]. None of its candidates won an election. The party attempted to become active in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]] but encountered resistance from [[Canada Post]], which refused to distribute its election material. The Sex Party challenged the Canada Post decision in federal court. The judgement found that Canada Post was within its rights to reasonably restrict (within that specific ad-mail program) material that was sexually explicit but that its application to the party's election material was improper.  The court then ordered Canada Post to re-write its policy regarding sexually explicit material in that program.

==Political positions==
The Sex Party was guided by the philosophy of [[sex-positivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/bcvotes2009/story/2009/04/09/bcv-other-parties.html |title=B.C.'s other political parties |publisher= [[CBC News]] |date=May 4, 2009 |accessdate= December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the party did not maintain a full slate of policy positions, both its federal and provincial election platforms have three goals: reform of how [[sex education]] is taught, "repeal sex-negative laws and regulations, and support sex-positive community".&lt;ref name=provplat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesexparty.ca/about-us/platform-provincial |date=February 2009 |title=Platform - Provincial |publisher=The Sex Party |accessdate=December 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210152152/http://thesexparty.ca/about-us/platform-provincial |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesexparty.ca/about-us/platform-federal |date=February 2007 |title=Platform - Federal |publisher=The Sex Party |accessdate=December 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206030343/http://www.thesexparty.ca/about-us/platform-federal |archivedate=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding education the party advocated for a restructuring of sex education in public schools so that it is taught gradually, rather than all in one class, and would include other aspects of human sexuality, like non-coital contact, emotional intimacy, and [[LGBT]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alarm clocks kill dreams |last=Soupcoff |first=Marni |newspaper= [[National Post]] |date=May 2, 2005 |page=A21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sex Party wanted provincial funding directed at research into sexuality policy issues and an expansion [[University of British Columbia]]'s Critical Studies in Sexuality program into an entire department. Regarding sex-negative laws, The Sex Party wanted to work towards undoing legislation and regulations that support [[antisexualism]]. This included legalizing prostitution,&lt;ref name=platform&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex Party lays out positions |last=Girard |first=Daniel |newspaper= [[Toronto Star]] |date=April 15, 2005 |page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting a Sex Worker Empowerment Program to counsel and educate sex workers, reserving areas on public parks and beaches for nudists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex Party lays out poll platform |newspaper= [[Calgary Herald]] |date= April 13, 2005 |page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for sexually explicit private gatherings, (uncensored) films, and entertainment,&lt;ref name=platform/&gt; and repealing provisions that allow municipalities to prohibit the sale of [[sex toy]]s.&lt;ref name=provplat/&gt; Regarding sex-positive community issues, The Sex Party wanted to enable residents of long term care facilities to express their sexuality in a safe, respectful and dignified manner,&lt;ref name=equal/&gt; create a Sex Positive Press Council to expose and remove censorship, make [[Valentines Day]] a statutory holiday, and rename [[Victoria Day]] to Eros Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex Party added to campaign's fringe festival of bit players |last=Hawthorn |first= Tom |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date= April 23, 2009 |page=S3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005 provincial election==
The Sex Party was registered with [[Elections BC]] in March 2005 with its founder, [[John Ince (politician)|John Ince]], also acting as the party leader. Ince was a [[Vancouver]] lawyer, author and co-owner of a store that hosted educational seminars and artistic shows about human sexuality, as well as selling sex-themed merchandise. He had been critical of government laws that perpetuated or resulted in harmful attitudes towards sex-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex, sloth, anarchy: Fringe has it all |last=Armstrong |first=Jane |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date=April 21, 2005 |page=S1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ince previously authored a non-fiction book, ''[[The Politics of Lust]]'', which addresses the impact of [[antisexualism|antisexual]] attitudes or [[erotophobia]] on a society's political organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.straight.com/article/sexual-freedom |title=Sexual freedom |first=Daniel |last=Wood |publisher= [[The Georgia Straight]] |date=December 15, 2005 |accessdate= December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party launched its election platform and candidates at a press conference at the [[Vancouver Public Library]] in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=B.C.'s Sex Party to lay bare its platform |last=Baglole |first=Joel |newspaper= [[The Vancouver Sun]] |date=April 13, 2005 |page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party nominated three candidates in the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|May 17, 2005 provincial election]], none of whom were elected:
*John Ince in [[Vancouver-Burrard]],
*Sex educator and small business owner Yvonne Tink in [[Vancouver-Kingsway (provincial electoral district)|Vancouver-Kingsway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An empty apology, all about sex |newspaper= The News |location= [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia]] |date=April 30, 2009 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Patrick Clark, a man living with [[cerebral palsy]] who sought to raise awareness about the sex lives of people living with disabilities, in [[Vancouver-Fairview]].&lt;ref name=equal&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.straight.com/article/equal-opportunity-sex |title=Equal-opportunity sex |first=Pieta |last=Woolley |publisher= [[The Georgia Straight]] |date=May 5, 2005 |accessdate= December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the election, the party held a fundraiser which featured erotic art meant to illustrate political themes and a performance piece involving couples having sex behind a screen, erotic poetry, and body painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Think Che Guevara in silk bikini briefs — OK, don't |last=Murphy |first=Dan |newspaper=[[The Province]] |location= [[Vancouver]] |date=May 8, 2005 |page=A27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After employees of the [[Liquor Control and Licensing Branch]] told Ince that the art installation would likely result in the refusal of a special event liquor licence, the party asked for judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sex and liquor don't mix, even in B.C. politics |last=Tupper |first=Peter |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=May 14, 2005 |page=F2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both a [[Provincial Court of British Columbia|provincial court]] and an [[British Columbia Court of Appeal|appeal court]] refused the review because an actual application had not been submitted for a decision to be reviewed, and the fundraiser went ahead with the serving of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/ca/06/02/2006bcca0252.htm |title=The Sex Party v.

==Federal campaign and Canada Post lawsuit==
The party intended to participate in the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]]. They prepared a pamphlet and sent it to Canada Post to deliver via their Unaddressed Admail Program. The Canada Post employees rejected the pamphlet because their policy document, the Unaddressed Admail Customer Guide, allowed them to refuse to deliver sexually explicit material. The four-page pamphlet had several images depicting people in the nude and objects shaped like human body parts, and because the pamphlet also contained the party's election platform, they complained that Canada Post was violating its directive to be politically impartial. The Sex Party objected to the refusal by filing a lawsuit against Canada Post saying the organization violated their [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms|right]] to freedom of expression. The [[Federal Court of Canada]] ruled that the "sexually explicit material" phrase used in the Canada Post policy document was undefined and too vague to be arbitrarily applied to any particular pamphlet. The Court found that their freedom of expression was reasonably restricted, and not prohibited, as Canada Post did offer alternative means of distribution. The judgement, which was delivered in January 2008, ordered Canada Post to rewrite its policy regarding sexually explicit material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2008/2008fc41/2008fc41.html |title=The Sex Party v.

According to the [[language family]] tree classification by [[Ethnologue]], [[Okpe language (Southwestern Edo)|Okpe]], [[Urhobo language|Urhobo]] and [[Uvwie language|Uvwie]], alongside [[Eruwa language|Eruwa]] and Isoko, make up the five Southwestern [[Edoid languages]] of the [[Benue-Congo languages|Benue-Congo group]]. Quoting Johnstone (1993), Ethnologue puts the [[population]] of [[Urhobo people]] at 546,000, [[Okpe]] 25,400 (2000) and Uvwie 19,800 (2000). These three languages have geographically neighbouring [[language]]s: [[Izon language|Izon]] and [[Itsekiri language|Itsekiri]] to the west and south, [[Ukwuani]] and [[Isoko language|Isoko]] to the east and [[Edo language|Edo]] to the north. Thus, Isoko and Urhobo are similar languages that belong to the same linguistic family.

== Literature ==
There is [[literature]] for both the Urhobo and Isoko languages. There are [[Bible]]s and [[Christian hymn]] books for both languages. There are also [[dictionary|dictionaries]] for Urhobo, written by Ukere, Osubele, Juliua Arerierian and Akpobome Diffre-Odiete. While all the former ones are [[bilingual]], the last one by Diffre-Odiete is a [[multilingual]] dictionary of English, Okpe, Urhobo and Uvwie, with over 900 entries in the four languages.

== Dialects ==
Okpe (ISO 639 – 3:oke), Urhobo (ISO 639 – 3:urh) and Uvwie (ISO 639 – 3:evh) are three diverse languages spoken in an area belonging to one and the same ethnic group called the [[Urhobo people]] of [[Delta State (Nigeria)|Delta State]] in southern [[Nigeria]], [[Africa]]. The Urhobo ethnic nation is culturally united, but it comprises twenty-four political clans or [[monarchy|kingdom]]s. Okpe is spoken in only one kingdom (the largest in [[Urhoboland]]). Uvwie is spoken in two kingdoms, while Urhobo is spoken, with [[dialect]]ical varieties, in the remaining twenty-one kingdoms. The [[Agbarho]] dialect is the accepted standard of written Urhobo for all twenty-four kingdoms. The Okpe and Uvwie clans view their languages as distinct languages and not as dialects of Urhobo. However, in their communication with people of other Urhobo clans, they use Urhobo, [[English language|English]] or [[Nigerian Pidgin]].

== Language Endangerment ==
Okpe and Uvwie speakers have been protesting the dominance of Urhobo-speaking [[clan]]s over them. As such, they have gone beyond [[linguistics|linguistic]] self-preservation to seeking politico-cultural alienation from other Urhobo clans. Therefore, people of the other twenty-one Urhobo–speaking clans view these activities as a threat to the historical and cultural unity of the [[ethnicity|ethnic]] nation.

Previous research shows that the three languages of the Urhobo people are [[endangered language|endangered]] to various degrees. Urhobo is only seriously endangered by the impact of Nigerian Pidgin and English in [[communication]].  Macaulay Mowarin (2005) notes that Uvwie is the most endangered of the trio, facing serious impact in the urban and rural areas from Nigerian Pidgin, Urhobo and English. Okpe is seriously endangered in [[Sapele,_Delta|Sapele]], the major Okpe town because of the impact of Nigerian Pidgin, Itsekiri, and Urhobo. In the rural areas, Okpe is endangered too, mainly from Itsekiri and Urhobo impact.

There are several factors responsible for the gradual loss of the three languages. The contact between the three languages on the one hand, and with other neighbouring languages on the other, have greatly impacted the trio, especially Uvwie. Generally, the language of communication is English among [[literacy|literate]] people and Nigerian Pidgin among [[illiterate]]s and semi-literates of Urhobo and neighbouring communities. This is the case in all spheres of activities, except in annual or periodical traditional [[religious rite]]s or elders' and chiefs' meetings, especially in rural areas. Okpe, Urhobo and Uvwie are also spoken in some rural homes, markets and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Church]] services.

Moreover, the non-implementation of the National Policy on Education continues to cause negative effect on language acquisition by newer generations of the Urhobo people. The policy which states that the language of instruction for the first three years of [[education]] should be the pupils' [[mother tongue]] or language of the school's host community has been largely ignored. Fines and other punishments are usually imposed on pupils and students who speak their [[native language]]s during school hours in both public and private schools across Delta State. This is to encourage the use of English as a [[lingua franca]]. English is made a core subject in order to graduate from secondary school and to gain admission to higher institutions.

[[Cultural assimilation|Intermarriage]]s between [[native speaker]]s and people of other language communities also affect intergenerational transfer of the languages, and thus children are raised with English. The impact of English on these native languages has spread to rural areas, especially among the youth and children who communicate in Pidgin and English because of the negative psychological effect of being regarded as primitive if they speak their native language in public.
Finally, the adoption of Agbarho dialect as the only acceptable form of written Urhobo has led to the non-documentation of Okpe and Uvwie languages as well as other dialects of Urhobo.

The '''Wovea''' are an [[ethnic group]] native to coastal areas of the Fako division of the [[Southwest Province (Cameroon)|Southwest Province]] of [[Cameroon]]. The Wovea are one of the ethnic groups that comprise the Sawa, or Cameroonian coastal peoples.

==History==
Wovea [[oral history]] names a man from the island of [[Bioko]] as their forebear. His ship washed ashore at Mboko, the area Southwest of [[Mount Cameroon]], where he married a local woman. They then moved southeast and settled at [[Ambas Bay]]. The Wovea likely lived along Ambas Bay in the 17th or 18th century, and they could have participated in the same migration from Mboko that brought the [[Bakweri]] and [[Isubu]] to their current territories.&lt;ref name="Fanso 51"&gt;Fanso 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Wovea came under the dominance of the Isubu. When the Spanish ousted Protestant missionaries from their base at Fernando Po (modern Bioko) in 1858, the Isubu king, [[William I of Bimbia|William I]] of [[Bimbia]], sold part of Wovea territory to British missionary [[Alfred Saker]]. The area became Victoria (today known as [[Limbe,_Cameroon|Limbe]]), and the Wovea living there were forced to move to Mondole Island.&lt;ref name="Fanso 51"/&gt; Victoria came to be a mixture of freed slaves, working Sawa, and Christianised Sawa from all the various coastal groups. [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] began to develop at this time.

In 1905, under [[German Empire|German]] colonial rule, the Wovea were relocated once again to their present home west of the [[Wouri estuary]] when Mondole Island became a [[leper colony]].&lt;ref name="Fanso 51"/&gt; After Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], Wovea territory fell under a British [[League of Nations]] mandate.

==Geography and culture==
[[Image:Duala ethnic groups.png|thumb|left|325px|Map showing the location of the various Duala ethnic groups of Cameroon]]
The Wovea live south of [[Mount Cameroon]] and on the [[Gulf of Guinea]], in the Fako division of the [[Southwest Province (Cameroon)|Southwest Province]]. Their territory lies  directly west of that of the Isubu. Fishing is a major form of employment and subsistence.

Bobea is the Wovea language. The language had 600 speakers in 1977, although many Wovea speak [[Duala language|Duala]] in lieu of their native tongue. In addition, most Wovea speak [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] or standard [[English language|English]]. A growing number of the [[Anglophone Cameroonian|Anglophones]] today grow up with Pidgin as their first tongue.&lt;ref&gt;"Pidgin, Cameroon", ''Ethnologue''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wovea have been mostly Christianized since the 1970s. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] denominations dominate, particularly the [[Baptist]] church.

The Wovea participate in the [[Ngondo]], a traditional festival of the Duala to which all of Cameroon's coastal Sawa peoples are invited.The main focus is on communicating with the ancestors and asking them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, [[beauty pageant]]s, [[pirogue]] races, and traditional [[sport wrestling|wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;''Guide touristique'' 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Wovea are [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] in language and origin. More narrowly, they fall into the Sawa, or the coastal peoples of Cameroon.
