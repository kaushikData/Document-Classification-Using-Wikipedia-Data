'''''Airey v. Ireland''''' (application No. 6289/73) was a [[Legal case|case]] decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1979.

==Facts==
Mrs. Airey wished to obtain a decree of [[Legal separation|judicial separation]] from her [[husband]] ([[divorce]] was illegal in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]); at that time [[legal aid]] was not available in Ireland for any civil matters, including seeking a judicial separation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695297&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR judgment in case Airey v. Ireland, para. 8-11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The Court held that:
*there has been a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (fair trial) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], by 5 votes to 2;
*there has been a breach of Article 8 (private and family life), by 4 votes to 3;
*it was not necessary also to examine the case under Article 14 (non-discrimination) taken in conjunction with Article 6 para. 1, by 4 votes to 3;
*it was not necessary also to examine the case under Article 13 (effective remedy), by 4 votes to 3.

Judges Thór Vilhjálmsson, O'Donoghue and Evrigenis each filed a dissent.

==Impact==

In the case, it was established that the right of effective access to the courts may entail legal assistance. ''Airey'' case has been applied in a number of cases on civil legal aid.&lt;ref&gt;Harris D. J., O'Boyle M., Warbrick C. ''Law of the European Convention on Human Rights.

'''An Act to Encourage Immigration''', signed by [[President Abraham Lincoln]] on July 4, 1864, was the first major American law to encourage immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lincolncottage.org/lincolns-forgotten-act-to-encourage-immigration/|title=LINCOLN’S ‘FORGOTTEN’ ACT TO ENCOURAGE IMMIGRATION|last=Silverman|first=Jason|date=|website=lincolnscottage.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

== Text of the Act ==
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States is hereby authorized, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint a Commissioner of Immigration, who shall be subject to the direction of the Department of State, shall hold his office for four years, and shall receive a salary at the rate of $2,500 a year. The said Commissioner may employ not more than three clerks, of such grade as the Secretary of State shall designate, to be appointed by him, with the approval of the Secretary of State, and to hold their offices at his pleasure.

SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That all contracts that shall be made by emigrants to the United States in foreign countries, in conformity to regulations that may be established by the said Commissioner, whereby emigrants shall pledge the wages of their labor for a term not exceeding twelve months to repay the expenses of their emigration, shall be held to be valid in law, and may be enforced in the courts of the United States, or of the several States and Territories; and such advances, if so stipulated in the contract, and the contract be recorded in the Recorder's office in the county where the emigrant shall settle, shall operate as a lien upon any land thereafter acquired by the emigrant, whether under the Homestead Law when the title is consummated or on property otherwise acquired, until liquidated by the emigrant; but not being herein contained shall be deemed to authorize any contract contravening the Constitution of the United States or creating in any way the relation of Slavery or servitude.

SEC. 3. And be it further enacted; That no emigrant to the United States who shall arrive after the passage of this act shall be compulsively enrolled for military service during the existing insurrection, unless such emigrant shall voluntarily renounce under oath his allegiance to the country of his birth, and declare his intention to become a citizen of the United States.

SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, That there shall be established in the City of New-York an office to be known as the United States Emigrant Office; and there shall be appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, an officer for said City, to be known as Superintendent of Immigration, at an annual salary of two thousand dollars; and the said Superintendent may employ a clerk of the first class; and such Superintendent shall, under the direction of the Commissioner of Immigration, make contracts with the different railroads and transportation companies of the United States for transportation tickets, to be furnished to such immigrants, and to be paid for by them, and shall, under such rules as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Immigration, protect such immigrants from imposition and fraud, and shall furnish them such information and facilities as will enable them to proceed in the cheapest and most expeditious manner to the place of their destination. And such Superintendent of Immigration shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Immigration: Provided, That the duties hereby imposed upon the Superintendent in the City of New-York shall not be held to affect the powers and duties of the Commissioner of the Immigration of the State of New-York.And it shall be the duty of said Superintendent in the City of Ney-York, to see that the provisions of the act commonly known as the Passenger Act, are strictly complied with, and all breaches thereof punished according to law.

SEC. 5. And be it further enacted. That no person shall be qualified to fill, any office under this act who shall be directly or indirectly interested in any corporation having lands for sale to immigrants, or in the carrying or transportation of immigrants, either from foreign countries to the United States and its Territories or to any part thereof, or who shall receive any fee or reward, or the promise thereof, for any service performed or any benefit rendered to any person or persons in the line or his duty under this act. And if any officer provided for by this act shall receive from any person or company any fee or reward, or promise thereof, for any services performed or any benefit rendered to any person or persons in the line of his duty under this act, he shall, upon conviction, be fined one thousand dollars or be imprisoned, not to exceed three years, at the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction, and forever after be ineligible to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit in the United States, SEC. 6. And be it further enacted, That said Commissioner of Immigration shall,at the commencement of each annual meeting of Congress, submit a detailed report of the foreign immigration during the preceding year, and a detailed account of all expenditures under this act.

Sic. 7. And be it further enacted, That the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, in the judgment of the President, is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of carrying the provisions of this act into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1864/08/03/news/an-act-to-encourage-immigration.html?mcubz=3|title=An Act to Encourage Immigration|last=|first=|date=August 3, 1864|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Battery Park City''' is a mainly residential {{convert|92|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[planned community]] on the west side of the southern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. More than one-third of the development is parkland.&lt;ref name=amny&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amny.com/real-estate/city-living/manhattan/city-living-battery-park-city-1.6844548 | title=City Living: Battery Park City | work=amNY | date=January 21, 2014 | accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land upon which it is built was created by [[land reclamation]] on the [[Hudson River]] using over {{convert|3|e6cuyd|e6m3}} of soil and rock excavated during the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], the [[New York City Water Tunnel]], and certain other construction projects, as well as from sand dredged from [[New York Harbor]] off [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Arthur. [http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EB293F7999CF967&amp;p_docnum=5&amp;p_queryname=NaN&amp;p_product=NewsBank&amp;p_theme=aggregated4&amp;p_nbid=J4BH4EDFMTE4NTg0NzQ0OS4yODY4NjU6MTo3OnJhLTE4ODg "IN N.Y.C., A $1 BILLION DREAM RISES"], ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', June 6, 1982. Accessed August 4, 2007. "Construction already is under way on the southern tip of Manhattan, at Battery Park City, land named for the British fort built there in 1693. The area was expanded by 1.2 million cubic yards of earth and rock excavated for the foundations of the World Trade Center nearby."&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood, which is the site of [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|Brookfield Place]] (formerly the World Financial Center), along with numerous buildings designed for housing, commercial, and retail, is named for adjacent [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]].

== Geography ==
{{maplink|frame=y|text=Location within New York City|frame-align=right|zoom=12|type=line&lt;!--shape--&gt;|id=Q810961|stroke-color=#000|stroke-width=1}}

Battery Park City is bounded on the east by [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]], which separates the area from the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]]. To the west, north, and south, the area is surrounded by the [[Hudson River]].

The development consists of roughly five major sections. Traveling north to south, the first neighborhood has high-rise residential buildings, the [[Stuyvesant High School]], a [[Regal Entertainment Group]] movie theater, and the [[#Library|Battery Park City branch]] of the [[New York Public Library]]. It is also the site of the 463-suite Conrad New York luxury hotel, which contains restaurants and bars such as the Loopy Doopy Rooftop Bar, ATRIO Wine Bar Restaurant, Mexican-themed El Vez, and three [[Danny Meyer]]-branded restaurants (North End Grill, Blue Smoke, [[Shake Shack]]); the hotel has a ballroom and a conference center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-neighborhood-2010-8 There Goes The Neighborhood: Goldman Sachs Accused Of Gentrifying Block Around Its HQ]. Joe Weisenthal in Business Insider February 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other restaurants located in that hotel, as well as a [[DSW, Inc.|DSW]] store and a [[New York Sports Club]] branch, were closed in 2009 after the takeover of the property by [[Goldman Sachs]]. Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings; for example, [[Goldman Sachs]] built a new headquarters at [[200 West Street]].

Nearby is [[#Brookfield Place|Brookfield Place]], a complex of several commercial buildings formerly known as the World Financial Center.

Current residential neighborhoods of Battery Park City are divided into northern and southern sections, separated by Brookfield Place. The northern section consists entirely of large, 20–45-story buildings, all various shades of orange brick. The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, which is located in Brookfield Place, contains residential apartment buildings such as Gateway Plaza and the Rector Place apartment buildings. In this section lies the majority of Battery Park City's residential areas, in three sections: Gateway Plaza, a high-rise building complex; the "Rector Place Residential Neighborhood"; and the" Battery Place Residential Neighborhood". These subsections contain most of the area's residential buildings, along with [[park]] space, [[supermarket]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[movie theater]]s. Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s, and completion of the final lots took place in early 2011. Additionally, a park restoration was completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultivatingculture.com/2013/04/10/battery-park-city-authority-completes-field-restoration/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the land was the proposed site of a $50,000,000 residential development that would have served workers in the Wall Street area.&lt;ref name=unit&gt;{{cite web | title=Housing Unit Named Battery Tower. | website=The New York Times | date=May 25, 1929 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/05/25/archives/housing-unit-named-battery-tower.html | accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battery Tower (Manhattan)|Battery Tower]] project was left unfinished after workers digging the foundation ran into forty feet of old [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]], sunken docks, and ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EXCAVATIONS BEGUN.; Steel Sheeting Is Being Used for Battery Tower Work. | website=The New York Times | date=December 8, 1929 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/12/08/archives/excavations-begun-steel-sheeting-is-being-used-for-battery-tower.html | accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted and never restarted.

By the late 1950s, the once-prosperous port area of downtown Manhattan was occupied by a number of dilapidated shipping piers, casualties of the rise of [[container shipping]] which drove sea traffic to [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal|Port Elizabeth, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The initial proposal to reclaim this area through [[Land reclamation|landfill]] was offered in the early 1960s by private firms and supported by the mayor. That plan became complicated when Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in 1966 the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], the proposal called for a 'comprehensive community' consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry. The landscaping of the park space and later the Winter Garden was designed by [[M. Paul Friedberg]].

In 1968, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the [[Battery Park City Authority]] (BPCA) to oversee development. Rockefeller named [[Charles J. Urstadt]] as the first chairman of the authority’s board that year. He then served as the chief executive officer from 1973 to 1978. Urstadt later served as the authority’s vice chair from 1996 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/2012/06/06/battery-park-city-creators-reminisce-about/|title=Battery Park City creators reminisce about neighborhood’s past|last=Kreuzer|first=Terese Loeb|date=June 6, 2012|work=Downtown Express|access-date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Development Corporation|New York State Urban Development Corporation]] and ten other public agencies were also involved in the development project.&lt;ref name="enr-1983"&gt;{{cite news |title=Megajob takes foothold in fill, New York City's $1-billion river development survives snags |publisher=Engineering News-Record |date=April 14, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several years, the BPCA made slow progress.

In addition to the change in the mix of units, the city approved adding nine acres, which extended the northern boundary from Reade Street to Duane Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/13/archives/planners-cut-lowincome-units-in-battery-park-city-proposal.html|title=Planners Cut Low‐Income Units In Battery Park City Proposal|last=Seigel|first=Max H.|date=July 13, 1972|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landfill material from [[Building of the World Trade Center|construction]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] was used to add fill for the southern portion.

The design of BPC to some degree reflects the values of vibrant city neighborhoods championed by [[Jane Jacobs]]. The [[Urban Land Institute]] (ULI) awarded the Battery Park City Master Plan its 2010 Heritage Award, for having "facilitated the private development of 9.3 million square feet of commercial space, 7.2 million square feet of residential space, and nearly 36 acres of open space in lower Manhattan, becoming a model for successful large-scale planning efforts and marking a positive shift away from the urban renewal mindset of the time."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uli.org/News/MediaCenter/PressReleases/2010%20archives/Content/AwardsforExcellenceAmericas2010Winners.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and early development ===
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the site hosted Creative Time's landmark Art on the Beach sculpture exhibitions. On September 23, 1979, the landfill was the site of an [[List of anti-nuclear protests in the United States|anti-nuclear rally]] attended by 200,000 people.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Herman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nearly 200,000 Rally to Protest Nuclear Energy |url= |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=B1 |date=September 24, 1979 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began on the first residential building in June 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/05/16/archives/construction-of-battery-park-city-is-now-scheduled-to-begin-in-june.html|title=Construction of Battery Park City Is Now Scheduled to Begin in June; Construction to Start June 3|last=Goodwin|first=Michael|date=May 16, 1980|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1981, the New York State Urban Development Corporation (now the [[Empire State Development Corporation]]) issued a [[request for proposal]], ultimately selecting six real-estate companies to develop over 1,800 residential units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/19/nyregion/6-builders-chosen-for-housing-at-battery-park-city.html|title=6 BUILDERS CHOSEN FOR HOUSING AT BATTERY PARK CITY|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=August 19, 1981|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]] started construction; [[Olympia and York]] of [[Toronto]] was named as the developer for the World Financial Center, who then hired [[Cesar Pelli]] as the lead architect.

[[File:Battery Park City North Cove.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Yacht harbor at North Cove, next to the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]]]]
During early construction, two acres of land in the southern section of the Battery Park landfill was used by artist [[Agnes Denes]] to plant wheat in an exhibition titled ''Wheatfield - A Confrontation''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agnes Denes|Denes, Agnes]] (c.2006) [http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Images/Ecology/wheatfield.php "Wheatfield - A Confrontation, Battery Park Landfill, downtown Manhattan, 2 acres of wheat planted &amp; harvested, summer 1982"] greenmuseum.org&lt;/ref&gt; The project was a visual contradiction: a golden field of wheat set among the steel skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Krug, Don. (c.2006) [http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/denes.php "Ecological Restoration: Agnes Denes, ''Wheatfield''"] greenmuseum.org&lt;/ref&gt; It was created during a six-month period in the spring, summer, and fall of 1982 when Denes, with the support of the [[Public Art Fund]], planted the field of wheat on rubble-strewn land near [[Wall Street]] and the [[World Trade Center site]]. Denes stated that her "decision to plant a wheatfield in Manhattan, instead of designing just another public sculpture, grew out of a long-standing concern and need to call attention to our misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values."&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, B. (1995). ''Sculpting with the Environment: A Natural Dialogue''. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, the BPCA oversaw a great deal of construction, including the entire [[Rector Place]] neighborhood and the river esplanade. It was during that period that [[Amanda Burden]], later City Planning Department Director in the Bloomberg administration, worked on Battery Park City. During the 1980s, a total of 13 buildings were constructed. The [[Vietnam Veterans Plaza]] was established by [[Edward I. Koch]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="Vietnam Veterans Plaza"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/vietnamveteransplaza/history|title=Vietnam Veterans Plaza|publisher=New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Battery Park City became the new home of the [[Stuyvesant High School]]. During the 1990s, an additional six buildings were added to the neighborhood. By the turn of the 21st century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.

Initially, in the 1980s, 23 buildings were built in the area. By the 1990s, 9 more buildings were built, followed by the construction of 11 buildings in the 2000s and 3 buildings in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ne?id=100010 Emporis NYC Districts and Zones: Battery Park City&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501110221/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ne?id=100010 |date=May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Battery Park City Authority, wishing to attract more middle-class residents, started providing subsidies in 1998 to households whose annual incomes were $108,000 or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/nyregion/battery-park-city-to-give-middle-income-renters-a-break.html|title=Battery Park City to Give Middle-Income Renters a Break|last=Pristin|first=Terry|date=March 24, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, nearly the entire landfill had been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/07/realestate/filling-in-the-blanks-at-battery-park-city.html|title=Filling in the Blanks At Battery Park City|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=February 7, 1999|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 21st century ===

The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 had a major impact on Battery Park City. The residents of Lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for an extended period of time. Parts of the community were an official crime-scene and therefore residents were unable to return to live or even collect property. Many of the displaced residents were not allowed to return to the area for months and none were given government guidance of where to live temporarily on the already crowded island of Manhattan. With most hotel rooms booked, residents, including young children and the elderly were forced to fend for themselves.

When they were finally allowed to return to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Jane. [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/us/after-the-attacks-the-dispossessed-battery-park-city-residents-only-visit.html "AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE DISPOSSESSED; Battery Park City Residents Only Visit"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 17, 2001. Accessed June 23, 2017. "But at the Gateway section of the complex, there were scattered reports of looting, on two Web sites about Battery Park City and from residents who returned home for the first time."&lt;/ref&gt; Upon residents' return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from the World Trade Center fires that persisted until December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/20/september11.usa|title=Ground Zero stops burning, after 100 days|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 20, 2001|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of the area's residents moved away permanently from the community after the adjacent World Trade Center towers collapsed and spread toxic dust, debris, and smoke. Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.

After September 11, 2001, residents of Battery Park City and [[Tribeca]] formed [[the TriBattery Pops Tom Goodkind Conductor]] in response to the events of the attacks. The “Pops” have been [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated and are the first lower Manhattan all-volunteer community band in a century.

Since then, real estate development in the area has continued robustly. Commercial development includes the {{convert|2100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[200 West Street]], the [[Goldman Sachs]] global headquarters, which began construction in 2005 and opened for occupancy in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyork.construction.com/projects/TopPrj_05-06/TPstrt1-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 200 West Street is seeking gold-level certification under the [[United States Green Building Council]]’s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program by incorporating various water and energy conservation features. Several residential projects are underway, including LEED buildings which cater to the environmentally conscious.

Battery Park City is owned and managed by the '''Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority''' (BPCA), a Class A [[New York state public-benefit corporations|New York State public-benefit corporation]] created by New York State in 1968 to redevelop outmoded and deteriorated piers, a project that has involved [[land reclamation|reclaiming the land]], replanning the area and facilitating new construction of a mixed commercial and residential community.&lt;ref&gt;Battery Park City Authority Act, [[Laws of New York|L. 1968 ch. 343-44]], L. 1969 ch. 624, L. 1971 ch. 377; codified at [[Consolidated Laws of New York|Public Authorities Law]] § 1970 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It has operated under the authority of the [[Empire State Development Corporation|Urban Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=6 Builders Chosen for Housing at Battery Park City |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07EED7153BF93AA2575BC0A967948260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 19, 1981 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is "to plan, create, co-ordinate and maintain a balanced community of [[commerce|commercial]], [[residential]], [[retail]], and [[park]] space within its designated 92-acre site on the [[Lower West Side, Manhattan|lower west side]] of [[Manhattan]]" in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120721062638/http://www.batteryparkcity.org/page/page11.html Battery Park City Authority Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt; The authority's board is composed of seven uncompensated members who are appointed by the [[governor]] and who serve six-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Consolidated Laws of New York|Public Authorities Law]] § 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The BPCA is invested with substantial powers: it can acquire, hold and dispose of [[real property]], enter into [[rental agreement|lease agreements]], borrow money and issue [[bond (finance)|debt]], and manage the project.&lt;ref&gt;[[Consolidated Laws of New York|Public Authorities Law]] § 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Like other public benefit corporations, the BPCA is exempt from [[property tax]]es and has the ability to issue [[municipal bond|tax exempt bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Consolidated Laws of New York|Public Authorities Law]] § 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the BPCA had operating expenses of $47.73 million as well as an outstanding debt of $982.85 million, and it employed 240 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abo.ny.gov/reports/annualreports/ABO2018AnnualReport.pdf|title=NYSABO 2018 Report|pp=16,29,44|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1989 agreement between the BPCA and the City of New York, $600 million was transferred by the BPCA to the city. Charles J. Urstadt, the first Chairman and CEO of the BPCA, noted in an August 19, 2007 op-ed piece in the ''[[New York Post]]'' that the aggregate figure of funds transferred to the City of New York is above $1.4 billion, with the BPCA continuing to contribute $200 million a year.

Excess revenue from the area was to be contributed to other housing efforts, typically low-income projects in [[the Bronx]] and [[Harlem]]. Much of this funding has historically been diverted to general city expenses, under section 3.d of the 1989 agreement. However, in July 2006, Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], Governor [[George Pataki]], and Comptroller [[William C. Thompson, Jr.]] announced the final approval for the New York City Housing Trust Fund derived from $130 million in Battery Park City revenues. The fund aimed to preserve or create 4,300 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Janny (August 1, 2006). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/nyregion/01mbrfs-004.html?fta=y Manhattan: Housing Plan Approved."]&lt;/ref&gt; It also provided seed financing for the New York Acquisition Fund, a $230 million initiative that aims to serve as a catalyst for the construction and preservation of more than 30,000 units of affordable housing citywide by 2016. The Acquisition Fund has since established itself as a model for similar funds in cities and states across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/downloads/pdf/New-Housing-Market-Place-Plan.pdf |title=Mayor Bloomberg’s affordable housing plan |publisher=[[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development]] |date=August 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016141440/http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/downloads/pdf/New-Housing-Market-Place-Plan.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2018, thirty residential buildings had been built in Battery Park City and no new construction was planned. The Battery Park City Authority’s main focus turned to maintenance of existing infrastructure, security and conservancy of the public spaces. The authority was creating over 1,000 free activities per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/realestate/battery-park-city-a-resort-like-community-built-on-landfill.html|title=Battery Park City: A Resort-Like Community Built on Landfill|last=Jacobson|first=Aileen|date=August 15, 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=October 11, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Battery Park City is located on land lease, condo owners pay higher monthly charges than owners of comparable apartments elsewhere in New York City because its residents pay their building's common charges in addition to PILOT (payments in lieu of taxes). The PILOT payments replace real estate taxes and the land lease. As a result, residential units have higher monthly costs compared to other neighborhoods, so apartments in Battery Park City are cheaper than comparable apartments elsewhere in the city. However, when monthly charges and rents are combined, the cost of apartments in Battery Park City are similar to those of other high-priced apartments in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090419/FREE/304199992/battery-park-city-condo-owners-fight-spikes-in-fees|title=Battery Park City condo owners fight spikes in fees|last=Fung|first=Amanda|date=April 29, 2009|work=Crain's New York Business|access-date=November 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural heritage ===

A largely [[Arab-American]] neighborhood existed adjacent to what is today southeastern Battery Park City from the late 1880s&lt;ref name=wpa&gt;{{cite fednyc}}, pp. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1940s. "[[Little Syria, Manhattan|Little Syria]]" encompassed [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] from Battery Park to Rector Street.&lt;ref name=wpa /&gt; It declined as a neighborhood as the inhabitants became successful and moved to other areas, especially [[Atlantic Avenue (Brooklyn)|Atlantic Avenue]] in [[Brooklyn]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Jane and Botti, David. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16936966 "Altered States: Preserving New York City's 'Little Syria'"] ''[[BBC News|BBC News Magazine]]'' (February 7, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and disappeared almost entirely when a great deal of lower Washington Street was demolished to make way for entrance ramps to the [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]], which opened in 1950.&lt;ref name=NYT2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karpf, Ruth. [https://www.nytimes.com/1946/08/11/archives/street-of-the-arabs.html "Street of the Arabs"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 11, 1946. Accessed August 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of the residents were [[Arab Christians|Arabic-speaking Christians]], [[Melkite]] and [[Maronite]] immigrants from present-day [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] who settled in the area in the late 19th century, escaping [[Dhimmi|religious persecution]] and poverty in their homelands &amp;ndash; which were then under control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] &amp;ndash; and answering the call of American [[Missionary|missionaries]] to escape their difficulties by traveling to New York City.&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;Dunlap, David W. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/nyregion/25quarter.html "When an Arab Enclave Thrived Downtown"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 24, 2010. Accessed August 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many other ethnic groups had lived in this diverse neighborhood, including Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Slovaks, Poles, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Czechs, and Irish.

A long-standing reminder of the ethnic past was the former [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]], which was destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]]. An additional historic church, [[St. George's Syrian Catholic Church]], still stands at 103 Washington Street.

== Buildings ==

=== Residential ===
The first residential building in Battery Park City, Gateway Plaza, was completed in 1983.&lt;ref name=amny/&gt; {{as of|2010}}, the population of the area was 13,386. Some of the more prominent residential buildings include:

A restaurant is located on the 14th floor.
*'''The Solaire''', the first [[Green building|green]] residential building in the United States, as well as the first residential high-rise building in New York City to be certified by the U.S. Green Building Council.&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin.

The developer received funding from the [[New York (state)|State of New York]], which was somewhat controversial as the developer was only required to agree to set aside 10% of the units as "affordable housing" or "moderate income", rather than the usual 80:20 agreement. When the building opened, rents ranged from roughly $2,500 to $9,001 depending on the size of the unit. The building has been rated [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum. The energy conserving building design is 35% more energy-efficient than code requires, resulting in a 67% lower electricity demand during peak hours, resulting in, among other benefits,  lower electric bills for residents, photovoltaic panels converting sunlight to electricity, and a computerized building management system and environmentally responsible operating and maintenance practices.

=== Office ===
[[File:World Financial Center 2006.jpg|thumb|Brookfield Place as seen in 2006, when it was the World Financial Center]]
Battery Park City, which is mainly residential, also has a few office buildings. The seven buildings in the Brookfield Place complex, as well as 200 West Street, are the neighborhood's only office buildings.

==== {{anchor|Brookfield Place}} Brookfield Place complex ====
{{main|Brookfield Place (New York City)}}
Located in the middle of Battery Park City and overlooking the [[Hudson River]], Brookfield Place, designed by [[César Pelli]] and owned mostly by [[Toronto]]-based [[Brookfield Office Properties]], has been home to offices of various major companies, including [[Merrill Lynch]], [[RBC Capital Markets]], [[Nomura Group]], [[American Express]] and [[Brookfield Asset Management]], among others. Brookfield Place also serves as the United States headquarters for [[Brookfield Office Properties]], which has its headquarters located in [[200 Vesey Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.com/arts__attractions/world_financial_center_and_winter_garden.1466/editorial_review.aspx |title=World Financial Center and Winter Garden New York City.com : Arts &amp; Attractions : Editorial Review |publisher=Nyc.com |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfinancialcenter.com/retail-dining/about |title=about |publisher=Worldfinancialcenter.com |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brookfield Place also has its own [[zip code]], 10281.

Brookfield Place's ground floor and portions of the second floor are occupied by a mall; its center point is a steel-and-glass atrium known as the [[Winter Garden Atrium|Winter Garden]]. Outside of the Winter Garden lies a sizeable [[yacht]] harbor on the Hudson known as North Cove.

The building's original developer was [[Olympia and York]] of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. It used to be named the World Financial Center, but in 2014, the complex was given its current name following the completion of extensive renovations. The World Financial Center complex was built by [[Olympia and York]] between 1982 and 1988; it was damaged in the September 11 attacks but later repaired. It has six constituent buildings – [[200 Liberty Street]], [[225 Liberty Street]], [[200 Vesey Street]], [[250 Vesey Street]], the Winter Garden Atrium, and One North End Avenue (a.k.a. the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] building).

==== 200 West Street ====
{{main|200 West Street}}
[[File:Goldman Sachs Tower 200 West Street Battery Park City.jpg|thumb|upright|200 West Street, from Murray Street, looking west]]
200 West Street is the location of the global headquarters of [[Goldman Sachs]], an [[investment banking]] firm. A {{convert|749|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, 44-story building located on the west side of [[West Side Highway|West Street]] between [[Vesey Street|Vesey]] and Murray Streets, it is north of Brookfield Place and the [[Conrad Hotels]], across the street from the [[Verizon Building]], and diagonally opposite the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. It is distinctive for being the only office building in the northern section of Battery Park City.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, John. ''A Guide to Contemporary New York City Architecture'' New York: Norton, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-393-73326-6}}. p.28&lt;/ref&gt; It started construction in 2005 and opened in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303828304575180581255747658?mod=WSJ_hp_editorsPicks|title=Goldman Sachs's New Palace Creates Princes, Serfs|date=April 16, 2010|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=April 17, 2010 | first=Susanne | last=Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==

The area lies within the area patrolled by the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s 1st Precinct at 1 Ericsson Place in [[Tribeca]]; this area also covers the rest of western Downtown Manhattan, including Tribeca, [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]], and [[Hudson Square]], as well as [[Governors Island]]. The overall area is relatively calm, with no murders, 12 rapes, 68 robberies, 81 felony assaults, 171 burglaries, 1,051 grand larcenies, and 27 grand larcenies auto reported in the area in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs001pct.pdf 1st Pct, NYPD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202124303/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs001pct.pdf |date=December 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==

Currently, the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] provides bus service to the area. {{As of|2014|10}}, the {{NYC bus link|M9|M20|M22|prose=y}} bus lines service parts of Battery Park City, with the {{NYC bus link|M15|M15 SBS|prose=y}} nearby at Battery Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NYC bus map|M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Downtown Alliance]] provides a free bus service&lt;ref&gt;http://www.downtownny.com/getting-around/downtown-connection&lt;/ref&gt; that runs along North End Avenue and South End Avenue, connecting the various residential complexes with subway stations on the other side of [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]].

There is currently no [[New York City Subway]] access in Battery Park City proper; however, the [[West Street pedestrian bridges]], as well as crosswalks across West Street, connect Battery Park City to subway stations and the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] station in the nearby [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. A tunnel from Brookfield Place under West Street also provides access from Battery Park City to the [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|World Trade Center]] PATH station. The [[Battery Park City Ferry Terminal]] is at the foot of [[Vesey Street]] opposite the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] and provides ferry transportation to various points in [[New Jersey]].

A '''belligerent''' (lat. ''bellum gerere'', "to wage war") is an individual, group, country, or other entity that acts in a hostile manner, such as engaging in [[combat]]. Belligerent comes from Latin, literally meaning "one who wages war".&lt;ref&gt;[[Present participle]] ''belligerent-'' (nominative singular ''belligerēns'').&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the use of ''belligerent'' as an adjective to mean aggressive, its use as a noun does not necessarily imply that a belligerent country is an [[:wikt:aggressor|aggressor]].

In times of [[war]], belligerent countries can be contrasted with [[neutral country|neutral countries]], and [[non-belligerent]]s. However, the application of the [[laws of war]] to neutral countries and the responsibilities of belligerents are not affected by any distinction between ''neutral countries'', ''neutral powers'' or ''non-belligerents'' — a non-belligerent may nevertheless risk being considered a belligerent if it aids or supports a belligerent in a way that is proscribed by neutral countries.

An interesting use of the term arose during the [[American Civil War]], when the [[Confederate States of America]], though [[non-recognized nations|not recognized]] as a sovereign state, was recognized as a ''belligerent power''; and, as a consequence, Confederate warships were given the same rights as US warships in foreign ports.&lt;ref name=hall-246&gt;Hall, Kermit L.

In this way the United States was able to fight the war as if it were an international war, without actually having to recognize the ''de jure'' existence of the Confederate government."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US-S-D"&gt;Staff.

==Belligerency==

"Belligerency" is a term used in [[international law]] to indicate the status of two or more entities, generally [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states, being engaged in a [[war]]. Wars are often fought with one or both parties to a conflict invoking the right to self-defence under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter#Article 51|Article 51]] of the [[United Nations Charter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/repertory/art51.shtml Chapter VII — Action with respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression] United Nations website, 23 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; (as the [[United Kingdom]] did in 1982 before the start of the [[Falklands War]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel K. Gibran (1997). The Falklands War: Britain Versus the Past in the South Atlantic, McFarland, {{ISBN|0-7864-0406-X}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Y63V3TfO6QC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;source=web&amp;ots=oG7a6YJeb7&amp;sig=4aTLo9ewO1HAenTX96sPwAh9AX8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result  p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;) or under the auspices of a [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution (such as the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 678]], which gave legal authority for the [[Gulf War]]).

A state of belligerency may also exist between one or more sovereign states on one side and rebel forces, if such rebel forces are recognised as belligerents. If there is a rebellion against a constituted authority (for example, an authority recognised as such by the United Nations), and those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents, the rebellion is an [[insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] second edition 1989 "insurgent B. n. One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognized as a belligerent."&lt;/ref&gt; Once the status of belligerency is established between two or more states, their relations are determined and governed by the laws of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Belligerency|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Boundary Treaty of 1866 between [[Chile]] and [[Bolivia]]''', also called the '''Mutual Benefits Treaty''', was signed in [[Santiago de Chile]] on August 10, 1866 by the Chilean Foreign Affairs Minister Alvaro Covarrubias and the Bolivian Plenipotentiary in Santiago Juan R. Muñoz Cabrera. It drew, for the first time, the border between both countries at the 24° South parallel from the Pacific Ocean to the eastern border of Chile and defined a zone of bipartite tax collection, the "Mutual Benefits zone", and tax preferences for articles from Bolivia and Chile.

Despite increasing border tensions since the 1840s, both countries fought together against Spain in the [[Chincha Islands War]] (1864–65) and resolved the question under the Governments of [[Mariano Melgarejo]] in Bolivia and [[José Joaquín Pérez]] in Chile. But before long, both countries were discontented with it, and Peru and Bolivia signed a [[Secret treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia of 1873|secret treaty against Chile]] in 1873. The Lindsay-Corral protocol, thought to clarify the treaty, was approved by Chile but never by Bolivia.

In 1874, a new boundary treaty was signed, which was violated by Bolivia in 1878. In 1879 began the [[War of the Pacific]].

==Background==

After the independence wars, the new Latin American republics adopted as a common juridical principle of frontier demarcation the administrative limits existing at the moment of separation from Spain. This was termed in{{clarify|date=April 2015}} ''[[Uti possidetis]]'' of 1810, a formula devised mainly to prevent European nations from setting foot in America, on the plea that between one heritage and another there were vacant regions susceptible of being title of ''[[res nullius]]''.

In particular, remote regions, sparsely populated or uninhabited areas, inhospitable climate, and sparse local vegetation caused a lack of geographical knowledge and hence administrative determination of the borders. But political unrest also led to changes, like the province of [[Tarija]] in colonial Argentina, which after independence wanted to come under Bolivian administration. On the other hand, European powers and the USA never recognized the principle of ''Uti possidetis'' 1810, as for example in the [[Falkland Islands]]. Since uncertainty characterized the demarcation of frontiers according to the ''Uti possidetis'' 1810, several long-running border conflicts arose in America after independence throughout the 19th century.

Bolivia had claimed territories down to latitude 26° South since its independence. In 1842, the Chilean Government of [[Manuel Bulnes]] declared the 23° South [[Circle of latitude|Parallel of latitude]] (near [[Mejillones]]) as the northern frontier of Chile, although at that time it was not possible to foresee the enormous importance of guano and nitrate.

From that day on, conflicts of jurisdiction between Chilean and Bolivian authorities were frequent. The Chilean ship ''Rumenia'' was carried to Cobija, the Bolivian port, and the Bolivian ''Sportsman'' to [[Caldera, Chile]]. Between 1842 and 1862, there were unsuccessful attempts at conciliation by both governments.

This situation could not continue indefinitely. Every day the affair was becoming more acute, because more interest was being taken in guano due to the increase in the revenue of Peru due to the deposits on the Chincha islands. The controversy became critical on 5 June 1863 as the Bolivian Congress secretly empowered the Executive to declare war on Chile.

An unexpected situation arose that modified the political relations of the nations of the Pacific: the war declared by [[Chincha Islands War|Spain on Peru]] and Spain's reassertion of her claims to the Chincha islands. The Governments of the Pacific were alarmed, and Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador made common cause with Peru. Previous differences were considered as being of secondary importance, and Bolivia and Chile sought to end the border conflict. Interrupted diplomatic relations were resumed, and on 10 August 1866 the Boundary Treaty was signed in Santiago.

==Content of the Treaty==

{{further|:wikisource:Boundary Treaty between Bolivia and Chile of 1866}}

The Treaty stipulated in seven articles:

* The international boundary will, in future, be drawn at the 24th parallel, and will be marked out on the ground "by means of visible and permanent signals — from the Pacific ''to the eastern boundary of Chile''" by experts nominated by both countries.
* Notwithstanding the previous declaration, Chile and Bolivia shall divide between them the export duties paid on Guano and minerals in the zone included between the 23rd and 25th parallels.
* For the carrying out of this, Bolivia shall set up a custom-house in Mejillones which will be the only one authorized to receive these duties on the exportation of guano and metals from the aforesaid zone. Chile will have the right to nominate fiscal employees -who shall intervene in the counting house department of this aduana with full right of inspection. Bolivia will be conceded an equal right in the event of Chile establishing a custom-house in parallel 24°.
* All exports from the territory situated between the parallels of latitude 23° to 25°, with the exception of guano and minerals, to be free from taxation, as will also be the natural production of Chile which may enter the country through Mejillones.
* By common accord between the two governments system will be adopted in the exploitation and sale of guano, and a similar agreement must he come to, to determine the duties on the exportation of minerals.
* Chile and Bolivia bind themselves to mutual preference in the event of the renting of the territories forming the subject matter of the present agreement, and to abstain from ceding them to any nation or individual.
* Eighty thousand pesos, withdrawn from ten percent, of the production of Mejillones will be granted to Bolivian concessionaries in guano exploitation whose, workings were suspended by act of the Chilean Government.

==Flaws of the Treaty==

Regarding the Treaty of Mutual Benefits, Ronald Bruce St John states:&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Bruce St John, "International Boundaries Research Unit, BOUNDARY &amp; TERRITORY BRIEFING, Volume 1 Number 6 "The Bolivia-Chile-Peru Dispute in the Atacama Desert", page 10&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Differing interpretations of the 1866 treaty soon complicated diplomatic relations between Bolivia and Chile. The agreement did not specify by name the individual items from which Chile was to derive half the fiscal revenues under the condominium provision, and the Bolivian government tried to limit their number with predictably caustic results. In an apparent effort to avoid sharing customs receipts, the Bolivian government also sought to export minerals extracted from the shared zone through the northern port of Cobija. A related controversy centred on a Bolivian contention that Caracoles, an immensely valuable silver deposit discovered in 1870, did not lie within the zone of condominium. With the ousting of the Melgarejo administration in 1871, the new Bolivian government hoped to revise the terms of the 1866 treaty and thus abolish the condominium aspects of the pact. When this was not forthcoming the Bolivian National Assembly declared null and void all acts of the Melgarejo administration and made it clear that the 1866 treaty was in jeopardy.''

As a matter of fact, the Treaty settled nothing, it left everything pending and opened the door to difficulties greater than those it attempted to settle.

==The Lindsay-Corral Protocol of 1872==

On 5 December 1872, after difficult talks, Bolivian and Chilean negotiators Corral and Lindsay agreed to a clarification of the treaty of 1866. The Lindsay-Corral Protocol gave Chile the right to appoint customs officers to work alongside their Bolivian counterparts in the condominium zone, stipulated that tax rates could not be modified unilaterally, confirmed Bolivian acceptance of nitrates and borax as products included in the terms of the 1866 treaty, agreed that Bolivia would make a separate account of the amount to be received for taxes not derived from the common zone, and stated that the eastern limits of the common zone would be fixed by experts of both countries, and in case of disagreement, by a third nominated by the Emperor of Brazil. This Protocol was approved by Chile in January 1873.

A new grievance arose in August 1872 as Quintin Quevedo, a Bolivian diplomat, follower of [[Mariano Melgarejo]] who had been toppled as president in 1871, embarked on an expedition from Valparaiso against the Bolivian government, without any effective action of the Chilean authority, despite a warning by the Peruvian and Bolivian consulates about weapons and men on board the ships ''Maria Luisa'' and ''Paquete de Los Vilos''.

Peru, which at that time enjoyed naval supremacy in South Pacific, responded with a naval demonstration in Mejillones, sending there the ''[[Huascar (ship)|Huascar]]'' and the ''Chalaco''. Peru's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jose de la Riva Agüero, told the Chilean Government that Peru would not view with indifference the occupation of Bolivian territory by foreign forces.

In October 1872 the Bolivian Assembly authorized the executive to sign a treaty of alliance with Peru (without the necessity for further legislative consultation) which finally became the [[Secret treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia of 1873]], signed on February 6, 1873, in Lima.

The Peruvian government saw the Lindsay-Corral Protocol as an increase in the regional influence of Chile and urged Bolivia to reject it, and in fact on May 19, 1873 the Bolivian Assembly postponed approval to 1874. The Assembly never approved nor refused the treaty.

In 1874, representatives of Bolivia and Chile reopened talks which concluded with the Treaty of Sucre or Boundary Treaty between Bolivia and Chile of 1874 (see English version in [[:wikisource:1874 Boundary Treaty between Bolivia and Chile|Boundary Treaty between Bolivia and Chile of 1874]]). The pact kept the 24th parallel as the boundary between Bolivia and Chile and Chile relinquished its former rights of condominium in return for no future nitrate tax increases over Chilean companies.

'''Brazilian nationality law''' is based on both the principles of ''[[jus soli]]'' and of ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. As a general rule, any person born in [[Brazil]] acquires Brazilian nationality at birth, irrespective of status of parents. [[Nationality law]] is regulated by Article 12 of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Federal Constitution]].

==Birth in Brazil==
A person born in Brazil acquires Brazilian nationality at birth. The only exception applies to children of persons in the service of a foreign government (such as a foreign [[diplomacy|diplomats]]). This means that parents and siblings of the Brazilian child are eligible to apply for permanent residency in Brazil, regardless of their nationality or where subsequent siblings were/are born.&lt;ref&gt;https://givebirthinbrazil.com/why-give-birth-brazil-florianopolis, Why Give Birth In Brazil?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural Brazilians born abroad==
Brazilian law considers as Brazilian citizens people born abroad in two cases:

*a person born outside Brazil of a Brazilian parent who is in the service of the Brazilian government; or
*a person born outside Brazil of a Brazilian parent, provided that that person either be registered with a Brazilian [[Consul (representative)|consular office]] or later move to Brazil and confirm one's nationality before a federal judge.

Between 1994 and 2007, registration with a Brazilian consular office did not confer Brazilian nationality. In September 2007, a [[constitutional amendment]] reinstituted consular registration as a means of acquiring Brazilian nationality.

==Naturalization as a Brazilian citizen==
Foreigners may apply for Brazilian nationality if they meet the following criteria:&lt;ref name=ministry&gt;[http://www.justica.gov.br/central-de-atendimento/estrangeiros/nacionalidade Nationality], [[Ministry of Justice (Brazil)|Ministry of Justice and Public Security of Brazil]] {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=law&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2015-2018/2017/lei/L13445.htm Law no. 13.445, of 24 May 2017], Government of Brazil {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=regulation&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2015-2018/2017/decreto/D9199.htm Decree no. 9.199, of 20 November 2017], Government of Brazil {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* four years of residence in Brazil
* adequate ability to communicate in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], attested by one of various exams or education certificates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imprensanacional.gov.br/web/guest/materia/-/asset_publisher/Kujrw0TZC2Mb/content/id/43885878/do1-2018-10-04-portaria-interministerial-n-16-de-3-de-outubro-de-2018-43885761 Interministerial ruling no. 16], [[Diário Oficial da União]], 3 October 2018. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* no prior criminal conviction, in Brazil or in the country of origin

The residence requirement may be reduced in certain circumstances:&lt;ref name=ministry/&gt;&lt;ref name=law/&gt;&lt;ref name=regulation/&gt;

* only two years of residence are required for those who have provided "relevant services" to the country, or for those with notable "professional, scientific or artistic ability"
* only one year of residence is required for those who have a Brazilian spouse or child, of for nationals of [[lusophone|Portuguese-speaking countries]]
* no residence period is required for those married to a Brazilian diplomat for more than five years, or for those who worked for more than 10 years in a Brazilian diplomatic mission

Those who have lived in Brazil for more than 15 years and have no criminal conviction do not have to satisfy any other condition for naturalization. There are also lower requirements for those who moved to Brazil as minors.&lt;ref name=ministry/&gt;&lt;ref name=law/&gt;&lt;ref name=regulation/&gt;

Since 10 May 2016, Brazil does not require naturalized citizens to renounce their previous nationality.&lt;ref name=un&gt;[https://nacoesunidas.org/acnur-novo-decreto-facilita-naturalizacao-de-estrangeiros-no-brasil-e-combate-a-apatridia/ ACNUR: New decree facilitates naturalization of foreigners in Brazil and fights statelessness], [[United Nations]] in Brazil, 20 May 2016 {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=regulation1981&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/Antigos/D86715.htm Decree no. 86.715, of 10 December 1981], Government of Brazil {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ministry/&gt;&lt;ref name=regulation/&gt;

==Dual nationality and loss of Brazilian nationality==
According to the Brazilian constitution, Brazilian citizens who acquire another nationality may lose Brazilian nationality. However, since 1994 a constitutional amendment allows two exceptions where Brazilians may maintain Brazilian nationality while acquiring another one. The first exception is in the case of recognition of "originary nationality" by foreign law. Contrary to a popular misconception, this term does '''not''' refer to recognition of original Brazilian nationality by the other country, but to cases where the '''other''' nationality is acquired by '''origin''' (by birth or descent, as opposed to naturalization).&lt;ref name=ruling&gt;[https://www.26notas.com.br/blog/?p=10947 Ruling number 172 of the Ministry of Justice, of 4 August 1995], 26th Notary Office of São Paulo {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the other country recognizes dual nationality is irrelevant. The second exception is in case the other country requires naturalization for the person to remain residing or to exercise civil rights there.

Although the government has the power to revoke Brazilian nationality of those who voluntarily naturalized in another country and did not satisfy one of the exceptions, it tends to apply these exceptions very broadly, and in practice it only revokes Brazilian nationality if the person formally requests so, or very rarely in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name=consular&gt;[http://www.portalconsular.itamaraty.gov.br/perda-da-nacionalidade Loss of nationality], [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations of Brazil]] {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;[http://gazetanews.com/brasileiro-pode-perder-nacionalidade-de-origem-ao-se-tornar-cidadao-de-outro-pais/ A Brazilian may lose original nationality while becoming a citizen of another country], Gazeta Brazilian News, 20 April 2017 {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2013 the Brazilian government revoked the nationality of a Brazilian citizen who had naturalized in the United States, to extradite her to that country (the Brazilian constitution does not allow extradition of its own citizens). The decision was confirmed by the [[Supreme Federal Court]] in 2017, and she was extradited in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.conjur.com.br/2018-jan-18/governo-extradita-brasileira-nata-acusada-homicidio-eua Government extradites Brazilian that lost citizenship, accused of homicide in the US], Consultor Jurídico, 18 January 2018 {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who lost Brazilian nationality due to naturalization in another country may apply for its reacquisition on the condition that they will renounce the other nationality.&lt;ref name=consular/&gt; After Brazilian nationality is reacquired, the applicants have 18 months to show proof of renunciation of the other nationality. The process is done in this order to prevent [[statelessness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imprensanacional.gov.br/web/guest/materia/-/asset_publisher/Kujrw0TZC2Mb/content/id/12936945/do1-2018-05-04-portaria-interministerial-n-11-de-3-de-maio-de-2018-12936941 Interministerial ruling no. 11], [[Diário Oficial da União]], 3 May 2018. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalized Brazilians are allowed to also keep their previous nationality.&lt;ref name=un/&gt;&lt;ref name=regulation1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=ministry/&gt;&lt;ref name=regulation/&gt; They may lose Brazilian nationality if convicted of activity considered "harmful to the national interest".&lt;ref name=law/&gt;&lt;ref name=regulation/&gt;

Brazilian citizens who also have another nationality are allowed to enter and leave Brazil with the passport of the other country in combination with any document attesting Brazilian nationality such as a [[Brazilian identity card]] or an expired [[Brazilian passport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pf.gov.br/institucional/ouvidoria/orientacoes-frequentes/brasileiros-com-passaporte-de-outro-pais Brazilians with a passport of another country], [[Federal Police of Brazil]], 8 May 2018. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they do not provide such document, they may still enter Brazil as foreigners, subject to the regular requirements and limitations as such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pf.gov.br/servicos-pf/passaporte/scripts-de-atendimento-passaporte/duvidas-sobre-uso-de-passaporte-estrangeiro-para-brasileiros-com-dupla-nacionalidade Questions about the use of a foreign passport for Brazilians with dual nationality], Federal Police of Brazil, 22 August 2018. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romapravoce.com/entrar-e-sair-do-brasil-com-passaporte-estrangeiro/ Dual citizenship: enter and leave Brazil with a foreign passport], Rome for You, 22 August 2018. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, usually this case is only possible if Brazil does not require a visa from the other nationality. Brazil only issues visas to dual citizens in exceptional circumstances, such as for those who work in foreign government jobs that prohibit the use of a Brazilian passport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.itamaraty.gov.br/en-us/vivis.xml Visitor visa], Consulate General of Brazil in Miami.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visa-free travel==
{{Main|Visa requirements for Brazilian citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Brazilian citizens.png|400px|thumbnail|right|Visa requirements for Brazilian citizens {{legend|#ed1c24|[[Brazil]]}}{{legend|#00A2E8|Passport not required.

Visa requirements for Brazilian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Brazil]]. As of 1 January 2017, Brazilian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 156 countries and territories, ranking the [[Brazilian passport]] 18th in terms of travel freedom according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2017|url=https://henleyglobal.com/files/download/hvri/HP_Visa_Restrictions_Index_170301.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
Male Brazilian citizens have a 12-month [[conscription in Brazil|military service]] obligation, unless the citizen has a disqualifying physical or psychological condition, or if the citizen does not wish to serve and the military finds enough volunteers to support its needs. Therefore, although registering for the military is mandatory, about 95% of those who register receive an exemption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nexojornal.com.br/expresso/2017/06/16/Quais-os-obst%C3%A1culos-%C3%A0-%E2%80%98obje%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-consci%C3%AAncia%E2%80%99-no-alistamento-militar What are the obstacles to 'conscientious objection' to military registration?], Nexo, 16 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Male citizens between 18 and 45 years of age are required to present a military registration certificate when applying for a Brazilian passport.&lt;ref name=passport&gt;[http://www.pf.gov.br/servicos-pf/passaporte/documentacao-necessaria/documentacao-para-passaporte-comum/documentacao-para-passaporte-comum Documentation for normal passport], [[Federal Police of Brazil]], 29 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting==
Voting in Brazil is mandatory for citizens between 18 and 70 years of age. Those who do not vote in an election and do not later present an acceptable justification (such as being away from their voting location at the time) must pay a fine of 3.51 BRL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tse.jus.br/eleitor-e-eleicoes/servicos/justificativa-eleitoral Voting justification], Supreme Electoral Court of Brazil.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tre-sp.jus.br/eleicoes/eleitor/tira-duvidas Answers to doubts from voters], Regional Electoral Court of São Paulo.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens between 18 and 70 years of age are required to present proof of voting compliance (by having voted, justified absence or paid the fine) when applying for a Brazilian passport.&lt;ref name=passport/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11048">[[File:Stralsund, st Nikolai (2007-01-24) d.JPG|thumb|The church of [[St. Nicholas' Church (Stralsund)|St. Nicolai, Stralsund]]. The clerestory is the level between the two green roofs, reinforced here by [[flying buttress]]es.]]

In [[architecture]], a '''clerestory''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɪər|s|t|ɔːr|i}} {{respell|KLEER|stor|ee}}; lit. ''clear storey'', also '''clearstory''', '''clearstorey''',  or '''overstorey''') is a high section of wall that contains [[window]]s above eye level. The purpose is to admit light, fresh air, or both.

Historically, ''clerestory'' denoted an upper level of a Roman [[basilica]] or of the [[nave]] of a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] or [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[church (building)|church]], the walls of which rise above the rooflines of the lower [[aisle]]s and are pierced with windows.

Similar structures have been used in transportation vehicles to provide additional lighting, ventilation, or headroom.

==History==
[[File:Monreale.jpg|thumb|The walls of the clerestory of the [[Basilica#Christian adoption of the basilica form|basilica-shaped]] cathedral of [[Monreale]], [[Italy]] are covered with [[mosaic]].]]

===Ancient world===
The technology of the clerestory appears to originate in the [[Egyptian temple|temples]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. The term "clerestory" is applicable to Egyptian temples, where the lighting of the hall of columns was obtained over the stone roofs of the adjoining aisles, through slits pierced in vertical slabs of stone.  Clerestory appeared in Egypt at least as early as the [[Amarna]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Gwendolyn Leick and Francis J. Kirk, ''A Dictionary of Ancient Near Eastern Architecture'', 1988, Routledge, 261 pages {{ISBN|0-415-00240-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palaces of [[Crete]] such as [[Knossos]], by contrast, [[lightwell]]s were employed in addition to clerestories.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', Modern Antiquarian (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Biblical accounts, the Hebrew [[Solomon's Temple|temple]] built by [[Solomon|King Solomon]] featured clerestory windows made possible by the use of a tall, angled roof and a central [[wikt:ridgepole|ridgepole]].&lt;ref name="Palmer2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Allison Lee|title=Historical Dictionary of Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHR9sHRfQ_0C&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=2014-06-15|date=2008-09-11|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6283-8|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clerestory was used in the [[Hellenistic art#Architecture|Hellenistic architecture]] of the later periods of [[Ancient Greeks|ancient Greek]] civilization. The Romans applied clerestories to [[basilica]]s of justice and to the basilica-like bath-houses and palaces.

===Early Christian and Byzantine basilicas===
[[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] churches and some Byzantine churches, particularly in Italy, are based closely on the Roman basilica, and maintained the form of a central [[nave]] flanked by lower aisles on each side. The nave and aisles are separated by columns or piers, above which rises a wall pierced by clerestory windows.
[[File:malmesbury.abbey.clerestory.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]]. The nave wall is divided into three stages: the upper stage with windows is the clerestory, beneath it is the triforium, and the lowest stage is the arcade.]]

===Romanesque period===
During the Romanesque period, many churches of the basilica form were constructed all over Europe. Many of these churches have wooden roofs with clerestories below them. Some Romanesque churches have barrel vaulted ceilings with no clerestory. The development of the [[groin vault]] and [[ribbed vault]] made possible the insertion of clerestory windows.

Initially the nave of a large aisled and clerestoried church was of two levels, [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] and clerestory. During the Romanesque period a third level was inserted between them, a gallery called the "[[triforium]]". The triforium generally opens into space beneath the sloping roof of the aisle. This became a standard feature of later Romanesque and Gothic large abbey and cathedral churches. Sometimes another gallery set into the wall space above the triforium and below the clerestory. This feature is found in some late Romanesque and early Gothic buildings in France.

[[File:Prophet Jonas in Augsburg Cathedral.jpg|thumb|11th century stained glass clerestory window of Prophet Jonah|213x213px]]
The oldest glass clerestory windows still in place are from the late 11th century, found in the [[Augsburg Cathedral]]

===Gothic period===
[[File:Cathedrale d'Amiens - Grandes verrieres et voutes de la nef.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The clerestory of [[Amiens Cathedral]]]]
[[File:Strasbourg Cathedral celestory windows.jpg|thumb|Clerestory windows in [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]
In smaller churches, clerestory windows may be [[trefoil]]s or [[quatrefoil]]s. In some Italian churches they are [[Rose Window#Oculi|ocular]]. In most large churches, they are an important feature, both for beauty and for utility. The [[ribbed vault]]ing and [[flying buttress]]es of Gothic architecture concentrated the weight and thrust of the roof, freeing wall-space for larger clerestory [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestration]]. In Gothic masterpieces, the clerestory is generally divided into [[bay (architecture)|bays]] by the vaulting shafts that continue the same tall columns that form the arcade separating the aisles from the nave.

The tendency from the early Romanesque period to the late Gothic period was for the clerestory level to become progressively taller and the size of the windows to get proportionally larger in relation to wall surface, emerging in works such as the Gothic architecture of [[Amiens Cathedral]] or [[Westminster Abbey]] where their clerestories account for nearly a third of the height of the interior.&lt;ref name="Simpson1922"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Frederick Moore|title=History of Architectural Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MFCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA273|year=1922|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern clerestory windows for energy-efficient buildings ==
Modern clerestories are often defined as vertical windows, located on high walls, extending up from the roofline, designed to allow light and breezes into a space, without compromising privacy. Factory buildings are often built with clerestory windows; modern housing designs sometimes include them as well.

Modern clerestory windows may have another especially important role, besides [[daylighting]] and [[natural ventilation|ventilation]]: they can be part of [[passive solar]] strategies, in very energy efficient buildings ([[Passive House|Passive House Buildings]], [[Zero energy building|Zero Energy Buildings]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/green-basics/siting-sun-passive-heating-and-daylighting "Siting with the Sun: Passive Heating and Daylighting"]. GreenBuildingAdvisor.com&lt;/ref&gt;

To that end, clerestories are used in conjunction with stone, brick, concrete and other high mass walls and floors, properly positioned to store [[solar heat gain]]s during the hotter parts of the day –  allowing the walls and the floor to act as a heat bank during the cooler parts of the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house-energy.com/Windows/Clerestory.html "Clerestory Windows: Advantages and Downsides"]. House-energy.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerestories – in passive solar strategies – should be properly located (typically in the sunny side of the building) and protected from the summer’s sun by rooflines, [[Overhang (architecture)|overhangs]], recessed thick walls or other architectural elements, in order to prevent overheating during the cooling season.

Clerestory roofs were used on [[Passenger car (rail)|railway carriages]] (known as "clerestory carriages") from the mid-1800s into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url  =https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ESnBiR7vLPQC| title = World Railways of the Nineteenth Century: A Pictorial History in Victorian Engravings|first =Jim |last = Harter| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| year=  2005|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Railway carriages, 1839-1939| first  =G.M.|last = Kichenside| publisher  =Ian Allan| year = 1964| at = Clerestory Roofs, p.12| url =https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-nEEAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman coaches]] in England, which were also clerestory roofed, were imported and assembled at Derby, where Pullman set up an assembly plant in conjunction with the [[Midland Railway]], a predecessor of the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS). The first coach, a sleeping car named "Midland", was assembled and ready for trial running in January 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford | first1 = J B | title = The American Cars of the Midland Railway | location = London | publisher = Ian Allan | page = 15 etc | year = 1984 | isbn = 0 7110 1387 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London Underground's last clerestory roofed trains were the [[London Underground Q Stock|'Q' stock]] which ceased operations in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RW Carroll Collection|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/robertcwp/7148066675/in/photostream/lightbox/|website=Flickr|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerestories were also used in early [[double-decker bus]]es, giving better [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and headroom in the centre corridor, as well as better [[Illumination (lighting)|illumination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url =https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9_U9AAAAIAAJ| title = The Golden Age of Buses| first =

[[Volkswagen Type 2]] Kombi, or Transport, commonly called the Microbus, came in a deluxe version with clerestory windows. VW made the Samba from 1961-67 in several versions, which had as many as 23 windows, and are highly prized by collectors.

Also known as 'Mollycroft Roof' especially in Romany and other caravans.

The '''Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Sabotage Convention''' or the '''Montreal Convention''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] by which states agree to prohibit and punish behaviour which may threaten the safety of civil aviation.

==Content==
The Convention does not apply to customs, law enforcement or military aircraft, thus it applies exclusively to civilian aircraft.

The Convention [[criminalization|criminalises]] the following behaviour:
#Committing an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if it is likely to endanger the safety of the aircraft;
#destroying an aircraft being serviced or damaging such an aircraft in such a way that renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight;
#placing or causing to be placed on an aircraft a device or substance which is likely to destroy or cause damage to an aircraft;
#destroying or damaging air navigation facilities or interfering with their operation if it is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft;
#communicating information which is known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight;
#attempting any of 1–5; and
#being an accomplice to any of 1–6.

The Convention sets out the principle of ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]''—that a party to the treaty must either (1) prosecute a person who commits one of the offences or (2) send the individual to another state that requests his or her [[extradition]] for prosecution of the same crime.

==Creation and entry into force==
The Convention was adopted by the International Conference on Air Law at [[Montreal]] on 23 September 1971. It came into force on 26 January 1973 after it had been ratified by 10 states. As of 2013, the Convention has 188 state parties.

==State parties==
The Convention has 188 state parties, which includes 186 [[Member states of the United Nations|UN members]] plus the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]. The seven UN member states that are ''not'' parties to the treaty are:

*{{flag|Eritrea}}
*{{flag|Kiribati}}
*{{flag|San Marino}}
*{{flag|Somalia}}
*{{flag|South Sudan}}
*{{flag|Tuvalu}}
}}

===Former state parties and successions===
Former state parties that were not formally succeeded by any existing state include [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], and [[Yugoslavia]]. A number of states ratified but have since been succeeded by new states: [[Serbia]] ratified as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]; [[Russia]] ratified as the [[Soviet Union]]; [[Belarus]] ratified as the [[Byelorussian SSR]]; and [[Ukraine]] ratified as the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Prior to the unification of [[Yemen]], both [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]] had ratified the convention. The [[Republic of China]] signed and ratified the agreement; in 1980, the [[People's Republic of China]] approved the treaty with a statement that it declared the Republic of China's actions with respect to the convention "null and void".

On 24 February 1988 in [[Montreal]], the '''Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation''' was signed as a supplement to the Convention.

The Protocol makes it an offence to commit similarly violent, dangerous, or damaging acts in airports that serve civil aviation.

The Protocol came into force on 6 August 1989 and as of February 2018 has been ratified by 175 states, which includes 173 UN member states plus the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]. The UN member states that are ''not'' parties to the Protocol are the seven states that have not ratified the Convention plus the following 14 states:

'''Crypto-anarchism''' (or  '''crypto-anarchy''') is a form of [[anarchism|anarchy]] accomplished through [[Computing|computer technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3079241 Crypto-anarchism]. Crypto-anarchism and Cryptocurrencies Series. Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 30 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Crypto-anarchists employ [[cryptography|cryptographic]] software to evade persecution and harassment while sending and receiving information over [[computer network]]s, in an effort to protect their [[privacy]], their [[Freedom (political)|political freedom]], and their [[economic freedom]].

By using [[Encryption software|cryptographic software]], the association between the [[identity (social science)|identity]] of a certain user or organization and the pseudonym they use is made difficult to find, unless the user reveals the association. It is difficult to say which country's laws will be ignored, as even the location of a certain participant is unknown. However, participants may in theory voluntarily create new laws using [[smart contract]]s or, if the user is [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]], depend on [[online reputation]].

== Origin ==
In his 1988 "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto", [[Timothy C. May]] introduced the basic principles of crypto-anarchism, encrypted exchanges ensuring total [[anonymity]], total [[freedom of speech]], and total [[free-market|freedom to trade]] – with foreseeable hostility coming from [[State (polity)|States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
"Crypto-" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:κρυπτός#Ancient Greek|''κρυπτός'']] kruptós, meaning "hidden" or "secret". Crypto-anarchism refers to anarchist [[politics]] founded on cryptographic methods, as well as a form of anarchism that operates in secret.{{sfn|May|1994|loc=section 19.4.29}}

==Motives==
One motive of crypto-anarchists is to defend against [[computer surveillance|surveillance]] of computer networks communication. Crypto-anarchists try to protect against government [[mass surveillance]], such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[Tempora]], [[telecommunications data retention]], the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]], [[Room 641A]], the [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)#Mass surveillance|FRA]] and so on. Crypto-anarchists consider the development and use of [[cryptography]] to be the main defense against such problems, as opposed to political action.

A second concern is evasion of [[censorship]], particularly [[Internet censorship]], on the grounds of [[freedom of expression]]. The programs used by crypto-anarchists often make it possible to both publish and read information off the internet or other computer networks anonymously. For example, [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], [[I2P]], [[Freenet]] and many similar networks allow for anonymous "hidden" webpages accessible only by users of these programs, while projects like [[Bitmessage]] allow for anonymous messaging system intended to be a substitute for [[email]]. This helps [[whistleblowing|whistleblowers]] and political opposition in oppressive nations to spread their information.

A third reason is to build and participate in [[counter economics]], which includes development of viable alternatives to banking systems, and development of alternative financial systems which provide the user with options for greater privacy or anonymity. [[Cryptocurrency|Cryptocurrencies]] such as [[Bitcoin]] and services like [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]] and [[Black Market Reloaded]] made it possible to trade goods and services with little interference from the law. These are examples of centralized, and thus vulnerable, marketplaces, or tools. Similarly, [[cryptocurrency wallet|web wallets]] employed by [[Bitcoin]] users are also centralized and vulnerable. Decentralized and distributed marketplaces and currency exchanges are more difficult to target by law enforcement agencies and may provide more security to its end-users. A decentralized and distributed marketplace in development is [[OpenBazaar]].

The technical challenge in developing and maintaining these cryptographic systems is tremendous, which causes some programmers to be interested in joining such projects.

=== Cryptography and law ===
Crypto-anarchists argue that without encryption abilities, messages, personal information, and private life would be seriously damaged.  They argue that a ban on cryptography is equal to the eradication of [[secrecy of correspondence]]. They argue that only a [[Draco (lawgiver)|draconian]] [[police-state]] would criminalize cryptography.  It is already illegal to use it in some countries, and export laws are restrictive in others. Citizens in the [[United Kingdom]] must, upon request, give keys for decryption of personal systems to authorities. Failing to do this can result in imprisonment for up to two years, without evidence of other criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cryptolaw.org/cls2.htm#uk|title=Crypto Law Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This legislative key-surrender tactic can be circumvented using automatic [[Rekeying (cryptography)|rekeying]] of [[secure channel]]s through rapid generation of new, unrelated public and private keys at short intervals. Following rekeying, the old keys can be deleted, rendering previously used keys inaccessible to the end-user, and thus removing the user's ability to disclose the old key, even if they are willing to do so. Technologies enabling this sort of rapidly rekeyed encryption include [[public-key cryptography]], [[Hardware random number generator|hardware PRNGs]], [[perfect forward secrecy]], and [[opportunistic encryption]].  Many apps commonly in use today on mobile devices around the world employ such encryption. The only ways to stop this sort of cryptography is to ban it completely (any such ban would be unenforceable for any government that is not [[totalitarian]], as it would result in massive invasions of privacy, such as blanket permission for physical searches of all computers at random intervals), or otherwise raise barriers to its practical use (be they [[Great Firewall of China|technological]] or [[Cryptography export laws|legal]]). Such barriers represent a [[Harassment|difficulty]] and [[Frameup|risk]] to the users of such cryptographic technology which would limit and potentially prevent its widespread adoption. Generally, it is the [[Legal threat#Effect of legal threat|threat of prosecution]] which limits the use and proliferation of a technology more so than the ease-of-use of a technology in and of itself.

Crypto-anarchism is an ideology that seeks to create and deploy information infrastructure that, by design, is unable to comply with authoritarian requests to break the participating individuals' secrecy of correspondence.

==Plausible deniability==
Crypto-anarchism relies heavily on [[plausible deniability]] to avoid censorship. Crypto-anarchists create this deniability by sending encrypted messages to interlinked [[Proxy server|proxies]] in computer networks. A payload of routing information is bundled with the message; the message is encrypted with each one of the proxies', and the receiver's, [[public key cryptography|public keys]]. Each node can only decrypt its own part of the message, and only obtain the information intended for itself. That is, from which node it got the message, and to which node it should deliver the message. With only access to this information, it is thought to be very difficult for nodes in the network to know what information they are carrying or who is communicating with whom. Peers can protect their identities from each other's by using rendevouz onions&lt;ref&gt;https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services&lt;/ref&gt; or similar,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freehaven.net/doc/freehaven.ps&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/garlic-routing&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital signature]]s, etc. Who originally sent the information and who is the intended receiver is considered infeasible to detect, unless the peers themselves collaborate to reveal this information. See [[mix network]]s, [[onion routing]] and [[anonymous P2P]] for more information.

Anonymizing communication protocols makes it difficult to know who is connected to any particular service or pseudonym. Because [[summary punishment]] for crimes is mostly illegal, it is difficult to stop any potential criminal activity in the network without enforcing a ban on strong cryptography.

[[Deniable encryption]] and anonymizing networks can be used to avoid being detected while sharing illegal or sensitive information, that users are too afraid to share without any protection of their identity. The information being shared could be anything from anti-state [[propaganda]], whistleblowing, organization of narcotics distribution, Illegal pornographic content, distribution of reports from political dissidents, anonymous monetary transactions, etc.

==Anonymous trading==
Untraceable, privately issued [[electronic money]] and [[anonymous Internet banking]] exists in these networks. [[Digital Monetary Trust]] and Yodelbank were examples of two such anonymous banks that were later put offline by their creators. [[Pecunix]] is an anonymous (submitting personal information when opening an account is optional) gold bank operating on the Internet.

[[Ukash]] is an e-money network. Cash in amounts up to £500/€750 can be swapped for a 19-digit Ukash voucher in payment terminals and retail outlets.

[[Bitcoin]] is a currency generated and secured by peer-to-peer networked devices that maintain a communal record of all transactions within the system that can be used in a crypto-anarchic context. The idea behind bitcoin can be traced to ''The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Much Ado About Bitcoin|first=Adrian|last=Chen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/opinion/much-ado-about-bitcoin.html|date=26 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210164404/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/opinion/much-ado-about-bitcoin.html|archivedate=10 December 2013|newspaper=International New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]] was an anonymous market operated using the Tor network. Similarly, Assassination Market is a Tor-based market operated by a self-described crypto-anarchist going by the pseudonym Kuwabatake Sanjuro.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/11/18/meet-the-assassination-market-creator-whos-crowdfunding-murder-with-bitcoins/|title=Meet the 'Assassination Market' Creator Who's Crowdfunding Murder with Bitcoins|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|date=18 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210230049/http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/11/18/meet-the-assassination-market-creator-whos-crowdfunding-murder-with-bitcoins/|archivedate=10 December 2013|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OpenBazaar]] is an open source project developing a protocol for [[e-commerce]] transactions in a fully [[Decentralization|decentralized]] marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usv.com/blog/introducing-ob1&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the [[cryptocurrency]] [[bitcoin]] and was inspired by a hackathon project called [[DarkMarket]].

Anonymous trading is easier to achieve for information services that can be provided over the Internet. Providing physical products is more difficult as the anonymity is more easily broken when crossing into the physical world: The vendor needs to know where to send the physical goods. Untraceable money makes it possible to ignore some of the [[law]]s of the physical world, as the laws cannot be enforced without knowing people's physical identities. For instance, tax on income for online services provided via the crypto-anarchists networks can be avoided if no government knows the identity of the service provider.

In ''[[Cyphernomicon|The Cyphernomicon]]'', Timothy C. May suggests that crypto-anarchism qualifies as a form of [[anarcho-capitalism]]: {{quote|What emerges from this is unclear, but I think it will be a form of anarcho-capitalist market system I call "crypto-anarchy."{{sfn|May|1994|loc=section 2.3.4}}}}

Another quote in the cyphernomicon defines crypto-anarchism. Under the title "What is Crypto Anarchy?", May writes:

{{quote|Some of us believe various forms of strong cryptography will cause the power of the state to decline, perhaps even collapse fairly abruptly. We believe the expansion into cyberspace, with secure communications, digital money, anonymity and pseudonymity, and other crypto-mediated interactions, will profoundly change the nature of economies and social interactions. 
Governments will have a hard time collecting taxes, regulating the behavior of individuals and corporations (small ones at least), and generally coercing folks when it can't even tell what _continent_ folks are on!{{sfn|May|1994|loc=2.13.1}}}}

In the XVI legislature, that version of the bill provided for a measure (paragraph 29), found to be in violation of free speech by the public opinion: after the public outcry, it has never been approved by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg16/lavori/stampati/pdf/16PDL0038530.pdf |title=Camera dei Deputati: disegno di legge N. 1415-B |language=Italian |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2011 |publisher=Camera dei Deputati}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=it&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.camera.it%2F_dati%2Fleg16%2Flavori%2Fstampati%2Fpdf%2F16PDL0038530.pdf English translation])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law]] calculated that in 2006, a higher proportion of Italians had had their [[Telephone tapping|phones tapped]] than citizens of any other European country. Opposing the confidentiality of information sources, the press often obstructs the only way for the acquisition of evidence about the news leaking of the wiretapped talks and for the identification of the 'Deep Throat'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= Intercettazioni eccessive: ammissibile il ricorso di Bettino Craxi a Strasburgo|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89258543}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==XV legislature==

After the [[SISMI-Telecom scandal]], in the government were raised "fears of a maxi-blackmail against the politics":&lt;ref&gt;http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2007/10/11/news/telecom-dossier-ricatti-1.5570&lt;/ref&gt; so it was adopted a first decree in order to destroy captured illegally wire-taps. The [[Constitutional Court]] stroke down the main provisions of this [[decree]].
 
By the way, prime minister [[Romano Prodi]] complained the political use of the wiretapping leaks;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quotidiano.net/intercettazioni-prodi-fini-politici-1.821346&lt;/ref&gt; his government proposed a Bill on this issue,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/00262762.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but it has never passed through as law.

==XVI legislature==
Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and his allies have been subject of a number of wire-taps which have been published. For instance, in December 2007 the audio recording of a phone call between Berlusconi, then leader of the opposition parties, and Agostino Saccà (general director of [[RAI]]) were published by the magazine ''[[L'espresso]]'', attracting strong criticism of Berlusconi from several media sources.&lt;ref name="Ref_2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/12/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-indagato/berlusconi-regime/berlusconi-regime.html|title=Inchiesta Berlusconi "Saccà va sospeso" L'ex premier: "Solleva il morale del Capo"|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica |date=13 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was proposed by the [[Berlusconi IV Cabinet]] and presented by [[Italian Minister of Justice]] [[Angelino Alfano]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuovo.camera.it/126?action=submit&amp;leg=16&amp;pdl=1415-B&amp;stralcio=&amp;navette=&amp;cerca=cerca Scheme] of the parliamentary procedures (which started on 30 June 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; approved by the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Camera]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/00424336.pdf The text] formerly (11 June 2009) approved by the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]].&lt;/ref&gt; then modified by the [[Italian Senate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/00484629.pdf The text] modified by the Senate (10 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and brought up again for approval at the Camera in October 2011. Supporters argued that courts were authorising the practice of wiretapping too often, and that the media should not be privy to the results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10279312 Italian bill to limit wiretaps draws fire]. BBC News. 11 June 2011. Retrieved 6 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi said in 2010 that legislation was necessary to protect the privacy of Italian citizens.&lt;ref name=bbcstrike/&gt;

===Paragraph 29===
The controversy largely centered around paragraph 29 of the proposed bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/Camera/view/doc_viewer_full?url=http%3A//www.camera.it/_dati/leg16/lavori/stampati/pdf/16PDL0038530.pdf&amp;back_to=http%3A//www.camera.it/126%3FPDL%3D1415-B%26leg%3D16%26tab%3D2%26stralcio%3D%26navette%3D |title=Camera dei Deputati: disegno di legge N. 1415-B |language=Italian |accessdate=4 October 2011 |work=Camera dei Deputati}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was being debated in the [[Camera dei Deputati|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Italian parliament]].&lt;ref name="mwblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/10/04/regarding-recent-events-on-italian-wikipedia/ |title=Wikimedia blog » Blog Archive » Regarding recent events on Italian Wikipedia |publisher=Blog.wikimedia.org |accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Italian notice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Comunicato_4_ottobre_2011/en&amp;oldid=43993454|title=Wikipedia:Comunicato 4 ottobre 2011 ("Communication 4 October 2011")|publisher=[[Italian Wikipedia]] |date=4 October 2011| accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed bill would have empowered anyone who believes themselves to have been offended by the content of a publication or website, even if the content were true, to [[right of reply|enforce publication of a reply]], uneditable and uncommented, in the same place and with equal prominence of the related content, with no right of protest against the requested rewrite or any inaccuracies contained, within 48 hours and without any prior evaluation of the claim by a judge.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Hooper, John (27 September 2011). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/27/italy-bloggers-protest-right-reply-bill "Italy's bloggers to protest over 'fascist' right to reply bill"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved 6 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; If after 48 hours the reply hadn't been published, the person requesting the reply may eventually appeal to a civil court which would assess the request and evaluate the disputed content.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The sanction would be a fine between €9,500 and €12,000.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; According to editors of the [[Italian Wikipedia]]:&lt;ref name="Italian notice" /&gt;

: ''"neutrality, freedom, and verifiability of [Wikipedia's] contents are likely to be heavily compromised by paragraph 29 of a law proposal, also known as "DDL intercettazioni" (Wiretapping Act). This proposal, which the Italian Parliament is currently debating, provides, among other things, a requirement to all websites to publish, within 48 hours of the request and without any comment, a correction of any content that the applicant deems detrimental to his/her image."''

: ''"Unfortunately, the law does not require an evaluation of the claim by an impartial third judge – the opinion of the person allegedly injured is all that is required, in order to impose such correction to any website. Hence, anyone who feels offended by any content published on a blog, an online newspaper and, most likely, even on Wikipedia would have the right for a statement ("correction") to be shown, unaltered, on the page, aimed to contradict and disprove the allegedly harmful contents, regardless of the truthfulness of the information deemed as offensive, and its sources."''

===Strikes and protests===
Italian journalists went on strike on 9 July 2010, in protest over the wiretapping bill.&lt;ref name=bbcstrike&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10568331 "Italian journalists strike over Berlusconi wiretap bill"]. BBC News. 9 July 2010. Retrieved 6 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

All pages on the [[Italian Wikipedia|Italian version of Wikipedia]] on 4 October 2011 were redirected to a statement opposing the proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Adam (4 October 2011). [http://www.businessinsider.com/italy-wikipedia-wiretapping-2011-10 "Wikipedia Shuts Down Italian Site In Response To Berlusconi's New Wiretap Act"] ''Business Insider''.

Despite its approval in Senate, the Bill was never approved by the Chamber of Deputies during the XVI Legislature and was not repeated in the next parliamentary term.

==XVII legislature==
Justice Minister [[Andrea Orlando]], on 20 April 2016, said: "Wiretaps are means of investigation absolutely essential; there are steps that must be turned into legislative acts which have to avoid misuse and their dissemination even when they are not about crimes. I think they go transposed the circular of the prosecution offices addressing the issue (...) The advantage is that the law does not change with the change of the attorney. If there was a pronouncement of the ''Consiglio superiore della magistratura'' (CSM) might help to have a consistent practice".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oua.it/intercettazioni-orlando-evitare-uso-improprio-intercettazioni-italpress/&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue has been dealt with in a bill proposed by the Chamber of deputies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/00939937.pdf Atto Senato n. 2067 della XVII Legislatura], art. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;; passed through in the Senate, became law authorizing Government to decree in this matter.

{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Organs of government}}
An '''election commission''' is a body charged with overseeing the implementation of election procedures. The exact name used varies from country to country, including such terms as "''electoral commission''", "''central election commission''",'" or "''electoral court''". Election commissions can be independent, mixed, judicial or executive. They may also be responsible for electoral [[boundary delimitation]]. In [[federation]]s there may be a separate body for each subnational government. The election commission has a duty to perform election related activities in an orderly manner. For election related problems, Election Commission is responsible.

==Electoral models==
===Independent model===
In the independent model the election commission is independent of the executive and manages its own budget. Countries with an independent election commission include Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the United Kingdom. In some of these countries the independence of the election commission is constitutionally guaranteed e.g. section 190 of the [[Constitution of South Africa]].

===Branch model===
In the branch model the election commission is often called an electoral branch, and is usually a constitutionally-recognized [[Separation of powers|separate branch of government]], with its members appointed by either the executive or the legislative branch. Countries with an electoral branch include Bolivia, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

===Mixed model===
In the mixed-model there is an independent board to determine policy, but implementation is usually a matter for an executive department with varying degrees of supervision by the independent board. Countries with such a model include Cameroon, France, Germany, Japan, Senegal and Spain.

===Executive model===
In the executive model the election commission is directed by a cabinet minister as part of the executive branch of government, and may include [[local government]] authorities acting as agents of the central body. Countries with this model include Denmark, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia.  In the United States, elections for federal, state, and local offices are run by the executive branch of each state government - see, for example, the Division of Elections of the [[Florida Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/about-us/|website=Florida Division of Elections|publisher=Florida Department of State|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial model===
In the judicial model the election commission is closely supervised by and ultimately responsible to a special "''electoral court''". Countries with such a model include Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2313">'''Electronic Frontier Canada''' ('''EFC''') is a Canadian on-line civil rights organization founded to ensure that the principles embodied in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] remain protected as new computing, communications, and information technologies are introduced into Canadian society.

EFC was founded in January, 1994 and later became incorporated under the [[Canada Corporations Act]] as a Federal non-profit corporation. The letters patent was submitted December 29, 1994, and recorded on January 18, 1995. EFC is not formally affiliated with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), which is based in [[San Francisco]], although it shares many of their goals about which the groups communicate from time to time. EFC is focused on issues directly affecting Canadians, whereas the EFF has a clear American focus.

Briefly, EFC's mandate is to conduct research into issues and promote public awareness in [[Canada]] regarding the application of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to new computer, communication, and information technologies, such as the Internet. The aim is protect freedom of expression and the [[right to privacy]] in cyberspace.

Recent activity{{when|date=June 2012}} has included a submission to the Canadian government concerning the [[Internet Service Provider]] wiretapping legislation reforms known as the Lawful Access proposals, and intervention in the [[BMG Canada Inc. and others v. Doe and others]] file-sharing case, where an [[Ontario Court]] refused to allow the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] and several major record labels from obtaining the subscriber information of ISP customers alleged to have been infringing copyright.

The EFC appears to have been inactive since 2004 (based on the last updates to their website).

'''Electronic services delivery''' or '''ESD''' refers to providing government services through the [[Internet]] or other electronic means. It is related to [[e-services]] and [[e-government]].

==Defining e-service==
E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term usually referring to ‘The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix 'e' standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.’ (Alexei Pavlichev &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).

‘An umbrella term for services available on the Internet, e-Service include e-Commerce transaction services for handling online orders, application hosting by application service providers (ASPs) and any processing capability that is obtainable on the Web.’ (Computer Desktop Encyclopedia, 2009)

E-Service or 'electronic service' constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible.' (Jeong, 2007).

{{Criminal defenses}}

In [[jurisprudence]], an '''excuse''' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to [[crime|criminal]] charges that is distinct from an ''exculpation''. [[Justification (jurisprudence)|Justification]] and excuse are different defenses in a criminal case (See [[Justification and excuse]]).&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder&lt;/ref&gt; Exculpation is a related concept which reduces or extinguishes a person's [[culpability]] and therefore a person's liability to pay compensation to the victim of a [[tort]] in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]].

The "excuse" provides a [[mitigating factor]] for a group of persons sharing a common characteristic. Justification, as in [[justifiable homicide]], vindicates or shows the [[justice]]. Thus, [[society]] approves of the purpose or motives underpinning some actions or the consequences flowing from them (see Robinson{{clarify|date=August 2017}}), and distinguishes those where the behavior cannot be approved but some excuse may be found in the characteristics of the defendant, e.g. that the accused was a serving police officer or suffering from a [[mental illness]]. Thus, a justification describes the quality of the act, whereas an excuse relates to the [[status (law)|status]] or [[capacity (law)|capacity]] (or lack of it) in the accused. These factors can affect the resulting [[Legal judgment|judgment]] which may be an [[acquittal]], or in the case of a conviction may mitigate [[sentence (law)|sentencing]].   An excuse may also be something that a person or persons use to explain any criticism or comments based on the outcome of any specific event.

==Explanation==
The [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislative]] branches of modern [[State (polity)|states]] enact policy into laws which are then administered through the judicial system. [[Judge]]s also have a residual discretion to excuse individuals from [[Legal liability|liability]] if it represents a [[justice|just]] result. When considering the consequences which are to be imposed on those involved in the activities forming the subject matter of the [[common law]] or [[legislation]], [[government]]s and judges have a choice:
:the criminal or civil [[defendant]] may be excused from liability as belonging to a class of person that ought to be excused, their behaviour may be considered justified, or an exculpation may be allowed on the merits of the particular case.
To be ''excused'' from liability means that although the defendant may have been a participant in the sequence of events leading to the prohibited outcome, no liability will attach to the particular defendant because they belong to a class of person exempted from liability. In some cases, this will be a policy of expediency. Hence, members of the [[armed forces]], the [[police]] or other civil organizations may be granted a degree of immunity for causing prohibited outcomes while acting in the course of their official duties, e.g. for an [[assault]] or trespass to the person caused during a lawful [[arrest]] or for an ambulance driver exceeding the speed limit in an emergency. Others are excused by virtue of their status and capacity. Others may escape liability because the quality of their actions satisfied a general public [[goodness and value theory|good]]. For example, the willingness to [[self-defense (theory)|defend]] oneself and others, or [[defense of property|property]] from injury may benefit [[society]] at large. Albeit that the actions of a [[vigilante]] fall outside the formal controls that would seek to ensure reasonable use of force in state-appointed police officers, such people may accidentally find themselves interrupting the commission of a crime and their actions in defence of their own or another's interests is justified out of expediency as opposed to having to wait until a police officer arrives before help can be rendered.  Whilst the jurisprudential importance of the distinction between justification and excuse defenses is clear, legally they have the same effect, acquittal, and there is an ongoing debate about whether the distinction makes any practical difference.

An ''exculpation'' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] in which a [[defendant]] argues that despite the fact they committed and are guilty of the [[crime]], [[tort]], or other wrong and have a liability to compensate the victim, they should be exculpated because of special circumstances that operated in favor of the defendant at the time they broke the [[law]].

===Defenses===
*[[Defense of infancy]]
:This is an aspect of the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] of ''[[parens patriae]]''. In the criminal law, each state will consider the nature of its own [[society]] and the available evidence of the age at which antisocial behavior begins to manifest itself. Some societies will have qualities of indulgence toward the young and inexperienced and will not wish them to be exposed to the criminal law system before all other avenues of response have been exhausted. Hence, some states have a policy of ''[[doli incapax]]'' and exclude liability for all acts and omissions that would otherwise have been criminal up to a specified age. Thereafter, there may be a [[rebuttable presumption]] against the use of criminal sanctions except in more serious cases. Other states leave discretion to [[prosecutor]]s to argue or the judges to rule on whether the child understood that what was being done was wrong.
:The status of [[minor (law)|minor]] may also excuse liability in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] for [[contract]], [[tort]] and other legal situations during which liabilities would otherwise attach to the infant. Where there is only minimal understanding, transactions entered into will be void, i.e. the infant is excused. When understanding grows in line with age, the law switches from excuse to exculpation, and transactions may be voidable, i.e. the courts will judge, whether in the particular circumstances, it would be right to favor the interests of the child or the interests of the other party or parties involved in the transaction. Hence, it would not be appropriate to allow a child knowingly to deceive innocent retailers or service providers into supplying value, and then allow him or her to avoid liability to pay a reasonable sum of money for those goods or services. This is a balancing of political and commercial interests.
*[[Insanity defense]], [[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|mental disorder defence]]s and the [[M'Naghten Rules]]
:If individuals are a danger to society and/or to themselves but not responsible through a lack of understanding, there is no point in [[punishment]] (whether in the criminal or non-criminal sense). Punishment is only justified [[morality|morally]] if the person understands that what was done was wrong and accepts the judgment of society as part of the process of [[expiation]] and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]. Hence, as with ''parens patriae'', the state accepts the person as being in need of care, and offers or requires medical treatment instead of subjecting such people to the stress of having to undergo a trial as to liability.
*[[Settled insanity]] is defined as a permanent or "settled" condition caused by long-term [[substance abuse]] and differs from the temporary state of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]]. In some [[United States]] jurisdictions "settled insanity" can be used as a basis for an [[insanity defense]], even though voluntary intoxication can not, if the "settled insanity"  negates one of the required elements of the crime  such as [[mens rea]].
*[[Automatism (law)|Automatism]]
:This criminal defense straddles the divide between excuse and exculpation. It works by showing that the defendant's mind was not in control of the body's movements at the relevant time and that this loss of control was not foreseeable. For example, a [[diabetes|diabetic]] suffering a [[hypoglycaemia|hypoglycaemic]] attack will not be liable for any loss or damage caused. To that extent, it borrows from the policy excuse favoring those who are suffering from a mental illness, but allows the full trial as to liability to proceed. For a detailed comparative law discussion, see [[automatism (case law)]]
*Self-defense is, in general, some reasonable action taken in protection of self.  An act taken in self-defense often is not a crime at all; no punishment will be imposed.  To qualify, any defensive force must be proportionate to the threat.  Use of a firearm in response to a non-lethal threat is a typical example of disproportionate force; however, such decisions are dependent on the situation and the applicable law, and thus the example situation can in some circumstances be defensible, Generally because of a codified presumption intended to prevent the unjust negation of this defense by the trier of fact.

===Exculpations===
*[[Duress]] in criminal law and in [[duress (contract law)|contract]] law
:In this situation, the defendant has actually done everything to break the law and intended to do it to avoid some threatened or actual harm. Thus, some degree of liability already attaches to the defendant for what was done. In law, the usual rule is that the defendant's motive for breaking the law is irrelevant although, in the criminal law, this may reduce the sentence. The basis of the defense argues that the threats made by the other person make the defendant's entire behavior involuntary and therefore the liability should be reduced or removed. The extent to which this defense should be allowed, if at all, is a simple matter of public policy. A state may say that no threat should force a person deliberately to break the law, particularly if this breach will cause loss or damage to a third person. Alternatively, a state may take the view that even though people may have ordinary levels of courage, they may nevertheless be coerced into agreeing to break the law and this human weakness should have some recognition in the law. For example, suppose that a group of terrorists kidnap A's family and instruct A to carry a large bomb into a crowded area as the price for the release of his family. If A carries out these instructions, making no effort to contact the police or to warn those in the danger area, the issue of liability for death and injury resulting depends on the state's values. This is a legal as well as a political decision. In the civil law, duress is similarly only an exculpation, rendering contracts and other transactions voidable, and offering only minor mitigation in the calculation of the amount of any [[damages]] payable.
*[[Mistake (criminal law)|Mistake of fact]] in criminal law and in [[mistake (contract law)|mistake in contract law]]
:The fundamental policy operating here is ''[[ignorantia juris non excusat]]'', i.e. the state cannot allow ignorance of the law to be a defense. This would unduly encourage the lazy and the deceitful to trade on their ignorance (real or otherwise). Thus, only mistakes relating to the factual basis of what is being attempted can form this defense and, in the majority of situations, it will only offer limited benefit to a defendant of ordinary capacity since the state owes no general duty to save citizens from the effects of their own ignorance or stupidity. Nevertheless, there may be limited circumstances in which people may honestly believe things that either prevent them from forming the requisite ''[[mens rea]]'' or from reaching an ''[[ad idem]]'' agreement.
*[[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]]
:This is an example of a purely mitigatory defense in that, in the few situations when it is allowed to operate, it only reduces the level of criminal liability. In most legal systems, it cannot extinguish liability. It is a natural part of human nature that people get angry when they are provoked. But the state has a positive interest in maintaining good order and therefore, no matter what is done or said, people are not supposed to react violently or to cause loss or damage. Even though certain forms of physical contact or particular words might cause even reasonable people to become seriously annoyed, the state cannot sanction or justify retaliation. Thus, in most aspects of the law, any loss of control is taken to be an aggravating factor that, in the criminal law or the law of intentional torts, might well lead to an increase in sentencing, or the award of punitive or exemplary damages.

The '''execution van''', also called a '''mobile execution unit''', was developed by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] and was first used{{fact|date=March 2016}} in 1997. Mobile gas vans were invented and used by the Soviet secret police [[NKVD]] in the late 1930s during the [[Great Purge]].&lt;ref name="Albats"&gt;[[Yevgenia Albats]], ''KGB: The State Within a State''. 1995, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rob_gell"&gt;[[Robert Gellately]].

==People's Republic of China==
After the 1997 decision to legalize lethal injection as a form of execution, [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] officials began using execution vans across China. Becoming popular in 2006{{fact|date=March 2016}}{{why|date=March 2016}}, these officials state that the vans are cost-effective by allowing communities without the money to build dedicated death rows to kill prisoners without the costs associated with sending prisoners away for death. Former Chinese judge and current lawyer Qiu Xingsheng argues that "some places can't afford the cost of sending a person to Beijing—perhaps $250—plus $125 more for the drug."&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; Because [[Beijing]] is the only place where the drug is manufactured, the vans have allowed localities to administer the death sentence where the crime took place. Estimates place the number of execution vans in operation at around 40; the PRC has not confirmed this number.

A converted 24-seat bus, the execution van keeps the appearance of a normal police van on the outside with no markings indicating its purpose. The rear of the vehicle houses a windowless chamber where the execution takes place. Several cameras are present and feed closed-circuit televisions in the front of the van; a recording can be made if desired. The bed itself slides out of the wall under its own power, on which the convicted person is strapped down. A [[syringe]] is put into the arm by a technician and a police official administers the injection by pressing a button.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

==Controversy==
The PRC government claims that this is a more humane form of killing people, being far less painful than [[firing squad]] executions. Zhao Shijie, president of the Yunnan Provincial High Court, was quoted as praising the new system: "The use of lethal injection shows that China's death penalty system is becoming more civilized and humane."&lt;ref name="IANSA"/&gt; While the vans have moved China away from previous days of large public executions, human rights activists counter that they are "like government-sanctioned death squads", and allow for an increased number and a higher efficiency of executions.

There is concern that mobile execution units have made [[organ harvesting]] much easier and more profitable, as lethal injection does not damage the body.{{clarify|date=January 2018}} In March 2006 the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]] banned the sale of organs.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; It is believed{{By whom|date=November 2018}} that this has had no effect. Activists claim that the bodies are quickly [[cremation|cremated]], which makes it impossible for family members to determine if organs have in fact been removed.&lt;ref name="asiatimes"/&gt;

==Notable executions==
On December 22, 2003, organized crime leader Liu Yong was executed in an execution van in a controversial ruling.  Liu was convicted of 32 charges and sentenced to death in 2000, but was granted a reprieve after appealing the case on the grounds that his confession was forced.  Liu had been given a retrial by the Supreme Court on December 17.  It was the first time the Supreme Court had bypassed China's two-trial system in which two trials are permitted and the verdict of the second trial may be appealed by either side.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2003/12/23/2003084622 |title=Mafia kingpin dies in execution van |work=[[Taipei Times]] |date=2003-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/chinas_criminal_justice_system.pdf China's Criminal Justice System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019034145/http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/chinas_criminal_justice_system.pdf |date=2011-10-19 }} - Yale Law School - Yale University (PDF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5978">'''Fee splitting''' is the practice of sharing fees with professional colleagues, such as physicians or lawyers, in return for being sent referrals&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/fee-splitting&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fee splitting in medicine and healthcare==

This is essentially the payment of a commission to the referrer with the express intention of ensuring that the referring doctor directs referrals of patients to the payee.

In most parts of the world, the practice is considered unethical and unacceptable, hence fee splitting is often covert.  The reason it is believed not to be in the interests of patients is because it represents a [[conflict of interest]] which may adversely affect patient care and well-being, since patients will not necessarily be referred to the most appropriate doctor to provide their on-going care but will instead be referred to those doctors or hospitals with whom the referring doctor has a "fee splitting" or commission payment type of arrangement.
It is also called as 'CUT' (also spoken as Cee-You-Tee) practice in many parts of the world including [[India]] for its reference to a 'cut' from the patients bill.

Many countries do not allow promotion of health services via mass media, advertisements and other direct promotions, and in a significant way, information on pricing and quality of care institutions and medicines reaches to patient through their primary care physician, many of whom indulge in a referral fee split unethical practice to refer a patient for business to a higher specialist, brand prescription and admissions.

==Fee splitting in the United States==

The situation in the US is not entirely clear &lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771534-2,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Medical Association]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wma.net/e/meetings/leaders1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[American Medical Association|AMA]] Code provides that payment by or to a physician solely for the referral of a patient is unethical as is the acceptance by a physician of payment of any kind, and in any form, from any source such as a pharmaceutical company or pharmacist or a manufacturer of medical appliances and devices, for referring a patient to that source. Another section specifies that clinics, laboratories, hospitals or other health care facilities which compensate physicians for referral of patients are engaged in fee-splitting, which is unethical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among its ''Definitions of Unprofessional Conduct'', the "West Hudson Psychiatric Society Virtual Newsletter" (1997) lists ''Offering, giving or receiving a fee for the referral of a patient (fee splitting), or permitting any person other than an employee or associate to share in your fee, who has not provided an appropriate service directly under your supervision''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rfmh.org/whps/syn1197.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice, or something resembling it, tends to be tolerated - in ''"Medicine, Money, and Morals: Physicians' Conflicts of Interest"'' by Marc A. Rodwin, forms of fee splitting and commission paying for referrals remain common in the USA and are in effect tolerated by key overseeing bodies such as the [[American Medical Association]] and [[Joint Commission International]], or JCI.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=nsUKs1ovVmYC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=joint+commission+fee+splitting&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_CyAWz_4xn&amp;sig=ZUZNhoBXpAUjybvjXYn5ZZ-wchI&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their website, the [[Joint Commission]] (JCI) have no published view on the issue of fee splitting, and in fact the Joint Commission stopped trying to provide guidance on [[medical ethics]] to American hospitals many years ago,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=nsUKs1ovVmYC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=joint+commission+fee+splitting&amp;source=web&amp;ots=_CyAWz_4xn&amp;sig=ZUZNhoBXpAUjybvjXYn5ZZ-wchI&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; preferring to concentrate on less challenging areas of healthcare assessment, despite the vast importance of [[medical ethics]] to [[patient safety]].  It is not clear if JCI operate to a similar level of standards when working outside of the USA.

The popular group marketing website groupon and other daily deal businesses have received the green light from some U.S. state bar associations, most notably [[North Carolina's State Bar]] formal opinion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbar.com/ethics/ethics.asp?page=14&amp;from=1/2011&amp;to=12/2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, approved in some jurisdictions, Alabama and other state bar associations have chosen to dissent &lt;ref&gt;http://www.alabar.org/ogc/PDF/2012-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; from the NC state bar ruling, and have formally ruled in opposition to allowing daily deal websites as an ethical form of group marketing. Some state bar associations have yet to formally choose an opinion.

==Fee splitting in the United Kingdom==

Fee splitting and similar practices are considered unequivocally unacceptable for the medical profession in the United Kingdom.

The practice is considered unethical, and offenders can be disciplined and even "struck off the medical register" (that is, lose their license to practice medicine).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/archive/func_proced_and_dis_jan_1970.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that it does not happen.

==Fee splitting in other countries==

Fee splitting in the medical profession of various sorts has been alleged in [[Malta]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/midweek/2007/11/14/n2.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sma.org.sg/3903/Forum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bumrungraddeath.com/pages/news_details.cfm?id=112&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/326/7379/10/c&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4158">A '''fixed-price contract''' is a type of [[contract]] where the payment amount does not depend on resources used or time expended. This is opposed to a [[cost-plus contract]], which is intended to cover the costs with additional [[profit (accounting)|profit]] made. Such a scheme is often used by [[military]] and [[government]] contractors to put the risk on the side of the vendor, and control costs. However, historically when such contracts are used for innovative new projects with untested or undeveloped technologies, such as new military transports or stealth attack planes, it can and often results in a failure if costs greatly exceed the ability of the contractor to absorb unforeseen [[cost overrun]]s.    
   
Fixed prices can require more time, in advance, for sellers to determine the price of each item. However, the fixed-price items can each be purchased faster, but bargaining could set the price for an entire set of items being purchased, reducing the time for such bulk purchases treated as a whole batch. Also, fixed-price items can help in pre-determining the value of the entire inventory, such as for insurance estimates.

However, such contracts continue to be popular despite a history of failed or troubled projects, though they tend to work when costs are well known in advance. Some laws have been written which prefer fixed-price contracts, however, many maintain that such contracts are actually the most expensive, especially when the risks or costs are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontechnology.com/Articles/2009/02/17/Stimulus-bill-requires-fixed-price-contracts.aspx] Fixed-price contracts required by stimulus law By Matthew Weigelt Feb 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===A400M===

[[Airbus]]'s German chief executive [[Tom Enders]] has noted the fixed-price contract for the [[A400M]] transport aircraft was a disaster rooted in [[naivety]], excessive enthusiasm and arrogance, stating, "If you had offered it to an American defence contractor like [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], they would have run a mile from it". He stated that unless the contract was renegotiated, the project must be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13447375] Heavy going   
- 8 April 2009, ''The Economist'', "The future of Europe's high-tech military transport hangs in the balance".&lt;/ref&gt;

===A-12 Avenger II===

The U.S. [[A-12 Avenger II]] development contract was a '''fixed-price incentive contract''', not a fixed price contract,  with a target price of $4.38 billion and ceiling price of $4.84 billion. It was to be a unique, stealthy, [[flying wing]] design. On 7 January 1991, the Secretary of Defense canceled the program. It was the largest contract termination in [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] history. Rather than saving costs, the craft was projected to consume up 70 percent of the [[U.S. Navy]]'s aircraft budget within three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/a-12.htm] A-12 Avenger II Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) - 1983-1991&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KC-46 Pegasus ===
The U.S. [[Boeing KC-46 Pegasus]] contract is a fixed price contract. Due to its history of cost overruns, it is an example of how fixed price contracts place the risk upon the vendor, in this case [[Boeing]]. Total cost overruns for this aircraft have totaled about $1.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/air-force/2016/07/21/boeing-kc46-cost-overrun-penalty-air-force-boom/87409004/|title = Boeing Racks Up Another $393M In Cost Overruns On KC-46 Program|access-date = 2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Boeing was able to absorb those costs and has gained US Air Force approval to put the KC-46 into production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article95719762.html|title = Air Force approves first round of KC-46 tanker production|access-date = 2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Four Trials book cover.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of the hardcover edition.]]
'''''Four Trials''''' is a [[book]] by former [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[John Edwards]] of [[North Carolina]] and his co-writer, [[John Auchard]]. The book was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in December 2003, before Edwards unsuccessfully ran for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries|Democratic Party presidential nomination]] and, later, [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] ticket with fellow Senator [[John Kerry]] of [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].

The book is [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] in nature and relates the story of four [[civil law (common law)|civil trials]] where Edwards acted as an [[Lawyer|attorney]] for people seeking [[damages]] ([[petitioner]]s) against large institutions and [[Insurance company|insurance companies]] ([[respondent]]s). Interspersing the stories of each trial are remembrances from Edwards's childhood, time at the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]], and meeting his wife, [[Elizabeth Anania Edwards]]. Edwards also wrote about his children (including Wade, his teenage son who died in a [[car accident]]). 

The four trials are covered in four chapters: "E.G." (an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who was treated by an aggressive [[aversion therapy]] that caused  [[coma]] and [[brain damage]]), "Jennifer" (a woman whose child had serious injuries because her [[obstetrician]] didn't perform a [[Cesarean section]]), "Josh" (a young child whose parents were killed in a car crash by a speeding [[truck]] driver who was paid by the number of miles he drove), and Valerie Lakey (a girl, age five, who was seriously injured by a swimming pool drain due to a faulty design).

The '''Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War''', commonly referred to as the '''Fourth Geneva Convention''' and abbreviated as '''GCIV''', is one of the four [[treaties]] of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It was adopted in August 1949. While the first three conventions dealt with combatants, the Fourth Geneva Convention was the first to deal with humanitarian protections for [[civilian]]s in a [[war|war zone]]. There are currently [[List of parties to the Geneva Conventions|196 countries]] party to the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]], including this and the other three treaties.&lt;ref name="Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries 2010"&gt;{{cite web | title=Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949 | website=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries | date=23 March 2010 | url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Treaty.xsp?documentId=AE2D398352C5B028C12563CD002D6B5C&amp;action=openDocument | access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted a report from the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] and a Commission of Experts which concluded that the Geneva Conventions had passed into the body of [[customary international law]], thus making them binding on non-signatories to the Conventions whenever they engage in armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/icty/icty.html|title=United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law|website=legal.un.org|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}]]

This sets out the overall parameters for GCIV:

=== Article 2:  Application of the Convention ===
Article 2 states that signatories are bound by the convention both in war, [[armed conflict]]s where [[Declaration of war|war has not been declared]], and in an [[Military occupation|occupation]] of another [[country]]'s territory.

:In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.

The scope of article 2 is broad:

:Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations.

In the commentary to the article [[Jean Pictet]] writes:

:They [conventions] are coming to be regarded less and less as contracts concluded on a basis of reciprocity in the national interests of the parties and more and more as a solemn affirmation of principles respected for their own sake, a series of unconditional engagements on the part of each of the Contracting Parties ' vis-à-vis ' the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949-53: Commentary of 1958|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Comment.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=5AA133B15493D9D0C12563CD0042A15A|publisher=International Red Cross|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Article 3: Conflicts not of an international character ===
Article 3 states that even where there is not a conflict of international character, the parties must as a minimum adhere to minimal protections described as: [[non-combatant]]s, members of [[armed forces]] who have laid down their arms, and [[combatants]] who are ''[[hors de combat]]'' (out of the fight) due to [[wound]]s, [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], or any other cause ''shall in all circumstances be treated humanely'', with the following prohibitions:

*(a) [[violence]] to life and person, in particular [[murder]] of all kinds, [[mutilation]], cruel treatment and [[torture]];
*(b) taking of [[hostage]]s;
*(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;
*(d) the passing of [[sentence (law)|sentences]] and the carrying out of [[execution]]s without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the [[judicial]] [[guarantee]]s which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.

=== Article 4: Definition of protected persons ===
Article 4 defines who is a ''protected person'':

:Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals.

It explicitly excludes "Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention" and the citizens of a neutral state or an allied state if that state has normal [[diplomatic relations]] "within the State in whose hands they are".

A number of articles specify how ''protecting powers'', ''[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]'' and ''other [[humanitarian organization]]s'' may aid ''protected persons''.

The definition of ''protected person'' in this article is arguably the most important article in this section because many of the articles in the rest of GCIV only apply to ''protected persons''.

=== Article 5: Derogations ===
Article 5 provides for the suspension of persons' rights under the Convention for the duration of time that this is "prejudicial to the security of such State", although "such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention."

The common interpretation of article 5 is that its scope is very limited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Comment.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=12409217CE36C309C12563CD0042A5E0 Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949. COMMENTARY OF 1958], p. 52 (derogations)&lt;/ref&gt; Derogation is limited to individuals "definitely suspected of" or "engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State." In paragraph two of the article, "spy or saboteur" is mentioned.

== Part II. General Protection of Populations Against Certain Consequences of War ==
===Article 13: Field of application of part II===
:The provisions of Part II cover the whole of the populations of the countries in conflict, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on '''[[Race (human classification)|race]]''', '''[[nationality]]''', '''[[religion]]''' or '''[[Political party|political opinion]]''', and are intended to alleviate the sufferings caused by war.

The list of basis on which distinction might be drawn is not exhaustive.

== Part III. Status and Treatment of Protected Persons ==

=== Section I. Provisions common to the territories of the parties to the conflict and to occupied territories ===

==== Article 32: Prohibition of corporal punishment, torture, etc. ====
A protected person may not have anything done  "of such a character as to cause physical suffering or extermination... the physical suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands. This prohibition applies not only to murder, [[torture]], [[corporal punishment]]s, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments not necessitated by the medical treatment". While popular debate remains on what constitutes a legal definition of torture, the ban on corporal punishment simplifies the matter; even the most mundane physical abuse is thereby forbidden by Article 32, as a precaution against alternate definitions of torture.

The prohibition on scientific experiments was added, in part, in response to experiments by [[Germany|German]] and [[Japan]]ese doctors during [[World War II]] of whom [[Josef Mengele]] was the most infamous.

==== Article 33: Individual responsibility, collective penalties, pillage and reprisals ====

:No protected person may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of [[intimidation]] or of [[terrorism]] are prohibited.
:[[Pillage]] is prohibited.
:[[Reprisal]]s against protected persons and their [[property]] are prohibited."

Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, [[collective punishment]] is a [[war crime]]. By collective punishment, the drafters of the Geneva Conventions had in mind the reprisal killings of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the First World War, the Germans executed [[Belgium|Belgian]] villagers in mass retribution for [[Resistance movement|resistance]] activity during the [[Rape of Belgium]]. In World War II, both the Germans and the Japanese carried out a form of collective punishment to suppress resistance. Entire villages or towns or districts were held responsible for any resistance activity that occurred at those places.&lt;ref name=keylor&gt;Keylor, William R., "The Twentieth Century World and Beyond," Oxford University Press, New York: 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions, to counter this, reiterated the principle of individual responsibility. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) Commentary to the conventions states that parties to a conflict often would resort to "intimidatory measures to terrorize the population" in hopes of preventing hostile acts, but such practices "strike at guilty and innocent alike. They are opposed to all principles based on humanity and justice."

Additional Protocol II of 1977 explicitly forbids collective punishment. But as fewer states have ratified this protocol than GCIV, GCIV Article 33 is the one more commonly quoted.

=== Section III. Occupied territories ===

Articles 47-78 impose substantial obligations on occupying powers.  As well as numerous provisions for the general welfare of the inhabitants of an occupied territory, an occupier may not forcibly deport protected persons, or  deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into occupied territory (Art.49).

==== Article 49: Deportations, transfers, evacuations ====

:Article 49. Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.

:Nevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bounds of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.

:The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.

:The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.

:The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.

:The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.

The reference in the last paragraph to “[[Deportation|deportation]]”, is commonly understood as the ''expulsion'' of foreign nationals, whereas the expulsion of nationals would be called ''extradition, banishment'' or ''exile''. If ethnic groups are affected by ''deportation'', it may also be referred to as [[population transfer]]. ''Transfer'' in this case literally means to move or pass from one place to another. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] has expressed the political opinion, “that international humanitarian law prohibits the establishment of settlements, as these are a form of population transfer into occupied territory.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/occupation-faq-051010.htm What does the law say about the establishment of settlements in occupied territory?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Article 50: Children ====

:Article 50. The Occupying Power shall, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities, facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children.

:The Occupying Power shall take all necessary steps to facilitate the identification of children and the registration of their parentage. It may not, in any case, change their personal status, nor enlist them in formations or organizations subordinate to it.

:Should the local institutions be inadequate for the purpose, the Occupying Power shall make arrangements for the maintenance and education, if possible by persons of their own nationality, language and religion, of children who are orphaned or separated from their parents as a result of the war and who cannot be adequately cared for by a near relative or friend.

:A special section of the Bureau set up in accordance with Article 136 shall be responsible for taking all necessary steps to identify children whose identity is in doubt. Particulars of their parents or other near relatives should always be recorded if available.

:The Occupying Power shall not hinder the application of any preferential measures in regard to food, medical care and protection against the effects of war which may have been adopted prior to the occupation in favour of children under fifteen years, expectant mothers, and mothers of children under seven years.

==== Article 53: Prohibited destruction ====

:Article 53. Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.

In [[The Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. Commentary]], [[Jean Pictet]] writes:

{{blockquote|In order to dissipate any misconception in regard to the scope of Article 53, it must be pointed out that the property referred to is not accorded general protection; the Convention merely provides here for its protection in occupied territory. The scope of the Article is therefore limited to destruction resulting from action by the Occupying Power. It will be remembered that Article 23 (g) of the [[Hague Regulations]] forbids the unnecessary destruction of enemy property; since that rule is placed in the section entitled "hostilities", it covers all property in the territory involved in a war; its scope is therefore much wider than that of the provision under discussion, which is only concerned with property situated in occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949-53: Commentary of 1958|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600060?OpenDocument|publisher=International Red Cross|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Article 56: Hygiene and public health ====

Article 56 describes the medical obligations the occupying power has in the occupied territory:

:To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring and maintaining, with the cooperation of national and local authorities, the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied territory, with particular reference to the adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics. Medical personnel of all categories shall be allowed to carry out their duties.

:If new hospitals are set up in occupied territory and if the competent organs of the occupied State are not operating there, the occupying authorities shall, if necessary, grant them the recognition provided for in Article 18. In similar circumstances, the occupying authorities shall also grant recognition to hospital personnel and transport vehicles under the provisions of Articles 20 and 21.

:In adopting measures of health and hygiene and in their implementation, the Occupying Power shall take into consideration the moral and ethical susceptibilities of the population of the occupied territory.

==== Article 78: Security measures. Internment and assigned residence. Right of appeal ====
Article 78 deals with [[internment]]. It allows the occupying power for "imperative reasons of security" to "subject them [protected persons] to assigned residence or to internment." The article does not allow the occupying power to take collective measures: each case must be decided separately.

==Part IV. Execution of the Convention==
This part contains "the formal or diplomatic provisions which it is customary to place at the end of an international Convention to settle the procedure for bringing it into effect are grouped together under this heading (1). They are similar in all four Geneva Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600172?OpenDocument Commentary: Part IV : Execution of the convention #Section II : Final provisions], Retrieved 2008-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annexes==
The ICRC commentary on the Fourth Geneva convention states that when the establishment of hospital and safety zones in occupied territories were discussed reference was made to a draft agreement and it was agreed to append it as an annex I to the Fourth Geneva Convention.&lt;ref name=ICRC-Appendix-I&gt;ICRC  [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600183?OpenDocument Commentary: Annex I : Draft agreement relating to hospital and safety zones and localities], Retrieved 2008-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRC states that "the Draft Agreement has only been put forward to States as a model, but the fact that it as carefully drafted at the Diplomatic Conference, which finally adopted it, gives it a very real value. It could usefully be taken as a working basis, therefore, whenever a hospital zone is to be established."&lt;ref name=ICRC-Appendix-I/&gt;

The ICRC states that Annex II is a "...draft which, according to Article 109 (paragraph 1) of the Convention, will be applied in the absence of special agreements between the Parties, deals with the conditions for the receipt and distribution of collective relief shipments. It is based on the traditions of the International Committee of the Red Cross which submitted it, and on the experience the Committee gained during the Second World War."&lt;ref name=ICRC-Appendix-II&gt;ICRC  [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600196?OpenDocument Commentary: Annex II : Draft regulations concerning collective relief], Retrieved 2008-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Annex III contains an example internment card, letter and correspondence card:&lt;ref name=ICRC-Appendix-III&gt;ICRC  [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600204?OpenDocument Commentary: Annex III Model internment cards, letters and correspondence cards], Retrieved 2008-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Bona fide|other uses|Bona fide (disambiguation)|and|Good faith (disambiguation)}}
'''Good faith''' ({{lang-la|bona fides}}), in human interactions, is a sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction. While some Latin phrases lose their literal meaning over centuries, this is not the case with ''bona fides''; it is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern-day English translation of ''good faith''.&lt;ref&gt;Garger, John. "Translating Arguendo and Bona Fide from Latin to English." ''Bright Hub Education''. Bright Hub Inc., 5 Jan 2012. Retrieved 6 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important concept within [[law]] and [[business]]. The opposed concepts are [[bad faith]], ''mala fides'' (duplicity) and [[perfidy]] (pretense). In contemporary English, the usage of ''bona fides'' is synonymous with [[credential]]s and [[identity document|identity]]. The phrase is sometimes used in job advertisements, and should not be confused with the [[bona fide occupational qualifications|''bona fide'' occupational qualifications]] or the employer's good faith effort, as described below.

==''Bona fides''==
''Bona fides'' is a Latin phrase meaning "good faith". Its [[Ablative (Latin)|ablative case]] is ''bona fide'', meaning "in good faith", it is often used as an adjective to mean "genuine". While today ''fides'' is concomitant to faith, a more technical translation of the Latin concept would be something like "reliability", in the sense of a trust between two parties for the potentiality of a relationship. In [[ancient Rome]] ''bona fides'' was always assumed by both sides, had implied responsibilities, and both legal and religious consequences if broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=John P.|title=THE ROMAN CONCEPT OF FIDES|website= sun.edu|date= May 2009|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/fides.html|accessdate= &lt;!-- January 2015 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fides (deity)|Fides]] was one of the original virtues to be considered a religious "divinity" in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman paganism]].

==Law==
{{main article|Good faith (law)}}
In [[law]], ''bona fides'' denotes the [[:wikt:mental state|mental]] and [[morality|moral]] states of honesty and [[belief|conviction]] regarding either the [[truth]] or the [[falsity]] of a [[proposition]], or of a body of [[opinion]]; likewise regarding either the rectitude or the depravity of a line of [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]]. As a legal concept ''bona fides'' is especially important in matters of [[Equity (law)|equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=819&amp;bold=|title=good faith |publisher=Law.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Faith as an international principle of law [http://www.trans-lex.org/901000 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''bona fide'' is also proclaimed by the original version of the [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Magna Carta]] (1215), Clause I&lt;/ref&gt; In contract law, the implied covenant of good faith is a general presumption that the parties to a contract will deal with each other honestly and fairly, so as not to destroy the right of the other party or parties to receive the benefits of the contract. In insurance law, the insurer's breach of the implied covenant may give rise to a legal liability known as [[insurance bad faith]].

Most US jurisdictions view breaches of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing solely as a variant of breach of [[contract]]. Linguistically, in the US, American English usage of ''bona fides'' applies it as synonymous with [[credential]]s, professional background, and documents attesting a person's [[identity document|identity]], which is not synonymous with [[bona fide occupational qualifications|''bona fide'' occupational qualifications]]. More recently, other common law countries have begun to adopt good faith as a general principle. In the UK, the High Court in ''[[Yam Seng Pte Ltd v Int Trade Corp Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2013] EWHC 111&lt;/ref&gt; expressed this preference. In Canada, the Supreme Court declared in ''[[Bhasin v. Hrynew]]'' that good faith was a general organizing principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14438/index.do |title=SCC 71|year=2014|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment efforts==
[[Bona fide occupational qualifications|''Bona fide'' occupational qualifications]] (employer's good faith effort) are qualities or attributes that employers are allowed to consider when making decisions on the hiring and retaining of employees. An employer's good faith effort is used as an evaluation tool by the jurisdiction during the annual program review process to determine an employer's level of commitment to the reduction goals of the [[Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction|CTR Law]]. [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal]] and [[State governments of the United States|state government]]s are required by [[Affirmative action#United States|affirmative action]] (and other such laws) to look for disabled, minority, female, and veteran business enterprises when bidding public jobs. Good faith effort law varies from state to state and even within states depending on the awarding department of the government. Most good faith effort requires advertising in state certified publications, usually a trade and a focus publication. Other countries such as Canada have similar programs.

==In wikis==
Public [[wiki]]s depend on implicitly or explicitly assuming that its users are acting in good faith. [[Wikipedia]]'s principle ''Assume Good Faith'' (often abbreviated AGF) has been a stated guideline since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Wikipedia:Assume good faith." Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. 13 May 2005, 20:361 UTC. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith&amp;oldid=14428829 Wikipedia:Assume good faith]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "the first principle in the Wikipedia etiquette".&lt;ref&gt;Goldspink, Chris (2007), "[http://isce.edu/ISCE_Group_Site/web-content/ISCE_Events/Auckland_2007/Papers/Regular/032_Goldspink.pdf Normative self-regulation in the emergence of global network institutions: The Case of Wikipedia]", ''Proceedings of the 13th ANZSYS Conference'' - Auckland, New Zealand, 2-5 December 2007; Systemic Development: Local Solutions in a Global Environment&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study of users' motives for contributing to Wikipedia, "while participants have both individualistic and collaborative motives, collaborative ([[Altruism|altruistic]]) motives dominate."&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C., Prasarnphanich, P.

{{Equitable doctrines}}
The '''history of equity and trusts''' concerns the development of the body of rules known as [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]], [[English trust law]] and its spread into a modern body of [[trust law]] around Commonwealth and the United States.

The law of trusts was constructed as part of "[[Equity (law)|equity]]", a body of principles made by the [[Courts of Chancery]], which sought to correct the strictness of the [[common law]]. The trust was an addition to the [[English property law|law of property]], in the situation where one person held legal title to property, but the courts decided it was fair, just or "equitable" that this person be compelled to use it for the benefit of another. This recognised a split between legal and beneficial ownership: the legal owner was referred to as a "trustee" (because he was "entrusted" with property) and the beneficial owner was the "beneficiary".

==Ancestors to trust law==
{{see also|Fideicommissum}}
Possible earliest concept of equity in land held in trust is the depiction of this ancient king ( [[Settlor|trustor]] ) which grants property back to its previous owner ( [[beneficiary]] ) during her absence, supported by witness testimony ( [[trustee]] ).  In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state ( trustor and holder of assets at highest position ) issues ownership along with past proceeds ( equity ) back to the beneficiary:
{{quote | ''On the testimony of Gehazi the servant of Elisha that the woman was the owner of these lands, the king returns all her property to her. From the fact that the king orders his eunuch to return to the woman all her property and the produce of her land from the time that she left ...'' &lt;ref&gt;Ben-Barak, Zafrira. "Meribaal and the System of Land Grants in Ancient Israel." Biblica (1981): 73-91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

*[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' (ca 750 BC)
*[[Aristotle]], ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (ca 350 BC) Book V, ch 10, Equity, a corrective of legal justice.

[[Roman law]] had a well-developed concept of the trust (''[[fideicommissum]]'') created by [[will (law)|wills]]. However, these testamentary trusts did not develop into the ''inter vivos'' (living) trusts which apply while the creator lives. This was created by later common law jurisdictions. The ''[[waqf]]'' is a similar institution in [[Sharia|Islamic law]], restricted to [[charitable trust]]s.

==Middle Ages==
{{main|Feudalism|Court of Chancery}}
The law of trusts first developed in the 12th century from the time of the [[crusades]] under the jurisdiction of the [[King of England]]. The "[[common law]]" regarded property as an indivisible entity, as it had been done through [[Roman law]] and the continental version of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. Where it seemed "inequitable" (i.e. unfair) to let someone with legal title hold onto it, the King's representative, the [[Lord Chancellor]] who established the [[Courts of Chancery]], had the discretion to declare that the real owner "in equity" (i.e. in all fairness) was another person. When a landowner left England to fight in the [[Crusades]], he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues, on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return. However, Crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return. Unfortunately for the Crusader, English common law did not recognize his claim. As far as the King's courts were concerned, the land belonged to the trustee, who was under no obligation to return it. The Crusader had no legal claim. The disgruntled Crusader would then petition the king, who would refer the matter to his [[Lord Chancellor]]. The Lord Chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience. At this time, the principle of [[Equity (law)|equity]] was born. The Lord Chancellor would consider it "unconscionable" that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the Crusader (the "true" owner). Therefore, he would find in favour of the returning Crusader. Over time, it became known that the Lord Chancellor's court (the Court of Chancery) would continually recognize the claim of a returning Crusader. The legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner, and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested. The Crusader was the "beneficiary" and the acquaintance the "trustee". The term "use of land" was coined, and in time developed into what we now know as a "trust".

In medieval English trust law, the settlor was known as the ''feoffor to uses'' while the trustee was known as the ''[[feoffee]] to uses'' and the beneficiary was known as the ''[[cestui que]] use'', or ''cestui que trust''.

==19th century and fusion==
"[[Antitrust law]]" emerged in the 19th century when industries created [[trust (monopoly)|monopolistic trusts]] by entrusting their shares to a board of trustees in exchange for shares of equal value with dividend rights; these boards could then enforce a monopoly. However, trusts were used in this case because a [[corporation]] could not own other companies' stock and thereby become a [[holding company]] without a "special act of the legislature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chandler, Jr. |first = Alfred D. | year = 1977| title= The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business | pages = 319–20 | publisher = Harvard University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hUkqx76sF6oC&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding companies were used after the restriction on owning other companies' shares was lifted.

{{Insolvency}}

'''Hong Kong insolvency law''' regulates the position of [[company|companies]] which are in [[financial distress]] and are unable to pay or provide for all of their debts or other obligations, and matters ancillary to and arising from financial distress.  The [[Law of Hong Kong|law]] in this area is now primarily governed by the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/BFBC0BDE18CA0665482575EE0030D882/$FILE/CAP_32_e_b5.pdf|title=Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap 32)|publisher=Department of Justice, Government of Hong Kong|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap 32H).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/4f0db701c6c25d4a4825755c00352e35/3041BA0E9AD9C926482575EE003161CF/$FILE/CAP_32H_e_b5.pdf|title=Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap 32H)|publisher=Department of Justice, Government of Hong Kong|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2012 Cap 32 was called the Companies Ordinance, but when the Companies Ordinance (Cap 622) came into force in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/707C1C4DC6BDF92848257A5500549A21/$FILE/CAP_622_e_b5.pdf|title=Companies Ordinance (Cap 622)|publisher=Department of Justice, Government of Hong Kong|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the provisions of Cap 32 were repealed except for the provisions relating to insolvency, which were retained and the statute was renamed to reflect its new principal focus.&lt;ref name=FSTB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/government/publication/consultation/docs/2013/Insolvency_Law.pdf. |title=Improvement of Corporate Insolvency Law Legislative Proposals, Consultation Document |publisher=Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau |accessdate=23 August 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Hong Kong law, the term [[insolvency]] is usually used with reference to companies, and [[bankruptcy]] is used in relation to individuals.  [[Personal bankruptcy]] is regulated by the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/BACF4766543D88A2482575EE002D5EBD/$FILE/CAP_6_e_b5.pdf|title=Bankruptcy Act (Cap 6)|publisher=Department of Justice, Government of Hong Kong|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives underpinning Hong Kong insolvency law have been described as follows:&lt;ref name=FSTB /&gt;
{{cquote|The fundamental purpose of corporate insolvency law is to resolve all claims against insolvent companies, and provide a fair and orderly process for realising and collecting the assets of insolvent companies and distributing them among creditors in accordance with the statutory scheme of distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(at paragraph 1.1)&lt;/small&gt;}}

==Winding up==

A company may go into winding up either voluntarily or by order of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.169(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  A company enters voluntary winding up by passing a [[special resolution]] to appoint a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]].  If the company is solvent when it enters voluntary winding up it is said to be in ''members' voluntary winding up'', and if it is insolvent it is said to be in ''creditors' voluntary winding up''.

A company may be wound up by the courts on several grounds.  These are:&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.177(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
# the company has by special resolution resolved that the company be wound up by the court;
# the company does not commence its business within a year from its incorporation, or suspends its business for a whole year;
# the company has no members; 
# the company is unable to pay its debts;
# the event, if any, occurs on the occurrence of which the articles provide that the company is to be [[Dissolution (law)|dissolved]];
# the court is of opinion that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up.

In practice the most important grounds tend to be insolvency (the fourth ground) and just and equitable winding up (the sixth ground).  Just and equitable winding up is usually unrelated to the solvency of the company.

A petition to the court for the winding up of a company may be presented by the company itself, or by any creditor or creditors (including any contingent or prospective creditor or creditors), contributory or contributories or the trustee in bankruptcy or the personal representative of a contributory.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.179(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  For these purposes a contributory broadly means a shareholder or other type of member of the company.  Liquidation is a class right, and so the court will not normally make an order upon the application of a creditor if it is opposed by a majority of creditors.&lt;ref&gt;''Re ABC Coupler Engineering'' [1961] 1 WLR 243&lt;/ref&gt;  However the court may give lower weight to creditors who are connected to the company as either directors or shareholders when considering what is in the best interests of the creditors as a whole.

===Effect of an order===

If the court makes an order winding up the company, then any disposition of the property of the company and any transfer of the company's shares made after the commencement of the winding up, is, unless the court otherwise orders, [[void (law)|void]].&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.182.&lt;/ref&gt;  However the commencement of winding up is deemed to ''relate back'' to the time when the petition was presented.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.184(2)&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, all dispositions of property or transfers of shares made between the time of the lodging of the petition and the making of the order are set aside unless the court orders.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Re Gray's Inn Construction Co Ltd]]'' [1980] 1 WLR 711&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, when a winding up order has been made no action or proceeding may be commenced or proceeded with against the company except by leave of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.186&lt;/ref&gt;  However this will not normally prevent a secured creditor from enforcing its security through an out of court process.  Where a secured creditor wishes to enforce their security through court action, leave will normally be granted.&lt;ref name=IFLR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iflr.com/Article/3458458/2015-Insolvency-and-Corporate-Reorganisation-Report-Hong-Kong.html|title=2015 Insolvency and Corporate Reorganisation Report: Hong Kong|publisher=IFLR|author=David Kidd ([[Linklaters]])|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insolvency==

The test for insolvency under Hong Kong law is whether a company is unable to pay its debts.  A company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts in the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.178(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
# if a creditor, by assignment or otherwise, to whom the company is indebted in a sum then due equal to or exceeding the specified amount, has served on the company, by leaving it at the registered office of the company, a demand under his hand requiring the company to pay the sum so due, and the company has for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum, or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; or 
# if execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of any court in favour of a creditor of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or
# if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts, and, in determining whether a company is unable to pay its debts, the court shall take into account the contingent and prospective liabilities of the company.

Where a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts, this has a number of other effects in addition to the ability for a creditor to present a petition to wind it up.  It also means that the [[board of directors|directors]] are expected to discharge their duties in the best interest of the company's creditors rather than its shareholders; that transactions may be potentially vulnerable as voidable transactions, and that the right of creditors to [[Set-off (law)|set-off]] mutual debts may become impaired in relation to debts which are incurred during the period of insolvency.

==Liquidation==

{{Main|Liquidation}}

Once a liquidator is appointed the company is said to be in [[liquidation]], or in winding up.  The duty of the liquidator is to take possession and control of all of the assets which the company is beneficially entitled to,&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.197&lt;/ref&gt; sell (or liquidate) them, and then distribute the proceeds among the creditors in accordance with the statutory scheme of priorities.  The liquidator also has wide powers, including (amongst other things) the power to (a) to bring or defend any action or other legal proceeding in the name and on behalf of the company, and (b) to carry on the business of the company, so far as may be necessary for the beneficial winding up thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.199&lt;/ref&gt;

The priority of claims is broadly as follows:&lt;ref name=IFLR /&gt;
# liquidator's costs and expenses&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.256&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[preferential creditor]]s&lt;ref name=s250&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.250&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[unsecured creditor]]s
As between themselves, the claimants in each level rank ''[[pari passu]]'' as between themselves.&lt;ref name=s250 /&gt;  Preferential claims are mostly sums due to employees (up to a limit) and certain sums due to Government.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.265(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secured creditor]]s do not normally participate in the liquidation process and will normally have a prior ranking claim to any assets over which they have a [[security interest]] (and so will normally take ahead of all the claimants above).  As between themselves, the priorities between claimants is determined by the law of priority as to who has a first ranking claim.  The one exception to this is [[floating charge]] holders.  By statute floating charge holders are subordinated to preferred creditors, although under complex rules still rank ahead of liquidator's claims.&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''[[Buchler v Talbot]]'' [2004] UKHL 9&lt;/ref&gt;

If after the payment of all of the creditors' claims there are any surplus funds left over, they are distributed to the members of the company in accordance with their entitlements.&lt;ref name=s250 /&gt;  Thereafter the company is dissolved and ceases to exist.

===The insolvent estate===

The liquidator has no better claim to any assets than the company did.  Accordingly, this means the liquidator is not entitled to have recourse to:
# assets which are in the company's possession but are owned by another party (for example, under a [[retention of title]] arrangement);
# assets which the company holds on trust for others;&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''[[Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd]]'' [1968] UKHL 4&lt;/ref&gt;
# assets which are subject to a valid security interest.

The liquidator has powers to disclaim any onerous property or unprofitable contracts.  Any person suffering loss by such disclaimer may claim against the insolvent estate as an unsecured creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Set-off===

{{Main|Set-off (law)}}

Curiously the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance makes no express provision for insolvency set-off within the statute itself, and instead, the relevant provisions are incorporated by reference from the Bankruptcy Ordinance.&lt;ref name=TDW /&gt;  Any sums which are owed by a creditor to the company are set-off against sums which are owed by the company to that creditor.&lt;ref name=s35&gt;Bankruptcy Ordinance, s.35&lt;/ref&gt;  In order for insolvency set-off to operate there must be strict mutuality between the claims (in that the company and creditor must both be beneficially entitled to the relevant debts, not merely claimants as agents or trustees for another party).&lt;ref&gt;''Biggerstaff v Rowatt's Wharf Ltd'' [1896] 2 Ch 93&lt;/ref&gt;  The rules of insolvency set-off are mandatory, and it is not possible to contract out of them.  The right to insolvency set-off is not if the creditor was aware that a winding-up petition had been presented at the time credit was extended to the company.&lt;ref name=s35 /&gt;

===Provisional liquidation===
{{Main|Provisional liquidation}}
If, upon the application for the appointment of a liquidator, there are concerns about potential dissipation of assets, or misconduct on the part of the directors, then the court may order the appointment of a [[provisional liquidator]].&lt;ref name=PL&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.193(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  Provisional liquidation is essentially an "emergency procedure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkinsolvency.com/provisional_liquidation.php|title=Provisional liquidation|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong there are three types of provisional liquidators.&lt;ref name=BWF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.briscoewongferrier.com/web2/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ProvisionalLiquidators1.pdf |title=Provisional Liquidators |publisher=Briscoe Wong Ferrier |author= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are "traditional" provisional liquidators, appointed under section 193; there are also provisional liquidators appointed pursuant to a members' voluntary liquidation under section 228A, and there are "Panel T" appointments under section 194(1A) whereby the Official Receiver is appointed as provisional liquidator.

In practice, most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some kind of [[fraud]] or other misconduct.  The applicant will normally need to show that (a) it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and (b) the company's assets are at risk prior to the hearing of the petition (which includes either dissipation of the company's assets, or the potential loss or destruction of the company's books and records.&lt;ref&gt;''Revenue &amp; Customs v Rochdale Drinks Distributors Ltd'' [2011] EWCA Civ 1116.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, it will normally be necessary to establish either (or both) that: (a) the company is clearly insolvent, and it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and/or (b) there has been the type of misconduct that would justify a just and equitable winding up.  An appointment of a provisional liquidator may also be made where it is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Treasure Traders Corporation Ltd'' [2005] EWHC 2774 (Ch).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the decision in the ''Legend'' case&lt;ref&gt;''In Re Legend International Resorts Ltd'' [2005] 3 HKLRD 16 CFI&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005&lt;ref name=Legend&gt;''Re Legend International Resorts Ltd'' [2006] 2 HKLRD 192&lt;/ref&gt; provisional liquidation may not be used as a means of shielding the company from creditor's claims to facilitate a restructuring in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f806367c-2c17-db11-8a10-00065bfd3168 |title=Corporate Rescue: The Need for Legislation |publisher=International Law Office |author=Andrew Kinnison and Jacky Yeung |date=4 August 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although prior to that date the practice was relatively common.&lt;ref name=BWF /&gt;

==Voidable transactions==

Separately from the provisions relating to the avoidance of transaction between the petition for winding up and the order, there are several other grounds upon which a transaction entered into by the company during the "twilight period" prior to going into liquidation may be challenged.  Conceptually these powers to avoid transactions are sometimes viewed as a logical extension of the [[anti-deprivation rule]].

* '''[[Unfair preference]]s.'''  Any transfer of an interest property by a company (including the grant of any security interest) or other similar act relating to property made or done by or against a company within 6-month period (or 2 years prior to the commencement of the liquidation if the transaction was with an "associate") before the commencement of the company's winding up which was influenced by the desire to prefer a particular creditor, then the liquidator may apply for the court to declare the transaction invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.266(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Extortionate credit transactions.'''  Where a company has entered into a credit transaction in the 3 years prior to going into liquidation, the liquidation may challenge that transaction as an extortionate credit transaction if having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either (a) the terms of it are or were such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of credit; or (b) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.  If the court is satisfied that a transaction is an extortionate credit transaction, it may set it aside in whole or in part.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.264B(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Voidable floating charge]]s.''' Where a company goes into liquidation, and the company created a [[floating charge]] on the assets and undertaking of the company within the 12 months prior to the commencement of the winding up, then unless it can be proved that the company was solvent at the relevant time, that floating charge is invalid except to the amount of any cash paid to the company in consideration for the charge granting of the floating charge.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.267&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one category of voidable transactions which is a feature of many other [[common law jurisdictions]] but which is ''not'' part of Hong Kong law is the power to challenge transactions as [[undervalue transaction]]s.&lt;ref name=TDW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tannerdewitt.com/overview-of-the-insolvency-regime-in-hong-kong/ |title=Overview of the Insolvency Regime in Hong Kong|publisher=Tanner DeWitt|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, although not part of the insolvency regime in Hong Kong, there is a power to set aside transactions which were entered into with intent to defraud creditors under section 60 of the Conveyancing and Property Ordinance (Cap 219).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/4f0db701c6c25d4a4825755c00352e35/8CED6A4F85D86708482575EE004E9C69/$FILE/CAP_219_e_b5.pdf|title=Conveyancing and Property Ordinance (Cap 219)|publisher=Department of Justice, Government of Hong Kong|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not affect the title to any property obtained by a party in good faith and without notice of the intention to defraud.

==Directors' duties==
If a company becomes insolvent, then the board of directors ceases to owe its duties to the shareholders - it owes its duty to act in the best interests of the creditors, being the persons who are beneficially entitled to the company's assets.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Colin Gwyer &amp; Associates Ltd v London Wharf (Limehouse) Ltd]]'' [2003] BCC 885&lt;/ref&gt;

If the company subsequently goes into liquidation, then the directors remain in office but they are effectively divested of all of their powers of management and the liquidator takes control and custody of the assets and the business and affairs of the company.

If in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that any business of the company has been carried on [[fraudulent trading|with intent to defraud creditors]] of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the court may, if it thinks proper so to do, declare that any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business in manner aforesaid shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the court may direct.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.275&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Hong Kong law there is at present no liability for what is commonly referred to as  [[wrongful trading]] or [[trading while insolvent]] in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=IFLR /&gt;

==Schemes of arrangement==

{{Main|Scheme of arrangement}}

In the absence of any specific corporate rehabilitation process, schemes of arrangement have been described as "the only tool currently available to facilitate the rescue of distressed companies".&lt;ref name=Scheme&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkinsolvency.com/schemes_of_arrangement.php|title=Scheme of Arrangement |publisher=www.hkinsolvency.com |accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schemes of arrangement are regulated under the Companies Ordinance.

Broadly, when a company in financial difficulties, it will put together a proposal to be presented to its creditors and shareholders.  This proposal will usually seek to compromise and/or extend the company's debts, often with the aim of enabling the business continuing to operate.  Part of the debt may be converted into equity.  Under a scheme creditors usually need to be willing to accept less than the full amount that they are owed.&lt;ref name=Scheme /&gt;  Normally they will only do so when the scheme offers a prospect of better rates of return than a liquidation.

In order for the proposed scheme to be approved, it is necessary for each class of creditors or members to approve the scheme by both (a) 75% in value, and (b) a majority in number.&lt;ref&gt;Companies Ordinance, s.674(1)&lt;/ref&gt;  How each class is defined is determined by the court, but the litmus test is the members of each class must have a sufficient "community of interest" that their views on the scheme should be considered together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=08ed866a-cd57-414b-a087-ae10ba3d55bb|title=Schemes of arrangement: the question of 'class' |author=Rachel Launders and Jordan Kent (Gilbert &amp; Tobin)|publisher=Lexology|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the practice in Hong Kong was to try and shield the company from its creditors whilst trying to implement a scheme of arrangement by asking the courts to appoint a [[provisional liquidator]], but that practice was effectively abolished by the courts in 2005.&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt;

==Cross-border insolvency==

{{Main|Cross-border insolvency}}

Hong Kong has not introduced the [[UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency]] into domestic legislation.  Accordingly, cross-border insolvency cases are still conducted upon an ''ad hoc'' basis using a form of [[modified universalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkinsolvency.com/index.php|title=Insolvency and Corporate Recovery in Hong Kong and the PRC|publisher=www.hkinsolvency.com|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The courts do have power to wind up a foreign company if it can be shown to have a sufficient connection with Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, s.327&lt;/ref&gt;  However the court are very reluctant to exercise this power.  Normally it will be necessary to establish that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkinsolvency.com/cross_border_insolvency.php|title=Cross-border insolvency|publisher=www.hkinsolvency.com|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the foreign company has a sufficient connection with Hong Kong;
# there is a reasonable possibility that the winding up will benefit those applying for the order; and
# the court must be able to exercise jurisdiction over one or more persons interested in the distribution of the foreign company's assets.

However, where a [[Letter rogatory|letter of request]] is issued by a foreign court, the Hong Kong courts may demonstrate more flexibility in relation to the making of an order with respect to a foreign company.&lt;ref&gt;''The Joint Official Liquidators of A Company v B and Another'' [2014] HKEC 1244.  The relevant company was already in liquidation in the [[Cayman Islands]] and the Grand Court in Cayman issued a letter of request to enable the liquidators to take advantage of the examination powers under s.221 available to a Hong Kong liquidator (there was no equivalent power in Cayman).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act''' (MPCA, {{ILCS|720|648}}) is an [[Illinois]] [[state law]] that was signed into law on November 16, 2005, and took effect on January 15, 2006.  The MPCA is an act used to create significant barriers such as the requirement to present ID to purchase cold medication that contains [[pseudoephedrine]] (Sudafed, Tylenol Cold and Claritin D) which could be used to produce [[methamphetamine]]. This is one of many [[state law]]s regulating the supply of [[pseudoephedrine]] that preceded the federal [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]].

The Act was introduced as Senate Bill 273.&lt;!-- Need which General Assembly passed it and which Public Act it was. --&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2010}}

==Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act - Amended==
In 2008, the Illinois state legislature amended{{specify|date=April 2010}} the MPCA creating a regional authority to establish a pilot program that targets individuals who are circumventing the law. As a result, the Southern Illinois counties of Williamson, Jackson, Union, Saline, Franklin, and Johnson, comprise the Illinois Meth Precursor Control Pilot Authority (IMPCPA). The IMPCPA administers methamphetamine precursor control strategies that assist law enforcement in reducing the number of methamphetamine manufacturing labs in Southern Illinois. This strategy employs an automated pseudoephedrine purchase tracking system that identifies purchase patterns associated with smurfing. Smurfing is a tactic used by small batch labs to obtain significant amounts of pseudoephedrine. Individuals, known as smurfs, make small pseudoephedrine purchases at numerous pharmacies. These legal purchases are then combined to manufacture meth.

[[File:Le Vachez Collection - Louis-Alexandre Expilly de la Poipe (1743-1794).jpg|thumb|Louis-Alexandre Expilly de La Poipe]]
__NOTOC__
'''Louis-Alexandre Expilly de la Poipe''' (24 February 1743 in [[Brest, France|Brest]] – 22 May 1794 in Brest) was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Roman Catholic hierarchies|rector]] of Saint-Martin-des-Champs near [[Morlaix]] in Léon, North [[Finistère]]. He was one of two deputies elected in 1788 by the Léon assembly of [[clergy]] to represent them at the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] convened by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].

At the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]], Expilly was president of the Ecclesiastical Committee working on the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], which in 1790 reorganised the Church in France, notably by creating one [[diocese]] per [[Département in France|département]]. The Constitution also stated that bishops should in future be elected, not appointed by the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

On 30 September 1790 the [[Bishop of Cornouaille]] (also known as the Bishop of Quimper) died. His successor would be the first bishop to be chosen by the new constitutional rules.  On 1 November, the electoral body for Finistère was convened at Quimper Cathedral despite opposition from the cathedral [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]]. Under [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], the chapter or one of their number could act as bishop until a new one was appointed.

In a third round of voting, Expilly was supported by 233 of the 380 electors while 125 votes went to the [[Bishop of Léon]], Monsignor [[Jean-François de La Marche]], in exile in [[London]] as a [[wiktionary:dissent|dissenter]] from the new Civil Constitution, and known as a ''[[Civil Constitution of the Clergy#Jurors and non-jurors|refractory]]'' priest.&lt;ref&gt;Refractory priests or ''refractaires'', also called ''non-jureurs'' (non-jurors or non-oath-takers) were priests who would not promise to uphold the new Civil Constitution of the Clergy.&lt;/ref&gt;   Expilly was proclaimed the first [[constitutional bishop]] of France.

Church traditionalists would not support an elected bishop and so there was no-one to [[Consecration|consecrate]] him. The [[Archbishop of Rennes]] refused, and in the end, Expilly had to go to [[Paris]] to be made a bishop by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]], the revolutionary [[Bishop of Autun]]. The consecration eventually took place on 24 February 1791.

In April 1791, [[Pope Pius VI]] issued an [[encyclical]] condemning Expilly and Talleyrand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicculture.net/docs/doc_view.cfm?recnum=4998 Encyclical of Pope Pius VI Charitas (On The Civil Oath In France) promulgated on 13 April 1791]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: "''They had received no commission to do so from the [[Apostolic See]]; they omitted the oath of obedience to the Pope; they neglected the examination and confession of faith which are prescribed in the Roman pontifical which should be observed universally; and they broke and despised all laws. They did this even though they must have known that the former candidate had been wrongly elected bishop of Quimper against the serious and repeated objections of the Chapter...''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Expilly was connected with the [[Girondist]] ''Commission des douze'' (Committee of Twelve), a group which stirred up opposition by a vigorous campaign of arresting "conspirators". He was imprisoned in June 1793, but released in August after modifying his position. However, he did not survive much longer. On 22 May 1794 he was [[guillotine]]d in Brest, the last person executed that day as he had been giving [[absolution]] to his fellows waiting at the scaffold. There would be no Bishop of Quimper/Cornouaille for the next four years.

Headed by the [[Minister of Justice (Finland)|Minister of Justice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oikeusministerio.fi/en/minister-of-justice|title=Minister of Justice|website=Oikeusministeriö|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is responsible for maintaining the legal safeguards necessary for the successful operation of democracy and fundamental rights of the inhabitants of [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oikeusministerio.fi/en/ministry|title=Ministry|website=Oikeusministeriö|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry's budget for 2018 is [[Euro|€]]940,743,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valtionbudjetti.fi/|title=Valtionbudjetti.fi: talousarvioesitys 2018 visualisoituna|website=Valtionbudjetti.fi|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 261 direct employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oikeusministerio.fi/henkilosto-lukuina|title=Henkilöstö lukuina|website=Oikeusministeriö|language=fi-FI|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drafting of the most central laws, the functioning of the judicial system, and the enforcement of sentences belong to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. Sentences are enforced by the [[Criminal Sanctions Agency]] ({{lang-fi|Rikosseuraamuslaitos}}, {{lang-sv|Brottspåföljdsmyndigheten}}), which administers the country's imprisonment and rehabilitation system. The Ministry of Justice of Finland might oversee the administration of justice in the [[Åland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oikeusministerio.fi/ahvenanmaa|title=Ahvenanmaa|website=Oikeusministeriö|language=fi-FI|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Ministry of Justice and its administrative sector are headed by the Minister of Justice, assisted by the Permanent Secretary. The incumbent Minister of Justice is [[Antti Häkkänen]].

The Ministry of Justice has three departments: The Law Drafting Department, the Department of Judicial Administration, and the Criminal Policy Department.

Units, separate from the three aforementioned departments, are: the Unit for Democracy, Language Affairs and Fundamental Rights; the Media and Communications Unit; the Administrative Unit; the Economy Unit; the Information Management Unit; the Internal Audit Unit; and the Management Support Unit.
===Administrative sector===
The administrative sector of the ministry consists of the [[Judicial system of Finland#Courts|courts]], Criminal Sanctions Agency and several other offices and boards (below):

* [[Legal Register Centre]]
* [[Office of the Bankruptcy Ombudsman]]
* [[Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman]]
* [[National Council for Crime Prevention]]
* [[Safety Investigation Authority]]
* [[European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control]] (HEUNI, affiliated with the Unites Nations)
* [http://lapsiasia.fi/en/ Office of the Ombudsman for Children]
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150219052914/http://www.tasa-arvo.fi/en/home Ombudsman for Equality]
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140103093812/http://www.ofm.fi/en/front_page Office of the Non-discrimination Ombudsman]


=== Units ===

==== Law Drafting Department ====
The task of the Law Drafting Department is to promote the aims and the operational concept of the Ministry of Justice by means of legislation. Legislative drafting is one of the Ministry's main tasks. 

The drafters are responsible for the entire life cycle of the project, starting from the preliminary work to the education and follow-up during the implementation phase. A considerable amount of the Department's work concerns the legislative cooperation within the EU as well as other international collaboration in addition to the national projects. 

In addition to the projects within the Ministry and the Department, the Law Drafting Department takes part in the preparation of the other Ministries' projects and answers for the general development and guidance relating to legislative drafting in the Government. One important duty is to give statements on draft statutes prepared by the other Ministries. The Unit for General International and EU Matters provides legal counselling in EU matters and assists the management of the Ministry in EU and international matters.

The Department's Unit for Legislative Inspection revises bills prepared by the Ministry of Justice and draft decree proposals with little general significance.

==== Department of Judicial Administration ====
The Department of Judicial Administration partakes in the development and strategical planning of legal protection policy. 
The Department is in charge of the performance management of and operational preconditions for the courts, legal aid, guardianship services, the Consumer Disputes Board, and the Bankruptcy Ombudsman, as well as those relating to the authority functions of the Legal Register Centre. This includes the administrative structures of the organisations and their operations, employer and personnel management, facility management, and personnel training. The department is also responsible for the Enforcement Service's operational preconditions and the strategic planning and guidance of its operations. 

The Department acquires sector-independent ICT services within its sector from the Legal Register Center and makes yearly sector-specific service agreements with the LRC. 

The Department of Judicial Administration is responsible for statute drafting within its sector and for the operational preconditions of the Judicial Appointments Board. It also partakes in international collaboration related to its sector. 
The Department monitors conventions and statutes on collaboration in international administration of justice and performs the central authority functions of the Ministry in accordance with them. The Unit for International Administration of Justice provides bureaus within the Ministry's administrative branch with guidance and training and supports them in the daily preparation of legal aid documents. 

The Department develops and consolidates the administrative branch's participation in civilian crisis management.

==== Department of Criminal Policy ====
The Department of Criminal Policy is responsible for the strategic planning and development of criminal policy and crime prevention, including the duties of the secretariat of the National Council for Crime Prevention, the development of the position of crime victims, and the development of anti-corruption measures.

'''Multimarket contact''' occurs when [[company|firms]] meet the same rivals in multiple markets. When firms compete with each other in more than one [[Market (economics)|market]], their [[Competition|competitive behavior]] may differ from that of single-market rivals. Multimarket competition may result in the reduction of the competitive intensity among rivals, an effect known as mutual forbearance.

Multimarket contact gives a firm the option to respond to actions or attacks by a rival not only in the market being challenged, but also in other markets where they both compete. As a result, multimarket competitors may hesitate to attack in one market for fear of [[retaliation]] in other markets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5417">The '''National Association of Testing Authorities''', Australia ('''NATA''') was established in 1947 in response to a call for the formation of a national testing services body to ensure the [[munition]]s which the government was manufacturing during the [[Second World War]] met a sufficiently high standard.  

NATA is a private [[not-for-profit]] company, governed by a Board that has representation from its members, and from industry, government and professional bodies.

In 1988, NATA's role as an accreditation body was recognised by the [[Australian Government]] in a [[Memorandum of Understanding]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/11-regulating-access-genetic-testing/laboratory-accreditation#_ftn4/|title=Regulating Access to Genetic Testing-Laboratory accreditation |publisher= Australian Law Reform Commission |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was renewed in 2014.

Its head office is situated in [[Rhodes, New South Wales]] and it has offices in four other capital cities of Australia. It employs 180 staff and over three thousand volunteer technical experts who assist NATA in the assessment of facilities and on its various technical committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nata.com.au/nata/about-nata/  |title=About NATA |publisher= National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
NATA provides accreditation services to inspection bodies and producers of certified reference materials. It offers both "traditional" testing programs and "specialised" programs in areas such as medical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/genomics/policy/nata/en/|title=Quality and Safety in Genetic Testing: An Emerging Concern |publisher= World Health Organization |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and veterinary testing, [[forensic science]], [[medical imaging]], reference material production and proficiency testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nata.com.au/nata/accreditation-info/types-of-accreditation/ |title=Types of Accreditation |publisher= National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATA monitors members' compliance with the [[OECD]] Principles of [[Good Laboratory Practice]] (GLP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trilab.com.au/about-trilab/nata-accreditation/ |title=NATA Accreditation |publisher= Trilab Laboratory |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
NATA formally recognises whether facilities produce reliable technical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.attar.com.au/ckfinder/userfiles/files/What%20NATA%20Accreditation%20Means.pdf |title=What is NATA Accreditation to ISO 17025 and What Does It Mean? |publisher= Advanced Technology Testing and Research |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International activities==
NATA represents Australia in a number of high-level International fora related to laboratory, inspection body, reference material producer and proficiency testing service provider accreditation practices and policies.

NATA represents Australia through:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6700">'''Negative option billing''' is a [[business]] practice in which customers are given goods or services that were not previously provided, and must either continue to pay for the service or specifically decline it in advance of billing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/1996_TXT/da961237.txt FCC Memorandum opinion and order, 1996] "Negative option billing is the practice of giving customers a service that was not previously provided and then charging them for the service unless they specifically decline it."&lt;/ref&gt;

This is, for example, the model on which [[mail order]] services, such as [[Columbia House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiahouse.com/howitworks |title=Columbia House – How It Works |publisher=Columbiahouse.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11 | quote = If you want the Director's Selection, just sit back and relax – we'll send it to you automatically }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Book sales club|book clubs]] are structured.

==US law==
According to the [[Federal Trade Commission]], unsolicited goods are considered a gift, and the recipient is not required to pay for or return them.&lt;ref name="ftc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Unordered Merchandise |url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0181-unordered-merchandise |website=Consumer Information |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en |date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Service |first1=United States Postal |title=Unsolicited Merchandise |url=http://about.usps.com/publications/pub300a/pub300a_tech_021.htm |website=about.usps.com |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is different to situations where a customer signs up for a service or club without reading [[fine print]] and agrees to purchase goods through the mail.&lt;ref name=ftc/&gt;&lt;ref name="ftc2"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Buying Plans Work |url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0068-how-buying-plans-work |website=Consumer Information |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en |date=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable example is the class-action lawsuit against [[Scholastic Corporation]] by consumers who felt "harassed, deceived, intimidated, and threatened" when they tried to cancel membership.&lt;ref name=prnewswire2006&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-30-2006/0004270838&amp;EDATE= "Parents Sue Educational Publisher Scholastic Alleging Misleading Billing, Marketing Scheme"], PW Newswire, 2006-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian law==
In [[Canada]], [[Canadian parliament|Parliament]] attempted to outlaw the practice in 1996 after a public outcry the previous year when most [[cable television]] companies added a package of new [[specialty service]]s to their lineups in this manner. This had previously been the standard manner of adding new channels to cable television service, but had not previously attracted the type of controversy that was raised by the 1995 channel launch, in part because the 1995 launch entailed a large number of channels which launched concurrently, whereas previous additions had only involved one or two channels at a time.

MP [[Roger Gallaway]] introduced a private-member's bill in 1996 to ban the practice which passed first reading, but died on the order paper when the House was dissolved for the 1997 elections. It was raised again in 1999, and was passed. Michael Janigan of the [[Public Interest Advocacy Centre]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concern associated with the practice of negative option billing has its origins in the nature of a [[contract]] of purchase and sale, as recognized in [[common law]]. As every first year law student learns, such a contract consists of [[offer and acceptance|an offer and an acceptance]]. The history of consumer protection [[statute]]s is a chronicle of legislators attempting to ensure that the offer is conveyed without misrepresentation by the vendor to a purchaser who has an opportunity to make an informed choice to accept or refuse the offer. This is because a contract that is made with a consumer who is unaware of key elements of the contract such as price, quantity and quality of the goods to be delivered is subversive of the efficiency of the market as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piac.ca/financial/negative_option_marketing/ Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PAIC) notes on Bill C-276]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ontario government]] also outlawed the practice in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_02c30_e.htm Ontario Consumer Protection Act, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario's regulations prohibiting negative option billing do not protect consumers from owing for goods or services that they have agreed to receive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.on.ca/mgs/en/ConsProt/STEL02_045943.html Ontario Ministry of Government and Consumer Services]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Alberta has outlawed negative billing in 1998.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Trading Act|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/F02.pdf|website=Queens Printers|publisher=Queens Printers|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK law==
In the UK the law which applies is ''The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000'' (2000 No. 2334),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/2334/contents/made |title=The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 |publisher=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ |date=2000 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically section 24 ''Inertia Selling''. (This effectively replaces the repealed s.1 of the ''Unsolicited Goods and Services Act'' (1971, as amended).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/30/contents |title=Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=1971 |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In summary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(2) The recipient [of unsolicited goods] may, as between himself and the sender, use, deal with or dispose of the goods as if they were an unconditional gift to him.

(3) The rights of the sender to the goods are extinguished.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55780">{{Network neutrality}}
'''Net bias''' (or network bias) is the counter-principle to [[net neutrality]], which indicates differentiation or discrimination of price and the quality of content or applications on the Internet by [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s. Similar terms include '''data discrimination''' and [[network management]].

Net bias occurs when an ISP drops packets or denies access based on artificially induced conditions such as simulating congestion or blocking packets, despite the fact that ample capacity exists to carry traffic. Examples (models) of net bias include [[tiered service]] (specialized service), metering, [[bandwidth throttling]], and [[Block (Internet)|port blocking]]. These forms of net bias are achieved by technical advancements of the [[Internet Protocol]]. 

The idea of net bias can arise from [[politics|political]] and [[economy|economic]] motivations and backgrounds, which create some concerns regarding [[data discrimination]] arising from political and economic interests. Non-discrimination means that one class of Internet customers may not be favored over another. According to this view, the  Internet should continue "to operate in a nondiscriminatory manner, both in terms of how subscribers access and receive Internet transmitted services and how content and other service providers reach subscribers."&lt;ref name=Frieden /&gt; Every internet user should have equal upload and download capabilities on every network.&lt;ref name=Frieden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bagwell&gt;{{cite web|last=Bagwell|first=Dana|title=A First Amendment Case For Internet Broadband Network Neutrality|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=8 Feb 2011|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/cgi-bin/redirect?url=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl%3furl_ver=Z39.88-2004%26res_dat=xri:pqdiss%26rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation%26rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:3421533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Net neutrality==
{{main|Net neutrality}}
The principle of equal treatment of traffic, called "Net Neutrality" by proponents, is not enshrined in law in the United States but is supported by some regulations. Most of the debate around the issue has centered on tentative plans, now postponed, by large Internet carriers to offer preferential treatment of traffic from certain content providers for a fee.&lt;ref name=ComcastBlocks&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/19/AR2007101900842.html |title=Comcast Blocks Some Internet Traffic |date=2010-10-19 |publisher=The Washington Post | accessdate=2011-08-02 |first=Peter |last=Svensson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network neutrality is a set of rules that forbid network owners from discriminating against independent applications (instead of against competing ISPs, as with open access).&lt;ref name=Bagwell/&gt;  

== Models of net bias ==
=== Tiered service (specialized service, bandwidth partitioning) ===
[[Tiered service]] is one of the strategies employed to change Internet [[pricing]] and involves an intent to have flexibility in [[quality of service]] (QoS) on the Internet. Tiered service allows ISPs to create and manage speed-related subscriber tiers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|title=The problem: Managing and Profiting from the Growth of Data Traffic|url=http://servicetiers.openet.com/the-problem.html|publisher=OPENET|accessdate=22 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130131025902/http://servicetiers.openet.com/the-problem.html|archivedate=31 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this model partitions bandwidth and provides different levels of peering requirements and offers transit clients different amounts of [[throughput]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frieden|first=Robert|title=Network Neutrality or Bias?--Handicapping the Odds for a Tiered and Branded Internet|journal=bepress Legal Series|year=2006|series=Working Paper 1755|url=http://law.bepress.com/expresso/eps/1755}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model stems from the perception of technical and economic limitations in the [[broadband]] industry. As technology develops, the demand for faster and higher performance of [[communication network]]s and the customer demand for bandwidth-intensive services, such as [[streaming video]]s, have increased.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=R. S.|author2=Wu, T.|title=Subsidizing Creativity through Network Design: Zero-Pricing and Net Neutrality|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|year=2009|volume=23|issue=3|pages=61–67|doi=10.1257/jep.23.3.61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=G. H.|title=Network Neutrality Regulation in the Broadband Market in Korea|journal=Korea Information Society Development Institute|year=2007|volume=14|pages=41–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; These situations result in [[network congestion]] that is mainly driven by a small number of heavy users.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krämer|first=J.|author2=Wiewiorra, L.|title=Network Neutrality and Congestion Sensitive Content providers: Implications for Service Innovation, Broadband Investment and Regulation|year=2010|series=SSRN Working Paper 1444423|ssrn=1444423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoo|first=Christopher S.|title=Network Neutrality and the Economics of Congestion|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|date=August 2006|volume=94|issue=6|pages=18–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, ISPs argue that existing [[Flat rate|flat-rate]] plans do not enable them to cover the additional cost required to manage heavier network traffic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=J.|author2=Kim, B.|title=Net Neutrality and Investment Incentives|year=2008|series=NET Institute Working Paper 08-03|ssrn=1285639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, this model may allow ISPs to reach different market segments with different data plans, targeting the different types of needs based on speed tiers, volume [[data cap]]s, and other customizable conditions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|title=The Solution: Flexibly package and sell data plans, and better match revenues with network utilization|url=http://servicetiers.openet.com/the-solution.html|publisher=OPENET|accessdate=22 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130201901/http://servicetiers.openet.com/the-solution.html|archivedate=30 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metering ===
Metered service (also called pay-per-use) is another strategy utilized to change Internet pricing other than tiered service. This model represents a usage-based pricing scheme that charges users based on their [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] usages.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=J.|author2=Lee, D. |author3=Lee, K. |title=Internet Pricing and Network Neutrality: How Internet  Pricing Schemes Affect the Incentives of Internet Service Providers|journal=International Telecommunications Policy Review|year=2010|volume=18|issue=1|pages=17–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metered service contrasts with the model of paying a [[Flat rate|flat fee]] on a recurring basis to have unlimited access to a given good or service.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This metering scheme not only satisfies ISPs in terms of recovering cost, but also enables users to rethink their usage patterns with a price signal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; This pricing plan can benefit low-volume users because metered service might create new and possibly lower price points for those users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=metered services (pay-per-use)|url=http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/metered-services|publisher=SearchCIO|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, research shows that price is the most important factor for users, among other factors such as Internet speed, which indicates that broadband users are price-sensitive. Price-sensitivity explains why few consumers like having to think about how much they are using the Internet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nam|first=C.|author2=Lee, H. |author3=Kim, S. |author4=Kim, T. |title=Network Neutrality Debate: an End User’s Perspective|journal=International Telecommunications Policy Review|year=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from the users’ perspective, one study suggested that consumers might have far less tolerance for unsolicited advertising, [[Spam (e-mail)|spam emails]], [[banner advertising]], and third party users of throughput when they are required to consider the cost for the amount of traffic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; However, from the ISPs’ perspective, one study indicates that a usage-based pricing scheme does not cause ISPs’ discrimination incentives against [[content provider]]s because ISPs are able to gain sufficient profits for the network investment to meet market needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

===Bandwidth throttling===
[[Bandwidth throttling]] is a tactic that allows information and telecommunication companies to regulate network traffic and control [[network congestion]]. This type of measure is viewed as a limitation on users’ upload and download speeds (rates) of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kellex|title=As of Yesterday Verizon Started Throttling its Top 5% Data Hogs, Doesn’t Affect 4G LTE or Tiered Data Customers|url=http://www.droid-life.com/2011/09/16/as-of-yesterday-verizon-started-throttling-its-top-5-data-hogs-doesnt-affect-4g-lte-or-tiered-data-customers/|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=DroidLife|date=Sep 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comcast]], one of the major ISPs, conducted bandwidth throttling on 49% of its customers who were using bandwidth for [[P2P file sharing]]. After Comcast’s actions were exposed, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ordered the company to stop throttling on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walters|first=Ray|title=BitTorrent throttlilng report reveals Comcast is keeping its word|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/news/bittorrent-throttling-report-reveals-comcast-is-keeping-its-word-20111021/|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Geek.com|date=Oct 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, this form of net bias frequently targets heavy mobile users who consume large amounts of content (packets), like unlimited data plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bonnington|first=Christina|title=AT&amp;T Adjusts Data-Throttling Policy in Response to Customer Complaints|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/03/att-throttling-adjustment/|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=wired.com|date=Mar 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile companies such as [[AT&amp;T]] and [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] have their own throttling policy because they are sometimes required to limit users’ traffic to maintain the quality of the entire network. Recently, however, throttling has become a controversial issue because some companies infringe upon this policy. For example, AT&amp;T had to pay US$850 to one customer to compensate for slowing down data speeds because they violated the terms of unlimited [[smartphone]] data contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Skelton|first=Alissa|title=AT&amp;T Loses Throttling Case, Pays $935 to Customer|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/17/att-loses-throttling-suit/|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Mashable Tech|date=Mar 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fitchard|first=Kevin|title=AT&amp;T vs. the consumer: The throttling controversy grows|url=http://gigaom.com/mobile/att-vs-the-consumer-the-throttling-controversy-grows/|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=gigaom|date=Mar 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these complaints from smartphone subscribers, AT&amp;T announced that they would change their policy for unlimited data users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Svensson|first=Peter|title=AT&amp;T Data Throttling: Carrier Clarifies Policy Of Slowing Speeds For 'Unlimited' Subscribers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/01/att-data-throttling-unlimited_n_1314046.html|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=HUFFPOST Tech|date=Mar 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blocking (port blocking) ===
[[Block (Internet)|Port blocking]] includes the deliberate decision by ISPs to deny onward transmission of traffic, or delivery of traffic, to an intended recipient. ISPs do not have a legitimate reason to deny onward packet transmission to specific customers of other ISPs. The ISPs have contractually committed to carry any and all packets from the former ISP without regard for the identity and marketplace success of that ISP’s customers (on a first-come, first-served basis).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; However, an ISP is more likely to have higher incentives for port blocking when the ISP is vertically and horizontally integrated because those integrated companies attempt to enhance the marketplace attractiveness of [[Affiliated company|corporate affiliates]]. For example, AT&amp;T blocked [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) because the company was concerned that the VoIP service might threaten its wireless and wired [[Telephone company|telephony service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley|first=Tony|title=AT&amp;T and Apple Admit Deal to Block VoIP on iPhone|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/170661/atandt_and_apple_admit_deal_to_block_voip_on_iphone.html|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=PCworld|date=Aug 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vahey|first=Moira|title=FCC Actions Pushed AT&amp;T to Stop VoIP Blocking|url=http://www.freepress.net/node/73305|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=FreePress|date=Oct 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an ISP can engage in port blocking for VoIP traffic when giving preference to an affiliated telephone company.

== Technical component for net bias ==
Technological advancements allowed these types of net bias to function, while the technology was not fully matured enough to apply new pricing or QoS schemes in the past.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|last=Krim|first=Jonathan|title=Executive Wants to Charge for Web Speed|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/30/AR2005113002109.html|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=Dec 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, as network technologies develop, ISPs implemented technological innovations that can prioritize packets and meter them when faced with increasing bandwidth requirements, using systems to distinguish properties of data packets. [[Packet analyzer|Packet analysis]] enables ISPs to monitor the [[Internet traffic]], and can be performed by a computer program or hardware component that intercepts and logs traffic passing over a digital network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connolly|first=Kevin|title=Law of Internet Security and Privacy|year=2003|publisher=Aspen Publishers|isbn=978-0-7355-4273-0|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many technologies for network management such as [[SNMP]] or [[NETCONF]].

== Motivations==
The idea of network flexibility in pricing, service provisioning, and QoS tends to be based on economic and political considerations. These considerations show that net bias (network flexibility) makes economic sense and may not violate a reasonable expectation of [[net neutrality]].

=== Economic motivations ===
ISPs have been increasingly investing in the infrastructure necessary to transport the bits and packets that correspond to commercially successful content and services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; As the [[Internet]] becomes more capable of covering most converged services, and those services require wide bandwidth, high QoS guarantees, and time-sensitivity, ISPs must make substantial investments to the network.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Madden|first=Mary|title=The Audience for Online Video-Sharing Sites Shoots Up.|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2009/13--The-Audience-for-Online-VideoSharing-Sites-Shoots-Up/3-Mobile-and-TV-Viewing/Americans-who-have-cut-back-on-expenses-are-more-likely-to-watch-online-video-on-their-televisions.aspx|publisher=Pew  Internet &amp; American Life Project|accessdate=23 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713060708/http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2009/13--The-Audience-for-Online-VideoSharing-Sites-Shoots-Up/3-Mobile-and-TV-Viewing/Americans-who-have-cut-back-on-expenses-are-more-likely-to-watch-online-video-on-their-televisions.aspx|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, at the early stage of the Internet’s appearance, ISPs were able to concentrate on “connectivity” over “cost” because the government supported the development of the Internet. However, as this support has been removed and ISPs have sought to recoup their investment, cost recovery has become substantially more important to ISPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leiner|first=Barry|title=Brief History of the Internet|url=http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/internet-51/history-internet/brief-history-internet|publisher=Internet society 20 years|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[incumbent carrier]]s like AT&amp;T, whose business involves both the Internet and telephony service, needed the new powerful source of revenue because traditional telephony became less profitable and its market share declined.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In this situation, the incumbent carriers recognize that the significant profits accrued by Internet content and application providers such as [[Google]] can bring carriers the new revenue streams they are seeking. Accordingly, some of the major ISPs believe that the best way to achieve their goals is through the partitioning of network bandwidth and the prioritizing of bitstreams by offering different QoS.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Likewise, some researchers argue that these strategies could work, emphasizing that ISPs should have unregulated pricing freedom, which may lead to promoted innovation, risk tasking, and diverse services and features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hazlett|first=Thomas|title=Neutering the net|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/392ad708-b837-11da-bfc5-0000779e2340.html#axzz1sov6yyRz|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=Mar 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Yoo pointed out that ISPs could offer undropped packets and timely packet delivery even under truly congested conditions when they have the option of offering a premium peak service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Professor Lawrence Lessig also indicates that consumer-tiering, which provides end users with different throughput speeds or permissible volume of traffic, could recoup infrastructure investments and create the necessary incentives for increased investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|title=TESTIMONY OF LAWRENCE LESSIG C.

=== Political motivations ===
As the FCC has perceived the need to create more incentives for incumbent carriers to invest in broadband, the commission has taken apart the access requirements and pricing model that force incumbent carriers to offer services at a low rate through the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In addition, the FCC has removed the traditional regulatory burdens for common carriers that provide Internet access and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appropriate Framework for Broadband Access to the Internet over Wireline Facilities|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-150A1.doc|publisher=FCC|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deregulatory initiatives have freed the carriers of having to share and interconnect facilities providing information services. Some proponents of net bias argue that ISPs do not have legal obligation to operate as [[common carrier]]s and that the network’s interconnection arrangements result from commercial necessity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Moreover, in terms of establishing the network’s interconnection, ISPs argue that they used their resources to maintain and upgrade the network for customers, and so far popular websites have received a “free ride” from these resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandyopadhyay|first=S.|author2=Guo, H. |author3=Cheng, H. |title=Subsidizing Creativity through Network Design: Zero-Pricing and Net Neutrality|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|year=2009|volume=23|issue=3|pages=61–67|ssrn=1422061|doi=10.1257/jep.23.3.61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waldmeir|first=Patti|title=The Net Neutrality Dogfight that is Shaking Up Cyberspace|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/76d85cb6-ba11-11da-9d02-0000779e2340,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F76d85cb6-ba11-11da-9d02-0000779e2340.html&amp;_i_referer=#axzz1sov6yyRz|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=Mar 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of net bias also propose lawful [[pricing]]. Network flexibility for pricing, interconnection, and QoS characterize the initiatives as lawful [[price discrimination]] that can provide consumers with greater flexibility and potentially lower bills for low-volume users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sidak|first=Gregory|title=Testimony of J.

===Internet censorship===
{{main|Internet censorship}}
The concept of [[freedom of information]] has emerged in response to state sponsored monitoring, surveillance, and censorship of the [[Internet]]. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of publishing or accessing information on the [[Internet]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Data discrimination may also occur on a national level to [[Censorship|censor]] political, 'immoral' or religious Internet content.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

For example, [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opennetinitiative.net/studies/china/ONI_China_Country_Study.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227034922/http://www.opennetinitiative.net/studies/china/ONI_China_Country_Study.pdf|date=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opennetinitiative.net/studies/saudi/ONI_Saudi_Arabia_Country_Study.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228013402/http://www.opennetinitiative.net/studies/saudi/ONI_Saudi_Arabia_Country_Study.pdf|date=February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; both filter content on the Internet, preventing access to certain types of websites. [[Singapore]] has network blocks on more than 100 sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opennetinitiative.net/studies/singapore/#toc2a |title=Internet Filtering in Singapore in 2004-2005: A Country Study |date=August 2005 |publisher=OpenNet Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[UK|Britain]], telecommunication companies block access to websites that depict  [[child pornography|sexually explicit images of children]]. In the [[United Arab Emirates]] {{as of|2006|lc=y}}, [[Skype]] was being blocked. &lt;!-- is it still? ---&gt; In [[Norway]], some ISPs use a voluntary filter to censor websites that the police (Kripos) believe to contain images of abuse of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2006/10/26/uknof5-richard-clayton-content-filtering/ |title=UKNOF5: Richard Clayton - Content Filtering |last=Charman |first=Suw |date=2006-10-26 |publisher=Open Rights Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]] also blocks foreign sites for copyright and other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet Censorship in Germany |url=http://odem.org/informationsfreiheit/en/presse.html |publisher=Online-Demonstrations-Plattform |date=April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., public institutions (e.g. libraries and schools), by law, block material that is related to the exploitation of children, and 'obscene and pornographic' material, unless they do not receive funding. The network filters also block sites and material relating to women’s health, gay and lesbian rights groups, and sexual
education for teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deibert.citizenlab.org/Circ_guide.pdf |accessdate=November 28, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029085950/http://deibert.citizenlab.org/Circ_guide.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifea.net/cipa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns regarding discrimination ==
The Internet has been historically regarded as an open and “best effort” network. Internet routers must forward packets on a first-come, first-served basis without regard for the analysis of data or content inside the packet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This aspect of the Internet has increased its value, contributing not only to the quality of our lives, but also to economic growth around the globe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Based on these notions, forms of net bias have created some concerns regarding discrimination from economic and political perspectives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; In other words, unreasonable net bias occurs when an ISP conducts a discrimination strategy against a specific type of packet without a reasonable and fair financial or operational justification.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== Concerns about economic discrimination ===
Users enjoy the high level of value when they are able to access the Internet on an unmetered and [[Flat rate|flat-rate]] basis.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Users can also obtain attractive content subsidized by advertisers who employ the flat-rate subscription option by adding to the downloaded packet payload.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; This value proposition provides users with the benefits of the Internet, emphasizing connectivity with less regard for cost-related concerns. Likewise, the positive [[network effect]] — which refers to the process whereby more and more people adopt a service or buy a good, and as a result users receive enjoyable benefits and additional users are attracted to the Internet — created by the spread of the Internet is substantially beneficial.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;{{cite book|last=Crandall|first=R.|title=Broadband communications|year=2005|publisher=Handbook of Telecommunications Economics|pages=156–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Internet, interlinking hundreds and thousands of networks reduces [[transaction cost]]s and brings a flood of free information to subscribers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt; However, if major ISPs can freely block and degrade specific traffic streams, there would be societal losses as the Internet becomes more expensive and less productive. Proponents of net bias contend that market-based Internet access achieves efficient outcomes, such as creating innovation incentives for ISPs to invest in building and expanding networks. Nevertheless, opponents of net bias claim that allowing price and service discrimination may ruin the value of the Internet and enable ISPs to shut out competitors or other stakeholders who are unwilling or unable to pay surcharges.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In other words, when large or powerful ISPs place a disproportionate financial burden on small and less financially sound ISPs and their subscribers by using forms of net bias like [[Block (Internet)|port blocking]] or [[tiered service]]s, they may exacerbate the [[digital divide]] that separates people with easy and robust Internet service access opportunities from those without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGULATORY REFORM AS A TOOL FOR BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/40/11/34487084.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One consumer group, [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], calls attention to a number of disadvantages that specialized services ([[tiered service]]s) may produce. This organization argues that any form of prioritization on the open Internet would bring enormous disadvantages in terms of innovation, competition, investment, consumer choice, and [[free speech]] because this permission may enable ISPs to choose specific content/applications with respect to their own interests and thereby destroy the nature and value of the today’s open Internet. Free Press cautions that specialized services will result in unbalanced and unparalleled economic growth, which is utterly against the public interest.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|last=Free Press|title=Comments of Free Press Regarding Further Inquiry|url=http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7020916539|publisher=FCC|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viewpoint of Pro-discrimination advocates====
While a broad presumption pertaining to data discrimination is perceived censorship, those in favor of this practice claim that there are benefits.  The ISPs are a business, and as such, “…correctly state that external, non-market driven constraints on their ability to price discriminate can adversely impact their incentive to invest in broadband infrastructure and their ability to recoup that investment.”&lt;ref name="Frieden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frieden|first=R|title=A Primer on Network Neutrality|journal=[[Intereconomics]]|year=2008|issue=43|pages=4–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are times when it could make sense, in the eyes of the ISPs, to give preference to one type of content over another.  For example, loading a plain text and image website is not nearly as strenuous as loading sites such as Hulu and YouTube.  Frieden states that “Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seek to diversify the Internet by prioritizing bitstreams and by offering different quality of service guarantees. To some observers, this strategy constitutes harmful discrimination that violates a tradition of network neutrality in the switching, routing, and transmission of Internet traffic.”&lt;ref name="Frieden" /&gt; While the QoS argument is that network neutrality rules make allowances for network owners to practice some types of discrimination to protect the functioning of the network.&lt;ref name="Bagwell" /&gt;

====Argument Against Data Discrimination====
Those  who oppose data discrimination say that it hurts the growth of the Internet, as well as the economy that is rooted in the depths of the Internet model.  “Instead of promoting competition, such picking of winners and losers will stifle the investment needed to perpetuate the Internet's phenomenal growth, hurting the economy.“&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;
If, for example, telecommunication network operators blocked data 
packets of Voice-over-IP services that might substitute their own telephone services, this would not only discriminate against specific firms but also reduce competition and economic welfare. Technically, this would not be a problem. Although data packets are homogeneous with respect to switching and transmission treatment, type, source, and destination can be revealed and data packets be handled differently if a network operator prefers to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kruse|first=Jorn|title=Network Neutrality and Quality of Service|journal=Intereconomics|date=Jan–Feb 2008|pages=25–30|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1436400881&amp;sid=6&amp;Fmt=6&amp;clientId=3552&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD|accessdate=8 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another problem is that the type of data that is given preferential treatment is up to the discretion of the ISP.  This allows them to move data as they see fit, whether it be through a political, moral, any other such kind of "lens".  This goes against the first amendment, the freedom of speech because by stopping certain kinds of information from reaching the end user, they are censoring content.  It is not the place of the ISP to censor content from the people.

The real threat to an open Internet is at the local network (the ends), where network owners can block information coming in from the inter-network, but it also is at the local network where the most harm can occur. Because of this, network neutrality rules allow some discrimination by the local network to protect itself, though it may not be based on content or type of application. For example, network owners want to protect their networks from being damaged. So, some discrimination is allowed to "prevent physical harm to the local Broadband Network caused by any network attachment or network usage." This means that local network operators may not control which types of applications users choose to employ, what type of devices users use to access the network, or which type of legal content users choose to convey or consume. The only allowable restrictions are on applications that cause harm to the local network.&lt;ref name="Bagwell" /&gt;

Proponents of network neutrality concede that network security is crucial enough to warrant making an exception to a network neutrality rule. Allowing network providers to deviate from neutrality only to the extent necessary to protect network trustworthiness is rooted in judicial and regulatory decisions and administrative rules that helped establish the principle of nondiscrimination as the core of network neutrality.&lt;ref name="Burstein"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burstein|first=Aaron|title=Trustworthiness as a Limitation on Network Neutrality|year=2009|publisher=Federal Communications Law Journal|pages=591–623|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=2&amp;did=1851638901&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=6&amp;Fmt=6&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1297224793&amp;clientId=3552}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sen. Al Franken has spoken out on FCC rulings “calling net neutrality the 'free speech issue of our time,'” Franken (D-MN) expressed his displeasure with the FCC’s recent net neutrality rules. ‘These rules are not strong enough,' he said, pointing out that paid prioritization was not banned and that wireless networks are allowed to discriminate at will. The rules mark the ‘first time the FCC has ever allowed discrimination on the Internet’ and they ‘will create essentially two Internets.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Nate|title=Comcast Is Trying To Whack Netflix: Sen Al Franken.|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/01/comcast-is-trying-to-whack-netflix-sen-al-franken/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=8 Feb 2011|date=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important concept for marketers to understand is that of disparate impact. If a discrimination case is brought against your company, the plaintiff would have to show evidence of disparate impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madmarketer.com/topics/digital/articles/419740-data-discrimination-dark-side-big-data.htm|title=Data Discrimination: The Dark Side of Big Data|website=www.madmarketer.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns about political discrimination ===
In 2005, the FCC issued a Broadband Policy Statement (also known as the Internet Policy Statement) that offered guidance and insight into its approach to the Internet and broadband consistent with Congress’ direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Statement|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf|publisher=FCC|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (FCC) The four principles of this statement are as follows:

:*To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice.

:*To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement.

:*To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network.

:*To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers.

At first glance, these principles appear noncontroversial in terms of standards regarding the freedom of the network. However, these principles do not address regulations with respect to the issues of differentiations in pricing, interconnection, and QoS.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; Further, the unregulated forms of net bias have the potential to create false congestion by the ISPs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; More specifically, advanced Internet protocol technology can allow ISPs to fabricate congestion and drop packets when no real congestion takes place. In addition, existing peering and transit agreements between stakeholders such as small and large ISPs may lack a specific prohibition of deliberate packet loss.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Many ISPs contend that major content providers such as [[Google]] or [[Yahoo!]] enjoy a [[Free rider problem|free ride]]. [[AT&amp;T]], one of the major ISPs, stated that the current standard procedure for Internet pricing and interconnection has left the company burdened with having to create, maintain, and frequently upgrade an expensive bit transport infrastructure whereas content providers do not have to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At SBC, It's All About "Scale and Scope"|url=http://www.freepress.net/news/14959|publisher=Free Press|accessdate=23 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314003726/http://www.freepress.net/news/14959|archivedate=14 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rob Frieden points out that the ISPs’ practices of net bias, as they are based on a “free rider” consideration, may violate the principles of network freedom or even the peering and transit agreement between ISPs. Based on existing peering and transit agreements made by AT&amp;T, Google is allowed to have its traffic delivered to AT&amp;T subscribers free of charge, and AT&amp;T is compensated for the traffic from other ISPs by the agreements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; Moreover, if AT&amp;T penalizes Google’s traffic from the various forms of net bias, it would jeopardize the principles of network freedom as well as violate its contractual commitment to its peers and transit customers who have paid for best efforts access to AT&amp;T’s networks.

Technical and market convergence as well as deregulation by the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] provided incentives for companies to integrate vertically and horizontally. As a result, those integrated companies have discrimination incentives such that they may try port blocking or unfair throttling to enhance the marketplace attractiveness of corporate affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guo|first=H.|author2=Bandyopadhyay, S. |author3=Cheng, H.K. |author4=Yang, Y. |title=Net Neutrality and Vertical Integration of Content and Broadband Services|year=2009|series=Warrington College of Business Administration Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, Free Press emphasized through its comments to the FCC Notice of Inquiry that specialized services should be provided with fairness, particularly in the vertically integrated environments of the information and telecommunication industry (e.g., Comcast, which has both content and broadband services).&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Consequently, concerns regarding discrimination raised the need of network neutrality regulations to preserve the open Internet and public interest and enable the Internet industry to survive and succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shrimali|first=G.|title=Surplus extraction by network providers: Implications for net neutrality and innovation|journal=Telecommunications Policy|year=2008|volume=32|issue=8|pages=545–558|doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2008.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knieps|first=G.|title=Market Driven Network Neutrality and the Fallacies of Internet Traffic Quality Regulation|journal= International Telecommunications Policy Review|year=2011|volume=18|issue=3|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The FCC and Data Discrimination==
In the United States, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] does not permit data discrimination except for "reasonable traffic management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22560491/|title=FCC to probe Comcast data discrimination|first=Peter |last=Svensson|date=Jan 2008|publisher=msnbc|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Communication Commission defines reasonable traffic management as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A network management practice is reasonable if it is appropriate and tailored to achieving a legitimate network management purpose, taking into account the particular network architecture and technology of the broadband Internet access service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db1223/FCC-10-201A1.pdf|title=In the Matter of Preserving the Open Internet Broadband Industry Practices|page=48|author=Federal Communications Commission|date=December 23, 2010|accessdate=2011-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218175730/http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db1223/FCC-10-201A1.pdf|archivedate=February 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is considered unreasonable for internet service providers to manage traffic by blocking applications or assigning quality of service based on source, destination, or unreasonable application provider payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sjordan/papers/tprc09.pdf |title=How to determine whether a traffic management practice is reasonable |first=Jordan |last=Scott |date=September 2009 |publisher=TPRC |accessdate=2011-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61oEh9jrs?url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sjordan/papers/tprc09.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, there are currently no laws prohibiting internet service providers from offering different service plans that may restrict consumers' access to selected material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/29489974/Full-Text-Comcast-vs-FCC-Federal-Court-Ruling|title=Full Text Comcast vs FCC Federal Court Ruling|date=April 2010|accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) published ''Broadband Connectivity Competition Policy'' which suggested that it may be beneficial to consumers if [[broadband]] providers would pursue a variety of business arrangements, including data prioritization, exclusive deals, and vertical integration into online content and applications. The report also suggests that government should move cautiously in implementing any changes to current regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plunkett’s Telecommunications Industry Almanac 2009 |last= Plunkett|first=Jack W. |year=2008 |publisher= Plunkett Research|location= |isbn=978-1-59392-141-5 |page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PUiN5cE7-QC&amp;dq=%22data+prioritization%22+network+neutrality&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FCC Appeals===
* Verizon Communications filed an appeal against the FCC in the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on January 20, 2011. The FCC's rules aim to prevent Internet service providers from blocking certain websites or applications. Verizon's appeal claims that the FCC has overstepped its authority and that the rules violate the company's constitutional rights. The company says that the net neutrality rules modify the terms of existing licenses held by Verizon. Rather than launching a lawsuit that directly challenges the regulations, the company is appealing the rules as an illegal change to their existing licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/01/verizons-net-neutrality-challenge-claims-it-violates-their-licenses.php |title=Verizon's Net Neutrality Challenge Claims It Violates Their Licenses |date=2011-01-21 |publisher=TalkingPointsMemo.com | accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**“It has been a very long and drawn out fight, and it has certainly distracted the FCC for the last year. It has distracted the carriers as well, who have spent a lot of time, effort and money in terms of publicly fighting about it and privately fighting about it," says Larry Downes an industry consultant and author..."It is very, very unlikely that AT&amp;T will file suit," said Downes. "They've said publicly and repeatedly that they are comfortable with the net neutrality order and I take that as a pretty strong indication that they are not going to litigate it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus|first=Stephanie|title=AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile Unlikely To Challenge Net Neutrality.|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/01/att-sprint-t-mobile-unlikely-to-challenge-net-neutrality.php|publisher=TalkingPointsMemo.com|accessdate=9 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence of Anti-competitiveness===
During a hearing held by Rep. Greg Walden, one of the speakers put forth a question that needs to be addressed by the FCC, as well as other groups that are in support of Net Neutrality.  The speaker said, "If the mere threat of Internet discrimination is such a concern and if the FCC has done no analysis to demonstrate why one company has more market power than another, why would discrimination by companies like Google or Skype be any more acceptable than discrimination by companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast?"&lt;ref name="Transcript"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walden|first=Greg|title=REP. GREG WALDEN HOLDS A HEARING ON NETWORK NEUTRALITY/INTERNET REGULATION.|journal=Political Transcript Wire|year=February 2011|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the same hearing, a different member spoke up and quoted Section 230 of the Communications Act saying, "...preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by federal or state regulations." essentially saying that there should be laws in place so that the government knows how to handle its authority over the FCC and ISPs.  He did not say that these laws are not laws meant for regulating what the FCC does, but how the FCC ''should'' act.&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;

In 2005, a small North Carolina telecom company, Madison River Communications, blocked their [[DSL]] customers from using the Vonage VoIP service. Service was restored after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) intervened and entered into a consent decree that had Madison River pay a fine of $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the FCC investigated allegations that Madison River violated nondiscriminatory obligations contained in the Communications Act, but the redefinition of broadband as an information service dramatically reduces the authority of regulators to deter this kind of competitive misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Network neutrality: Competition, innovation, and nondiscriminatory access : hearing before the Task Force on Telecom and Antitrust on of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, One Hundred Ninth Congress, second session|year=2006|publisher=Washington: U.S. G.P.O.|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju27225.000/hju27225_0.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Anti-Piracy
* “Network-level filtering means your Internet service provider – Comcast, AT&amp;T, EarthLink, or whoever you send that monthly check to – could soon start sniffing your digital packets, looking for material that infringes on someone’s copyright. “What we are already doing to address piracy hasn’t been working. There’s no secret there...""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Brad|title=att-and-other-isps-may-be-getting-ready-to-filter|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/att-and-other-isps-may-be-getting-ready-to-filter|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be one of the major reasons that ISPs want to be able to discriminate against certain data types.  Ever since the dawn of peer-to-peer file sharing, both the MPAA and the RIAA have been hounding ISPs to divulge any and all information relating to file sharing.  With the implementation of data discrimination, that file sharing data can be, and will be, thrown to the bottom of the pecking order.  This will render any kind of sharing, even the kind that isn't deemed illegal, useless because the transfer speeds will be unusably slow.
* Center of Digital Democracy (CDD) conducts a study which finds out several internet service providers (ISP) offer advertising companies specific packages for users personal information. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/38721-digital-redlining-how-internet-service-providers-promote-poverty|title=Digital Redlining: How Internet Service Providers Promote Poverty|last=Tveten|first=Julianne|website=Truthout|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue was resolved by correction of the software as well as a change in the network configuration used by Craig's List. Craig's List founder [[Craig Newmark]] stated that he believed the blocking was unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Silicon Valley Watcher|url=http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2006/06/craigslist_is_b.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Comcast Corp. actively interferes with attempts by some of its high-speed Internet subscribers to share files online, a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally. The interference, which The Associated Press confirmed through nationwide tests, is the most drastic example yet of data discrimination by a U.S. Internet service provider. It involves company computers masquerading as those of its users. Comcast's interference appears to be an aggressive way of managing its network to keep file-sharing traffic from swallowing too much bandwidth and affecting the Internet speeds of other subscribers.&lt;ref name=ComcastBlocks/&gt;
**If widely applied by other ISPs, the technology Comcast is using would be a crippling blow to the BitTorrent, eDonkey and Gnutella file-sharing networks. While these are mainly known as sources of copyright music, software and movies, BitTorrent in particular is emerging as a legitimate tool for quickly disseminating legal content.&lt;ref name=ComcastBlocks/&gt;

An '''orphan film''' is a [[motion picture]] work that has been abandoned by its owner or [[copyright]] holder; also, any film that has suffered neglect.

==History==
The exact origin of the term orphan film is unclear.  By the 1990s, however, film archivists were commonly using this colloquialism to refer to motion pictures abandoned by their owners.  Before the end of the decade, the phrase emerged as the governing metaphor for film preservation, first in the United States, then internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Lukow, "The Politics of Orphanage:  The Rise and Impact of the 'Orphan Film' Metaphor on Contemporary Preservation Practice", paper delivered at the University of South Carolina symposium, "Orphans of the Storm:  Saving Orphan Films in the Digital Age", September 23, 1999.  http://www.sc.edu/filmsymposium/archive/orphans2001/lukow.html .  As early as October 1950 ''Industrial Marketing'' magazine referred to 16mm industrial sales movies as orphan films.  Restoration expert Robert Gitt was quoted using the metaphor as early as 1992, to refer to silent-era films, newsreels, and kinescopes.  Robert Epstein, “Mining Hollywood's Old Movie Gold,”  ''Los Angeles Times'', July 16, 1992, p. F1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Historians and archivists define the term in both a narrow and a broad sense.  A report from the [[Librarian of Congress]], ''Film Preservation 1993,'' offered a first definition.  As a category of so-called [[orphan works]], orphan films are those “that lack either clear copyright holders or commercial potential” to pay for their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;''Film Preservation 1993: A Study of the Current State of American Film Preservation: Report of the Librarian Of Congress'',  by Annette Melville and Scott Simmon, Washington, DC: NFPB/LOC, 1993.  https://www.loc.gov/film/study.html&lt;/ref&gt;   However, a much wider group of works fall under the orphan rubric when the term is expanded to refer to all manner of films that have been neglected.  The neglect might be physical (a deteriorated film print), commercial (an unreleased movie), cultural (censored footage), historical (a forgotten World War I-era production) or technical (footage from television commercials and series or music videos).

This broader conception is typically illustrated by a list of orphaned genres.  In ''Redefining Film Preservation: A National Plan'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;''Redefining Film Preservation: A National Plan; Recommendations of the Librarian Of Congress in Consultation with the National Film Preservation Board'', coordinated by Annette Melville and Scott Simmon, Washington, DC: NFPB/LOC, 1994.  https://www.loc.gov/film/plan.html&lt;/ref&gt;  the Librarian of Congress enumerated newsreels, actuality footage, silent films, experimental works, home movies, independent fiction and documentary films, political commercials, amateur footage, along with advertising, educational and industrial films as culturally significant orphans.  To this the National Film Preservation Foundation adds animation, ethnic films, anthropological footage, and fragments.  (See [http://www.filmpreservation.org "What Are Orphan Films"].)

Within a decade the epithet was adopted by scholars and educators.  In ''The Film Experience:  An Introduction'' (2004), for example, Timothy Corrigan and Patricia White include a section on orphan films, defining them simply as "Any sort of films that have survived but have no commercial interests to pay the costs of their preservation."&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Corrigan and Patricia White, ''The Film Experience:  An Introduction'' (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2004), 391–98. They add to the list of orphaned genres government-produced films, citing ''What You Should Know about Biological Warfare'' (1952)  This film is viewable as a digital file at https://archive.org/details/WhatYouS1952  as part of the Prelinger Collection of “ephemeral films.”  Collector-activist [[Rick Prelinger]] is one of the people most responsible for raising awareness of orphan films.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in this way, more films are orphans than not.  Many are more accurately described as “footage,” recordings shot on celluloid but not intended to be completed works or theatrical releases.  The millions of feet of [[home movies]] and newsreel [[outtakes]] alone outnumber the quantity of film stock used to make all of the [[feature films]] ever released by Hollywood studios.

==Movement==
The resurgent interest in these films is due to their rich value as cultural and historical artifacts.  Documentarians, filmmakers, historians, curators, collectors and scholars have joined forces with archivists because they deem orphans not only historical documents, but also evidence of alternative, suppressed, minority or forgotten histories.

Since 1999, hundreds of these devotees have gathered for the biennial [http://www.nyu.edu/orphanfilm] Orphan Film Symposium]. 
In their introduction to the anthology ''Mining the Home Movie'' (2008) Karen Ishizuka and Patricia Zimmermann assess the impact of these symposiums.

{{Quote|In 1999, film historian Dan Streible and several other interdisciplinary faculty members at the University of South Carolina initiated a symposium on orphan films that drew together archivists, film historians, artists, curators, and other to discuss and screen works within a rigorous scholarly context. Orphan Film Symposium I was entitled “Orphans of the Storm: Saving Orphan Films in the Digital Age” and was held in September 1999. Orphan Film Symposium II, “Documenting the 20th Century,” was held in March 2001; Orphan Film Symposium III, “Sound/Music/Voice: Listening to Orphan Films,” in September 2002; and Orphan Film Symposium IV, “On Location: Place and Region in Forgotten Films,” in March 2004. These four symposia have functioned to generate new research and curatorial activities and have lent increased visibility to the orphan film cause. They have also provided a significant academic and curatorial context for amateur film research.

The Orphan Film symposia, together with an important presence for orphan, amateur, and small-gauge films within the Association of Moving Image Archivists throughout the 1990s and afterward, suggest the coalescing of various international and regional movements to look more closely at these subaltern cinemas.|&lt;ref&gt;Karen L. Ishizuka and Patricia R. Zimmermann, eds. ''Mining the Home Movie: Excavations in Histories and Memories'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the fifth Orphan Film Symposium ("Science, Industry &amp; Education") took place at the University of South Carolina (March 2006), [[New York University]] took up the project, incorporating it into the Department of Cinema Studies and its Moving Image Archiving and Preservation master's program at the [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. Orphans 6, 7, and 8 took place in New York City. The 2008 symposium focused on neglected films and videos by, about, against, and under "the state." The 2010 edition, "Moving Pictures Around the World," included speakers from 17 nations. In 2012, [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in Queens co-hosted the eighth symposium, "Made to Persuade". The ninth and tenth symposiums took place at major institutions outside of New York. [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] hosted Orphans 9 ("The Future of Obsolescence," 2014) in Amsterdam, attracting attendees from 30 nations. Orphans 10 ("Sound," 2016) convened at the Library of Congress [[Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation]] in Culpeper, Virginia.
 
In 2001, members of these academic-archival professions began referring to an “orphan film movement.”  As archivist-scholar Caroline Frick has written, some of the most active participants identify themselves as “orphanistas,” passionate advocates for saving, studying, and screening neglected cinema.  In 2004, visual anthropologist Emily Cohen wrote that the movement's creative and intellectual ferment constituted an “Orphanista Manifesto.”&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Frick, ''Restoration Nation:  Motion Picture Archives and 'American' Film Heritage'', PhD diss. University of Texas at Austin, 2005, [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2005/frickd15921/frickd15921.pdf UT Austin library PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604204547/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2005/frickd15921/frickd15921.pdf |date=2011-06-04 }}, and in Frick's ''Saving Cinema: The Politics of Preservation,'' (Oxford University Press, forthcoming); Emily Cohen, “The Orphanista Manifesto: Orphan Films and the Politics of Reproduction,” ''American Anthropologist'' (December 2004), 719–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rick Prelinger Howard Besser.orphanfilms.theora.ogv|thumb|right|440px|[[Rick Prelinger]] ([[Prelinger Archives]]) and [[Howard Besser]] (NYU professor of cinema studies) answer the questions "What is an orphan film?" and "What is the Orphan Film Symposium?"

More pragmatically, in the United States the group's rising influence affected discourse and policies about copyright reform, joining the broader media reform movement. Examples of this include the 2003 Supreme Court case ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' and the 2006 Copyright Office [http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/ ''Report on Orphan Works'']. In September 2008, the [[U.S. Senate]] passed a bill (S.2913) "to provide a limitation on judicial remedies in copyright infringement cases involving orphan works," but the House of Representatives adjourned before addressing the measure.

Although U.S. copyright stakeholders confine their discussion to the narrower definition of an orphan (a work with no identifiable rightsholder or whose rights holder cannot be located), the broader conception—an orphan film as a neglected object—continues to be used internationally. Film archivists working quite separately in different nations have used the orphan metaphor for a decade. At the Cinemateca de Cuba, for example, the term "huérfanos" has been used to conceptualize the lost and abandoned works of Cuban film history, its "orfandad."  The Nederlands Filmmuseum preserves and programs its "Bits &amp; Pieces" series of unidentified film fragments, its "foundlings." The China Film Archive in Beijing uses a translatable orphan film metaphor as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Streible, "The Role of Orphan Films in the 21st Century Archive," ''[[Cinema Journal]]'' 46.3 (Spring 2007): 124–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indication of the international interest in orphan films was filmmaker Martin Scorsese's announcement of a World Cinema Foundation (WCF) at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Press reports stated that the WCF would preserve "orphan" films. By 2008, however, the WCF's mission statement referred only to "neglected" films rather than orphans, as the foundation helps fund preservation of lesser known theatrical motion pictures, which remain under the legal ownership of some party. [http://www.worldcinemafoundation.org World Cinema Foundation] In 2013 the foundation proper was renamed the World Cinema Project, which is overseen by The Film Foundation Scorsese created in 1990.

In April 2008, the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF) endorsed a [http://www.fiafnet.org/uk/members/Fair%20Use.cfm "Declaration on Fair Use and Access"] which stated "FIAF supports efforts to clarify the legal status of 'orphan' motion pictures and related promotional and historical materials for the purpose of preservation and public access."  Shortly thereafter, on June 4, 2008, the European Union announced the signing of a new "Memorandum of Understanding" on orphan works. The EU's Digital Libraries Initiative produced the statement.  Signatories included key institutions in moving image archiving and representatives of rightsholders: Association Des Cinematheques Europeennes - [[Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques]], the [[British Library]], European Film Companies Alliance, [[Federation Europeenne Des Realisateurs De L'audiovisuel]], Federation Internationale Des Associations De Producteurs De Films, and the International Federation Of Film Distributors. See [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=4145 EU Press Release on Orphan Works.]. In 2010, the Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques carried out a survey among its members to assess the dimension of orphan films. According to this survey, more than 210,000 films preserved in Europe's Film Archives are considered orphan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ace-film.eu/?page_id=246&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2012, the EU adopted the Orphan Works [[Directive 2012/28/EU]] which legally allows the (online) use of orphan works across Europe, provided that a search for the rights holder has been carried before. 
Currently, the [[European Union]] is addressing copyright, access, and preservation issues via FORWARD, a three-year project (2013-2016) to create a registry of orphan films. Officially termed  "Framework for a EU-wide Audiovisual Orphan Works Registry," the project aims to create simplified process for determining the rights status of moving image works.

'''''Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India''''', 434 U.S. 308 (1978) decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in which the Court held that [[Sovereign state|foreign states]] are entitled to sue for [[treble damages]] in U.S. courts, and should be recognized as "[[Legal personality|persons]]" under the [[Clayton Act]].

==Facts==
In 1975, the [[government of India]], filed an [[antitrust]] suit against [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical firms]] [[Pfizer, Inc.]], [[American Cyanamid Company]], [[Bristol-Myers]] Company, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Squibb]] Corporation, [[Olin Corporation]] and [[The Upjohn Company]], alleging that these companies had conspired to [[Restraint of trade|restrain]] and [[Monopoly|monopolize]] interstate and foreign trade in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of broad spectrum [[antibiotics]]. The [[Imperial State of Iran]], the [[Republic of the Philippines]] and the [[Republic of Vietnam]] brought similar suits against one or more of these pharmaceutical firms, with the Supreme Court eventually deciding to recognize the additional cases in its ruling.

The constitutional issues at stake in this case surround the U.S. Constitutions recognition of foreign people, entities or governments as "persons" with the right and ability to bring suit in U.S. courts against U.S. registered corporations under U.S. antitrust laws.  The government of India had filed suit against these five pharmaceutical companies for damages under the Clayton Antitrust Act for their attempts to restrain and monopolize interstate and foreign trade surrounding the manufacture and distribution of certain broad spectrum antibiotics, in violation the Sherman Act.  Accusations included the use of price fixing, market division and fraud committed against the [[US Patent Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PFIZER INC. v. INDIA, 434 U.S. 308 (1978)|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=434&amp;invol=308|publisher=FindLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clayton Antitrust Act===
The [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] was enacted in 1914 to add additional substance to U.S. antitrust law by seeking to prevent certain anti-competitive practices during their inception, and continued a regime that started with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.  The Clayton Act specified particular prohibited conduct, outlined specific exemptions to the law, and provided for a tri-level enforcement regimen including measure intended to remediate prohibited conduct, expanding on the consumer protections that were provided under the earlier enacted Sherman Antitrust Act.

===Sherman Antitrust Act===
Enacted by Congress in 1890, the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] was the first federal law that prohibited business practices that were considered to be harmful to consumers, specifically those that were deemed to reduce marketplace competition.  The act continues to serve as the basis for most antitrust litigation in federal courts.

===Defense===
The pharmaceutical companies involved in the suit were seeking to invalidate the case by appealing to the [[United States Court of Appeals 8th Circuit]] under the defense that non-US companies were not persons as defined under the Clayton and Sherman acts, making them ineligible to seek treble damages in the U.S. court system.   The court Court of Appeals ruled against the defendants under statute. 550 F.2d, 397 that treble-damages for persons injured by antitrust violations was first provided in section 7 of the Sherman Act, and was re-enacted without substantial change in 1914 in section 4 of the Clayton Act.

Unsuccessful in invalidating their case through the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court asking the court to clarify the definition of 'persons' under the Clayton and Sherman acts, as section 8 of the Clayton act states:

::::''"[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."''

==Judgment==
The opinion of the Supreme Court was delivered by Justice [[Potter Stewart]]. The Court ruled for the government of India, affirming that a foreign nation otherwise entitled to sue in U.S. courts is entitled to sue for damages under the antitrust laws to the same extent as any other plaintiff. The fact that the respondents are sovereign foreign entities is not reason to deny them the remedy of treble damages the [[U.S. Congress]] has afforded to any person negatively affected by violations of U.S. or international antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PFIZER INC. v. INDIA, 434 U.S. 308 (1978)|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=434&amp;invol=308|publisher=FindLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Justices referred to the Sherman and Clayton antitrust laws in their ruling, as well as a prior ruling favoring the [[State of Georgia]]'s right to sue in ''[[Georgia v. Evans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia v. Evans|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/316/159/case.html|publisher=Justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Stewart further stated in his opinion:

{{Quote|The result we reach does not involve any novel concept of the jurisdiction of the federal courts. This Court has long recognized the rule that a foreign nation is generally entitled to prosecute any civil claim in the courts of the United States upon the same basis as a domestic corporation or individual might do.}}

The majority reasoned that a foreign nation is entitled to pursue damages when it its business or property has suffered damages caused by another entities antitrust violations. When a foreign nation conducts business in U.S. commercial markets, it can be victimized by anti-competitive practices in the same manner as a domestic U.S. State of private person.

The issue of person-hood for a sovereign government was supported by prior case law, with Justice Stewart referring to two specific cases to support the majority argument.  Both the ''[[United States v. Cooper Corp]]'' and ''[[Georgia v. Evans]]'' cases considered the rights of person-hood for government entities.  While the Cooper case rules that the United States Government was not to be considered a "person" under US antitrust laws, the court ruled in ''Georgia v. Evans'' that the state was allowed consideration as a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia v. Evans|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/316/159|publisher=Cornell University Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision did not rest on Georgia's status as a state but that unlike the federal government in the ''U.S. v. Cooper Corp'' ruling, the State of Georgia had been given no other remedy to enforce the prohibitions of the laws in question.  Like the State of Georgia, the Government of India also had no other remedy outside of the court system.

===Dissent===
Chief Justice Burger dissented the ruling, joined by Justices Powell and Rehnquist. In his dissent, Justice Burger stated that a foreign nations entitlement to bring damage actions in U.S. courts against domestic suppliers for alleged violations of antitrust laws was never considered when the Sherman and Clayton Acts were enacted, and that the Clayton and Sherman acts did not extend the right of person-hood to foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PFIZER, INC., et al., Petitioners, v. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA et al.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/434/308|publisher=Cornell University Law Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Justice Burger indicated in his dissent his dismay at the majorities recognition of a foreign government as a person under the Clayton and Sherman antitrust laws, while also noting that the majority option conceded that the question of application of the Sherman and Clayton Acts to foreign governments was never considered at the time the laws were enacted. He also referred to prior judgements under these acts, including the much more specific definition of person in the Clayton act.  Citing the case of ''[[Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/421/723/case.html|publisher=Justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice Burger highlighted the courts reliance on the specific definition of persons as outlined in the Clayton act, specifically the mention of foreign corporations and associations existing under or authorized laws of any foreign country as entities covered under the Act, but no mention the governments of foreign countries.

''

When a witness is presented for testimony in the U.S. judicial system, the order is "direct" testimony, then the opposing attorney does "cross" and then "redirect" from the attorney first offering the witness. "Recross" may be allowed, but usually the opposing attorney must ask for permission from the judge before proceeding with this additional round of questioning.

In [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]] the process is called '''re-examination'''.

In [[broadcast engineering]], the '''reference distance''' is the [[distance]] which, under normal circumstances and flat [[terrain]], a [[radio station]] would reach with a particular level of [[signal strength]].  This distance depends on two factors: [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) and [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT).  The actual distance a station's signal travels depends highly on [[weather]], where factors like [[temperature inversion]]s and heavy [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] have a strong and highly variable influence on [[radio propagation]].  However, for purposes of [[broadcast law]] such as [[construction permit]]s and [[broadcast license]]s, fixed calculations called [[propagation curve]]s are applied to determine the reference distances for all existing and proposed stations.  These also take into account [[beam tilt]], [[carrier frequency]], and even the [[Earth's curvature]] at longer distances.

This is in turn used to define most [[broadcast class]]es for [[FM broadcasting|FM station]]s in [[North America]].  Each class (except D) is defined as having a maximum ERP and HAAT.  If the HAAT of a station's [[radio antenna]] exceeds that specified for the class, it must reduce ERP so that its signal does not exceed the reference distance.  The signal strength used differs by class, but generally the value is 1.0mV/m (millivolt per meter) or 60dBu (decibels over one microvolt per meter) for most of the [[United States]], and 0.5mV/m or 54dBu in [[Canada]], and for some U.S. stations in parts of certain areas including [[California]], the [[Great Lakes region]], and the [[Northeast (US)|Northeast]].  This is considered the [[service contour]] of a station by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), and by [[COFETEL]] in [[Mexico]], according to [[NARBA]] and other international agreements among the three.  The reference distances are in turn used to create mandatory minimum spacing distances among [[co-channel]] stations, and certain [[adjacent channel]]s as well.

Real-world calculations can also be done by including data from digital [[topographical map]]s, typically along 12 or 16 [[radial (radio)|radial]]s, and including the specifications from the [[radiation pattern]] for a [[directional antenna]].  However, this does not fit the definition of a [[reference]] in this sense, even though it determines the actual [[broadcast range]] of a station.  This actual range is used in the [[reserved band]] in the U.S., while the reference distance is used for [[commercial radio]] stations.

In the [[United States]] under the [[Securities Act of 1933]], any offer to sell [[securities]] must either be registered with the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) or meet certain qualifications to exempt them from such registration. '''Regulation A''' (or '''Reg A''') contains rules providing exemptions from the registration requirements, allowing some companies to use [[equity crowdfunding]] to offer and sell their securities without having to register the securities with the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/regulation-a-amendments-secg.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation A offerings are intended to make access to capital possible for small and medium-sized companies that could not otherwise bear the costs of a normal SEC registration and to allow non-accredited investors to participate in the offering. The regulation is found under Title 17 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], chapter 2, part 230. The legal citation is 17 C.F.R. §230.251 ''et seq.''

On March 25, 2015, the SEC issued new final regulations amending Regulation A.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-49.html&lt;/ref&gt; Montana and Massachusetts state regulators sued the SEC requesting a stay that would pause the implementation of Reg A.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/17/us-sec-montana-regulations-idUSKBN0OX2RZ20150617&lt;/ref&gt; The rules came into force on July 19, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/business/smallbusiness/new-rules-let-companies-sell-stakes-to-investors-of-modest-means.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation A+==
On March 25, 2015, the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]  adopted final rules to implement Section 401 of the [[Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act]] by expanding Regulation A into two tiers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/small-crowds-get-their-day-in-investing-sun-1434655720&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tier 1, for securities offerings of up to $20 million in a 12-month period 
* Tier 2, for securities offerings of up to $50 million in a 12-month period 
An issuer of $20 million or less of securities can elect to proceed under either Tier 1 or Tier 2. The final rules for offerings under Tier 1 and Tier 2 build on current Regulation A and preserve, with some modifications, existing provisions regarding issuer eligibility, [[Offering circular]] contents, testing the waters, and "bad actor" disqualification. The new rules modernize the Regulation A filing process for all offerings, align practice in certain areas with prevailing practice for registered offerings, create additional flexibility for issuers in the offering process, and establish an ongoing reporting regime for certain Regulation A issuers. Under the final rules, Tier 2 issuers are required to include audited [[financial statements]] in their offering documents and to file annual, semiannual, and current reports with the SEC on an ongoing basis.

===Non-accredited Investors===

Regulation A allows the general public to invest in private companies. With the exception of securities that will be listed on a national securities exchange upon qualification, purchasers in Tier 2 offerings must either be [[accredited investors]], as that term is defined in [[Regulation D (SEC)]], or be subject to certain limitations on the size of their investment.

===Tier 1===
In addition to qualifying a Regulation A offering with the SEC, companies using a Tier 1 offering must register or qualify their offering in any state in which they seek to offer or sell securities pursuant to Regulation A.  Some states provide the option to have Tier 1 offerings that will be conducted in multiple states reviewed through a coordinated state review program by the [[North American Securities Administrators Association]].

===Tier 2===
Issuers in Tier 2 offerings are required to qualify offerings with the Commission before sales can be made pursuant to Regulation A, but they are not required to register or qualify their offerings with '''state securities regulators'''. This partially exempts Tier 2 companies from [[blue sky law]] securities rules in each state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/03/65007-the-reg-a-bombshell-50m-unaccredited-equity-crowdfunding-title-iv-takes-center-stage/&lt;/ref&gt; Tier 2 offerings by such issuers, do remain subject to some state law enforcement and antifraud rules. Issuers in Tier 2 offerings may still be subject to filing fees in the states in which they intend to offer securities.

===Notable Offerings===

[[Equity crowdfunding]] platforms [[StartEngine]] and [[SeedInvest]] have facilitated Regulation A+ campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/funded-tesla-wannabe-elio-motors-raises-big-from-the-crowd-or-did-it/&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful Regulation A+ campaign was completed by automotive startup Elio Motors, raising nearly $17 million from 6,600 investors. The campaign was designed, produced and marketed by CrowdfundX,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/moiravetter/2015/08/26/crowdfunding-elio-motors-crowdfundx-30-million-dollars/#7fcf65862da1&lt;/ref&gt; a financial marketing firm based in Los Angeles. Elio Motors closed out their Regulation A+ offering in February, 2016, and subsequently listed to the OTCQX,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/ELIO/quote&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first crowdfinanced IPO in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2016/03/01/elio-motors-first-equity-crowdfunded-company-soars-past-1b-valuation-days-after-listing-shares/#5de1ddf541cf&lt;/ref&gt; In July, 2017, Myomo, a medical device maker out of Boston, MA, became the first crowdfinanced IPO to list shares to the NYSE. CrowdfundX also marketed this historic Reg A+ IPO.

The first real estate lending marketplace to obtain SEC qualification utilizing an amended Tier 1 Regulation A offering was [https://www.groundfloor.us/ Groundfloor], achieving the feat on August 31, 2015.&lt;ref name=Lend&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.lendacademy.com/groundfloor-is-breaking-new-ground-with-the-worlds-first-regulation-a-deal/ |title = GROUNDFLOOR Is Breaking New Ground With The World's First Regulation A+ Deal |publisher = Lend Academy |author = Ryan Lichtenwald |date = 4 September 2015 |accessdate = 2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Groundfloor the first marketplace open to non-accredited investors.&lt;ref name=Hype&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hypepotamus.com/companies/groundfloor/ |title = GROUNDFLOOR High Rises with $5M Series A, First of New $100M Fintech Ventures Fund |publisher = Hypepotamus |author = Kiki Roeder |date = 11 December 2015 |accessdate = 2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Dec. 3rd, 2015, real estate crowdfunding company [[Fundrise]] used the newly expanded Regulation A rules to raise capital for the launch of the world's first online [[Real Estate Investment Trust]].

In June 2016, [[American Homeowner Preservation]] opened a Regulation A+ offering with what has been called "probably the lowest investment minimum"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2017/01/95099-real-estate-alternative-investment-non-accredited-investors/&lt;/ref&gt; of any Regulation A+ offering.  Their minimum investment is $100.

==Testing The Waters==
Regulation A allows companies to conduct a publicity campaign and to solicit indications of interest from the public to assess the level of interest in investing in the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/19/why-every-entrepreneur-should-consider-a-mini-ipo/&lt;/ref&gt; This is intended to help the company decide whether to proceed with a Reg A offering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inc.com/ryan-feit/a-free-call-option-for-startups-on-fundraising.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roman Assemblies''' were institutions in [[ancient Rome]]. They functioned as the machinery of the Roman legislative branch, and thus (theoretically at least) passed all legislation. Since the assemblies operated on the basis of [[direct democracy]], ordinary citizens, and not elected representatives, would cast all ballots. The assemblies were subject to strong checks on their power by the executive branch and by the [[Roman Senate]]. Laws were passed (and magistrates elected) by [[Curia]] (in the [[Curiate Assembly]]), Tribes (in the [[Tribal Assembly]]), and [[Centuria|Centuries]] (in the [[Centuriate Assembly]]).

When the city of Rome was founded (traditionally dated at 753 BC), a senate and an assembly, the [[Curiate Assembly]], were both created. The Curiate Assembly was the principal legislative assembly during the era of the [[Roman Kingdom]]. While its primary purpose was to elect new kings, it also possessed rudimentary legislative powers. Shortly after the founding of the [[Roman Republic]] (traditionally dated to 509 BC), the principal legislative authority shifted to two new assemblies, the Tribal Assembly ("Citizen's Assembly") and the Centuriate Assembly.  Eventually, most legislative powers were transferred to another assembly, the [[Plebeian Council]] ("Assembly of the Commoners"). Ultimately, it was the Plebeian Council that disrupted the balance between the senate, the legislative branch, and the executive branch{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. This led to the collapse of the republic, and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BC. Under the empire, the powers that had been held by the assemblies were transferred to the senate. While the assemblies eventually lost their last semblance of political power, citizens continued to gather into them for organizational purposes. Eventually, however, the assemblies were ultimately abandoned.

==Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom==
{{main|Constitution of the Roman Kingdom|Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom}}
The Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom were political institutions in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]]. While one assembly, the [[Curiate Assembly]], had some legislative powers,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"&gt;Abbott, 18&lt;/ref&gt; these powers involved nothing more than a right to symbolically ratify decrees issued by the [[Roman King]]. The functions of the other assembly, the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom|Calate Assembly]], were purely [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious]]. During the years of the kingdom, the [[spqr|People of Rome]] were organized on the basis of units called [[Curia]].&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"/&gt; All of the People of Rome were divided amongst a total of thirty Curiae.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"/&gt; These Curiae were the basic units of division in the two popular assemblies.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 33"&gt;Byrd, 33&lt;/ref&gt; The members in each Curia would vote, and the majority in each Curia would determine how that Curia voted before the assembly. Thus, a majority of the Curiae (sixteen out of the thirty total Curiae) were needed during any vote before either the Curiate Assembly or the Calculate Assembly. 
[[Image:Platner - Ancient Rome city growth.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Growth of the city region during the kingdom]]

The Curiate Assembly was a popular assembly during the period of the Roman Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 18"/&gt; and was organized on the basis of the thirty Curiae.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"&gt;Abbott, 19&lt;/ref&gt; The king presided over the assembly, and submitted decrees to it for ratification.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"/&gt; After a king died, the [[Interrex]] selected a candidate to replace the king.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 14"&gt;Abbott, 14&lt;/ref&gt; After the nominee received the approval of the [[Senate of the Roman Kingdom|Roman Senate]], the Interrex held the formal election before the Curiate Assembly. After the Curiate Assembly elected the new king, and the senate ratified that election, the Interrex then presided over the assembly as it voted on the law which granted the king his legal powers (the ''[[lex curiata de imperio]]'').&lt;ref name="Abbott, 14"/&gt; On the ''[[calends]]'' (the first day of the month), and the ''[[nones (calendar)|nones]]'' (around the fifth day of the month), this assembly met to hear announcements.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"/&gt; Appeals heard by this assembly often had to deal with questions concerning Roman family law.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 15"&gt;Abbott, 15&lt;/ref&gt; During two fixed days in the spring, the assembly was to always to me to meet to witness wills and adoptions.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"/&gt; The assembly also had jurisdiction over the admission of new families to a Curia, the transfer of families between two Curiae, and the transfer of individuals from [[plebeian]] (commoner) to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] (aristocratic) status (or vice versa).&lt;ref name="Abbott, 19"/&gt;

==Legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic==
{{main|Constitution of the Roman Republic|Legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic|Plebeian Council}}
The Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic were political institutions in the ancient [[Roman Republic]]. There were two types of Roman assembly. The first was the ''comitia'',&lt;ref name="Lintott, 42"&gt;Lintott, 42&lt;/ref&gt; which was an assembly of Roman citizens.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 251"&gt;Abbott, 251&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Roman citizens gathered to enact laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. The second type of assembly was the council (''concilium''), which was an assembly of a specific group of citizens.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 251"/&gt; For example, the "Plebeian Council" was an assembly where Plebeians gathered to elect Plebeian magistrates, pass laws that applied only to Plebeians, and try judicial cases concerning Plebeians.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 43"&gt;Lintott, 43&lt;/ref&gt; A convention (''conventio''), in contrast, was an unofficial forum for communication, where citizens gathered to debate bills, campaign for office, and decide judicial cases.&lt;ref name="Lintott, 42"/&gt; The voters first assembled into conventions to deliberate, and then they assembled into committees or councils to actually vote.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2"&gt;Taylor, 2&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the curiae (familial groupings), Roman citizens were also organized into centuries (for military purposes) and tribes (for civil purposes). Each gathered into an assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The [[Centuriate Assembly]] was the assembly of the Centuries, while the [[Tribal Assembly]] was the assembly of the Tribes. Only a block of voters (Century, Tribe or Curia), and not the individual electors, cast the formal vote (one vote per block) before the assembly.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 40"&gt;Taylor, 40&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of votes in any Century, Tribe, or Curia decided how that Century, Tribe, or Curia voted.

The Centuriate Assembly was divided into 193 (later 373) Centuries, with each Century belonging to one of three classes: the officer class, the infantry, and the unarmed adjuncts.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 85"&gt;Taylor, 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cicero, 226"&gt;Cicero, 226&lt;/ref&gt; During a vote, the Centuries voted, one at a time, by order of seniority. The president of the Centuriate Assembly was usually a [[Roman Consul]] (the chief magistrate of the republic).&lt;ref name="Polybius, 132"&gt;Polybius, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Only the Centuriate Assembly could elect Consuls, [[Praetors]] and [[Roman censor|Censors]], only it could [[Declaration of war|declare war]],&lt;ref name="Abbott, 257"&gt;Abbott, 257&lt;/ref&gt; and only it could ratify the results of a census.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 3, 4"&gt;Taylor, 3, 4&lt;/ref&gt; While it had the power to pass ordinary laws (''leges''), it rarely did so.
[[Image:Gaius Gracchus Tribune of the People.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Gaius Gracchus]], tribune of the people, presiding over the Plebeian Council]]

The organization of the Tribal Assembly was much simpler than was that of the Centuriate Assembly, in contrast, since its organization was based on only thirty-five Tribes. The Tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical divisions (similar to modern [[U.S. Congress|U.S. Congressional]] districts or Commonwealth Parliamentary constituencies).&lt;ref name="Lintott, 51"&gt;Lintott, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Tribal Assembly was usually a Consul,&lt;ref name="Polybius, 132"/&gt; and under his presidency, the assembly elected [[Quaestors]], [[aedile|Curule Aediles]], and [[tribune|Military Tribunes]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, 7"&gt;Taylor, 7&lt;/ref&gt; While it had the power to pass ordinary laws (''leges''), it rarely did so. The assembly known as the [[Plebeian Council]] was identical to the Tribal Assembly with one key exception: only [[plebeian]]s (the commoners) had the power to vote before it. Members of the aristocratic [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] class were excluded from this assembly. In contrast, both classes were entitled to a vote in the Tribal Assembly. Under the presidency of a [[tribune|Plebeian Tribune]] (the chief representative of the people), the Plebeian Council elected Plebeian Tribunes and [[aedile|Plebeian Aediles]] (the Plebeian Tribune's assistant), enacted laws called [[plebiscite]]s, and presided over judicial cases involving Plebeians. Originally, laws passed by the Plebeian Council only applied to Plebeians.&lt;ref name="Byrd, 31"&gt;Byrd, 31&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 287 BC, laws passed by the Plebeian Council had acquired the full force of law, and from that point on, most legislation came from the council.

==Legislative assemblies of the Roman Empire==
{{see also|Constitution of the Roman Empire|Legislative assemblies of the Roman Empire}}

The legislative assemblies of the Roman Empire were political institutions in the ancient [[Roman Empire]]. During the reign of the second [[Roman Emperor]], [[Tiberius]], the powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies were transferred to the [[Roman senate|senate]]. The neutering of the assemblies had become inevitable for reasons beyond the fact that they were composed of the rabble of Rome. The electors were, in general, ignorant as to the merits of the important questions that were laid before them,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 278"&gt;Abbott, 278&lt;/ref&gt; and often willing to sell their votes to the highest bidder. After the founding of the [[Roman Empire]], the People of Rome continued to organize by Centuries and by Tribes, but by this point, these divisions had lost most of their relevance.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"&gt;Abbott, 397&lt;/ref&gt;

While the machinery of the [[Centuriate Assembly]] continued to exist well into the life of the empire,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; the assembly lost all of its practical relevance. Under the empire, all gatherings of the Centuriate Assembly were in the form of an unsorted convention. Legislation was never submitted to the imperial Centuriate Assembly, and the one major legislative power that this assembly had held under the republic, the right to declare war, was now held exclusively by the emperor.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; All judicial powers that had been held by the republican Centuriate Assembly were transferred to independent jury courts, and under the emperor [[Tiberius]], all of its former electoral powers were transferred to the senate.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; After it had lost all of these powers, it had no remaining authority. Its only remaining function was, after the senate had 'elected' the magistrates, to hear the ''renuntiatio'',&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; The ''renuntiatio'' had no legal purpose, but instead was a ceremony in which the results of the election were read to the electors. This allowed the emperor to claim that the magistrates had been "elected" by a sovereign people.

After the founding of the empire, the tribal divisions of citizens and freedmen continued, but the only political purpose of the tribal divisions was such that they better enabled the senate to maintain a list of citizens.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; Tribal divisions also simplified the process by which grain was distributed.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; Eventually, most ''freedmen'' belonged to one of the four urban Tribes, while most ''freemen'' belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; Under the emperor Tiberius, the electoral powers of the [[Tribal Assembly]] were transferred to the senate. Each year, after the senate had elected the annual magistrates, the Tribal Assembly also heard the ''renuntiatio''.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; Any legislation that the emperor submitted to the assemblies for ratification were submitted to the Tribal Assembly.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; The assembly ratified imperial decrees, starting with the emperor [[Augustus]], and continuing until the emperor [[Domitian]]. The ratification of legislation by the assembly, however, had no legal importance as the emperor could make any decree into law, even without the acquiescence of the assemblies. Thus, under the empire, the chief executive again became the chief lawgiver, which was a power he had not held since the days of the early republic.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; The [[Plebeian Council]] also survived the fall of the republic,&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt; and it also lost its legislative, judicial and electoral powers to the senate. By virtue of his [[tribune|tribunician powers]], the emperor had absolute control over the council.&lt;ref name="Abbott, 397"/&gt;

[[File:Atomium 010-censored.png|thumb|A censored photo of the [[:en:Atomium|Atomium]] in Brussels (2006). Because there was no [[:en:Freedom of Panorama|Freedom of Panorama]] (FOP) in Belgium at the time, we had to black out the Atomium in the photo and weren't allowed to show the national monument of Belgium: the Atomium. "The image of the Atomium is protected since its construction. It's mandatory to gain approval from the vzw/asbl Atomium and the '''SABAM''', before copying or broadcasting the image of the Atomium. It is also necessary to mention "copyright vzw/asbl Atomium"."]]
'''SABAM''' is one of the Belgian associations of authors, composers and publishers. The bilingual acronym stands for  "'''S'''ociété d''''A'''uteurs '''B'''elge – '''B'''elgische '''A'''uteurs '''M'''aatschappij". Their headquarters is located at 75–77 rue d'Arlon in [[Brussels]].

SABAM was founded in 1922 at the instigation of the composer {{Interlanguage link multi|Emiel Hullebroeck|nl}} under the name NAVEA. In 1945 it changed to its current name.  The SABAM is a Civil Co-operative Society (CVBA) with Belgian authors, composers and publishers as members. They represent the interests of its members in the field of intellectual property rights and collect all the [[royalties]] due to its members in Belgium, and sister organizations in other countries (such as [[BUMA/STEMRA|Buma/Stemra]] in the Netherlands), and then distributes these royalties to the copyright holders.

Unlike Buma/Stemra, which is limited to music copyright, SABAM is active in all disciplines where copyrights are involved. The members of SABAM are not only composers, poets and musicians, but also writers, poets, artists, publishers, visual artists, architects, designers, choreographers, photographers, film and television directors, etc.

SABAM also monitors the Internet to check the illegal supply of art.
In 2004 SABAM filed a complaint against [[Internet service provider|ISP]] [[Tiscali]] because of the illegal distribution of music over the Internet.
A restaurant owner from Brussels was fined because he had a picture of the [[Atomium]] on his website.

In October 2007, the SABAM was investigated by a Brussels court on suspicion of falsifying financial statements, the abuse of the confidence of its members and the laundering of misappropriated funds. The investigation, which was started by a complaint by the [[Walloons|Walloon]] composer [[Philippe Delhaye]], is ongoing.

In August 2009 [[Google]] removed several music videos for Belgian artists from its video web site YouTube because of complaints made by SABAM.

== Criticism ==
SABAM has received a lot of criticism from festival organisations for claiming money they don't deserve, and having very unclear conditions, from artists for late payments (SABAM had a debt of 200 million EUR towards artists in 2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/cnt/aid912005/sabam-moet-artiesten-nog-200-miljoen-euro|title=Sabam moet artiesten nog 200 miljoen euro|author=ikerremans|work=Gazet van Antwerpen|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from many other people for demanding money in the strangest places, s.a. libraries for reading stories to toddlers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harbison |first=Niall |url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2012/03/13/belgian-rightsholders-group-wants-to-charge-libraries-for-reading-books-to-kids/ |title=Rightsholders Group to Charge Libraries for Reading Books to Kids |website=www.thenextweb.com |date=13 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kim Herbots |url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/1407794/2012/03/13/Sabam-wil-geld-voor-voorleesuurtje-in-bibliotheek.dhtml |title=Sabam wil geld voor voorleesuurtje in bibliotheek – Binnenland |work=[[De Morgen]] |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=dgs |url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF20120313_008 |title=Bibliotheken moeten auteursrechten betalen voor voorleesuu... |work=[[De Standaard]] |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=2012-12-10|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; or playing music in a taxi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gva.be/cnt/aid1086459/voortaan-ook-auteursrechten-voor-muziek-in-taxi|title=Voortaan ook auteursrechten voor muziek in taxi|author=ikerremans|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SABAM has been criticised publicly in newspapers and TV shows.

For example, in 2011, one of the episodes of the TV show [[Basta (TV show)|Basta]] was dedicated to SABAM. As one of the actions, the people from comedy group [[Neveneffecten]], makers of the show, organised a concert with imaginary artists, and sent the playlist to SABAM. SABAM charged as if all imaginary artists would be a member of their organisation. SABAM however refunded the money after the episode was shown on the national television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gva.be/cnt/aid1247681/sabam-terugbetaling-aan-basta-was-uitzondering|title=Sabam:|author=fvranckx|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ridiculing actions included organising a party on less than 1 m² (since the fees depended on the area of the party, and started only from 1 m²), or calling to SABAM to ask if they had to pay SABAM because their phone rang on a public place with a protected tune.

SABAM has also been ridiculed in other shows. In the 2014 conference of [[Michael Van Peel]], Van Peel referred to the videos posted by [[ISIL]], and concluded it was sad the videos didn't have background music. "Then we could have sent our terrorist organisation: SABAM."

In 2017, festival organizers went to the Commercial Court because SABAM increased the cost with approximately 30 %. The festival organizers (who also organize most of the concerts in Belgium) think that SABAM is abusing their [[monopoly]] by doing this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.demorgen.be/muziek/sabam-verhoogt-tarieven-festivals-naar-rechtbank-misbruik-van-monopolie-be3324c4/|title=Sabam verhoogt tarieven, festivals naar rechtbank: "Misbruik van monopolie"|last=AJ|work=[[De Morgen]]|access-date=2017-05-29|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smriti''' ({{lang-sa|स्मृति}}, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Smṛti}}''), literally "that which is remembered" are a body of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts usually attributed to an author, traditionally written down but constantly revised, in contrast to [[Śruti]]s (the Vedic literature) considered authorless, that were transmitted verbally across the generations and fixed.&lt;ref name=wendydof&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-7190-1867-6}}, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; ''Smriti'' is a derivative secondary work and is considered less authoritative than ''Sruti'' in Hinduism, except in the [[Mimamsa]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Smrti", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N–Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 656-657&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shelpollock41/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold G.

The Smrti literature is a corpus of diverse varied texts.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Smrti", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N–Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 656-657&lt;/ref&gt; This corpus includes, but is not limited to the six [[Vedanga|Vedāngas]] (the auxiliary sciences in the Vedas), the epics (the [[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]] and [[Ramayana|Rāmāyana]]), the [[Dharmasutras|Dharmasūtras]] and [[Dharmaśāstra]]s (or Smritiśāstras), the Arthasaśāstras, the [[Puranas|Purānas]], the Kāvya or poetical literature, extensive ''Bhasyas'' (reviews and commentaries on ''Shrutis'' and non-Shruti texts), and numerous ''Nibandhas'' (digests) covering politics, ethics (''Nitisastras''),&lt;ref name=monierwilliams/&gt; culture, arts and society.&lt;ref name=bilimoriasmrti&gt;Purushottama Bilimoria (2011), The idea of Hindu law, Journal of Oriental Society of Australia, Vol. 43, pages 103-130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy Perrett 1998 pages 16-18"&gt;Roy Perrett (1998), Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824820855}}, pages 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Smriti text exists in many versions, with many different readings.&lt;ref name=wendydof/&gt; Smritis were considered fluid and freely rewritten by anyone in ancient and medieval Hindu tradition.&lt;ref name=wendydof/&gt;&lt;ref name=shelpollock41&gt;Sheldon Pollock (2011), Boundaries, Dynamics and Construction of Traditions in South Asia (Editor: Federico Squarcini), Anthem, {{ISBN|978-0857284303}}, pages 41-58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Smrti'' is a Sanskrit word, from the root Smara (स्मर), which means "remembrance, reminiscence, thinking of or upon, calling to mind", or simply "memory".&lt;ref name=monierwilliams&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche smRti] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; The word is found in ancient Vedic literature, such as in section 7.13 of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. In later and modern scholarly usage, the term refers to tradition, memory, as well as a vast post-Vedic canon of "tradition that is remembered".&lt;ref name=monierwilliams/&gt;&lt;ref name=geraldlarson/&gt; David Brick states that the original meaning of smriti was simply tradition, and not texts.&lt;ref&gt;Brick, David. 2006. pp. 295-301&lt;/ref&gt;

''Smriti'' is also a symbolic synonym for number 18, from the 18 scholars who are credited in Indian tradition for writing dharma-related smriti texts (most have been lost).&lt;ref name=monierwilliams/&gt; In linguistic traditions, ''Smrti'' is the name of a type of verse meter. In Hindu mythology,&lt;ref&gt;Manmatha Nath Dutt, {{Google books|vgM-AQAAMAAJ|A Prose English Translation of Srimadbhagavatam|page=RA3-PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Smriti'' is the name of the daughter of ''Dharma''&lt;ref&gt;literally morality, ethics, law, duty, right living&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Medha''.&lt;ref&gt;literally, prudence&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarly literature, Smriti is also spelled as ''Smṛti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Gyatso |title=In the Mirror of Memory: Reflections on Mindfulness and Remembrance in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbIiaEx_8d8C |year=1992|publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-1077-6 |pages=67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
''Smrtis'' represent the remembered, written tradition in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=bilimoriasmrti/&gt; The Smrti literature is a vast corpus of derivative work. All ''Smriti'' texts are regarded to ultimately be rooted in or inspired by ''Shruti''.&lt;ref name=wendydof/&gt;

The ''Smrti'' corpus includes, but is not limited to:&lt;ref name="bilimoriasmrti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy Perrett 1998 pages 16-18"/&gt;
#The six [[Vedanga|Vedāngas]] (grammar, meter, phonetics, etymology, astronomy and rituals),&lt;ref name=bilimoriasmrti/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Witzel and [[Michael Witzel]] (2003), Vedic Hinduism, in The Study of Hinduism (Editor: A Sharma), {{ISBN|978-1570034497}}, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Winternitz, History of Indian Literature, Volume 1-3, Motilal Barnarsidass, Delhi, Reprinted in 2010, {{ISBN|978-8120802643}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[Itihasa]] (literally means "so indeed it was"), Epics (the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana),&lt;ref name=bilimoriasmrti/&gt;&lt;ref name=geraldlarson&gt;Gerald Larson (1993), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1399575 The Trimūrti of Smṛti in classical Indian thought], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 43, No. 3, pages 373-388&lt;/ref&gt;
#The texts on the four proper goals or aims of human life:&lt;ref name=tadeusz&gt;Tadeusz Skorupski (1988), Review: Manu Swajambhuwa, Manusmryti, Czyli Traktat o Zacności; Watsjajana Mallanga, Kamasutra, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland (New Series), Volume 120, Issue 1, pages 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;
##[[Dharma]]: These texts discuss ''dharma'' from various religious, social, duties, morals and personal ethics perspective. Each of six major schools of Hinduism has its own literature on dharma. Examples include Dharma-sutras (particularly by [[Gautama Dharmasutra|Gautama]], [[Apastamba Dharmasutra|Apastamba]], [[Baudhayana]] and [[Vāsiṣṭha]]) and Dharma-sastras (particularly [[Manusmṛti]], [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]], [[Nāradasmṛti]] and [[Viṣṇusmṛti]]). At the personal dharma level, this includes many chapters of [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasutras]].
##[[Artha]]: Artha-related texts discuss ''artha'' from individual, social and as a compendium of economic policies, politics and laws. For example, the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' of [[Chanakya]], the Kamandakiya Nitisara,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/kamandakiyanitis00kamarich#page/n15/mode/2up Kamandakiya Niti Sara] MN Dutt (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt; Brihaspati Sutra,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/brihaspatisutrao00brharich#page/n5/mode/2up Brihaspati Sutra - Politics and Government] Sanskrit Original with English translation by FW Thomas (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; and Sukra Niti.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Sacred_Books_of_the_Hindus/SBH%2013%20-%20Sukra%20Niti%20Sara%20English%20Translation%20-%20Benoy%20Kumar%20Sarkar%201914#page/n1/mode/2up Sukra Niti] Bk Sarkar (Translator); Chapter 1 verse 43 onwards - Rules of State and Duties of Rulers; Chapter 1 verse 424 onwards - Guidelines on infrastructure for economy; Chapter 1 verse 550 onwards - Guidelines on treasury management, law and military; Chapter 2 - Functions of state officials, etc&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Olivelle|Olivelle]] states that most Artha-related treatises from ancient India have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2011), Language, Texts, and Society: Explorations in Ancient Indian Culture and Religion, Anthem Press, {{ISBN|978-0857284310}}, page 174&lt;/ref&gt;
##[[Kama]]: These discuss arts, emotions, love, erotics, relationships and other sciences in the pursuit of pleasure. The [[Kamasutra]] of [[Vātsyāyana]] is most well known. Others texts include [[Ratirahasya]], Jayamangala, Smaradipika, Ratimanjari, Ratiratnapradipika, [[Ananga Ranga]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Soble (2005), Sex from Plato to Paglia, {{ISBN|978-0313334245}}, page 493&lt;/ref&gt;
##[[Moksha]]: These develop and debate the nature and process of liberation, freedom and spiritual release. Major treatises on the pursuit of moksa include the later [[Upanishad]]s (early Upanishads are considered ''Sruti'' literature), [[Vivekachudamani]], and the sastras on [[Yoga]].
#The Purānas (literally, "of old"),&lt;ref name=bilimoriasmrti/&gt;&lt;ref name=geraldlarson/&gt;

===The structure of Smriti texts===
The ''Smrti'' texts structurally branched, over time, from so-called the "limbs of the Vedas", or auxiliary sciences for perfecting grammar and pronunciation (part of Vedāngas).&lt;ref name=gavinflood&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, pages 53-56&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the attempt to perfect the art of rituals led to the science of ''Kalpa'', which branched into three Kalpa-sūtras: Srauta-sūtras, Grhya-sūtras, and Dharma-sūtras (estimated to have been composed between 600-200 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;John E. Mitchiner (2000), Traditions of the Seven Rsis, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813243}}, page xviii&lt;/ref&gt; The Srauta-sutras became texts describing the perfect performance of public ceremonies (solemn community [[yajna]]s), the Grhya-sutras described perfect performance of home ceremonies and domestic rites of passage, and Dharma-sutras described jurisprudence, rights and duties of individuals in four [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashrama]] stages of life, and social ethics.&lt;ref name=gavinflood/&gt; The Dharma-sūtras themselves became the foundations for a large canon of texts, and branched off as numerous Dharma-sastra texts.&lt;ref name=gavinflood/&gt;

Jan Gonda states that the initial stages of Smriti texts structurally developed in the form of a new prose genre named Sūtras, that is "aphorism, highly compact precise expression that captured the essence of a fact, principle, instruction or idea".&lt;ref name=jangonda/&gt; This brevity in expression, states Gonda, was likely necessitated by the fact that writing technology had not developed yet or was not in vogue, in order to store a growing mass of knowledge, and all sorts of knowledge was transferred from one generation to the next through the process of memorization, verbal recitation and listening in the 1st millennium BCE. Compressed content allowed more essential, densely structured knowledge to be memorized and verbally transferred to the next generation in ancient India.&lt;ref name=jangonda&gt;Jan Gonda (1977), The Ritual Sutras, in A History of Indian Literature: Veda and Upanishads, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447018234}}, pages 466-474&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Smrti in Hindu Law==
''Smrtis'' contribute to exposition of the Hindu [[Dharma]] but are considered less authoritative than ''[[Śruti]]s'' (the Vedic corpus that includes early Upanishads).&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Smrti", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N–Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, pages 656 and 461&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest Smriti on Hindu Law: Dharma-sūtras===
The root texts of ancient Hindu jurisprudence and law are the ''Dharma-sūtras''. These express that Shruti, Smriti and Acara are sources of jurisprudence and law.&lt;ref name=donalddavis27/&gt; The precedence of these sources is declared in the opening verses of each of the known, surviving Dharma-sūtras. For example,&lt;ref name=donalddavis27/&gt;
{{Quote|
The source of Dharma is the Veda, as well as the tradition [Smriti], and practice of those who know the Veda. – Gautama Dharma-sūtra 1.1-1.2

The Dharma is taught in each Veda, in accordance with which we will explain it. What is given in the tradition [Smriti] is the second, and the conventions of cultured people are the third. – Baudhayana Dharma-sūtra 1.1.1-1.1.4

The Dharma is set forth in the vedas and the Traditional Texts [Smriti]. When these do not address an issue, the practice of cultured people becomes authoritative. – Vāsiṣṭha Dharma-sūtra 1.4-1.5

===Later Smriti on Hindu Law: Dharma-smriti===
The ''Smritis'', such as Manusmriti, Naradasmriti, Yajnavalkya Smrti and Parashara Smriti, expanded this definition, as follows,

|Manusmriti 2.12}}

The Yajnavalkya Smriti includes four Vedas, six Vedangas, Purana, Nyaya, Mimamsa and other sastras, in addition to the ethical conduct of the wise, as sources of knowledge and through which sacred law can be known. It explains the scope of the Dharma as follows,

{{Quote|
Rites, proper conduct, Dama (self-restraint), [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence), charity, self-study, work, realisation of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Self, Soul) through [[Yoga]] – all these are [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yajnavalkyasmrit00yj#page/14/mode/2up Yajnavalkya Smriti], Srisa Chandra Vidyarnava (Translator), The Sacred Books of the East, Vol 21, page 15;&lt;br&gt;Srirama Ramanujachari, Yajñavalkya Smṛti, Dharma Teachings of Yajñavalkya, Srimantham Math, Madras&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: [https://archive.org/details/Trivandrum_Sanskrit_Series_TSS Yajnavalkya Smriti] page 27;&lt;br&gt;Transliteration: [http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/etcs/ind/aind/ved/yvw/dhs/ys/ys.htm Yajnavalkya-Smrti] Chapter 1, Thesaurus Indogermanischer Text und Sprachmaterialien, Germany; '''Quote''': "Ijya Acāra Dama [[Ahimsa]] Dāna [[Svādhyāya]] Karmanam, Ayam tu Paramo Dharma yad Yogena Atman Darshanam"&lt;/ref&gt;
|Yajnavalkya Smriti 1.8}}

Levinson states that the role of ''Shruti'' and ''Smriti'' in Hindu law is as a source of guidance, and its tradition cultivates the principle that "the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad".&lt;ref name=davidlevinson/&gt; The later Hindu texts include fourfold sources of ''Dharma'', states Levinson, which include ''Atmanastushti'' (satisfaction of one's conscience), ''Sadacara'' (local norms of virtuous individuals), ''Smriti'' and ''Sruti''.&lt;ref name=davidlevinson&gt;David Levinson (2002), Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, Volume 1, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761922582}}, page 829&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Soledad Brothers''' were three [[African-American]] inmates charged with the murder of a white prison guard, John Vincent Mills, at California's [[Correctional Training Facility|Soledad Prison]] on January 16, 1970.&lt;ref name="beavercountytimes-1970-01-17"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Prison Guard Is Beaten to Death|newspaper=[[Beaver County Times]]|date=January 17, 1970|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8bAiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M7MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3630,3871188&amp;dq|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]], Fleeta  Drumgo, and John Clutchette were said to have murdered Mills in retaliation for the shooting deaths of three black prisoners during a prison fight in the exercise yard three days prior by another guard, Opie G. Miller.

==Soledad Prison==
[[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] met W.L. Nolen through the [[Black Panther Party]] in Soledad State Prison in 1969. They were transferred together to the O Wing, along with Drumgo and Clutchette, which was considered the worst part of the adjustment center of which Max Row is a part. According to Jackson, in the O Wing "the strongest hold out no more than a couple of weeks. It destroys the logical processes of the mind, a man's thoughts become completely disorganized. The noise, madness streaming from every throat, frustrated sounds from the bars, metallic sounds from the walls, the steel trays, the iron beds bolted to the wall, the hollow sounds from a cast-iron sink or toilet. The smells, the human waste thrown at us, unwashed bodies, the rotten food. When a white con leaves here he's ruined for life. No black leaves Max Row walking. Either he leaves on the meat wagon or he leaves crawling licking at the pig's feet."&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=George|authorlink=George Jackson (Black Panther)|title=Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson|publisher = Longmans Canada Limited|year=1970|location=Toronto, Canada|isbn=978-0698103474}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jackson's letters from the prison he describes the attitude of the staff toward the convicts as both defensive and hostile, apparently out of pure malevolence. His account of life at the prison was used by the Soledad Brothers Defense Committee.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Prison yard riot==
On January 13, 1970, 14 black inmates and 2 white inmates from the [[prison#Security levels|maximum-security]] section of Soledad Prison were released into a recreation yard. It had been several months since they were last released into the yard.&lt;ref name="The Day-January 7, 1985"&gt;{{cite news|title=Last vestiges of radical movement will go on trial in Bingham case|first=Lary|last=Hatfield|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RDlSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RzYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4907%2C1089678|newspaper=The Day|publisher=The Day Publishing Company|location=New London, Connecticut|date=January 7, 1985|pages=1–4|accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aptheker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aptheker|first=Bettina|title=The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yA9vwr6g8cMC|isbn=0-8014-8597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black prisoners were ordered to the far end of the yard, while the white prisoners remained near the center of the yard.&lt;ref name="Aptheker"/&gt; Officer Opie G. Miller, an expert [[marksman]] armed with a rifle, watched over the inmates from a [[guard tower]] {{convert|13|ft|m|0}} above the yard.&lt;ref name="Aptheker"/&gt; A [[fist fight]] ensued and Miller opened fire on the prisoners below. No [[warning shot]] was fired. Three black inmates were killed in the shooting: W.L. Nolen and Cleveland Edwards died in the yard, while Alvin Miller died in the prison hospital a few hours later. A white inmate, Billy D. Harris, was wounded in the groin by Miller's fourth shot, and ended up losing a testicle.&lt;ref name="Aptheker"/&gt; In a letter from June 10, 1970, George Jackson described the scene as seeing three of his brothers having been "murdered [...] by a pig shooting from 30 feet above their heads with a military rifle." &lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

Following the incident, thirteen black prisoners began a hunger strike in the hopes of securing an investigation.&lt;ref name="bulletin-1970-01-15"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Negro Prisoners Begin Hunger Strike in Bid for Investigation|newspaper=[[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]|date=January 15, 1970|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zKQSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1453,3541718&amp;dq=miller+guard&amp;hl=en|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 1970, a [[Monterey County]] [[grand jury]] convened, then exonerated Miller in the deaths of Nolen, Edwards, and Miller with a ruling of "[[justifiable homicide]]". No black inmates were permitted to testify, including those who had been in the recreation yard during the shooting. In Soledad Prison, inmates heard the grand jury's ruling on the prison radio.&lt;ref name="Aptheker"/&gt; Thirty minutes later, John V. Mills was found dying in another maximum-security wing of the prison, having been beaten and thrown from a third-floor tier of Y Wing, George Jackson's cellblock, to the television room below. On February 14, 1970, after an investigation into Mills' death by prison officials, George Lester Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo and John Wesley Clutchette were indicted by the Monterey County grand jury for [[first-degree murder]].&lt;ref name="Aptheker"/&gt;

==Soledad Brothers Defense Committee==
The Soledad Brothers Defense Committee was formed by [[Fay Stender]] to assist in publicizing the case and raising funds to defend Jackson, Drumgo, and Clutchette. Among the several celebrities, writers, and left-wing political activists that supported the SBDC and their cause were [[Julian Bond]], [[Kay Boyle]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Tom Hayden]], [[William Kunstler]], [[Jessica Mitford]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Benjamin Spock]], and [[Angela Davis]].&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Andrews|first1=Lori|authorlink1=Lori Andrews|title=Black Power, White Blood: The Life and Times of Johnny Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKmKSuzduK8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1999|origyear=1996|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781566397506|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernstein|first1=Lee|title=America is the Prison: Arts and Politics in Prison in the 1970s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3yRlKxxDtkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 12, 2011|year=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=9780807871171|chapter=The Age of Jackson: George Jackson and the Radical Critique of Incarceration |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3yRlKxxDtkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Tuscaloosa News-October 18, 1970"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Rebellion Brewing Inside Nation's Prisons|first=Austin|last=Scott|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oCgeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NbkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7115%2C3538937|agency=AP|newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|date=October 18, 1970|accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1970, California State Senator [[Mervyn Dymally]] and the [[California Legislative Black Caucus]] pursued an investigation of Soledad Prison and released a report that tried to legitimize the Committee and give it some credibility.

==Jonathan Jackson's attempt to free the Soledad Brothers==
{{Main|Marin County courthouse incident}}
On August 7, 1970, George Jackson's seventeen-year-old brother [[Jonathan P. Jackson|Jonathan]] held up a courtroom during the trial of prisoner [[James McClain]], charged at the time with the attempted stabbing of a Soledad guard at the [[Marin County Civic Center]]. Jonathan Jackson, after having armed McClain, temporarily freed three San Quentin prisoners, and took Superior Court Judge [[Harold Haley]], Deputy District Attorney Gary Thomas, and three women on the jury hostage to secure the freedom of the "Soledad Brothers". Jackson, McClain, Haley, and a prisoner named William Christmas were killed as they attempted to drive away from the courthouse. Haley died due to the discharge of a [[sawed-off shotgun]] that had been fastened to his neck with adhesive tape by the abductors. Thomas, prisoner [[Ruchell Magee]], and one of the jurors were wounded.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909547-1,00.html|title=Justice: A Bad Week for the Good Guys|accessdate=June 4, 2008|date=August 1970|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after his brother's death, in George Jackson's last letter in his collection of letters written while in prison, he wrote a letter to his deceased brother, signing it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cold and calm though.&lt;br&gt;'All right, gentlemen, I'm taking over now.' {{#tag:ref|The final words Jonathan Jackson used in the San Rafael courthouse.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;br&gt;Revolution, George"&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Angela Davis]], who purchased the guns used in the escape attempt, was later tried on several charges in connection with the escape. A jury found her not guilty on murder, kidnapping and criminal conspiracy charges.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell. Earl. "Angela Davis Acquitted on All Charges", ''The New York Times'', June 5, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Quentin Six==
{{Main|San Quentin Six}}
On August 21, 1971, days before his trial in the guard's killing, the 29-year-old Jackson allegedly launched a riot  at San Quentin with a 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[pistol]]. There is controversy over the course of events that led to Jackson's obtaining of the firearm. Prison officials alleged that Stephen Bingham, the attorney who replaced Fay Stender{{#tag:ref|Eight years after George Jackson's death, Fay Stender was shot in 1979, allegedly by a member of the Black Guerilla Family for not supporting Jackson's militarist politics. She suffered severe injuries that led to her paralysis. Stender committed suicide in May, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;James, Joy. ''Imprisoned Intellectuals: America's Political Prisoners Write on Life, Liberation, and Rebellion''. New York, New York: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc. pp. 86-87; {{ISBN|978-0742520271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} as Jackson's attorney, visited Jackson. Bingham was alleged to have smuggled Jackson a pistol and an Afro wig. He was purported to have given a wig to Jackson within in which to hide the gun.  However, Bingham was found not guilty of this charge in an ensuing trial in 1986.  Prison officials had claimed that as Jackson was attempting to leave his meeting with Bingham, a gun protruded from a wig he was wearing and Jackson was asked to show the object. With a gun in hand, Jackson released an entire floor of prisoners from the maximum-security wing, allegedly saying, "This is it, gentlemen, the Dragon has come!" In the ensuing melee, three guards were killed, as were two prisoners suspected of being snitches, before George Jackson rushed out into the yard where he was shot and killed by a guard. Other people involved in the case believe Jackson's death was a setup by prison authorities, who conspired to supply Jackson with a gun, in the hopes that he would be killed in the ensuing melee, allegedly because they saw his power as a threat to their control and authority. Inconsistencies in the stories, although common among eyewitnesses in many crimes, fueled the controversy and helped to set off an uprising at [[Attica Correctional Facility]] in New York three weeks later. Bingham's acquittal in 1986 on charges that he smuggled Jackson a gun and a wig, and was thereby responsible for the escape attempt and murders, occurred after he emerged from hiding for 13 years in order to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=People In The News: Ex-fugitive finally feels free, retains his political activism |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=auhVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6900%2C6635723 |newspaper=The Register-Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |date=June 28, 1987 |page=2A |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were complaints on behalf of the defendants that they were not informed of the scheduled court hearing, specifically in a letter from George Jackson on June 13, 1970. They also claimed the court report stated that 1-48 pages of the testimony were recorded and they were only given 1-46 pages of testimony.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; After Jackson's death, on March 27, 1972, the two surviving Soledad Brothers—Clutchette and Drumgo—were acquitted by a San Francisco jury of the original charges of murdering a prison guard on the grounds that the state had failed to completely prove its case.&lt;ref&gt;"Acquit Soledad Brothers", ''Pacific Stars and Stripes'', March 29, 1972, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Bulgaria}}
The '''Supreme Administrative Court''' of [[Bulgaria]] was first established on 25 November 1878 as one of the three divisions of the then-single [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]. It did not exist during the [[History of the People's Republic of Bulgaria|Communist  rule]], but was restored in 1991.

The purpose of the Court is outlined in the [[Constitution of Bulgaria|Constitution]]:
'' "Article 125 (1) The Supreme Administrative Court shall exercise supreme judicial oversight as to the precise and equal application of the law in administrative justice.
(2) The Supreme Administrative Court shall rule on all challenges to the legality of acts of the [[Council of Ministers of Bulgaria|Council of Ministers]] and the individual ministers, and of other acts established by law. ''

The Supreme Administrative Court became a separate institution with the promulgation of the Administrative Justice Law from 3 April 1912. The Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bulgaria of 1947 did not provide for judicial supervision over administrative acts, and as a result the Supreme Administrative Court was closed in 1948 by virtue of the Law on the Structure of People’s Courts. Bulgaria's seventh Grand National Assembly reestablished the Court in 1991.

The current Chairman of the Supreme Administrative Court is Georgi Kolev. He was appointed to this position in 2010. The Deputies are Veneta Markovska and Galina Solakova. The Court consists of two colleges and six divisions, each with a particular phere of responsibilities.

The Supreme Administrative Court publishes a periodical, the Administrative Justice Journal. It is used to describe the problems of Administrative Law and to present practices from the relevant European judicial institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19107">'''Texas Tax Code Chapter 313''' (aka the ''Texas Economic Development Act'') creates a state program for certain large businesses to limit the appraised value on their property for the purposes of local Texas public school district property taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TX/htm/TX.313.htm|title=Tax Code Chapter 313 Texas Economic Development Act|last=|first=|date=|website=statutes.capitol.texas.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appraised value limitation is an agreement between a taxpayer and a Texas school district in which the taxpayer proposes to build or install property--and create jobs meeting certain job and wage requirements--in exchange for a ten-year limitation on the taxpayer's property value for school district maintenance and operations tax (M&amp;O) purposes. For ten years, school M&amp;O property taxes are not levied on the value in excess of the limitation amount. Limitation amounts are established by statute and vary by school district from $10 million to $100 million.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2016/april/chap313.php|title=Chapter 313: Attracting Jobs and Investment|last=Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts|first=|date=April 2016|website=comptroller.texas.gov|series=Fiscal Notes|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304003917/https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2016/april/chap313.php|archive-date=March 4, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike abatements based on a percentage of the property value, the structure of the program benefits primarily extremely large projects.  The majority of projects are in the petrochemical or energy sectors, although some are typical manufacturing.

Created by the Texas legislature in 2001, and initially set to expire in 2007, the program has been renewed several times.  In 2013, the Texas Legislature reset the expiration date of the program to December 31, 2022.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Texas Legislature, 83rd Regular Session, [https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=83R&amp;Bill=HB3390 House Bill 3390] &lt;/ref&gt;

Companies seeking a limitation submit an abatement application to the school district in which the project may be located.  The school district forwards the application to the Texas Comptroller for evaluation. The school district may not grant final approval of the abatement without Comptroller analysis and approval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For the 10 years of the tax benefit period, reduced local school district revenues are substantially replaced with state funds through the state public school finance system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/docs/96-1359-2016.pdf|title=A Report of the Texas Economic Development Act, 2017|last=Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts|first=|date=January 2017|website=|page=a|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304104052/https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/docs/96-1359-2016.pdf|archive-date=September 6, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texas Tax Code gives to the Texas Comptroller's office responsibility and authority to adopt rules necessary for the implementation and administration or the program.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Tax Code [https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/TX/htm/TX.313.htm#313.031 §313.031(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Comptroller's office delegates to school districts the responsibility to enforce provisions of the limitation agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Administrative Code, Title 34, Part 1, Chapter 9, Subchapter F,  [http://texreg.sos.state.tx.us/public/readtac$ext.TacPage?sl=R&amp;app=9&amp;p_dir=&amp;p_rloc=&amp;p_tloc=&amp;p_ploc=&amp;pg=1&amp;p_tac=&amp;ti=34&amp;pt=1&amp;ch=9&amp;rl=1054 Rule §9.1054(i)(3)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, in House Bill 3390, the Texas legislature charged the Comptroller's office with reviewing the number of qualifying jobs created in future projects receiving tax limitations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Texas Comptroller's website posts documents related to the projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/local/ch313/agreement-docs.php?_ga=1.213457943.2073348964.1474830232|title=Chapter 313 School Value Limitation Documents|last=Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Costs ==
A 2017 report to the Texas Legislature by the Texas Comptroller reported 311 active limitation agreements, representing an estimated $146 billion of total investment through 2033.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; That report indicated that between 2002 and 2015, local school property tax revenue reductions due to limitation agreements were approximately $7.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/docs/96-1359-2016.pdf|title=A Report of the Texas Economic Development Act, 2017|last=Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts|first=|date=January 2017|website=|page=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304104052/https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/docs/96-1359-2016.pdf|archive-date=September 6, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "''Tax Exemptions and Tax Incidence Report''" prepared by the Texas Comptroller in February, 2017, estimated that limitation agreements would reduce school districts revenues in that year by about  $513 million, also indicating that total school district revenue could be reduced by over $1 billion annually by the year 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/business/texanomics/article/Texas-biggest-economic-development-incentive-10916880.php|title=Texas' Biggest Tax Incentive Set to Double by 2022|last=DePillis|first=Lydia|date=February 8, 2017|website=|publisher=Houston Chronicle|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215223431/https://www.chron.com/business/texanomics/article/Texas-biggest-economic-development-incentive-10916880.php|archive-date=February 15, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comptroller.texas.gov/transparency/reports/tax-exemptions-and-incidence/2017/96-463.pdf|title=Tax Exemptions and Tax Incidence Reports|last=Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts|first=|date=February 2017|website=|page=36|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-largest-corporate-welfare-program-rapidly-ballooning/|title=Texas' Largest Corporate Welfare Program is Rapidly Ballooning|last=Sadasivam|first=Naveena|date=February 13, 2017|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213193459/https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-largest-corporate-welfare-program-rapidly-ballooning/|archive-date=February 13, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Supporters ==
Supporters of the program argue that Texas' high local property tax rates put the state at a disadvantage when competing for businesses making new investments.  Business groups say the program attracts projects that would have not come to Texas otherwise, and that without the program Texas cannot compete with other states for new business investment.  Proponents of the program claim that local school district property revenue reductions created by the abatement do not create a real cost to the state, arguing that without the program, none of the businesses receiving the abatement would have located in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ttara.org/files/document/file-4e36c23951e81.pdf|title=Questions and Answers about the Texas Economic Development Act|last=Texas Taxpayers and Research Association|first=|date=December 2010|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719190541/http://www.ttara.org/files/document/file-4e36c23951e81.pdf|archive-date=July 18, 2014|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sachamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Texas2050-Sept-22-2016.pdf|title=Texas 2050 - A Framework for Long-Term Economic Growth|last=Texas 2050|first=|date=September 22, 2016|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531201431/https://www.sachamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Texas2050-Sept-22-2016.pdf|archive-date=May 31, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ttara.org/files/document/file-58862ea4ee69b.pdf|title=TTARA releases report on Chapter 313: State's 'single most important economic development tool'|last=Texas Taxpayers and Research Association|first=|date=January 23, 2017|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531141228/http://www.ttara.org/files/document/file-58862ea4ee69b.pdf|archive-date=May 31, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ttara.org/files/document/file-587e921ed3196.pdf|title=Understanding Chapter 313: School Property Tax Limitations and the Impact on State Finances|last=Texas Taxpayers and Research Association|first=|date=January 2017|website=|page=7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305225454/http://www.ttara.org/files/document/file-587e921ed3196.pdf|archive-date=March 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Bennett-Craymer-Chapter-313-helps-keep-Texas-11056084.php|title=Chapter 313 helps keep Texas' status as an economic powerhouse|last=Craymer|first=Dale|last2=Bennett|first2=Tony|date=April 6, 2017|website=|publisher=Houston Chronicle - Guest Editorial|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415003354/https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Bennett-Craymer-Chapter-313-helps-keep-Texas-11056084.php|archive-date=April 15, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program Critics ==
Critics of the program argue that many of the projects receiving the abatement would have located in Texas for other reasons.  Wind farms, they say, find Texas an ideal location due to its rich wind resources, separate electrical grid, and large rate-payer-funded transmission networks. They say that the program's petrochemical projects locate in Texas largely because of little regulation, proximity to rich oil and gas shale plays, and access to deep-water ports and pipeline networks.  Critics also point to the relatively small number of jobs created compared to the large amount of revenues forgone for each job.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texaspolicy.com/content/detail/local-tax-incentives-chapter-313-texas-economic-development-act|title=Local Tax Incentives: Chapter 313 - Texas Economic Development A|last=Peacock|first=Bill|date=August 21, 2017|website=|publisher=Texas Public Policy Foundation|archive-url=https://www.scribd.com/document/356841557/CWG-Chapter-313-Texas-Economic-Development-Act#from_embed|archive-date=May 31, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasobserver.org/chapter-313-texas-tax-incentive/|title=Free Lunch|last=Michel|first=Patrick|date=March 14, 2016|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125102433/https://www.texasobserver.org/chapter-313-texas-tax-incentive/|archive-date=January 25, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mystatesman.com/news/big-dollars-little-oversight/KqNmdAArCJEG5Vm5qTGSbN/|title=Big dollars, little oversight?

}}[[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Peace Palace which houses the Hague Academy of International Law, pictured in March 2006]]

'''The Hague Academy of International Law''' ({{lang-fr|Académie de droit international de La Haye}}) is a center for high-level [[education]] in both [[public international law|public]] and [[conflict of laws|private international law]] housed in the [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Courses are taught in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] and, except for External Programme Courses, are held in the Peace Palace. 

The Academy is famous for its Summer Courses Programme. [[List of Hague Academy of International Law people|The Academy's alumni]] and current/former faculty include heads of state, foreign ministers, ambassadors, 13 judges of the [[International Court of Justice]], one former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] and two [[Nobel Prize]] recipients.

==History==
[[File:TMCasser.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Tobias Asser]] (1838–1913)]]
Since its creation in 1923, The Hague Academy of International Law has occupied premises at the [[Peace Palace]]. Next to the Peace Palace building the Academy’s facilities include the Academy Hall built for international conferences, the Peace Palace Library as well as further administrative accommodations. The new buildings were planned and realized by architects [[Michael Wilford]] and Manuel Schupp.
Alongside The Hague Academy of International Law the Peace Palace houses highest judicial institutions such as the [[International Court of Justice]] and the Bureau of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]. In the context of the movement for the establishment of peace through law, the idea of creating an Academy of International Law was mooted at the [[Hague Conference]] in 1907 (having previously been voiced by the [[Institut de Droit International]] as early as 1873). The Dutch Government took up the idea, and the [[International Law Association]] in turn examined the question. The Dutch Lawyer [[Tobias Asser|Tobias M. C. Asser]] proposed a plan that envisaged more or less what the Academy was to become, with courses held from July to October. Asser received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1911 and contributed a part of the prize money to the Academy; and the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Endowment for Peace]] provided a valuable contribution to get it started. The inauguration of the Academy was planned for October 1914. But [[World War I]] broke out, and preparations could not be resumed until 1921. When the Summer Courses started on 14 July 1923, at the Peace Palace in The Hague, 353 students originating from 31 countries attended, of whom 35 were women.

Today, the Academy is a centre for research and teaching in public and private international law, with the aim of further scientific and advanced studies of the legal aspects of international relations. The [[UN General Assembly]] regularly refers to the “valuable contribution” that the Academy “continues to make to the United Nations Program of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/40/a40r066.htm see Resolution A/RES/40/66.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was awarded the [[Wateler Peace Prize]] (1936, 1950), the [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize]] (1992), the Order of Rio Branco,&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Ordem de Rio Branco|See Wikipedia page in Portuguese.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil (1999), and the Medal of the [[Royal Institute of European Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Real Instituto de Estudios Europeos|See Wikipedia page in spanish.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spain (2000). The Academy has been nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] 34 times between 1915 and 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/database.html See nobelprize.org.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is part of the [[Hague Academic Coalition]].

===Summer Courses===
The Summer Courses of the Academy are held in July (Public International Law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?summer-programme/public-international-law Programme of the Public International Law session.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231031443/http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?summer-programme%2Fpublic-international-law |date=2010-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and August (Private International Law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?summer-programme/private-international-law Programme of the Private International Law session.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029171717/http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?summer-programme%2Fprivate-international-law |date=2010-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;); each session lasts three weeks. The Academy is not a University: it does not have a permanent teaching staff, but its scientific body, the Curatorium, freely calls upon academics, practitioners, diplomats, and other personalities from all over the world whom it considers qualified to give courses, in English or French (with simultaneous interpretation). These courses are given in the form of a series of lectures, on general or special subjects. In principle, the courses are then published in the Collected Courses of the Academy of International Law, which now run to more than 360 volumes and are certainly among the most important encyclopædic publications on private and public international law.

The Summer programme is directed to advanced students and practitioners seeking a deeper understanding of international law, public or private.
The summer courses are open to candidates who have completed at least four years of studying at university, including subjects of international law, and who can prove to the Curatorium that they possess a sufficient knowledge of the subject; to candidates holding a 3-year law degree at the opening of the session of the Academy. All candidates must master one of the two working languages (French or English). A merit-based scholarship program allows approximately 20% of the students to receive assistance from public and private funding sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?institutions-and-personalities List of donors, institutions and personalities.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?regulations Scholarships regulations.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year, attendees representing between 80 and 100 nationalities participate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?summer-programme/represented-nationalities Represented nationalities.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centre for Studies and Research in International Law and International Relations===

There are between 20 and 24 participants, half in the English-speaking section and half in the French-speaking section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?centre-for-studies-and-research-in-international-law-and-international-relations/regulations-centre Centre regulations.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===External Program===
At the end of the 1960s, the Academy established the Prestigious "External Program", which is normally held each year, in turn in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, upon the invitation of host governments or international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?external-programme/locations Locations where the sessions of the External Programme were successively held.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The External Program is designed for around 20 participants from the countries in the region, whose travelling expenses are usually financed by the Academy and whose accommodation is financed by the government of the host State or organization. In addition, a number of participants come from the host state itself. [[GNLU]] in collaboration with the Hague Academy of International Law concluded the 2013 edition. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?external-programme/regulations-external External Programme regulations.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academy diploma==
The Hague Academy of International Law awards a high-level diploma for students who already have a thorough knowledge of international law and who pass an examination in either public international law or private international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?diploma-regulations Diploma regulations.]&lt;/ref&gt; Few Diplomas are awarded each year, the examination being highly selective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?awarded-diplomas Awarded Diplomas since 1950.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral scholarships==
The Academy awards each year 4 doctoral scholarships. The beneficiaries stay for two months (July and August) in The Hague to pursue their doctoral researches. They can access the Peace Palace Library and attend the Summer Courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hagueacademy.nl/?doctoral-scholarships Conditions of admission to a doctoral scholarship on the Academy's website.]&lt;/ref&gt; The candidates should come from a developing country and live there,  their doctoral thesis should be in the process of completion.
